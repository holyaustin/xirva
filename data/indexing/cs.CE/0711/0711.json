The phenomenon on the basis of `biovielectroluminescence', satisfies\nman/microbio/megabio/computer vision (MMMCV), as a robust candidate for\nphysical and visual sciences. The general aim of this addendum is to present a\nrefined text of Sections 1-3 of that proposal and highlighting the contents of\nits Appendix in form of a `Mechanisms' Section. We then briefly remind in an\narticle aimed for December 2007, by appending two more equations into Section\n3, a theoretical II-time scenario as a time model well-proposed for the\nphenomenon. The time model within the core of the proposal, plays a significant\nrole in emphasizing the principle points on Objectives no. 1-8, Sub-hypothesis\n3.1.2, mentioned in Article [arXiv:0710.0410]. It also expresses the time\nconcept in terms of causing quantized energy f(|E|) of time |t|, emit in regard\nto shortening the probability of particle loci as predictable patterns of\nparticle's un-occurred motion, a solution to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle\n(HUP) into a simplistic manner. We conclude that, practical frames via a time\nalgorithm to this model, fixates such predictable patterns of motion of scenery\nbodies onto recordable observation points of a MMMCV system. It even\nsuppresses/predicts superposition phenomena coming from a human subject and/or\nother bio-subjects for any decision making event, e.g., brainwave quantum\npatterns based on vision. Maintaining the existential probability of Riemann\nsurfaces of II-time scenarios in the context of biovielectroluminescence, makes\nmotion-prediction a possibility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2007 19:41:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Alipour", "Philip B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2116", "submitter": "Frederic Vignat", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Vignat (LGS), Fran\\c{c}ois Villeneuve (LGS)", "title": "A numerical approach for 3D manufacturing tolerances synthesis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Dans Proceedings of the 10th CIRP International Seminar on\n  Computer Aided Tolerancing - 10th CIRP International Seminar on Computer\n  Aided Tolerancing, Erlangen : Allemagne (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": null, "abstract": "  Making a product conform to the functional requirements indicated by the\ncustomer suppose to be able to manage the manufacturing process chosen to\nrealise the parts.

This is usually\ndone by the verification of the conformity of the workpiece to manufacturing\ntolerances at the end of each set-up. It is thus necessary to determine these\nmanufacturing tolerances. This step is called \"manufacturing tolerance\nsynthesis\". In this paper, a numerical method is proposed to perform 3D\nmanufacturing tolerances synthesis.

The main framework of the\nalgorithm is an estimation of distribution algorithm, in which an ant-miner\nmethodology improves the individual solutions produced in each generation.\nUnlike our previous work (where learning is implicit), the learning in the\nmemetic estimation of distribution algorithm is explicit, i.e. we are able to\nidentify building blocks directly. The overall approach learns by building a\nprobabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of\nindividual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local\nsearch processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive\nhigher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the\ntest problem. Computational results show that the proposed approach outperforms\nmost existing approaches. It is suggested that the learning methodologies\nsuggested in this paper may be applied to other scheduling problems where\nschedules are built systematically according to specific rules\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 15:16:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 17:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Burke", "Edmund", ""], ["Li", "Jingpeng", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3628", "submitter": "Francesc Rossell\\'o", "authors": "Gabriel Cardona, Francesc Rossello, Gabriel Valiente", "title": "A Perl Package and an Alignment Tool for Phylogenetic Networks", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.CE", "license": null, "abstract": "  Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of phylogenetic trees that allow\nfor the representation of evolutionary events acting at the population level,\nlike recombination between genes, hybridization between lineages, and lateral\ngene transfer.
