Indeed, dynamical\nproperties of CRNs can be described by a set of non-linear differential\nequations that rarely can be solved in closed-form, but that can instead be\nused to reason on the system dynamics. In this context, one of the possible\napproaches is to perform numerical simulations, which may require a high\ncomputational effort. In particular, in order to investigate some dynamical\nproperties, such as robustness or global sensitivity, many simulations have to\nbe performed by varying the initial concentration of chemical species. Results:\nIn order to reduce the computational effort required when many simulations are\nneeded to assess a property, we exploit a new notion of monotonicity of the\noutput of the system (the concentration of a target chemical species at the\nsteady-state) with respect to the input (the initial concentration of another\nchemical species). To assess such monotonicity behavior, we propose a new\ngraphical approach that allows us to state sufficient conditions for ensuring\nthat the monotonicity property holds. Our sufficient conditions allow us to\nefficiently verify the monotonicity property by exploring a graph constructed\non the basis of the reactions involved in the network. Once established, our\nmonotonicity property allows us to drastically reduce the number of simulations\nrequired to assess some dynamical properties of the CRN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2021 08:18:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nasti", "Lucia", ""], ["Gori", "Roberta", ""], ["Milazzo", "Paolo", ""], ["Poloni", "Federico", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.00615", "submitter": "Joseph Paul", "authors": "Joseph Suresh Paul, Sreekanth Madhusoodhanan", "title": "A linear phase evolution model for reduction of temporal unwrapping and\n  field estimation errors in multi-echo GRE", "comments": "29pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph cs.CE eess.SP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This article aims at developing a model based optimization for reduction of\ntemporal unwrapping and field estimation errors in multi-echo acquisition of\nGradient Echo sequence.

We trace the different\nsources of non-convexification in the context of topology optimization problems\nstarting from domain discretization, passing through penalization for\ndiscreteness and effects of filtering methods, and end with a note on\ncontinuation methods. Design/Methodology/Approach: Starting from the global\noptimum of the compliance minimization problem, we employ analytical tools to\ninvestigate how intermediate density penalization affects the convexity of the\nproblem, the potential penalization-like effects of various filtering\ntechniques, how continuation methods can be used to approach the global\noptimum, and how the initial guess has some weight in determining the final\noptimum. Findings: The non-convexification effects of the penalization of\nintermediate density elements simply overshadows any other type of\nnon-convexification introduced into the problem, mainly due to its severity and\nlocality. Continuation methods are strongly recommended to overcome the problem\nof local minima, albeit its step and convergence criteria are left to the user\ndepending on the type of application.

In this paper, we present a\nframework for optimizing the build orientation with respect to removability of\nsupport structures. In particular, given a general multi-axis machining setup\nand sampled build orientations, we define a Pareto-optimality criterion based\non the total support volume and the \"secluded\" support volume defined as the\nsupport volume that is not accessible by a given set of machining tools. Since\ntotal support volume mainly depends on the build orientation and the secluded\nvolume is dictated by the machining setup, in many cases the two objectives are\ncompeting and their trade-off needs to be taken into account. The accessibility\nanalysis relies on the inaccessibility measure field (IMF), which is a\ncontinuous field in the Euclidean space that quantifies the inaccessibility of\neach point given a collection of tools and fixturing devices. The value of IMF\nat each point indicates the minimum possible volumetric collision between\nobjects in relative motion including the part, fixtures, and the tools, over\nall possible tool orientations and sharp points on the tool. We also propose an\nautomated support removal planning algorithm based on IMF, where a sequence of\nactions are provided in terms of the fixturing devices, cutting tools, and tool\norientation at each step. In our approach, each step is chosen based on the\nmaximal removable volume to iteratively remove accessible supports. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through benchmark\nexamples in 2D and realistic examples in 3D.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 03:24:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mirzendehdel", "Amir M.", ""], ["Behandish", "Morad", ""], ["Nelaturi", "Saigopal", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.07763", "submitter": "Juan Cante", "authors": "Daniel Yago, Juan Cante, Oriol Lloberas-Valls, Javier Oliver", "title": "Topology optimization using the unsmooth variational topology\n  optimization (UNVARTOP) method.

Hence, this\npaper presents a novel secure UAV-assisted mobile relaying system operating at\nTHz bands for data acquisition from multiple ground user equipments towards a\ndestination. We assume that the UAV-mounted relay may act, besides providing\nrelaying services, as a potential adversary called the untrusted UAV relay. To\nsafeguard end-to-end communications, we present a secure two-phase transmission\nstrategy with cooperative jamming. Then, we formulate an optimization problem\nin terms of a new measure $-$ secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), defined as the\nratio of achievable average secrecy rate to average system power consumption,\nwhich enables us to obtain the best possible security level while taking UAV's\ninherent flight power limitation into account. This optimization problem leads\nto a joint design of key system parameters, including UAV's trajectory and\nvelocity, communication scheduling, and power allocations. Since the formulated\nproblem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization and computationally\nintractable, we propose alternative algorithms to solve it efficiently via\ngreedy/sequential block coordinated descent, successive convex approximation,\nand non-linear fractional programming techniques. Numerical results demonstrate\nsignificant SEE performance improvement of our designs when compared to other\nknown benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2021 06:25:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mamaghani", "Milad Tatar", ""], ["Hong", "Yi", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.10602", "submitter": "Yanwen Fang", "authors": "Yanwen Fang, Philip L.
