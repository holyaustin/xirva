A\ncontinuum multiaxial failure criterion for concrete is calibrated on the basis\nof fine-scale simulations, and it serves as the adaptive criterion in the\nmultiscale framework. Thus, in this approach, simulations start without\nassigning any material Representative Volume Element (RVE) to the macro-scale\nfinite elements.

A test on a typical conductor model\nverifies the accuracy of the approximate analytical solution. Based on the\nanalytical solution and numerical weather prediction (NWP) data, an efficient\nsimulation method for temperature evolution of transmission systems under\nmultiple operation states is proposed. As demonstrated on an NPCC 140-bus\nsystem, it achieves over 1000 times of efficiency enhancement, verifying its\npotentials in online risk assessment and decision support.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 16:45:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 16:39:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Yao", "Rui", ""], ["Sun", "Kai", ""], ["Liu", "Feng", ""], ["Mei", "Shengwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07320", "submitter": "Martin Lints", "authors": "Martin Lints, Andrus Salupere, Serge Dos Santos", "title": "Simulation of detecting contact nonlinearity in carbon fibre polymer\n  using ultrasonic nonlinear delayed time reversal", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A finite element method simulation of a carbon fibre reinforced polymer block\nis used to analyse the nonlinearities arising from a contacting delamination\ngap inside the material.

Model inadequacies arise for\nnumerous reasons, such as incomplete knowledge of the phenomena or\ncomputational intractability of more accurate models. In such situations it is\nimpractical or impossible to improve the model, but necessity requires its use\nto make predictions. With this in mind, it is important to represent the\nuncertainty that a model's inadequacy causes in its predictions, as neglecting\nto do so can cause overconfidence in its accuracy. A powerful approach to\naddressing model inadequacy leverages the composite nature of physical models\nby enriching a flawed embedded closure model with a stochastic error\nrepresentation. This work outlines steps in the development of a stochastic\noperator as an inadequacy representation by establishing the framework for\ninferring an infinite-dimensional operator and by introducing a novel method\nfor interrogating available high-fidelity models to learn about modeling error.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 21:57:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Portone", "Teresa", ""], ["McDougall", "Damon", ""], ["Moser", "Robert D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.08875", "submitter": "Mike Eichhorn", "authors": "Mike Eichhorn, Alexander Haertel", "title": "A Debris Backwards Flow Simulation System for Malaysia Airlines Flight\n  370", "comments": "7 pages, 14 figures, IEEE OCEANS 2016 - Shanghai, 10-13 April 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/OCEANSAP.2016.7485732", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ao-ph cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a system based on a Two-Way Particle-Tracking Model to\nanalyze possible crash positions of flight MH370.
