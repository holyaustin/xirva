The tree and ancestral sequences maximize the\nprobability of observing the given data under a Markov model of sequence\nevolution, in which branch lengths are also optimized but constrained to take\nthe same value on any edge across all sequence sites. AML differs from the more\nusual form of maximum likelihood (ML) in phylogenetics because ML averages over\nall possible ancestral sequences. ML has long been known to be statistically\nconsistent -- that is, it converges on the correct tree with probability\napproaching 1 as the sequence length grows. However, the statistical\nconsistency of AML has not been formally determined, despite informal remarks\nin a literature that dates back 20 years. In this short note we prove a general\nresult that implies that AML is statistically inconsistent. In particular we\nshow that AML can `shrink' short edges in a tree, resulting in a tree that has\nno internal resolution as the sequence length grows. Our results apply to any\nnumber of taxa.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2008 06:52:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Roch", "Sebastien", ""], ["Steel", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.2001", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Uwe Aickelin and Kathryn Dowsland", "title": "Exploiting problem structure in a genetic algorithm approach to a nurse\n  rostering problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Scheduling, 3(3), pp 139-153, 2000", "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1099-1425(200005/06)3:3<139::AID-JOS41>3.0.CO;2-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.CE", "license": null, "abstract": "  There is considerable interest in the use of genetic algorithms to solve\nproblems arising in the areas of scheduling and timetabling.
