We propose a technique based on an\ninteractive neural network algorithm using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs). SOMs\nare a class of clustering algorithms based on competitive learning among\nspatially-ordered neurons. Our SOMs are trained on selections of stochastically\ngenerated PDF samples. The selection criterion for every optimization iteration\nis based on the features of the clustered PDFs. Our main goal is to provide a\nfitting procedure that, at variance with the standard neural network\napproaches, allows for an increased control of the systematic bias by enabling\nuser interaction in the various stages of the process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2008 05:41:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Nov 2008 23:56:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Carnahan", "J.", ""], ["Honkanen", "H.", ""], ["Liuti", "S.", ""], ["Loitiere", "Y.", ""], ["Reynolds", "P.
