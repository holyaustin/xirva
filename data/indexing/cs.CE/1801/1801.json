Economic considerations\nprevent a full observation of distribution grids with direct measurements.\nFirst approaches using a limited number of measurements to monitor such grids\nexist, some of which use artificial neural networks (ANN). The current\nANN-based approaches, however, are limited to static topologies, only estimate\nvoltage magnitudes, do not work properly when confronted with a high amount of\ndistributed generation and often yield inaccurate results. These strong\nlimitations have prevented a true applicability of ANN for distribution grid\nmonitoring. The objective of this paper is to overcome the limitations of\nexisting approaches. We do that by presenting an ANN-based scheme, which\nadvances the state-of-the-art in several ways: Our scheme can cope with a very\nlow number of measurements, far less than is traditionally required by the\nstate-of-the-art weighted least squares state estimation (WLS SE). It can\nestimate both voltage magnitudes and line loadings with high precision and\nincludes different switching states as inputs. Our contribution consists of a\nmethod to generate useful training data by using a scenario generator and a\nnumber of hyperparameters that define the ANN architecture. Both can be used\nfor different grids even with a high amount of distributed generation.\nSimulations are performed with an elaborate evaluation approach on a real\ndistribution grid and a CIGRE benchmark grid both with a high amount of\ndistributed generation from photovoltaics and wind energy converters. They\ndemonstrate that the proposed ANN scheme clearly outperforms state-of-the-art\nANN schemes and WLS SE under normal operating conditions and different\nsituations such as gross measurement errors when comparing voltage magnitude\nand line magnitude estimation errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 09:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Jan 2018 07:27:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 26 Jul 2018 07:28:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 5 Mar 2019 14:07:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Menke", "Jan-Hendrik", ""], ["Bornhorst", "Nils", ""], ["Braun", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04828", "submitter": "Zeger Bontinck", "authors": "Zeger Bontinck, Oliver Lass, Herbert De Gersem and Sebastian Sch\\\"ops", "title": "Uncertainty Quantification For A Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine\n  With Dynamic Rotor Eccentricity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Progress in Industrial Mathematics at ECMI 2016.

For\nthese reasons, automated map building has been a long time goal, either for\nroad network reconstruction or for local road surface reconstruction from low\nlevel observations. In this work, we navigate between these two goals. Starting\nfrom an approximate road axis (+ width) network as a simple road modelling, we\npropose to use observations of street features and optimisation to improve the\ncoarse model. Observations are generic, and as such, can be derived from\nvarious data, such as aerial images, street images and street Lidar, other GIS\ndata, and complementary user input.\n  Starting from an initial road modelling which is at a median distance of 1.5\nmetre from the sidewalk ground-truth, our method has the potential to robustly\noptimise the road modelling so the median distance reaches 0.45 metre fully\nautomatically, with better results possible using user inputs and/or more\nprecise observations. The robust non linear least square optimisation used is\nextremely fast, with computing time from few minutes (whole Paris) to less than\na second for a few blocks.\n  The proposed approach is simple, very fast and produces a credible road\nmodel.
