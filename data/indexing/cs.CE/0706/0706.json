We also introduce a scheme which allows the incorporation of\nmodels with a wide variety of agent types, and discuss a mechanism for the\nremoval of bias from relevant parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jun 2007 17:29:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Nachi", ""], ["Hauser", "Raphael", ""], ["Johnson", "Neil F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1119", "submitter": "Stefan Stefanov Z", "authors": "Stefan Z.

In\nthis paper we show how graphics processors can be used for N-body simulations\nto obtain improvements in performance over current generation CPUs.

In some of the calculations, we achieve sustained performance of\nnearly 100 GFlops on an ATI X1900XTX. The performance on GPUs is comparable to\nspecialized processors such as GRAPE-6A and MDGRAPE-3, but at a fraction of the\ncost. Furthermore, the wide availability of GPUs has significant implications\nfor cluster computing and distributed computing efforts like Folding@Home.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2007 21:02:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Elsen", "Erich", ""], ["Vishal", "V.", ""], ["Houston", "Mike", ""], ["Pande", "Vijay", ""], ["Hanrahan", "Pat", ""], ["Darve", "Eric", ""]]}]
