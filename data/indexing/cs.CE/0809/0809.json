It is composed\nof an hourly demand-forecasting module and of a simulation component for a\nplant electrical system. The first module was done using dynamic neural\nnetworks with backpropagation training algorithm; it is used to predict the\nelectric power demanded every hour, with an error percentage below of 1%. This\ninformation allows efficient management of energy peak demands before this\nhappen, distributing the raise of electric load to other hours or improving\nthose equipments that increase the demand. The simulation module is based in\nadvanced estimation techniques, such as: parametric estimation, neural network\nmodeling, statistic regression and previously developed models, which simulates\nthe electric behavior of the smelter plant. These modules facilitate\nelectricity demand and consumption proper planning, because they allow knowing\nthe behavior of the hourly demand and the consumption patterns of the plant,\nincluding the bill components, but also energy deficiencies and opportunities\nfor improvement, based on analysis of information about equipments, processes\nand production plans, as well as maintenance programs. Finally the results of\nits application in Southern Peru smelter are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Sep 2008 22:26:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 20:28:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 17:20:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 05:22:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 23:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sarmiento", "Juan Ojeda", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.2680", "submitter": "Armen Bagdasaryan", "authors": "Armen Bagdasaryan", "title": "Mathematical Tool of Discrete Dynamic Modeling of Complex Systems in\n  Control Loop", "comments": "9 pages, paper presented at the American Conference on Applied\n  Mathematics (MATH'08), Harvard University; published in book Recent Advances\n  on Applied Mathematics, WSEAS Press, 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MA cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a method of discrete modeling and analysis of\nmulti-level dynamics of complex large-scale hierarchical dynamic systems\nsubject to external dynamic control mechanism.

We present the approach using\nsimulation of paths of a time-dependent nonlinear stochastic equation. The core\nidea is to extract information at one or more nominal model parameters and use\nthis information to gain estimation efficiency at neighboring parameters. This\nidea is the basis of a general strategy, called DataBase Monte Carlo (DBMC),\nfor improving efficiency of Monte Carlo. In this paper we describe how this\nstrategy can be implemented using the variance reduction technique of Control\nVariates (CV). We show that, once an initial setup cost for extracting\ninformation is incurred, this approach can lead to significant gains in\ncomputational efficiency. The initial setup cost is justified in projects that\nrequire a large number of estimations or in those that are to be performed\nunder real-time constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Sep 2008 15:29:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Borogovac", "T.", ""], ["Alexander", "F.
