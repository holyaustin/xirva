The models are dynamically coupled to each other and to the\nearthmoving equipment. Agitated soil is represented by a hybrid of contacting\nparticles and continuum solid, with the moving equipment and resting soil as\ngeometric boundaries. Each zone of active soil is aggregated into distinct\nbodies, with the proper mass, momentum and frictional-cohesive properties,\nwhich constrain the equipment's multibody dynamics. The particle model\nparameters are pre-calibrated to the bulk mechanical parameters for a wide\nrange of different soils. The result is a computationally efficient model for\nearthmoving operations that resolve the motion of the soil, using a fast\niterative solver, and provide realistic forces and dynamic for the equipment,\nusing a direct solver for high numerical precision. Numerical simulations of\nexcavation and bulldozing operations are performed to validate the model and\nmeasure the computational performance. Reference data is produced using coupled\ndiscrete element and multibody dynamics simulations at relatively high\nresolution.

However, the large\ndomain sizes and generation of higher harmonics at the focus make these\nproblems extremely computationally demanding. Numerical methods typically\nemploy a uniform mesh fine enough to resolve the highest harmonic present in\nthe problem, leading to a very large number of degrees of freedom. This paper\nproposes a more efficient strategy in which each harmonic is approximated on a\nseparate mesh, the size of which is proportional to the wavelength of the\nharmonic. The increase in resolution required to resolve a smaller wavelength\nis balanced by a reduction in the domain size. This nested meshing is feasible\nowing to the increasingly localised nature of higher harmonics near the focus.\n  Numerical experiments are performed for FUS transducers in homogeneous media\nin order to determine the size of the meshes required to accurately represent\nthe harmonics. In particular, a fast \\emph{volume potential} approach is\nproposed and employed to perform convergence experiments as the computation\ndomain size is modified. This approach allows each harmonic to be computed via\nthe evaluation of an integral over the domain. Discretising this integral using\nthe midpoint rule allows the computations to be performed rapidly with the FFT.\nIt is shown that at least an order of magnitude reduction in memory consumption\nand computation time can be achieved with nested meshing.

For cohesive zone modelling,\ntraction-separation relations represent the adhesive interactions across\ninterfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently capture\ntraction-separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods,\nparticularly under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem,\nmodels derived from the neural network approach are attractive. Although they\ncan be trained to fit data along the loading paths taken in a particular set of\nmixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws for paths\nnot covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically\nconsistent neural network (TCNN) approach is established to model the\nconstitutive behavior of interfaces when faced with sparse training data sets.\nAccordingly, three conditions are examined and implemented here: (i)\nthermodynamic consistency, (ii) maximum energy dissipation path control and\n(iii) J-integral conservation. These conditions are treated as constraints and\nare implemented as such in the loss function. The feasibility of this approach\nis demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with a range of physical\nconstraints. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to\noptimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to\novercome convergence issues that can arise when multiple constraints are\npresent. The resultant numerical implementation of the ideas presented here\nproduced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction separation surfaces that maintained\nthe fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input.
