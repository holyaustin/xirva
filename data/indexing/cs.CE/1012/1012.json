Here, we propose a\nmachine-learning approach applied to the tunneling current-voltage (I-V)\ncharacteristic for efficient discrimination between the four nucleotides. We\nfirst combine principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means (FCM)\nclustering to learn the \"fingerprints\" of the electronic density-of-states\n(DOS) of the four nucleotides, which can be derived from the I-V data. We then\napply the hidden Markov model and the Viterbi algorithm to sequence a time\nseries of DOS data (i.e., to solve the sequencing problem). Numerical\nexperiments show that the PCA-FCM approach can classify unlabeled DOS data with\n91% accuracy. Furthermore, the classification is found to be robust against\nmoderate levels of noise, i.e., 70% accuracy is retained with a signal-to-noise\nratio of 26 dB. The PCA-FCM-Viterbi approach provides a 4-fold increase in\naccuracy for the sequencing problem compared with PCA alone. In conjunction\nwith recent developments in nanotechnology, this machine-learning method may\npave the way to the much-awaited rapid, low-cost genome sequencer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Dec 2010 09:53:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Yuen", "Henry", ""], ["Shimojo", "Fuyuki", ""], ["Zhang", "Kevin J.", ""], ["Nomura", "Ken-ichi", ""], ["Kalia", "Rajiv K.", ""], ["Nakano", "Aiichiro", ""], ["Vashishta", "Priya", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.1615", "submitter": "Adrian Paschke", "authors": "Kenneth McLeod, Gus Ferguson, Albert Burger", "title": "Argudas: arguing with gene expression information", "comments": "in Adrian Paschke, Albert Burger, Andrea Splendiani, M.

Using continuous Lagrange multiplier spaces\nto enforce flux continuity across cell facets, the number of global degrees of\nfreedom is the same as for a continuous Galerkin method on the same mesh.\nDifferent from our earlier investigations on the approach for the\nNavier--Stokes equations, the pressure field in this work is discontinuous\nacross cell boundaries.
