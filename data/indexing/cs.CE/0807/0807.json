The recent growth in the number of\nhybridization network reconstruction algorithms has led to an increasing\ninterest in the definition of metrics for their comparison that can be used to\nassess the accuracy or robustness of these methods. In this paper we establish\nsome basic results that make it possible the generalization to tree-child time\nconsistent (TCTC) hybridization networks of some of the oldest known metrics\nfor phylogenetic trees: those based on the comparison of the vectors of path\nlengths between leaves. More specifically, we associate to each hybridization\nnetwork a suitably defined vector of `splitted' path lengths between its\nleaves, and we prove that if two TCTC hybridization networks have the same such\nvectors, then they must be isomorphic. Thus, comparing these vectors by means\nof a metric for real-valued vectors defines a metric for TCTC hybridization\nnetworks. We also consider the case of fully resolved hybridization networks,\nwhere we prove that simpler, `non-splitted' vectors can be used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2008 09:13:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Cardona", "Gabriel", ""], ["Llabres", "Merce", ""], ["Rossello", "Francesc", ""], ["Valiente", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1475", "submitter": "Maziar Nekovee", "authors": "Maziar Nekovee", "title": "Simulations of Large-scale WiFi-based Wireless Networks:\n  Interdisciplinary Challenges and Applications", "comments": "Future Generation Computer Systems, Article in Press", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.future.2008.05.007", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) is the fastest growing wireless technology to date.\nIn addition to providing wire-free connectivity to the Internet WiFi technology\nalso enables mobile devices to connect directly to each other and form highly\ndynamic wireless adhoc networks.

In this work, we consider the trapezoidal family of\nschemes for integrating the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each\nsubdomain and present four different coupling methods, corresponding to\ndifferent algebraic constraints, for enforcing kinematic continuity on the\ninterface between the subdomains.\n  Method 1 (d-continuity) is based on the conventional approach using\ncontinuity of the primary variable and we show that this method is unstable for\na lot of commonly used time integrators including the mid-point rule. To\nalleviate this difficulty, we propose a new Method 2 (Modified d-continuity)\nand prove its stability for coupling all time integrators in the trapezoidal\nfamily (except the forward Euler). Method 3 (v-continuity) is based on\nenforcing the continuity of the time derivative of the primary variable.\nHowever, this constraint introduces a drift in the primary variable on the\ninterface. We present Method 4 (Baumgarte stabilized) which uses Baumgarte\nstabilization to limit this drift and we derive bounds for the stabilization\nparameter to ensure stability.\n  Our stability analysis is based on the ``energy'' method, and one of the main\ncontributions of this paper is the extension of the energy method (which was\npreviously introduced in the context of numerical methods for ODEs) to assess\nthe stability of numerical formulations for index-2 differential-algebraic\nequations (DAEs).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jul 2008 08:10:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2009 21:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nakshatrala", "K.
