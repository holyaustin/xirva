Input uncertainty is propagated into output uncertainty, reflecting\nthat option prices are as unknown as the inputs they are based on. Option\npricing formulas are tools whose validity is conditional not only on how close\nthe model represents reality, but also on the quality of the inputs they use,\nand those inputs are usually not observable. We provide three alternative\nframeworks to calibrate option pricing tree models, propagating parameter\nuncertainty into the resulting option prices. We finally compare our methods\nwith classical calibration-based results assuming that there is no options\nmarket established. These methods can be applied to pricing of instruments for\nwhich there is not an options market, as well as a methodological tool to\naccount for parameter and model uncertainty in theoretical option pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 14:48:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gzyl", "Henryk", ""], ["Molina", "German", ""], ["ter Horst", "Enrique", ""]]}]
