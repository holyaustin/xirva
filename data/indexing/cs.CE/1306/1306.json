The\ncontribution of the paper is twofold. First a detailed description of the\nsimulator is given, under the software engineering point of view, by\nhighlighting the innovations and optimizations introduced. Their introduction\ninto the previous version of the BiNS simulator was needed to provide to\nfunctions for simulating molecular signaling and communication potentials\ninside bounded spaces. The second contribution consists of the analysis,\ncarried out by using BiNS2, of a specific communication process happening\ninside blood vessels, the atherogenesis, which is the initial phase of the\nformation of atherosclerotic plaques, due to the abnormal signaling between\nplatelets and endothelium. From a communication point of view, platelets act as\nmobile transmitters, endothelial cells are fixed receivers, sticky to the\nvessel walls, and the transmitted signal is made of bursts of molecules emitted\nby platelets. The simulator allows evaluating the channel latency and the\nfootprint on the vessel wall of the transmitted signal as a function of the\ntransmitter distance from the vessels wall, the signal strength, and the\nreceiver sensitivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 21:05:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Felicetti", "Luca", ""], ["Femminella", "Mauro", ""], ["Reali", "Gianluca", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0194", "submitter": "Matthias Bechmann", "authors": "Matthias Bechmann, John Clark, Angelika Sebald", "title": "Genetic algorithms and solid state NMR pulse sequences", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Magnetic Resonance 228, 66 (2013)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2012.12.015", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE physics.ins-det", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of genetic algorithms for the optimisation of magic angle spinning\nNMR pulse sequences is discussed.

In this paper we extend the approach to include tubular conductors,\nallowing to model realistic cables with tubular sheaths, armors and pipes. We\nalso include the effect of a lossy ground. A noteworthy feature of the proposed\ntechnique is the accurate prediction of proximity effects, which can be of\nmajor importance in three-phase, pipe type, and closely-packed single-core\ncables.

From our study, we observed that\nperiodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks,\nbids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest\ntime-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns\nin RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first\nprice payment in fact is accounted for 55.4% of total cost due to the\narrangement of the soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft\nfloor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable\nposition. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the\ncurrent bidding strategy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs\nfor optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal\nbehaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been\nwell considered in the past.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 15:15:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Shuai", ""], ["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Zhao", "Xiaoxue", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6578", "submitter": "Davide Cagnoni", "authors": "Davide Cagnoni, Francesco Agostini, Thomas Christen, Carlo de Falco,\n  Nicola Parolini, and Ivica Stevanovi\\'c", "title": "Multiphysics simulation of corona discharge induced ionic wind", "comments": "24 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.4843823", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.CE physics.flu-dyn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ionic wind devices or electrostatic fluid accelerators are becoming of\nincreasing interest as tools for thermal management, in particular for\nsemiconductor devices.
