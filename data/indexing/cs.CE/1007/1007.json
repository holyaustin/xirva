The algorithmic\nacceleration is achieved with the fast multipole method (FMM) in conjunction\nwith a boundary element method (BEM) formulation of the continuum electrostatic\nmodel, as well as the BIBEE approximation to BEM. The hardware acceleration is\nachieved through graphics processors, GPUs. We demonstrate the power of our\nalgorithms and software for the calculation of the electrostatic interactions\nbetween biological molecules in solution. The applications demonstrated include\nthe electrostatics of protein--drug binding and several multi-million atom\nsystems consisting of hundreds to thousands of copies of lysozyme molecules.\nThe parallel scalability of the software was studied in a cluster at the\nNagasaki Advanced Computing Center, using 128 nodes, each with 4 GPUs. Delicate\ntuning has resulted in strong scaling with parallel efficiency of 0.8 for 256\nand 0.5 for 512 GPUs. The largest application run, with over 20 million atoms\nand one billion unknowns, required only one minute on 512 GPUs. We are\ncurrently adapting our BEM software to solve the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann\nequation for dilute ionic solutions, and it is also designed to be flexible\nenough to be extended for a variety of integral equation problems, ranging from\nPoisson problems to Helmholtz problems in electromagnetics and acoustics to\nhigh Reynolds number flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 23:27:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Oct 2010 18:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 22:07:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Yokota", "Rio", ""], ["Bardhan", "Jaydeep P.", ""], ["Knepley", "Matthew G.", ""], ["Barba", "L.

The problem of assembling\nfragments into a complete conformation is mapped to a constraint solving\nproblem and solved using CLP. The constraint-based model uses a medium\ndiscretization degree Ca-side chain centroid protein model that offers\nefficiency and a good approximation for space filling.
