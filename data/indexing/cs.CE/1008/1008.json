'Phenotyping' of wild\ntype and mutants is a time-consuming and costly effort by many individuals.\nThis article is a preliminary progress report in research on large-scale\nautomation of phenotyping steps (imaging, informatics and data analysis) needed\nto study plant gene-proteins networks that influence growth and development of\nplants. Our results undermine the significance of phenotypic traits that are\nimplicit in patterns of dynamics in plant root response to sudden changes of\nits environmental conditions, such as sudden re-orientation of the root tip\nagainst the gravity vector. Including dynamic features besides the common\nmorphological ones has paid off in design of robust and accurate machine\nlearning methods to automate a typical phenotyping scenario, i.e. to\ndistinguish the wild type from the mutants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 18:54:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dashti", "Hesam T.", ""], ["Tonejc", "Jernej", ""], ["Ardalan", "Adel", ""], ["Siahpirani", "Alireza F.", ""], ["Guettes", "Sabrina", ""], ["Sharif", "Zohreh", ""], ["Wang", "Liya", ""], ["Assadi", "Amir H.", ""]]}]
