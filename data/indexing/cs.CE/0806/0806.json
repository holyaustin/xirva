But, as\nfar as rooted phylogenetic trees goes, these vectors can only separate\nnon-weighted binary trees, and therefore these dissimilarity measures are\nmetrics only on this class. In this paper we overcome this problem, by\nsplitting in a suitable way each path length between two taxa into two lengths.\nWe prove that the resulting splitted path lengths matrices single out arbitrary\nrooted phylogenetic trees with nested taxa and arcs weighted in the set of\npositive real numbers. This allows the definition of metrics on this general\nclass by comparing these matrices by means of metrics in spaces of real-valued\n$n\\times n$ matrices. We conclude this paper by establishing some basic facts\nabout the metrics for non-weighted phylogenetic trees defined in this way using\n$L^p$ metrics on these spaces of matrices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jun 2008 10:17:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Cardona", "Gabriel", ""], ["Llabres", "Merce", ""], ["Rossello", "Francesc", ""], ["Valiente", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2312", "submitter": "Balint Joo", "authors": "Balint Joo (for the USQCD Collaboration)", "title": "Continuing Progress on a Lattice QCD Software Infrastructure", "comments": "5 Pages, to appear in the Proceedings of SciDAC 2008 conference,\n  (Seattle, July 13-17, 2008), Conference Poster Presentation Proceedings", "journal-ref": "J.Phys.Conf.Ser.125:012066,2008", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/125/1/012066", "report-no": "JLAB-IT-08-02", "categories": "hep-lat cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report on the progress of the software effort in the QCD Application Area\nof SciDAC.
