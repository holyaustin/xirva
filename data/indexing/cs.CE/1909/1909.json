PCE is a\ndata-driven regression-based technique that relies on spectral polynomials as\nbasis-functions. In this technique, the outputs of few numerical simulations\nare used to estimate the PCE coefficients within a regression framework\ncombined with regularization techniques where the regularization parameters are\nestimated using standard cross-validation as applied in supervised machine\nlearning methods.\n  In the present work, we introduce an efficient method for estimating the PCE\ncoefficients combining Elastic Net regularization with a data-driven feature\nranking approach. Our goal is to increase the probability of identifying the\nmost significant PCE components by assigning each of the PCE coefficients a\nnumerical value reflecting the magnitude of the coefficient and its stability\nwith respect to perturbations in the input data. In our evaluations, the\nproposed approach has shown high convergence rate for high-dimensional\nproblems, where standard feature ranking might be challenging due to the curse\nof dimensionality.\n  The presented method is implemented within a standard machine learning\nlibrary (Scikit-learn) allowing for easy experimentation with various solvers\nand regularization techniques (e.g. Tikhonov, LASSO, LARS, Elastic Net) and\nenabling automatic cross-validation techniques using a widely used and well\ntested implementation.

Our analytical model gives a smooth,\nclosed-form expression for ground surface acceleration, which we can then use\nin the Rayleigh integral or in an \"acoustic shader\" for a finite-difference\ntime-domain wave simulation. We find that when modal sound is inaudible, ground\nsound is audible in scenarios where a dense object impacts a soft ground and\nscenarios where the impact point has a low elevation angle to the listening\npoint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2019 21:06:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Qu", "Ante", ""], ["James", "Doug L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.09563", "submitter": "Jialin Liu", "authors": "Jialin Liu, Chih-Min Lin and Fei Chao", "title": "Gradient Boost with Convolution Neural Network for Stock Forecast", "comments": "UKCL2019.11pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CE q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Market economy closely connects aspects to all walks of life.

Our framework exhibits great\npotential in the analysis of multi-scale, multi-physics phenomena\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2019 12:39:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Yupeng", ""], ["Li", "Minchen", ""], ["Jiang", "Chenfanfu", ""], ["Alonso-marroquin", "Fernando", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13772", "submitter": "Martin Bauer", "authors": "Martin Bauer, Sebastian Eibl, Christian Godenschwager, Nils Kohl,\n  Michael Kuron, Christoph Rettinger, Florian Schornbaum, Christoph\n  Schwarzmeier, Dominik Th\\\"onnes, Harald K\\\"ostler, Ulrich R\\\"ude", "title": "waLBerla: A block-structured high-performance framework for multiphysics\n  simulations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.camwa.2020.01.007", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CE physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Programming current supercomputers efficiently is a challenging task.\nMultiple levels of parallelism on the core, on the compute node, and between\nnodes need to be exploited to make full use of the system. Heterogeneous\nhardware architectures with accelerators further complicate the development\nprocess. waLBerla addresses these challenges by providing the user with highly\nefficient building blocks for developing simulations on block-structured grids.\nThe block-structured domain partitioning is flexible enough to handle complex\ngeometries, while the structured grid within each block allows for highly\nefficient implementations of stencil-based algorithms. We present several\nexample applications realized with waLBerla, ranging from lattice Boltzmann\nmethods to rigid particle simulations. Most importantly, these methods can be\ncoupled together, enabling multiphysics simulations. The framework uses\nmeta-programming techniques to generate highly efficient code for CPUs and GPUs\nfrom a symbolic method formulation. To ensure software quality and performance\nportability, a continuous integration toolchain automatically runs an extensive\ntest suite encompassing multiple compilers, hardware architectures, and\nsoftware configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 15:13:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Martin", ""], ["Eibl", "Sebastian", ""], ["Godenschwager", "Christian", ""], ["Kohl", "Nils", ""], ["Kuron", "Michael", ""], ["Rettinger", "Christoph", ""], ["Schornbaum", "Florian", ""], ["Schwarzmeier", "Christoph", ""], ["Th\u00f6nnes", "Dominik", ""], ["K\u00f6stler", "Harald", ""], ["R\u00fcde", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13843", "submitter": "Sebastian Sch\\\"ops", "authors": "Markus Clemens and Bernhard K\\\"ahne and Sebastian Sch\\\"ops", "title": "A Darwin Time Domain Scheme for the Simulation of Transient Quasistatic\n  Electromagnetic Fields Including Resistive, Capacitive and Inductive Effects", "comments": "presented at the URSI Kleinheubacher Tagung 2019", "journal-ref": "2019 Kleinheubach Conference, IEEE, Miltenberg, Germany, 2019.\n  ISBN 978-1-7281-3161-0.
