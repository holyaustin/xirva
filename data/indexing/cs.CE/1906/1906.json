These solutions are shown to develop velocity and\nsurface gradient catastrophes in finite time and the inherent persistence of\ndry spots is shown to be terminated by the collapse of the parabolic core. All\ndetails of the evolution can be obtained in closed form until the collapse\ntime, thanks to formation of simple waves that sandwich the evolving\nself-similar core. The continuation of solutions asymptotically for short times\nbeyond the collapse is then investigated analytically, in its weak form, with\nan approach using stretched coordinates inspired by singular perturbation\ntheory. This approach allows to follow the evolution after collapse by\nimplementing a spectrally accurate numerical code, which is developed alongside\na classical shock-capturing scheme for accuracy comparison. The codes are\nvalidated on special classes of initial data, in increasing order of\ncomplexity, to illustrate the evolution of the dry spot initial conditions on\nlonger time scales past collapse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2019 13:57:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Camassa", "R.", ""], ["Falqui", "G.", ""], ["Ortenzi", "G.", ""], ["Pedroni", "M.", ""], ["Pitton", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.12166", "submitter": "Anna Caroline Felix Santos De Jesus", "authors": "Anna Caroline Felix Santos de Jesus", "title": "A study on Stokes-Brinkman dimensionless model for flow in porous media", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we propose a non-dimensionalization approach for the\nStokes-Brinkman model for flow in porous media.
