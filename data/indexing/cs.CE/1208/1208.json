Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of\nprotein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein\ndomain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global\nstructure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.\nHowever, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to\nthe choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult\nproblem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.\n  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph\nregularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to\nregularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold\nof protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the\nregularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and\nautomatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an\niterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP\nprotein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking\nperformance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise\nsimilarity based ranking methods.\n  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph\nregularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining\nmultiple graphs. This aspect of generalization introduces a new frontier in\napplying multiple graphs to solving protein domain ranking applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Aug 2012 19:32:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 14:19:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 06:21:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jim Jing-Yan", ""], ["Bensmail", "Halima", ""], ["Gao", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.3789", "submitter": "Bhaskar DasGupta", "authors": "Bhaskar DasGupta and Lakshmi Kaligounder", "title": "On Global Stability of Financial Networks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1112.5687 by other authors.\n  Prior title for this article was \"Contagion in Financial Networks: Measure,\n  Evaluation and Implications\"", "journal-ref": "Journal of Complex Networks, 2(3), 313-354, 2014", "doi": "10.1093/comnet/cnu004", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The recent financial crisis have generated renewed interests in fragilities\nof global financial networks among economists and regulatory authorities.

So, tumor cells ecologically\ninterplay with other kind of cells, e.g. endothelial cells or immune system\neffectors, producing and exchanging various chemical signals. As such, tumor\ngrowth is an ideal object of hybrid modeling where discrete stochastic\nprocesses model agents at low concentrations, and mean-field equations model\nchemical signals. In previous works we proposed a hybrid version of the\nwell-known Panetta-Kirschner mean-field model of tumor cells, effector cells\nand Interleukin-2. Our hybrid model suggested -at variance of the inferences\nfrom its original formulation- that immune surveillance, i.e. tumor elimination\nby the immune system, may occur through a sort of side-effect of large\nstochastic oscillations. However, that model did not account that, due to both\nchemical transportation and cellular differentiation/division, the\ntumor-induced recruitment of immune effectors is not instantaneous but,\ninstead, it exhibits a lag period. To capture this, we here integrate a\nmean-field equation for Interleukins-2 with a bi-dimensional delayed stochastic\nprocess describing such delayed interplay. An algorithm to realize trajectories\nof the underlying stochastic process is obtained by coupling the Piecewise\nDeterministic Markov process (for the hybrid part) with a Generalized\nSemi-Markovian clock structure (to account for delays). We (i) relate tumor\nmass growth with delays via simulations and via parametric sensitivity analysis\ntechniques, (ii) we quantitatively determine probabilistic eradication times,\nand (iii) we prove, in the oscillatory regime, the existence of a heuristic\nstochastic bifurcation resulting in delay-induced tumor eradication, which is\nneither predicted by the mean-field nor by the hybrid non-delayed models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Aug 2012 16:01:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Caravagna", "Giulio", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemistica e\n  Comunicazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Milano-Bicocca, Italy"], ["Graudenzi", "Alex", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemistica e Comunicazione,\n  Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Milano-Bicocca, Italy"], ["Antoniotti", "Marco", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica Sistemistica e Comunicazione, Universit\u00e0 degli\n  Studi Milano-Bicocca, Italy"], ["Mauri", "Giancarlo", "", "Dipartimento di Informatica\n  Sistemistica e Comunicazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi Milano-Bicocca,\n  Italy"], ["d'Onofrio", "Alberto", "", "Department of Experimental Oncology, European\n  Institute of Oncology, Italy"]]}, {"id": "1208.3856", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Alexandre David (Aalborg University), Dehui Du (East China Normal\n  University), Kim G.
