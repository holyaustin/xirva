It is\nhighly desirable to preserve these bounds on the pressure field in predictive\nnumerical simulations, that is, one needs to satisfy discrete maximum\nprinciples (DMP). Unfortunately, many of the existing formulations for flow\nthrough porous media models do not satisfy DMP. This paper presents a robust,\nscalable numerical formulation based on variational inequalities (VI), to model\nnon-linear flows through heterogeneous, anisotropic porous media without\nviolating DMP. VI is an optimization technique that places bounds on the\nnumerical solutions of partial differential equations. To crystallize the\nideas, a modification to Darcy equations by taking into account\npressure-dependent viscosity will be discretized using the lowest-order\nRaviart-Thomas (RT0) and Variational Multi-scale (VMS) finite element\nformulations. It will be shown that these formulations violate DMP, and, in\nfact, these violations increase with an increase in anisotropy. It will be\nshown that the proposed VI-based formulation provides a viable route to enforce\nDMP. Moreover, it will be shown that the proposed formulation is scalable, and\ncan work with any numerical discretization and weak form. Parallel scalability\non modern computational platforms will be illustrated through strong-scaling\nstudies, which will prove the efficiency of the proposed formulation in a\nparallel setting.

This novel approach mainly consists of two steps: the computation of the\nWigner kernel, a multi-dimensional function describing the effects of the\npotential over the system, and the field-less evolution of the particles which\neventually create new signed particles in the process. Although this method has\nproved to be extremely advantageous in terms of computational resources - as a\nmatter of fact it is able to simulate in a time-dependent fashion many- body\nsystems on relatively small machines - the Wigner kernel can represent the\nbottleneck of simulations of certain systems. Moreover, storing the kernel can\nbe another issue as the amount of memory needed is cursed by the dimensionality\nof the system. In this work, we introduce a new technique which drastically\nreduces the computation time and memory requirement to simulate time-dependent\nquantum systems which is based on the use of an appropriately tailored neural\nnetwork combined with the signed particle formalism. In particular, the\nsuggested neural network is able to compute efficiently and reliably the Wigner\nkernel without any training as its entire set of weights and biases is\nspecified by analytical formulas. As a consequence, the amount of memory for\nquantum simulations radically drops since the kernel does not need to be stored\nanymore as it is now computed by the neural network itself, only on the cells\nof the (discretized) phase-space which are occupied by particles. As its is\nclearly shown in the final part of this paper, not only this novel approach\ndrastically reduces the computational time, it also remains accurate.
