The character of the problem and\nespecially the symmetries involved must guide the choice of random matrices to\nbe used for the definition of a baseline reference. For standard correlation\nmatrices this is the Wishart ensemble of symmetric random matrices. The real\nworld complexity however often shows asymmetric information flows and therefore\nmore general correlation matrices are required to adequately capture the\nasymmetry.

Voltage is controlled directly at the head of the line\n(sub-station), however, voltage anywhere further down the line is subject to\nfluctuations, caused by irregularities of real and reactive distributed power\nconsumption/generation. The lack of a direct control of voltage along the line\nmay result in the voltage instability, also called voltage collapse -\nphenomenon well known and documented in the power engineering literature.\nMotivated by emerging photo-voltaic technology, which brings a new source of\nrenewable generation but also contributes significant increase in power flow\nfluctuations, we reexamine the phenomenon of voltage stability and collapse. In\nthe limit where the number of consumers is large and spatial variations in\npower flows are smooth functions of position along the feeder, we derive a set\nof the power flow Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), verify phenomenon of\nvoltage collapse, and study the effect of disorder and irregularity in\ninjection and consumption on the voltage profile by simulating the stochastic\nODE. We observe that disorder leads to nonlinear amplification of the voltage\nvariations at the end of the line as the point of voltage collapse is\napproached. We also find that the disorder, when correlated on a scale\nsufficiently small compared to the length of the line, self-averages, i.e. the\nvoltage profile remains spatially smooth for any individual realization of the\ndisorder and is correlated only at scales comparable to the length of the line.\nFinally, we explain why the integrated effect of disorder on the voltage at the\nend of the line cannot be described within a naive one-generator-one-load\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2011 15:55:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Chertkov", "M.", ""], ["Backhaus", "S.", ""], ["Turtisyn", "K.", ""], ["Chernyak", "V.", ""], ["Lebedev", "V.", ""]]}]
