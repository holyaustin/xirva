Although linear octrees, which store only\nleaf octants, have an underlying tree structure by definition, it is not often\nexploited in previously published mesh-related algorithms. This is because the\nbranches are not explicitly stored, and because the topological relationships\nin meshes, such as the adjacency between cells, introduce dependencies that do\nnot respect the octree hierarchy. In this work we combine hierarchical and\ntopological relationships between octree branches to design efficient recursive\nalgorithms.\n  We present three important algorithms with recursive implementations. The\nfirst is a parallel search for leaves matching any of a set of multiple search\ncriteria. The second is a ghost layer construction algorithm that handles\narbitrarily refined octrees that are not covered by previous algorithms, which\nrequire a 2:1 condition between neighboring leaves. The third is a universal\nmesh topology iterator. This iterator visits every cell in a domain partition,\nas well as every interface (face, edge and corner) between these cells. The\niterator calculates the local topological information for every interface that\nit visits, taking into account the nonconforming interfaces that increase the\ncomplexity of describing the local topology. To demonstrate the utility of the\ntopology iterator, we use it to compute the numbering and encoding of\nhigher-order $C^0$ nodal basis functions.\n  We analyze the complexity of the new recursive algorithms theoretically, and\nassess their performance, both in terms of single-processor efficiency and in\nterms of parallel scalability, demonstrating good weak and strong scaling up to\n458k cores of the JUQUEEN supercomputer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 16:02:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 21:00:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2015 03:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Isaac", "Tobin", ""], ["Burstedde", "Carsten", ""], ["Wilcox", "Lucas C.", ""], ["Ghattas", "Omar", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.0416", "submitter": "Anya Johnson", "authors": "Anya Elaine Johnson, Eli Strauss, Rodney Pickett, Christoph Adami, Ian\n  Dworkin, and Heather J.

An extreme form of altruism can be found in colicinogenic E. coli.\nThese suicidal altruists explode, releasing colicins that kill unrelated\nindividuals, which are not colicin resistant. By committing suicide, the\naltruist makes it more likely that its kin will have less competition. The\nbenefits of this strategy rely on the number of competitors and kin nearby. If\nthe organism explodes at an inopportune time, the suicidal act may not harm any\ncompetitors. Communication could enable organisms to act altruistically when\nenvironmental conditions suggest that that strategy would be most beneficial.\nQuorum sensing is a form of communication in which bacteria produce a protein\nand gauge the amount of that protein around them. Quorum sensing is one means\nby which bacteria sense the biotic factors around them and determine when to\nproduce products, such as antibiotics, that influence competition. Suicidal\naltruists could use quorum sensing to determine when exploding is most\nbeneficial, but it is challenging to study the selective forces at work in\nmicrobes. To address these challenges, we use digital evolution (a form of\nexperimental evolution that uses self-replicating computer programs as\norganisms) to investigate the effects of enabling altruistic organisms to\ncommunicate via quorum sensing. We found that quorum-sensing altruists killed a\ngreater number of competitors per explosion, winning competitions against\nnon-communicative altruists.

Connectivity has been assessed on the basis of\na 500 m average inter-site distance, roads and intensive land use as barrier\neffects as well as the presence of \"green\" corridors. In all countries the\nNatura 2000 network is mostly made of sites which are not physically connected.\nHighest functional connectivity values are found for Spain, Slovakia, Romania\nand Bulgaria.

We then introduce an\nexact method, called KisSplice, to extract alternative splicing events.\nFinally, we show that it enables to identify more correct events than general\npurpose transcriptome assemblers.\n  In order to deal with ever-increasing volumes of NGS data, we put an extra\neffort to make KisSplice as scalable as possible. First, to improve its running\ntime, we propose a new polynomial delay algorithm to enumerate bubbles. We show\nthat it is several orders of magnitude faster than previous approaches. Then,\nto reduce its memory consumption, we propose a new compact way to build and\nrepresent a de Bruijn graph. We show that our approach uses 30% to 40% less\nmemory than the state of the art, with an insignificant impact on the\nconstruction time.\n  Additionally, we apply the same techniques developed to list bubbles in two\nclassical problems: cycle enumeration and the K-shortest paths problem. We give\nthe first optimal algorithm to list cycles in undirected graphs, improving over\nJohnson's algorithm. This is the first improvement to this problem in almost 40\nyears. We then consider a different parameterization of the classical\nK-shortest (simple) paths problem: instead of bounding the number of st-paths,\nwe bound the weight of the st-paths.

The\n(1,1)-block is approximated using linear finite elements based on the nodes of\nthe high-order discretization, and the application of its inverse is\napproximated using algebraic multigrid with an incomplete factorization\nsmoother. This preconditioner is designed to be efficient on anisotropic\nmeshes, which are necessary to match the high aspect ratio domains typical for\nice sheets. We develop and make available extensions to two libraries---a\nhybrid meshing scheme for the p4est parallel AMR library, and a modified\nsmoothed aggregation scheme for PETSc---to improve their support for solving\nPDEs in high aspect ratio domains. In a numerical study, we find that our\nsolver yields fast convergence that is independent of the element aspect ratio,\nthe occurrence of nonconforming interfaces, and of mesh refinement, and that\ndepends only weakly on the polynomial finite element order.

In particular, the (real) kinetic orders can differ from the\n(integer) stoichiometric coefficients. As with mass-action kinetics, complex\nbalancing equilibria are determined by the graph Laplacian of the underlying\nnetwork and can be characterized by binomial equations and parametrized by\nmonomials. In algebraic terms, we focus on a constructive characterization of\npositive solutions of polynomial equations with real and symbolic exponents.\n  Uniqueness and existence for all rate constants and initial conditions\nadditionally depend on sign vectors of the stoichiometric and kinetic-order\nsubspaces.
