Neither do we need\npreparational graph transformations, nor do we need to introduce additional\ncurrent variables (as in MNA). Thus this algorithm is more accessible to\nstudents, and consequently more suitable for classroom presentations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Mar 2009 12:25:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gerbracht", "Eberhard H. -A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2641", "submitter": "Constantinos Siettos", "authors": "Konstantinos G.
