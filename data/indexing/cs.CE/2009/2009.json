Current modeling approaches resort to numerical solvers that simulate\nthe tumor progression according to a given differential equation. Using\nhighly-efficient numerical solvers, a single forward simulation takes up to a\nfew minutes of compute. At the same time, clinical applications of tumor\nmodeling often imply solving an inverse problem, requiring up to tens of\nthousands forward model evaluations when used for a Bayesian model\npersonalization via sampling.

Secondly, in contrast to the\ntraditional time integration scheme with a finite order of accuracy, this\nmethod exhibits a super convergence behavior versus the number of computed\nmodes. Thirdly, in contrast to the stabilized finite element methods for fluid,\nno stabilization term is employed in our formulation, producing a solution that\nis consistent and more accurate.

This is particularly relevant for\naerospace systems, where high levels of integrity and high performances are\nrequired at the same time. We propose a novel strategy for the nearly real-time\nFault Detection and Identification (FDI) of a dynamical assembly, and for the\nestimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of the system. The availability of a\ntimely estimate of the health status of the system will allow for an informed\nadaptive planning of maintenance and a dynamical reconfiguration of the mission\nprofile, reducing operating costs and improving reliability. This work\naddresses the three phases of the prognostic flow - namely (1) signal\nacquisition, (2) Fault Detection and Identification, and (3) Remaining Useful\nLife estimation - and introduces a computationally efficient procedure suitable\nfor real-time, on-board execution. To achieve this goal, we propose to combine\ninformation from physical models of different fidelity with machine learning\ntechniques to obtain efficient representations (surrogate models) suitable for\nnearly real-time applications. Additionally, we propose an importance sampling\nstrategy and a novel approach to model damage propagation for dynamical\nsystems. The methodology is assessed for the FDI and RUL estimation of an\naircraft electromechanical actuator (EMA) for secondary flight controls. The\nresults show that the proposed method allows for a high precision in the\nevaluation of the system RUL, while outperforming common model-based techniques\nin terms of computational time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 12:53:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Berri", "Pier Carlo", ""], ["Vedova", "Matteo D.

The temporal adaptivity scheme is\nrecast under the linear feedback control theory equipped with an error\nestimation that extrapolates the solution obtained from an energy-stable, fully\nimplicit time marching scheme. We test three time step controllers with\ndifferent properties: a simple Integral controller, a complete\nProportional-Integral-Derivative controller, and the PC11 predictive\ncontroller. We assess the performance of the adaptive schemes for the nonlocal\nCahn-Hilliard equation in terms of the number of time steps required for the\ncomplete simulation and the computational effort measured by the required\nnumber of nonlinear and linear solver iterations. We also present numerical\nevidence of mass conservation and free energy decay for simulations with the\nthree different time step controllers. The PC11 predictive controller is the\nbest in all three-dimensional test cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:24:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Barros", "Gabriel F.", ""], ["C\u00f4rtes", "Adriano M.
