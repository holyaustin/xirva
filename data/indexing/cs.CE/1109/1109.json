Data compression and the associated techniques coming from\ninformation theory are often perceived as being of interest for data\ncommunication and storage. In recent years, a substantial effort has been made\nfor the application of textual data compression techniques to various\ncomputational biology tasks, ranging from storage and indexing of large\ndatasets to comparison of genomic databases. This paper presents a differential\ncompression algorithm that is based on production of difference sequences\naccording to op-code table in order to optimize the compression of homologous\nsequences in dataset. Therefore, the stored data are composed of reference\nsequence, the set of differences, and differences locations, instead of storing\neach sequence individually. This algorithm does not require a priori knowledge\nabout the statistics of the sequence set. The algorithm was applied to three\ndifferent datasets of genomic sequences, it achieved up to 195-fold compression\nrate corresponding to 99.4% space saving.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2011 05:39:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Afify", "Heba", ""], ["Islam", "Muhammad", ""], ["Wahed", "Manal Abdel", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0651", "submitter": "Matthew Knepley", "authors": "Jaydeep P.

The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has\nled to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone\nremodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows\nto derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first\ndiagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is\ncurrently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel\ndiagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here\nsimulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)\nnegative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone\nmineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the\npatient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone\nco-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone\ndensity, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes\nand cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations\nof these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for\nother systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are\ndelighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal\nmethods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies.

We focus here on the steps\nnecessary for achieving a true physics-based ability to predict the arrival and\nconsequences of major space weather storms. Great disturbances in the space\nenvironment are common but their precise arrival and impact on human activities\nvaries greatly.

However, most of them are specific to either a\nquantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a\nmass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution).\n  In this context, we have developed MassChroQ, a versatile software that\nperforms LC-MS data alignment and peptide quantification by peak area\nintegration on extracted ion chromatograms. MassChroQ is suitable for\nquantification with or without labelling and is not limited to high resolution\nsystems. Peptides of interest (for example all the identified peptides) can be\ndetermined automatically or manually by providing targeted m/z and retention\ntime values. It can handle large experiments that include protein or peptide\nfractionation (as SDS-PAGE, 2D-LC). It is fully configurable. Every processing\nstep is traceable, the produced data are in open standard format and its\nmodularity allows easy integration into proteomic pipelines. The output results\nare ready for use in statistical analyses.\n  Evaluation of MassChroQ on complex label-free data obtained from low and high\nresolution mass spectrometers showed low CVs for technical reproducibility\n(1.4%) and high coefficients of correlation to protein quantity (0.98).\n  MassChroQ is freely available under the GNU General Public Licence v3.0 at\nhttp://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/masschroq/.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2011 08:52:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Valot", "Beno\u00eet", ""], ["Langella", "Olivier", ""], ["Nano", "Edlira", ""], ["Zivy", "Michel", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5796", "submitter": "Xuan Vinh Nguyen", "authors": "Nguyen Xuan Vinh", "title": "Genetic Testing for Complex Diseases: a Simulation Study Perspective", "comments": "5 pages technical report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.CE q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is widely recognized nowadays that complex diseases are caused by, amongst\nthe others, multiple genetic factors.
