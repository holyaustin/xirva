The problem is non-linear, and therefore\noptimization techniques have been used to find a reasonable solution to the\nproblem. The main problem in fitting the data is the lack of low spatial\nfrequencies. This deficiency often leads to a local minimum and to\nnon-plausible solutions. In this work we explore how to obtain low frequency\ninformation for FWI. Our approach involves augmenting FWI with travel time\ntomography, which has low-frequency features. By jointly inverting these two\nproblems we enrich FWI with information that can replace low frequency data. In\naddition, we use high order regularization, in a preliminary inversion stage,\nto prevent high frequency features from polluting our model in the initial\nstages of the reconstruction. This regularization also promotes the\nnon-dominant low-frequency modes that exist in the FWI sensitivity. By applying\na joint FWI and travel time inversion we are able to obtain a smooth model than\ncan later be used to recover a good approximation for the true model. A second\ncontribution of this paper involves the acceleration of the main computational\nbottleneck in FWI--the solution of the Helmholtz equation.

While the trapezoidal method in SPICE does\nsolve for the Stratonovich solution, its accuracy is limited by the minimum\ntime step of integration in SPICE. We implement the s-LLGS equation in both its\ncartesian and spherical coordinates form in SPICE and compare the stability and\naccuracy of the two implementations. The results in this paper will serve as\nguidelines for researchers to understand the tradeoffs between accuracy and\ncomplexity of various numerical methods and the choice of appropriate calculus\nto solve the s-LLGS equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2016 17:44:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Jul 2016 14:04:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 22:19:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 00:16:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ament", "Sebastian", ""], ["Rangarajan", "Nikhil", ""], ["Parthasarathy", "Arun", ""], ["Rakheja", "Shaloo", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05093", "submitter": "Sumith Yesudasan", "authors": "Sumith Yesudasan and Sibi K.

Solving such equations using finite volumes or\nDiscontinuous Galerkin requires a numerical flux function which solves local\nRiemann problems at cell interfaces. There are various methods to express the\nnumerical flux function. On the one end, there is the robust but very diffusive\nLax-Friedrichs solver; on the other end the upwind Godunov solver which\nrespects all resulting waves. The drawback of the latter method is the costly\ncomputation of the eigensystem.\n  This work presents a family of simple first order Riemann solvers, named\nHLLX$\\omega$, which avoid solving the eigensystem. The new method reproduces\nall waves of the system with less dissipation than other solvers with similar\ninput and effort, such as HLL and FORCE. The family of Riemann solvers can be\nseen as an extension or generalization of the methods introduced by Degond et\nal. \\cite{DegondPeyrardRussoVilledieu1999}. We only require the same number of\ninput values as HLL, namely the globally fastest wave speeds in both\ndirections, or an estimate of the speeds.

Thus, the efficient modeling\nof convoluted search space, the clever use of energy functions, and more\nimportantly, the use of effective sampling algorithms become crucial to address\nthis problem. For protein structure modeling, an off-lattice model provides\nlimited scopes to exercise and evaluate the algorithmic developments due to its\nastronomically large set of data-points. In contrast, an on-lattice model\nwidens the scopes and permits studying the relatively larger proteins because\nof its finite set of data-points. In this work, we took the full advantage of\nan on-lattice model by using a face-centered-cube lattice that has the highest\npacking density with the maximum degree of freedom. We proposed a graded\nenergy-strategically mixes the Miyazawa-Jernigan (MJ) energy with the\nhydrophobic-polar (HP) energy-based genetic algorithm (GA) for conformational\nsearch. In our application, we introduced a 2x2 HP energy guided macro-mutation\noperator within the GA to explore the best possible local changes exhaustively.\nConversely, the 20x20 MJ energy model-the ultimate objective function of our GA\nthat needs to be minimized-considers the impacts amongst the 20 different amino\nacids and allow searching the globally acceptable conformations.
