Stereoisomerism is of great importance in many\ndifferent fields since the molecular properties and biological effects of the\nstereoisomers are often significantly different. Most drugs for example, are\noften composed of a single stereoisomer of a compound, and while one of them\nmay have therapeutic effects on the body, another may be toxic. A challenging\ntask is the automatic detection of stereoisomers using line input\nspecifications such as SMILES or InChI since it requires information about\ngroup theory (to distinguish stereoisomers using mathematical information about\nits symmetry), topology and geometry of the molecule. There are several\nsoftware packages that include modules to handle stereochemistry, especially\nthe ones to name a chemical structure and/or view, edit and generate chemical\nstructure diagrams. However, there is a lack of software capable of\nautomatically analyzing a molecule represented as a graph and generate a\nclassification of the type of isomerism present in a given atom or bond.\nConsidering the importance of stereoisomerism when comparing chemical\nstructures, this report describes a computer program for analyzing and\nprocessing steric information contained in a chemical structure represented as\na molecular graph and providing as output a binary classification of the isomer\ntype based on the recommended conventions.

A first obstacle along this path is to\ndecipher the mechanisms by which protein aggregates are targeted to specific\nintercellular locations. Here, using an integrated approach based on\nindividual-based modeling, time-lapse fluorescence microscopy and automated\nimage analysis, we show that the movement of aging-related protein aggregates\nin E. coli is purely diffusive (Brownian). Using single-particle tracking of\nprotein aggregates in live E. coli cells, we estimated the average size and\ndiffusion constant of the aggregates. Our results evidence that the aggregates\npassively diffuse within the cell, with diffusion constants that depend on\ntheir size in agreement with the Stokes-Einstein law. However, the aggregate\ndisplacements along the cell long axis are confined to a region that roughly\ncorresponds to the nucleoid-free space in the cell pole, thus confirming the\nimportance of increased macromolecular crowding in the nucleoids. We thus used\n3d individual-based modeling to show that these three ingredients (diffusion,\naggregation and diffusion hindrance in the nucleoids) are sufficient and\nnecessary to reproduce the available experimental data on aggregate\nlocalization in the cells. Taken together, our results strongly support the\nhypothesis that the localization of aging-related protein aggregates in the\npoles of E. coli results from the coupling of passive diffusion- aggregation\nwith spatially non-homogeneous macromolecular crowding.

A robust CRT was recently proposed for a\nspecial case when the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the moduli is more\nthan 1 and the remaining integers factorized by the gcd of all the moduli are\nco-prime. In this special case, a closed-form reconstruction from erroneous\nremainders was proposed and a necessary and sufficient condition on the\nremainder errors was obtained. It basically says that the reconstruction error\nis upper bounded by the remainder error level $\\tau$ if $\\tau$ is smaller than\na quarter of the gcd of all the moduli. In this paper, we consider the robust\nreconstruction problem for a general set of moduli. We first present a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the remainder errors for a robust\nreconstruction from erroneous remainders with a general set of muduli and also\na corresponding robust reconstruction method. This can be thought of as a\nsingle stage robust CRT. We then propose a two-stage robust CRT by grouping the\nmoduli into several groups as follows. First, the single stage robust CRT is\napplied to each group. Then, with these robust reconstructions from all the\ngroups, the single stage robust CRT is applied again across the groups. This is\nthen easily generalized to multi-stage robust CRT. Interestingly, with this\ntwo-stage robust CRT, the robust reconstruction holds even when the remainder\nerror level $\\tau$ is above the quarter of the gcd of all the moduli.

The method is based on a\nsurface admittance operator in combination with the method of moments and it\naccurately predicts both skin and proximity effects. Application to a\nthree-phase armored cable with wire screens demonstrates a speed-up by a factor\nof about 100 compared to a finite elements computation. The inclusion of\nproximity effect in combination with the high efficiency makes the new method\nvery attractive for cable modeling within EMTP-type simulation tools.\nCurrently, these tools can only take skin effect into account.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2013 20:18:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2014 16:34:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Patel", "Utkarsh R.", ""], ["Gustavsen", "Bjorn", ""], ["Triverio", "Piero", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6314", "submitter": "Jan Zeman", "authors": "Alena Zemanov\\'a, Jan Zeman, Michal \\v{S}ejnoha", "title": "Numerical model of elastic laminated glass beams under finite strain", "comments": "Moderate revisions; 17 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables", "journal-ref": "Archives of Civil and Mechanical Engineering, 14 (4), 734--744,\n  (2014)", "doi": "10.1016/j.acme.2014.03.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Laminated glass structures are formed by stiff layers of glass connected with\na compliant plastic interlayer. Due to their slenderness and heterogeneity,\nthey exhibit a complex mechanical response that is difficult to capture by\nsingle-layer models even in the elastic range. The purpose of this paper is to\nintroduce an efficient and reliable finite element approach to the simulation\nof the immediate response of laminated glass beams. It proceeds from a refined\nplate theory due to Mau (1973), as we treat each layer independently and\nenforce the compatibility by the Lagrange multipliers. At the layer level, we\nadopt the finite-strain shear deformable formulation of Reissner (1972) and the\nnumerical framework by Ibrahimbegovi\\'{c} and Frey (1993). The resulting system\nis solved by the Newton method with consistent linearization. By comparing the\nmodel predictions against available experimental data, analytical methods and\ntwo-dimensional finite element simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed\nformulation is reliable and provides accuracy comparable to the detailed\ntwo-dimensional finite element analyzes. As such, it offers a convenient basis\nto incorporate more refined constitutive description of the interlayer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 21:12:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 22:43:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zemanov\u00e1", "Alena", ""], ["Zeman", "Jan", ""], ["\u0160ejnoha", "Michal", ""]]}]
