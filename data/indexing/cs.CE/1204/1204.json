Ellipsoidal harmonics are used surprisingly infrequently,\nconsidering their substantial value for problems ranging in scale from\nmolecules to the entire solar system. In this article, we suggest two possible\nreasons for the paucity relative to spherical harmonics. The first is\nessentially historical---ellipsoidal harmonics developed during the late 19th\ncentury and early 20th, when it was found that only the lowest-order harmonics\nare expressible in closed form. Each higher-order term requires the solution of\nan eigenvalue problem, and tedious manual computation seems to have discouraged\napplications and theoretical studies. The second explanation is practical: even\nwith modern computers and accurate eigenvalue algorithms, expansions in\nellipsoidal harmonics are significantly more challenging to compute than those\nin Cartesian or spherical coordinates. The present implementations reduce the\n\"barrier to entry\" by providing an easy and free way for the community to begin\nusing ellipsoidal harmonics in actual research. We demonstrate our\nimplementation using the specific and physiologically crucial problem of how\ncharged proteins interact with their environment, and ask: what other\nanalytical tools await re-discovery in an era of inexpensive computation?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 21:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2012 17:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bardhan", "Jaydeep P.", ""], ["Knepley", "Matthew G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0357", "submitter": "Stefan Bauer", "authors": "Stefan Bauer (1), Lutz-P.

Many different algorithms have been proposed, a summary and\ncomparison of which can be found in [Fennema-Notestine, 2006]. Despite the\nabundance of approaches, we discovered that the algorithms which had been\nsuggested so far, perform poorly when dealing with tumor-bearing brain images.\nThis is mostly due to additional difficulties in separating the brain from the\nskull in this case, especially when the lesion is located very close to the\nskull border. Additionally, images acquired according to standard clinical\nprotocols, often exhibit anisotropic resolution and only partial coverage,\nwhich further complicates the task. Therefore, we developed a method which is\ndedicated to skull-stripping for clinically acquired tumor-bearing brain\nimages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2012 09:48:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Stefan", ""], ["Nolte", "Lutz-P.", ""], ["Reyes", "Mauricio", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.1995", "submitter": "Johannes Wollbold", "authors": "Johannes Wollbold", "title": "Attribute Exploration of Gene Regulatory Processes", "comments": "111 pages, 9 figures, file size 2.1 MB, PhD thesis University of\n  Jena, Germany, Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, 2011.

In such networks, a transmitter\nsends one or more signalling molecules, which are diffused over the medium, to\nthe receiver to realise the communication. In order to be able to engineer\nsynthetic molecular communication networks, mathematical models for these\nnetworks are required. This paper proposes a new stochastic model for molecular\ncommunication networks called reaction-diffusion master equation with exogenous\ninput (RDMEX). The key idea behind RDMEX is to model the transmitters as time\nseries of signalling molecule counts, while diffusion in the medium and\nchemical reactions at the receivers are modelled as Markov processes using\nmaster equation. An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model\nmolecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers. For\nthe case where the reaction kinetics at the receivers is linear, we show how\nRDMEX can be used to determine the mean and covariance of the receiver output\nsignals, and derive closed-form expressions for the mean receiver output signal\nof the RDMEX model. These closed-form expressions reveal that the output signal\nof a receiver can be affected by the presence of other receivers. Numerical\nexamples are provided to demonstrate the properties of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Apr 2012 05:28:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2012 12:50:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2012 04:57:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 11:15:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2013 10:20:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chou", "Chun Tung", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.4366", "submitter": "Michael Robinson", "authors": "Michael Robinson", "title": "Multipath-dominant, pulsed doppler analysis of rotating blades", "comments": "9 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel angular fingerprinting algorithm for detecting changes in\nthe direction of rotation of a target with a monostatic, stationary sonar\nplatform.
