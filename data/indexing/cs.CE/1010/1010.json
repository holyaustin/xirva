The finite automaton is indexed with an extension of\nBurrows-Wheeler transform to allow pattern search inside the plausible\nrecombinant sequences. The size of the index stays limited, because of the high\nsimilarity of individual genomes. The index finds applications in variation\ncalling and in primer design.
