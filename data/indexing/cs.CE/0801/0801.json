On the other\nhand, the Immersed Boundary method is also known to suffer from a severe\ntimestep stability restriction when using an explicit time discretization. In\nthis paper, we propose several efficient semi-implicit schemes to remove this\nstiffness from the Immersed Boundary method for the two-dimensional Stokes\nflow. First, we obtain a novel unconditionally stable semi-implicit\ndiscretization for the immersed boundary problem. Using this unconditionally\nstable discretization as a building block, we derive several efficient\nsemi-implicit schemes for the immersed boundary problem by applying the Small\nScale Decomposition to this unconditionally stable discretization. Our\nstability analysis and extensive numerical experiments show that our\nsemi-implicit schemes offer much better stability property than the explicit\nscheme. Unlike other implicit or semi-implicit schemes proposed in the\nliterature, our semi-implicit schemes can be solved explicitly in the spectral\nspace. Thus the computational cost of our semi-implicit schemes is comparable\nto that of an explicit scheme, but with a much better stability property.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 22:22:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2008 21:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Thomas Y.", ""], ["Shi", "Zuoqiang", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3046", "submitter": "John Stockie", "authors": "Michael Chapwanya, Wentao Liu and John M.
