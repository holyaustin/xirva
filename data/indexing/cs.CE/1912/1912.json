A\nmore sensitive downstream analysis is critical for a better understanding of\nthe genome donor (e.g., health characteristics). Therefore, read sets from\nsequenced samples should ideally be mapped to the latest available reference\ngenome that represents the most relevant population. Unfortunately, the\nincreasingly large amount of available genomic data makes it prohibitively\nexpensive to fully re-map each read set to its respective reference genome\nevery time the reference is updated. There are several tools that attempt to\naccelerate the process of updating a read data set from one reference to\nanother (i.e., remapping).

In these networks, a\nnode usually has a certain chance of default or breakdown due to self-factors\nor the influence from upstream nodes. For regulatory authorities and companies,\nit is critical to efficiently identify the vulnerable nodes, i.e., nodes with\nhigh default risks, such that they could pay more attention to these nodes for\nthe purpose of risk management. In this paper, we propose and investigate the\nproblem of top-$k$ vulnerable nodes detection in uncertain graphs. We formally\ndefine the problem and prove its hardness. To identify the $k$ most vulnerable\nnodes, a sampling-based approach is proposed. Rigorous theoretical analysis is\nconducted to bound the quality of returned results. Novel optimization\ntechniques and a bottom-$k$ sketch based approach are further developed in\norder to scale for large networks. In the experiments, we demonstrate the\nperformance of proposed techniques on 3 real financial networks and 5 benchmark\nnetworks. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods can achieve up\nto 2 orders of magnitudes speedup compared with the baseline approach.\nMoreover, to further verify the advantages of our model in real-life scenarios,\nwe integrate the proposed techniques with our current loan risk control system,\nwhich is deployed in the collaborated bank, for more evaluation.

Continual\nsynchronization between sub-models allows for trajectory predictions with\nsuperior accuracy compared to a single model or a classical ensemble of\nindependent models whose decision fusion is based on the majority voting or\naveraging the outcomes. However, it comes out from numerous observations that\nthe supermodeling procedure's convergence depends on a few principal factors\nsuch as (1) the number of sub-models, (2) their proper selection, and (3) the\nchoice of the convergent optimization procedure, which assimilates the\nsupermodel meta-parameters to data. Herein, we focus on modeling the evolution\nof the system described by a set of PDEs. We prove that supermodeling is\nconditionally convergent to a fixed-point attractor regarding only the\nsupermodel meta-parameters. We investigate the formal conditions of the\nconvergence of the supermodeling scheme theoretically. We employ the Banach\nfixed point theorem for the supermodeling correction operator, updating the\nsynchronization constants' values iteratively. The \"nudging\" of the supermodel\nto the ground truth should be well balanced because both too small and too\nlarge attraction to data cause the supermodel desynchronization. The time-step\nsize can control the convergence of the training procedure, by balancing the\nLipshitz continuity constant of the PDE operator. All the sub-models have to be\nclose to the ground-truth along the training trajectory but still sufficiently\ndiverse to explore the phase space better.
