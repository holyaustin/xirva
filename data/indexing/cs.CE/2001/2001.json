This evolution of bone\ndensity is one of the most important mechanisms for developing fracture\nresistance. A finite element framework for simulating bone adaptation, commonly\ncalled bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed by a novel method to\nboth quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The\nauthors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for\nmodelling fracture is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone\ndensity distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that\nconfigurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed\nexclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for\npost-processing and enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the\nevolving crack front. In this paper density fields are generated from both (a)\nbone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry and material\nproperties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly\nevaluate the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have\na spatially smooth density field with higher regularity than if the field is\ndirectly approximated on the finite element mesh. Therefore, discrete density\ndata is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted Least\nSquares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical\nsimulations for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including\nconsideration of an equine 3rd metacarpal bone. The degree of bone adaption is\nshown to influence both fracture resistance and the resulting crack path.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 22:09:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lewandowski", "Karol", ""], ["Kaczmarczyk", "\u0141ukasz", ""], ["Athanasiadis", "Ignatios", ""], ["Marshall", "John F.", ""], ["Pearce", "Chris J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.01022", "submitter": "Hyoung Suk Suh", "authors": "Hyoung Suk Suh, WaiChing Sun, Devin O'Connor", "title": "A phase field model for cohesive fracture in micropolar continua", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.cma.2020.113181", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  While crack nucleation and propagation in the brittle or quasi-brittle regime\ncan be predicted via variational or material-force-based phase field fracture\nmodels, these models often assume that the underlying elastic response of the\nmaterial is non-polar and yet a length scale parameter must be introduced to\nenable the sharp cracks represented by a regularized implicit function.\nHowever, many materials with internal microstructures that contain surface\ntension, micro-cracks, micro-fracture, inclusion, cavity or those of\nparticulate nature often exhibit size-dependent behaviors in both the\npath-independent and path-dependent regimes.

A characteristic feature of these simulations is that the\nproblem domain is simple (typically a rectilinear representative volume element\n(RVE)), but the evolution of internal topological features is extremely\ncomplex. Traditionally, the finite element method (FEM) is used for elasticity\ncalculations; FEM is nearly ubiquituous due to (1) its ability to handle meshes\nof complex geometry using isoparametric elements, and (2) the weak formulation\nwhich eschews the need for computation of second derivatives.

These were previously used in the PDE-constrained optimization. The\npresented methodology is suitable for high-performance architectures due to\ninherent parallelism in the adjoint method during the gradient evaluation,\nsince the individual contingency scenarios are modeled by independent set of\nthe constraints. Preliminary evaluation of the performance and convergence is\nperformed to study the reduced space approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 13:26:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kardos", "Juraj", ""], ["Kourounis", "Drosos", ""], ["Schenk", "Olaf", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11806", "submitter": "Martin Bauer", "authors": "Martin Bauer, Harald K\\\"ostler, Ulrich R\\\"ude", "title": "lbmpy: Automatic code generation for efficient parallel lattice\n  Boltzmann methods", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Lattice Boltzmann methods are a popular mesoscopic alternative to macroscopic\ncomputational fluid dynamics solvers. Many variants have been developed that\nvary in complexity, accuracy, and computational cost. Extensions are available\nto simulate multi-phase, multi-component, turbulent, or non-Newtonian flows. In\nthis work we present lbmpy, a code generation package that supports a wide\nvariety of different methods and provides a generic development environment for\nnew schemes as well. A high-level domain-specific language allows the user to\nformulate, extend and test various lattice Boltzmann schemes. The method\nspecification is represented in a symbolic intermediate representation.\nTransformations that operate on this intermediate representation optimize and\nparallelize the method, yielding highly efficient lattice Boltzmann compute\nkernels not only for single- and two-relaxation-time schemes but also for\nmulti-relaxation-time, cumulant, and entropically stabilized methods. An\nintegration into the HPC framework waLBerla makes massively parallel,\ndistributed simulations possible, which is demonstrated through scaling\nexperiments on the SuperMUC-NG supercomputing system\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 13:00:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 09:09:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Martin", ""], ["K\u00f6stler", "Harald", ""], ["R\u00fcde", "Ulrich", ""]]}]
