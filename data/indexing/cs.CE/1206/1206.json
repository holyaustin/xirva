Unlike the traditional web\nads, the advertiser's profits for group-buying ads depends on the time to\nexpiry and additional customers needed to satisfy the minimum group size. Since\nboth these quantities are time-dependent, optimal bid amounts to maximize\nprofits change with every impression. Consequently, traditional static bidding\nstrategies are far from optimal. Instead, bid values need to be optimized in\nreal-time to maximize expected bidder profits. This online optimization of deal\nprofits is made possible by the advent of ad exchanges offering real-time\n(spot) bidding. To this end, we propose a real-time bidding strategy for\ngroup-buying deals based on the online optimization of bid values. We derive\nthe expected bidder profit of deals as a function of the bid amounts, and\ndynamically vary bids to maximize profits. Further, to satisfy time constraints\nof the online bidding, we present methods of minimizing computation timings.\nSubsequently, we derive the real time ad selection, admissibility, and real\ntime bidding of the traditional ads as the special cases of the proposed\nmethod. We evaluate the proposed bidding, selection and admission strategies on\na multi-million click stream of 935 ads. The proposed real-time bidding,\nselection and admissibility show significant profit increases over the existing\nstrategies. Further the experiments illustrate the robustness of the bidding\nand acceptable computation timings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 17:25:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Balakrishnan", "Raju", ""], ["Bhatt", "Rushi P", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0638", "submitter": "Amani Tahat", "authors": "Amani Tahat, Jordi Marti and Mohammad Tahat", "title": "WM Program manual", "comments": "63 pages,19 figures,one appendix", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This user manual has been written to describe the open source code WM to be\ndistributed associated with a research article submitted to the information\ntechnology journal 45001-ITJ-ANSI, entitled: \"Maintenance and Reengineering of\nsoftware: Creating a Visual C++ Graphical User Interface to Perform Specific\nTasks Related to Soil Structure Interaction in Poroelastic Soil\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 14:51:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2012 16:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tahat", "Amani", ""], ["Marti", "Jordi", ""], ["Tahat", "Mohammad", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.1305", "submitter": "Massimiliano Vasile", "authors": "Massimiliano Vasile, Federico Zuiani", "title": "MACS: An Agent-Based Memetic Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm\n  Applied to Space Trajectory Design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part G:\n  Journal of Aerospace Engineering September 5, 2011 0954410011410274", "doi": "10.1177/0954410011410274", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NE math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an algorithm for multiobjective optimization that blends\ntogether a number of heuristics.
