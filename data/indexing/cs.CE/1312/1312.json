One of the key obstacles to the effective use of this\ntechnology is the difficulty in interpreting measured spectra to accurately and\nefficiently identify metabolites. Traditional methods for automated metabolite\nidentification compare the target MS or MS/MS spectrum to the spectra in a\nreference database, ranking candidates based on the closeness of the match.\nHowever the limited coverage of available databases has led to an interest in\ncomputational methods for predicting reference MS/MS spectra from chemical\nstructures.\n  This work proposes a probabilistic generative model for the MS/MS\nfragmentation process, which we call Competitive Fragmentation Modeling (CFM),\nand a machine learning approach for learning parameters for this model from\nMS/MS data. We show that CFM can be used in both a MS/MS spectrum prediction\ntask (ie, predicting the mass spectrum from a chemical structure), and in a\nputative metabolite identification task (ranking possible structures for a\ntarget MS/MS spectrum).\n  In the MS/MS spectrum prediction task, CFM shows significantly improved\nperformance when compared to a full enumeration of all peaks corresponding to\nsubstructures of the molecule. In the metabolite identification task, CFM\nobtains substantially better rankings for the correct candidate than existing\nmethods (MetFrag and FingerID) on tripeptide and metabolite data, when querying\nPubChem or KEGG for candidate structures of similar mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Dec 2013 19:20:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 23:22:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 15:30:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Allen", "F.", ""], ["Greiner", "R.", ""], ["Wishart", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0465", "submitter": "Jennifer Warrender BSc MSc", "authors": "Jennifer D.
