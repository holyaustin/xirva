Time domain full waveform inversion\n(TD-FWI) is a promising UST image formation technique that fits the parameter\nfields of a wave physics model by gradient-based optimization. For high\nresolution 3D UST, it holds three key challenges: Firstly, its central building\nblock, the computation of the gradient for a single US measurement, has a\nrestrictively large memory footprint. Secondly, this building block needs to be\ncomputed for each of the $10^3-10^4$ measurements, resulting in a massive\nparallel computation usually performed on large computational clusters for\ndays. Lastly, the structure of the underlying optimization problem may result\nin slow progression of the solver and convergence to a local minimum. In this\nwork, we design and evaluate a comprehensive computational strategy to overcome\nthese challenges: Firstly, we introduce a novel gradient computation based on\ntime reversal that dramatically reduces the memory footprint at the expense of\none additional wave simulation per source. Secondly, we break the dependence on\nthe number of measurements by using source encoding (SE) to compute stochastic\ngradient estimates. Also we describe a more accurate, TD-specific SE technique\nwith a finer variance control and use a state-of-the-art stochastic LBFGS\nmethod. Lastly, we design an efficient TD multi-grid scheme together with\npreconditioning to speed up the convergence while avoiding local minima.
