Here, we propose two simple\nmethods for incorporating information about the hierarchical nature of the\ncategorization scheme.

Taylor's power\nlaw (Taylor 1961: Nature, 189:732-) is well recognized as one of the\nfundamental models in population ecology. A fundamental property of biological\npopulations, which Taylor's power law reveals, is the near universal\nheterogeneity of population abundance distribution in habitat. Obviously, the\nheterogeneity also exists at the community level, where not only the\ndistributions of population abundances but also the proportions of the species\ncomposition in the community are often heterogeneous. Nevertheless, existing\ncommunity diversity indexes such as Shannon index and Simpson index can only\nmeasure \"local\" or \"static\" diversity in the sense that they are computed for\neach habitat at a specific time point, and the indexes alone do not reflect the\ndiversity changes. In this note, I propose to extend the application scope of\nTaylor's power law to the studies of human microbial communities, specifically,\nthe community heterogeneity at both population and community levels. I further\nsuggested that population dispersion models such as Taylor (1980: Nature, 286,\n53-), which is known to generate population distribution patterns consistent\nwith the power law, should also be very useful for analyzing the distribution\npatterns of human microbes within the human body. Overall, I hope that the\napproach to human microbial community with the power law offers an example that\necological theories can play an important role in the emerging medical ecology,\nwhich aims at studying the ecology of human microbiome and its implications to\nhuman diseases and health, as well as in personalized medicine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2012 20:26:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Zhanshan Sam", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.3506", "submitter": "Eric Phipps", "authors": "Eric Phipps and Roger Pawlowski", "title": "Efficient Expression Templates for Operator Overloading-based Automatic\n  Differentiation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Expression templates are a well-known set of techniques for improving the\nefficiency of operator overloading-based forward mode automatic differentiation\nschemes in the C++ programming language by translating the differentiation from\nindividual operators to whole expressions.

Although progress has been recently made in the identification of\nvarious concurring factors influencing nucleosome positioning, it is still\nunclear whether nucleosome positions are sequence dictated or determined by a\nrandom process. It has been postulated for a long time that,in the proximity of\nTSS, a barrier determines the position of the +1 nucleosome and then geometric\nconstraints alter the random positioning process determining nucleosomal\nphasing. Such a pattern fades out as one moves away from the barrier to become\nagain a random positioning process.

Moreover,we are\nfar from the identification of a set of sequence rules able:to account for the\ngenome-wide nucleosome organization;to explain the nature of the barriers on\nwhich the statistical mechanism hinges;to allow for a smooth transition from\nsequence-dictated to statistical positioning and back. We show that sequence\ncomplexity,quantified via various methods, can be the rule able to at least\npartially account for all the above.In particular, we have conducted our\nanalyses on 4 high resolution nucleosomal maps of the model eukaryotes and\nfound that nucleosome depleted regions can be well distinguished from\nnucleosome enriched regions by sequence complexity measures.In particular, (a)\nthe depleted regions are less complex than the enriched ones, (b) around TSS\ncomplexity measures alone are in striking agreement with in vivo nucleosome\noccupancy,in particular precisely indicating the positions of the +1 and -1\nnucleosomes.
