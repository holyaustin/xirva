Twenty years ago Stewart published the first consistent\ntheory with purely inelastic impacts and an impulsive friction model analogous\nto Coulomb friction. In this paper we demonstrate that the consistent impact\nmodel can exhibit multiple solutions with a varying degree of dissipation even\nin the single-contact case. Replacing the impulsive friction model based on\nCoulomb friction by a model based on the maximum dissipation principle resolves\nthe non-uniqueness in the single-contact impact problem. The paper constructs\nthe alternative impact model and presents integral equations describing\nrigid-body dynamics with a non-impulsive and non-compliant contact model and an\nassociated purely inelastic impact model maximizing dissipation. An analytic\nsolution is derived for the single-contact impact problem. The models are then\nembedded into a time-stepping scheme. The macroscopic behaviour is compared to\nCoulomb friction in a large-scale granular flow problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 09:15:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Preclik", "Tobias", ""], ["Eibl", "Sebastian", ""], ["R\u00fcde", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00676", "submitter": "Mustafa Mohamad", "authors": "Han Kyul Joo, Mustafa A.

A stochastic dynamic programming model maximizing expected final capital\nincrement is formulated to solve the problem to optimality. We then investigate\nthe performance of four controlling policies: ($R, Q$), ($R, S$), ($s, S$) and\n($s$, $\\overline{Q}$, $S$); for these policies, we adopt simulation-genetic\nalgorithm to obtain approximate values of the controlling parameters. Finally,\na simulation-optimization heuristic is also employed to solve this problem.\nComputational comparisons among these approaches show that policy $(s, S)$ and\npolicy $(s, \\overline{Q}, S)$ provide performance close to that of optimal\nsolutions obtained by stochastic dynamic programming, while\nsimulation-optimization heuristic offers advantages in terms of computational\nefficiency. Our numerical tests also show that capital availability as well as\nbusiness overdraft interest rate can substantially affect the retailer's\noptimal lot sizing decisions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Jun 2017 14:38:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Zhen", ""], ["Rossi", "Roberto", ""], ["Zhang", "Ren-qian", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05748", "submitter": "Sebastian Sch\\\"ops", "authors": "Marius Klimek and Stefan Kurz and Sebastian Sch\\\"ops and Thomas\n  Weiland", "title": "A Space-Time Approach for the Time-Domain Simulation in a Rotating\n  Reference Frame", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We approach the discretisation of Maxwell's equations directly in space-time\nwithout making any non-relativistic assumptions with the particular focus on\nsimulations in rotating reference frames.

The basic concept of\nthe displacement version of the reduced Trefftz method operates on the natural\nboundary conditions enforced in an integral form whereas the stress version of\nthe reduced Trefftz type approach operates on the essential boundary conditions\nenforced in an integral sense. The application of the method proposed in the\nframework of the finite element method is briefly outlined. The methods used by\nthe reduced Trefftz type approach for enforcing conformity and interelement\ncontinuity between neighboured elements are also discussed. Comparisons with\nother known methods for the same purpose are performed. General strategy for\ndeveloping finite elements of general geometric form such as quadrilateral\nelements with invariance properties is presented. The basic idea of this\nstrategy consists in using the natural coordinate system only for defining the\nelement geometry and performing the element integration in the biunit interval.\nFor defining the approximation functions a local coordinate system defined from\nthe directions of the covariant base vectors and the perpendicular\ncontravariant base vectors computed in the geometric centre of the element is\nused. This strategy can also be used to implement other versions of finite\nelements and other forms of finite elements. Different numerical calculations\nand comparisons in the linear statics and kinetics are performed in order to\nassess the convergence and the numerical performance of finite elements\ndeveloped by applying the reduced Trefftz type approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 13:16:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Diab", "Sulaiman Abo", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.08324", "submitter": "Eleonora Alfinito Dr.", "authors": "R.
