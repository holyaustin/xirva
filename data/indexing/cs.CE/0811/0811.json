Moreover, to control flexibly the\nsize and the coherence of the compressive sensing filter, as an example, the\nmicrostrip filter based on defected ground structure (DGS) has been employed to\nrealize the compressive sensing filter. Of course, the compressive sensing\nfilter also can be constructed along the identical idea by many other\nstructures, for example, the man-made electromagnetic materials, the plasma\nwith different electron density, and so on. By the proposed architecture, the\nn-dimensional signals of S-sparse in arbitrary orthogonal frame can be exactly\nreconstructed with measurements on the order of Slog(n) with overwhelming\nprobability, which is consistent with the bonds estimated by theoretical\nanalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2008 08:33:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Lianlin", ""], ["Zhang", "Wenji", ""], ["Xiang", "Yin", ""], ["Li", "Fang", ""]]}]
