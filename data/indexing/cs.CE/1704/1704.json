Energy disaggregation can be formulated as a source\nseparation problem where the aggregated signal is expressed as linear\ncombination of basis vectors in a matrix factorization framework. In this\npaper, an approach based on Sum-to-k constrained Non-negative Matrix\nFactorization (S2K-NMF) is proposed. By imposing the sum-to-k constraint and\nthe non-negative constraint, S2K-NMF is able to effectively extract\nperceptually meaningful sources from complex mixtures. The strength of the\nproposed algorithm is demonstrated through two sets of experiments: Energy\ndisaggregation in a residential smart home, and HVAC components energy\nmonitoring in an industrial building testbed maintained at the Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory (ORNL). Extensive experimental results demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of S2K-NMF as compared to state-of-the-art\ndecomposition-based disaggregation algorithms.

The\ntechnique overcomes some of the cost limitations of turbulence simulation,\nsince the main flow is treated with a coarse-grid LES, with the equivalent of\nwall functions supplied by the near-wall sampled QDNS. Two cases are tested, at\nfriction Reynolds number Re$_\\tau$=4200 and 20,000. The total grid node count\nfor the first case is less than half a million and less than two million for\nthe second case, with the calculations only requiring a desktop computer. A\ngood agreement with published DNS is found at Re$_\\tau$=4200, both in terms of\nthe mean velocity profile and the streamwise velocity fluctuation statistics,\nwhich correctly show a substantial increase in near-wall turbulence levels due\nto a modulation of near-wall streaks by large-scale structures. The trend\ncontinues at Re$_\\tau$=20,000, in agreement with experiment, which represents\none of the major achievements of the new approach. A number of detailed aspects\nof the model, including numerical resolution, LES-QDNS coupling strategy and\nsub-grid model are explored. A low level of grid sensitivity is demonstrated\nfor both the QDNS and LES aspects. Since the method does not assume a law of\nthe wall, it can in principle be applied to flows that are out of equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 22:31:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sandham", "Neil D.", ""], ["Johnstone", "Roderick", ""], ["Jacobs", "Christian T.", ""]]}]
