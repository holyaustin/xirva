Methods: This new approach for\nsource analysis does not use a geometry conforming volume triangulation, but\ninstead uses a structured mesh that does not resolve the geometry. The geometry\nis described using level set functions and is incorporated implicitly in its\nmathematical formulation. As no triangulation is necessary, the complexity of a\nsimulation pipeline and the need for manual interaction for patient specific\nsimulations can be reduced and is comparable with that of the FEM for\nhexahedral meshes. In addition, it maintains conservation laws on a discrete\nlevel. Here, we present the theory for UDG-FEM forward modeling, its\nverification using quasi-analytical solutions in multi-layer sphere models and\nan evaluation in a comparison with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG-FEM) method on\nhexahedral and on conforming tetrahedral meshes. We furthermore apply the\nUDG-FEM forward approach in a realistic head model simulation study. Results:\nThe given results show convergence and indicate a good overall accuracy of the\nUDG-FEM approach. UDG-FEM performs comparable or even better than DG-FEM on a\nconforming tetrahedral mesh while providing a less complex simulation pipeline.\nWhen compared to DG-FEM on hexahedral meshes, an overall better accuracy is\nachieved.

Numerical models have\ncontributed significantly towards this understanding, and more recently,\nadjoint-based modelling has been employed to optimise the positioning of the\nturbines in an array in an automated way and improve on simple, regular\nman-made configurations. Adjoint-based optimisation of high-resolution and\nideally 3D transient models is generally a very computationally expensive\nproblem. As a result, existing work on the adjoint optimisation of tidal\nturbine placement has been mostly limited to steady-state simulations in which\nvery high, non-physical values of the background viscosity are required to\nensure that a steady-state solution exists. However, such compromises may\naffect the reliability of the modelled turbines, their wakes and interactions,\nand thus bring into question the validity of the computed optimal turbine\npositions. This work considers a suite of idealised simulations of flow past\ntidal turbine arrays in a 2D channel. It compares four regular array\nconfigurations, detailed by Divett et al. (2013), with the configuration found\nthrough adjoint optimisation in a steady-state, high-viscosity setup. The\noptimised configuration produces considerably more power. The same\nconfigurations are then used to produce a suite of transient simulations that\ndo not use constant high-viscosity, and instead use large eddy simulation (LES)\nto parameterise the resulting turbulent structures. It is shown that the LES\nsimulations produce less power than that predicted by the constant\nhigh-viscosity runs. Nevertheless, they still follow the same trends in the\npower curve throughout time, with optimised layouts continuing to perform\nsignificantly better than simplified configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 13:15:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jacobs", "Christian T.", ""], ["Piggott", "Matthew D.", ""], ["Kramer", "Stephan C.", ""], ["Funke", "Simon W.", ""]]}]
