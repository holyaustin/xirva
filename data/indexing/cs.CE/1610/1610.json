The local form of the first\nlaw of thermodynamics provides a condition for equilibrium of the crack front.\nThe direction of the crack propagation is shown to be given by the direction of\nthe configurational forces on the crack front that maximise the local\ndissipation. The evolving crack front is continuously resolved by the finite\nelement mesh, without the need for face splitting or the use of enrichment\ntechniques. A monolithic solution strategy is adopted, solving simultaneously\nfor both the material displacements (i.e. crack extension) and the spatial\ndisplacements, is adopted. In order to trace the dissipative loading path, an\narc-length procedure is developed that controls the incremental crack area\ngrowth. In order to maintain mesh quality, smoothing of the mesh is undertaken\nas a continuous process, together with face flipping, node merging and edge\nsplitting where necessary. Hierarchical basis functions of arbitrary polynomial\norder are adopted to increase the order of approximation without the need to\nchange the finite element mesh.

Using a very fine\nmesh for the discretization of this setting leads to the necessity to solve a\nlarge system of equations that is often difficult to deal with.

In this framework, static derivatives\nemerge as natural extensions to modal derivatives for displacement fields other\nthan the vibration modes, such as the Krylov subspace vectors. Here the dynamic\nproblem is projected onto the tangent space of the quadratic manifold, allowing\nfor a much less number of generalized coordinates compared to linear basis\nmethods. The potential of the quadratic manifold approach is investigated in a\nnumerical study, where several variations of the approach are compared on\ndifferent examples, indicating a clear pattern where the proposed approach is\napplicable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 13:13:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Rutzmoser", "J.
