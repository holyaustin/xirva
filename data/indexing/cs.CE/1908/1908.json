High-dimensional optimal\nstopping problems are, however, notoriously difficult to solve due to the\nwell-known curse of dimensionality. In this work we propose an algorithm for\nsolving such problems, which is based on deep learning and computes, in the\ncontext of early exercise option pricing, both approximations for an optimal\nexercise strategy and the price of the considered option. The proposed\nalgorithm can also be applied to optimal stopping problems that arise in other\nareas where the underlying stochastic process can be efficiently simulated. We\npresent numerical results for a large number of example problems, which include\nthe pricing of many high-dimensional American and Bermudan options such as, for\nexample, Bermudan max-call options in up to 5000 dimensions. Most of the\nobtained results are compared to reference values computed by exploiting the\nspecific problem design or, where available, to reference values from the\nliterature. These numerical results suggest that the proposed algorithm is\nhighly effective in the case of many underlyings, in terms of both accuracy and\nspeed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2019 13:11:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Aug 2019 12:36:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Becker", "Sebastian", ""], ["Cheridito", "Patrick", ""], ["Jentzen", "Arnulf", ""], ["Welti", "Timo", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.01719", "submitter": "Van-Dang Nguyen", "authors": "Van-Dang Nguyen, Massimiliano Leoni, Tamara Dancheva, Johan Jansson,\n  Johan Hoffman, Demian Wassermann, Jing-Rebecca Li", "title": "Portable simulation framework for diffusion MRI", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jmr.2019.106611", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The numerical simulation of the diffusion MRI signal arising from complex\ntissue micro-structures is helpful for understanding and interpreting imaging\ndata as well as for designing and optimizing MRI sequences. The discretization\nof the Bloch-Torrey equation by finite elements is a more recently developed\napproach for this purpose, in contrast to random walk simulations, which has a\nlonger history. While finite elements discretization is more difficult to\nimplement than random walk simulations, the approach benefits from a long\nhistory of theoretical and numerical developments by the mathematical and\nengineering communities. In particular, software packages for the automated\nsolutions of partial differential equations using finite elements\ndiscretization, such as FEniCS, are undergoing active support and development.\nHowever, because diffusion MRI simulation is a relatively new application area,\nthere is still a gap between the simulation needs of the MRI community and the\navailable tools provided by finite elements software packages. In this paper,\nwe address two potential difficulties in using FEniCS for diffusion MRI\nsimulation. First, we simplified software installation by the use of FEniCS\ncontainers that are completely portable across multiple platforms. Second, we\nprovide a portable simulation framework based on Python and whose code is open\nsource.

This task is difficult when f is the output of an\nexpensive-to-evaluate numerical simulator and the number of CAD parameters is\nlarge. Most often, the set of all considered CAD shapes resides in a manifold\nof lower effective dimension in which it is preferable to build the surrogate\nmodel and perform the optimization. In this work, we uncover the manifold\nthrough a high-dimensional shape mapping and build a new coordinate system made\nof eigenshapes. The surrogate model is learned in the space of eigenshapes: a\nregularized likelihood maximization provides the most relevant dimensions for\nthe output. The final surrogate model is detailed (anisotropic) with respect to\nthe most sensitive eigenshapes and rough (isotropic) in the remaining\ndimensions. Last, the optimization is carried out with a focus on the critical\ndimensions, the remaining ones being coarsely optimized through a random\nembedding and the manifold being accounted for through a replication strategy.\nAt low budgets, the methodology leads to a more accurate model and a faster\noptimization than the classical approach of directly working with the CAD\nparameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Aug 2019 14:58:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2021 06:48:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gaudrie", "David", ""], ["Riche", "Rodolphe Le", ""], ["Picheny", "Victor", ""], ["Enaux", "Benoit", ""], ["Herbert", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.11346", "submitter": "Murwan Siddig", "authors": "Murwan Siddig, Yongjia Song", "title": "Adaptive Partition-based SDDP Algorithms for Multistage Stochastic\n  Linear Programming", "comments": "27 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we extend the adaptive partition-based approach for solving\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with fixed recourse to the multistage stochastic\nprogramming setting.
