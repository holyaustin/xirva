It is conclusive that\nflies could contribute a certain amount of neuromatrices indicating an imagery\nfunction of a visual-computational system into computer graphics and storage\nsystems. The visual system involves the time aspect, whereas flies possess\nfaster pulses compared to humans' visual ability due to the E-field state on an\nactive fly's eye surface. This behaviour can be tested on a dissected fly\nspecimen at its ommatidia. Electro-optical contacts and electrodes are wired\nthrough the flesh forming organic emitter layer to stimulate light emission,\nthereby to a computer circuit. The next step is applying a threshold voltage\nwith secondary voltages to the circuit denoting an array of essential\nelectrodes for bit switch. As a result, circuit's dormant pulses versus active\npulses at the specimen's area are recorded. The outcome matrix possesses a\nconstruction of RGB and time radicals expressing the time problem in\nconsumption, allocating time into computational algorithms, enhancing the\ntechnology far beyond. The obtained formulation generates consumed distance\ncons(x), denoting circuital travel between data source/sink for pixel data and\nbendable wavelengths.

Water molecules in the gas phase selectively absorb T-rays at\ndiscrete frequencies corresponding to their molecular rotational transitions.\nThis results in prominent resonances spread over the T-ray spectrum, and in the\ntime domain the T-ray signal is observed as fluctuations after the main pulse.\nThese effects are generally undesired, since they may mask critical\nspectroscopic data. So, ambient water vapor is commonly removed from the T-ray\npath by using a closed chamber during the measurement. Yet, in some\napplications a closed chamber is not applicable. This situation, therefore,\nmotivates the need for another method to reduce these unwanted artifacts. This\npaper presents a study on a computational means to address the problem.\nInitially, a complex frequency response of water vapor is modeled from a\nspectroscopic catalog. Using a deconvolution technique, together with fine\ntuning of the strength of each resonance, parts of the water-vapor response are\nremoved from a measured T-ray signal, with minimal signal distortion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2007 02:17:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Withayachumnankul", "Withawat", ""], ["Fischer", "Bernd M.", ""], ["Mickan", "Samuel P.", ""], ["Abbott", "Derek", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4486", "submitter": "Michel Fliess", "authors": "Michel Fliess (INRIA Futurs), C\\'edric Join (INRIA Futurs, CRAN),\n  Hebertt Sira-Ramirez", "title": "Non-linear estimation is easy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Int.

Depending on the population sample in\nquestion, their relative performance can vary greatly, and it is unclear which\nmethod to choose for a particular sample. Instead of choosing a single method,\nwe explore combining predictions returned by different methods in a principled\nway, and thereby circumvent the problem of method selection.\n  We propose several techniques for combining haplotype reconstructions and\nanalyze their computational properties. In an experimental study on real-world\nhaplotype data we show that such techniques can provide more accurate and\nrobust reconstructions, and are useful for outlier detection.
