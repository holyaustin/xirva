Current methods of continuous measurement of blood\npressure are either invasive and/or require expensive equipment. Therefore, we\ninvestigated a new method for the continuous estimation of two main features of\nblood pressure waveform: systolic and diastolic pressures. The estimates were\nobtained from a photoplethysmography signal as input to the fifth order\nautoregressive moving average models. The performance of the method was\nevaluated using beat-to-beat full-wave blood pressure measurements from 15\nyoung subjects, with no known cardiovascular disorder, in supine position as\nthey breathed normally and also while they performed a breath-hold maneuver.\nThe level of error in the estimates, as measured by the root mean square of the\nmodel residuals, was less than 5 mmHg during normal breathing and less than 8\nmmHg during the breath-hold maneuver. The mean of model residuals both during\nnormal breathing and breath-hold maneuvers was considered to be less than 3.2\nmmHg. The dependency of the accuracy of the estimates on the subject data was\nassessed by comparing the modeling errors for the 15 subjects. Less than 1% of\nthe models showed significant differences (p < 0.05) from the other models,\nwhich indicates a high level of consistency among the models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2018 20:08:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zadi", "Armin Soltan", ""], ["Alex", "Raichel", ""], ["Zhang", "Rong", ""], ["Watenpaugh", "Donald E.", ""], ["Behbehani", "Khosrow", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06184", "submitter": "Ali Khodabakhsh", "authors": "Ali Khodabakhsh, Orestis Papadigenopoulos, Jannik Matuschke, Jimmy\n  Horn, Evdokia Nikolova, Emmanouil Pountourakis", "title": "Electric Vehicle Valet", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a novel way to use Electric Vehicles (EVs) as dynamic mobile\nenergy storage with the goal to support grid balancing during peak load times.\nEVs seeking parking in a busy/expensive inner city area, can get free parking\nwith a valet company in exchange for being utilized for grid support.

Many studies based on\nevolutionary game theory have tried to solve the puzzle and figure out the\nreason why cooperation exists and how it emerges. Network reciprocity is one of\nthe mechanisms to promote cooperation, where nodes refer to individuals and\nlinks refer to social relationships. The spatial arrangement of mutant\nindividuals, which refers to the clustering of mutants, plays a key role in\nnetwork reciprocity. Besides, many other mechanisms supporting cooperation\nsuggest that the clustering of mutants plays an important role in the expansion\nof mutants. However, the clustering of mutants and the game dynamics are\ntypically coupled. It is still unclear how the clustering of mutants alone\nalters the evolutionary dynamics. To this end, we employ a minimal model with\nfrequency independent fitness on a circle. It disentangles the clustering of\nmutants from game dynamics. The distance between two mutants on the circle is\nadopted as a natural indicator for the clustering of mutants or assortment. We\nfind that the assortment is an amplifier of the selection for the connected\nmutants compared with the separated ones. Nevertheless, as mutants are\nseparated, the more dispersed mutants are, the greater the chance of invasion\nis. It gives rise to the non-monotonic effect of clustering, which is\ncounterintuitive.

In this paper, a mathematical model for In Situ Combustion is\nproposed, which takes full consideration for related physical phenomena,\nincluding multi-dimensional multi-component three-phase flow, heat convection\nand conduction, chemical reactions, and mass transfer between phases. In the\nmathematical model, different governing equations and constraints are involved,\nforming a complicated PDE (partial differential equation) system.

The problem is\nthen formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model, in which\nconstraints are derived from a careful analysis of the interdependency between\nfeasible time intervals that are eligible for observations. We apply the\nproposed model to several different problem instances that reflect real-world\nsituations.
