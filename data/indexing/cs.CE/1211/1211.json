The Artificial Bee Colony or ABC is one of the recent additions to the\nclass of swarm intelligence based algorithms that mimics the foraging behavior\nof honey bees. ABC consists of three groups of bees namely employed, onlooker\nand scout bees. In ABC, the food locations represent the potential candidate\nsolution. In the present study an attempt is made to generate the population of\nfood sources (Colony Size) adaptively and the variant is named as A-ABC. A-ABC\nis further enhanced to improve convergence speed and exploitation capability,\nby employing the concept of elitism, which guides the bees towards the best\nfood source. This enhanced variant is called E-ABC. The proposed algorithms are\nvalidated on a set of standard benchmark problems with varying dimensions taken\nfrom literature and on five engineering design problems. The numerical results\nare compared with the basic ABC and three recent variant of ABC.

We performed structural\nanalysis on a linker probable region (LPR) around domain boundary points of\nknown SCOP domains. The LPR was described using a set of overlapping peptide\nfragments of fixed size. Each peptide fragment was then described by geometric\ninvariants (GIs) and subjected to clustering process where the fragments\ncorresponding to actual linker come up as outliers. We then discover the actual\nlinkers by finding the longest continuous stretch of outlier fragments from\nLPRs. This method was evaluated on a benchmark dataset of 51 continuous\nmulti-domain proteins, where it achieves F1 score of 0.745 (0.83 precision and\n0.66 recall). When the method was applied on 725 continuous multi-domain\nproteins, it was able to identify novel linkers that were not reported\npreviously.
