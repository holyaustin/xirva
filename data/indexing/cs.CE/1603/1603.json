This work\ndemonstrates that the problem may be overcome with the use of a dedicated\nreconstruction method that further allows for T2 quantification by extracting\nthe embedded relaxation information. Thus, the proposed reconstruction method\ndirectly yields a spin-density and relaxivity map from only a single radial\ndata set. The method is based on an inverse formulation of the problem and\ninvolves a modeling of the received MRI signal. Because the solution is found\nby numerical optimization, the approach exploits all data acquired. Further, it\nhandles multi-coil data and optionally allows for the incorporation of\nadditional prior knowledge. Simulations and experimental results for a phantom\nand human brain in vivo demonstrate that the method yields spin-density and\nrelaxivity maps that are neither affected by the typical artifacts from TE\nmixing, nor by streaking artifacts from the incomplete k-space coverage at\nindividual echo times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 21:10:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Block", "Kai Tobias", ""], ["Uecker", "Martin", ""], ["Frahm", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00546", "submitter": "Jan Egger", "authors": "Jan Egger, Philip Voglreiter, Mark Dokter, Michael Hofmann, Xiaojun\n  Chen, Wolfram G.

The algorithm has been\ndeveloped and tested hand-in-hand by physicians and computer scientists to make\nsure a future practical usage in a clinical setting is feasible. To cover\ntypical acquisitions from the clinical routine, the approach has been evaluated\nwith dozens of datasets where the tumors are hyperechoic (brighter), hypoechoic\n(darker) or isoechoic (similar) in comparison to the surrounding liver tissue.\nDue to the interactive real-time behavior of the approach, it was possible even\nin difficult cases to find satisfying segmentations of the tumors within\nseconds and without parameter settings, and the average tumor deviation was\nonly 1.4mm compared with manual measurements.

Nevertheless, thanks to the recent development of additive layer\nmanufacturing techniques (3D printing), complex structures usually impossible\nto design with conventional manufacturing techniques can be constructed with a\nlow cost, allowing notably to build porous or foam-type structures for fuel\ncells. We seek thus to come up with the micro-structure of an arrangement of\nmicro-tubular cathodes which maximizes the contact surface subject to a\npressure drop and a permeability constraint. The optimal periodic design\n(fluid/solid) emerges from the application of a shape gradient algorithm\ncoupled to a level-set method for the geometrical description of the\ncorresponding cell problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Mar 2016 21:21:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Delgado", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08604", "submitter": "Matthew Dixon", "authors": "Matthew Dixon, Diego Klabjan, Jin Hoon Bang", "title": "Classification-based Financial Markets Prediction using Deep Neural\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are powerful types of artificial neural networks\n(ANNs) that use several hidden layers.

It is shown in a\nmathematically concise manner that standard beam contact models based on a\npoint-wise contact force fail to describe a considerable range of\nconfigurations, which are, however, likely to occur in practical applications.\nOn the contrary, the formulation proposed here models beam-to-beam contact by\nmeans of distributed line forces, a procedure that is shown to be applicable\nfor arbitrary geometrical configurations. The proposed formulation is based on\na Gauss-point-to-segment type contact discretization and a penalty\nregularization of the contact constraint. By means of detailed theoretical and\nnumerical investigations, it is shown that this approach is more suitable for\nbeam contact than possible alternatives based on mortar type contact\ndiscretizations or constraint enforcement by means of Lagrange multipliers. The\nproposed formulation is enhanced by a consistently linearized integration\ninterval segmentation avoiding numerical integration across strong\ndiscontinuities. In combination with a smoothed contact force law and the\nemployed C1-continuous beam elements, this procedure drastically reduces the\nnumerical integration error, an essential prerequisite for optimal spatial\nconvergence rates. The resulting line-to-line contact algorithm is supplemented\nby contact contributions of the beam endpoints, which represent boundary minima\nof the underlying minimal distance problem. Finally, a series of numerical test\ncases is analyzed in order to investigate the accuracy and consistency of the\nproposed formulation regarding integration error, spatial convergence behavior\nand resulting contact force distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 14:53:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Meier", "Christoph", ""], ["Popp", "Alexander", ""], ["Wall", "Wolfgang A.", ""]]}]
