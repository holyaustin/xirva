As a first approximation, we ignore the protocell growth and\ndivision dynamics. The behavior of catalytic reaction networks is then\nsimulated by means of a stochastic model that accounts for the creation and the\nextinction of species and reactions. While this is not yet an exhaustive\nprotocell model, it already provides clues regarding some processes that are\nrelevant for understanding the conditions that can enable a population of\nprotocells to undergo evolution and selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 15:53:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Serra", "Roberto", ""], ["Filisetti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Villani", "Marco", ""], ["Graudenzi", "Alex", ""], ["Damiani", "Chiara", ""], ["Panini", "Tommaso", ""]]}]
