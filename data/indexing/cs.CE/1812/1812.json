Adaptive\nsparse grid approximations are an established approach to overcome these\nchallenges. However, standard adaptivity is based on global information, thus\nproperties such as lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality or anisotropic\ncoupling of the input directions, which are common in practical applications,\nare not fully exploited. We propose a novel structure-exploiting\ndimension-adaptive sparse grid approximation methodology using Sobol'\ndecompositions in each subspace to introduce a sensitivity scoring system to\ndrive the adaptive process. By employing local sensitivity information, we\nexplore and exploit the anisotropic coupling of the stochastic inputs as well\nas the lower intrinsic stochastic dimensionality. The proposed approach is\ngeneric, i.e., it can be formulated in terms of arbitrary approximation\noperators and point sets. In particular, we consider sparse grid interpolation\nand pseudo-spectral projection constructed on (L)-Leja sequences.

One popular class\nof reconstruction methods in this setting is based on internode distances, i.e.\nthe average graph distance between pairs of species across gene trees. While\nstatistical consistency in the limit of large numbers of loci has been\nestablished in some cases, little is known about the sample complexity of such\nmethods. Here we make progress on this question by deriving a lower bound on\nthe worst-case variance of internode distance which depends linearly on the\ncorresponding graph distance in the species tree. We also discuss some\nalgorithmic implications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 04:48:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Roch", "Sebastien", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.08548", "submitter": "Marcin W\\k{a}torek", "authors": "Marcin W\\k{a}torek, Stanis{\\l}aw Dro\\.zd\\.z, Pawe{\\l}\n  O\\'swi\\c{e}cimka, Marek Stanuszek", "title": "Multifractal cross-correlations between the World Oil and other\n  Financial Markets in 2012-2017", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Energy Economics 81, 874-885 (2019)", "doi": "10.1016/j.eneco.2019.05.015", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.CE econ.EM physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Statistical and multiscaling characteristics of WTI Crude Oil prices\nexpressed in US dollar in relation to the most traded currencies as well as to\ngold futures and to the E-mini S$\\&$P500 futures prices on 5 min intra-day\nrecordings in the period January 2012 - December 2017 are studied. It is shown\nthat in most of the cases the tails of return distributions of the considered\nfinancial instruments follow the inverse cubic power law. The only exception is\nthe Russian ruble for which the distribution tail is heavier and scales with\nthe exponent close to 2. From the perspective of multiscaling the analysed time\nseries reveal the multifractal organization with the left-sided asymmetry of\nthe corresponding singularity spectra. Even more, all the considered financial\ninstruments appear to be multifractally cross-correlated with oil, especially\non the level of medium-size fluctuations, as the multifractal cross-correlation\nanalysis carried out by means of the multifractal cross-correlation analysis\n(MFCCA) and detrended cross-correlation coefficient $\\rho_q$ show. The degree\nof such cross-correlations is however varying among the financial instruments.\nThe strongest ties to the oil characterize currencies of the oil extracting\ncountries. Strength of this multifractal coupling appears to depend also on the\noil market trend. In the analysed time period the level of cross-correlations\nsystematically increases during the bear phase on the oil market and it\nsaturates after the trend reversal in 1st half of 2016.

The\ntime-dependent evolution of concentrations of the species is commonly described\nby a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the\nanalysis of such high-dimensional, non-linear system of equations is often\ncomputationally expensive and even prohibitive in practice. The major challenge\ntowards reducing such models is providing the guarantees as to how the solution\nof the reduced model relates to that of the original model, while avoiding to\nsolve the original model. In this paper, we have designed and tested an\napproximation method for ODE models of biochemical reaction systems, in which\nthe guarantees are our major requirement. Borrowing from tropical analysis\ntechniques, dominance relations among terms of each species' ODE are exploited\nto simplify the original model, by neglecting the dominated terms. As the\ndominant subsystems can change during the system's dynamics, depending on which\nspecies dominate the others, several possible modes exist. Thus, simpler models\nconsisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,\npiecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.\nBy combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,\nwe show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,\nconsisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower\nand upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our\nmethod provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of\ntropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical\nreduction systems. The method is tested on several case studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 17:30:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 09:56:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Beica", "Andreea", ""], ["Feret", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["Petrov", "Tatjana", ""]]}]
