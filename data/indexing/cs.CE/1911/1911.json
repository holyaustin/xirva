The proposed approach overcomes a key deficiency in existing\ndensity-based optimization methods that typically yield designs that do not\nhave smooth surfaces but have large number of small intricate features, which\nare difficult to manufacture even by additive manufacturing. In the proposed\napproach, Bezier curves are utilized to describe the skeleton of the design\nbeing optimized where the description of the entire design is realized by\nassigning thickness along the curves. This geometric representation technique\nensures that the optimized design is smooth and concise and can easily be tuned\nto be manufacturable by additive manufacturing. In the optimization method, the\ndensity field is described by the Heaviside function defined on the Bezier\ncurves. Compared to NURBS or B-spline based models, Bezier curves have fewer\ncontrol parameters and hence are easier to manipulate for sensitivity\nderivation, especially for distance sensitivities. Due to its powerful curve\nfitting ability, using Bezier curve to represent density field allows exploring\ndesign space effectively and generating concise structures without any\nintricate small features at the borders. Furthermore, this density\nrepresentation method is mesh independent and design variables are reduced\nsignificantly so that optimization problem can be solved efficiently using\nsmall-scale optimization algorithms such as sequential quadratic programming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Oct 2019 18:36:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Deng", "Hao", ""], ["Hinnebusch", "Shawn", ""], ["To", "Albert C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.00931", "submitter": "Roman Korol", "authors": "Roman Korol, Jorge L.

However, an unfortunate property\nof existing non-preconditioned numerical integration schemes for path-integral\nmolecular dynamics (PIMD) - including ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD)\nand thermostatted RPMD (T-RPMD) - is that for a given MD timestep, the overlap\nbetween the exact ring-polymer Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution and that sampled\nusing MD becomes zero in the infinite-bead limit. This has clear implications\nfor hybrid Metropolis Monte-Carlo/MD sampling schemes. We show that these\nproblems can be avoided through the introduction of \"dimension-free\" numerical\nintegration schemes for which the sampled ring-polymer position distribution\nhas non-zero overlap with the exact distribution in the infinite-bead limit for\nthe case of a harmonic potential. We show that dimension freedom can be\nachieved via mollification of the forces from the physical potential and with\nthe BCOCB integration scheme. The dimension-free numerical integration schemes\nyield finite error bounds for a given MD timestep as the number of beads is\ntaken to infinity; these conclusions are proven for harmonic potential and\nborne out numerically for anharmonic systems, including water.

Experimental orders of convergence are calculated from successive\nrefinements of the grid. The numerical methods are further validated by\ncomparisons between statistical inferences obtained from Monte Carlo ensembles\nof numerical solutions and theoretical first-order perturbation results. It is\nfound that while for Gaussian correlation of the log-conductivity field all the\nmethods perform well, in the exponential case their accuracy deteriorates and,\nfor large variance and number of modes, the benchmark problems are practically\nnot tractable with reasonably large computing resources, for all the methods\nconsidered in this study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2019 09:05:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2020 19:34:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Alecsa", "Cristian D.", ""], ["Boros", "Imre", ""], ["Frank", "Florian", ""], ["Knabner", "Peter", ""], ["Nechita", "Mihai", ""], ["Prechtel", "Alexander", ""], ["Rupp", "Andreas", ""], ["Suciu", "Nicolae", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10812", "submitter": "Jacopo Bonari", "authors": "Jacopo Bonari, Maria R.

Tissue temperature must be efficiently and accurately obtained from\ndeformed tissues for precise thermal energy delivery; however, the classical\nPennes bio-heat transfer can handle only the static non-moving state of soft\ntissue. This paper presents a formulation of bio-heat transfer under the effect\nof tissue deformation for fast or near real-time tissue temperature\ncomputation, based on fast explicit dynamics finite element algorithm for\ntransient heat transfer. The proposed computation is achieved by transformation\nof the unknown deformed tissue state to the known initial non-moving state via\na mapping function. The appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed\nmethodology are evaluated on a realistic virtual human liver with blood vessels\nto demonstrate a clinically relevant scenario of thermal ablation of hepatic\ncancer. Compared against the established non-linear procedures from commercial\nfinite element analysis package, ABAQUS/CAE, the proposed methodology can\nachieve a typical 1.0e-3 level of normalized relative error at nodes and\nbetween 1.0e-4 and 1.0e-5 level of total errors, which is in good agreement\nwith ABAQUS solutions. The proposed method consumes slightly more time than the\nformulation without soft tissue deformation, and computation performance of\nfive different formulations are examined. The proposed method can be applied\nwith bio-mechanical deformable models for fast or near real-time computation of\nnon-linear bio-heat transfer, leading to translational potential in dynamic\ntissue temperature predictive analysis and thermal dosimetry computation for\ncomputer-integrated medical education and personalized treatments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2019 21:45:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jinao", ""], ["Chauhan", "Sunita", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.12133", "submitter": "Qiao-Le He", "authors": "Qiao-Le He, Liming Zhao", "title": "Bayesian inference based process design and uncertainty analysis of\n  simulated moving bed chromatographic systems", "comments": "32 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.seppur.2020.116856", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE math.OC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Prominent features of simulated moving bed (SMB) chromatography processes in\nthe downstream processing is based on the determination of operating\nconditions.

The model relies on an artificial heat\nconvection coefficient to couple two layers and establish the approximate\nrelationship with the corresponding 3D model. In the model, a constant pressure\ndrop and heat generation rate are treated. The material distribution is\noptimized to reduce the average temperature of the base plate at the prescribed\nterminal time. Furthermore, to reduce the intermediate density regions during\nthe density-based topology optimization procedure, a detailed analysis of\ninterpolation functions is made and the penalty factors are chosen on this\nbasis. Finally, considering the engineering application of the model, a\npractical model with more powerful cooling medium and higher inlet pressure is\nbuilt.
