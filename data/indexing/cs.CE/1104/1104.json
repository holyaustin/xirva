The first one is to\npropose an extension of the force density method (FDM)(H.J. Schek, 1974), a\nform-finding method for prestressed cable-net structures. The second one is to\npresent a review of various form-finding methods for tension structures, in the\nrelation with the extended FDM. In the first part, it is pointed out that the\noriginal FDM become useless when it is applied to the prestressed structures\nthat consist of combinations of both tension and compression members, while the\nFDM is usually advantageous in form-finding analysis of cable-nets. To\neliminate the limitation, a functional whose stationary problem simply\nrepresents the FDM is firstly proposed. Additionally, the existence of a\nvariational principle in the FDM is also indicated. Then, the FDM is\nextensively redefined by generalizing the formulation of the functional. As the\nresult, the generalized functionals enable us to find the forms of tension\nstructures that consist of combinations of both tension and compression\nmembers, such as tensegrities and suspended membranes with compression struts.\nIn the second part, it is indicated the important role of three expressions\nused by the description of the extended FDM, such as stationary problems of\nfunctionals, the principle of virtual work and stationary conditions using\nNabla symbol. They can be commonly found in general problems of statics,\nwhereas the original FDM only provides a particular form of equilibrium\nequation. Then, to demonstrate the advantage of such expressions, various\nform-finding methods are reviewed and compared. As the result, the common\nfeatures and the differences over various form-finding methods are examined.\nFinally, to give an overview of the reviewed methods, the corresponding\nexpressions are shown in the form of three tables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2011 16:45:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Miki", "Masaaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4668", "submitter": "Massimiliano Vasile Massimiliano Vasile", "authors": "Matteo Ceriotti and Massimiliano Vasile", "title": "MGA trajectory planning with an ACO-inspired algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Acta Astronautica, 67 (9-10). pp. 1202-1217, ISSN 0094-5765, 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NE cs.SY math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a set of celestial bodies, the problem of finding an optimal sequence\nof swing-bys, deep space manoeuvres (DSM) and transfer arcs connecting the\nelements of the set is combinatorial in nature. The number of possible paths\ngrows exponentially with the number of celestial bodies. Therefore, the design\nof an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed\ncombinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve\nthe design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number\nof alternative mission options in a short time. This work proposes to formulate\nthe complete automated design of a multiple gravity assist trajectory as an\nautonomous planning and scheduling problem. The resulting scheduled plan will\nprovide the optimal planetary sequence and a good estimation of the set of\nassociated optimal trajectories. The trajectory model consists of a sequence of\ncelestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.\nFor each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the\ntime of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding\nswing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.\nFor each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers\nfrom the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents\na planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm\ninspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of\npossible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding\none node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is\nused to select a feasible direction. This approach to automatic trajectory\nplanning is applied to the design of optimal transfers to Saturn and among the\nGalilean moons of Jupiter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Apr 2011 00:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ceriotti", "Matteo", ""], ["Vasile", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4720", "submitter": "Hadi Poormohammadi", "authors": "Ruzbeh Tusserkani and Changiz Eslahchi and Hadi Poormohammadi and Azin\n  Azadi", "title": "TripNet: A Method for Constructing Phylogenetic Networks from Triplets", "comments": "12 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We present TripNet, a method for constructing phylogenetic networks from\ntriplets.

As\nwith any other field in Systems Biology, computational tools are required to\ndeal with this ocean of data. iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute\nquantification) is a technique that allows simultaneous quantification of\nproteins from multiple samples. Although iTRAQ data gives useful insights to\nthe biologist, it is more complex to perform analysis and draw biological\nconclusions because of its multi-plexed design. One such problem is to find\nproteins that behave in a similar way (i.e. change in abundance) among various\ntime points since the temporal variations in the proteomics data reveal\nimportant biological information. Distance based methods such as Euclidian\ndistance or Pearson coefficient, and clustering techniques such as k-mean etc,\nare not able to take into account the temporal information of the series. In\nthis paper, we present an linear-time algorithm for clustering similar patterns\namong various iTRAQ time course data irrespective of their absolute values. The\nalgorithm, referred to as Temporal Pattern Mining(TPM), maps the data from a\nCartesian plane to a discrete binary plane. After the mapping a dynamic\nprogramming technique allows mining of similar data elements that are\ntemporally closer to each other. The proposed algorithm accurately clusters\niTRAQ data that are temporally closer to each other with more than 99%\naccuracy. Experimental results for different problem sizes are analyzed in\nterms of quality of clusters, execution time and scalability for large data\nsets.
