To model the interaction between the matrix and the fractures, we use\nGeneralized Multiscale Finite Element Method. In this approach, the matrix and\nthe fracture interaction is modeled via local multiscale basis functions. We\ndeveloped the GMsFEM and applied for linear flows with horizontal or vertical\nfracture orientations on a Cartesian fine grid. In this paper, we consider\narbitrary fracture orientations and use triangular fine grid and developed\nGMsFEM for nonlinear flows. Moreover, we develop online basis function\nstrategies to adaptively improve the convergence. The number of multiscale\nbasis functions in each coarse region represents the degrees of freedom needed\nto achieve a certain error threshold. Our approach is adaptive in a sense that\nthe multiscale basis functions can be added in the regions of interest.\nNumerical results for two-dimensional problem are presented to demonstrate the\nefficiency of proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 05:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Akkutlu", "I.

In this paper, we propose\nTurboMOR, a novel MOR technique for the efficient reduction of passive RC\nnetworks. TurboMOR is based on moment-matching, achieved through efficient\ncongruence transformations based on Householder reflections. A novel feature of\nTurboMOR is the block-diagonal structure of the reduced models, that makes them\nmore efficient than the dense models produced by existing techniques. Moreover,\nthe model structure allows for an insightful interpretation of the reduction\nprocess in terms of system theory.
