These offer\nsophisticated tools for the study of human behaviour, the recreation of\nenvironmental factors such as fire or smoke, and the inclusion of architectural\nor structural features, such as elevators, pillars and exits. Although such\nsimulation environments can provide insights into crowd behaviour, they lack\nthe ability to examine potentially dangerous forces building up within a crowd.\nThese are commonly referred to as crush conditions, and are a common cause of\ndeath in emergency evacuations.\n  In this paper, we describe a methodology for the prediction and mitigation of\ncrush conditions. The paper is organised as follows. We first establish the\nneed for such a model, defining the main factors that lead to crush conditions,\nand describing several exemplar case studies. We then examine current methods\nfor studying crush, and describe their limitations. From this, we develop a\nthree-stage hybrid approach, using a combination of techniques. We conclude\nwith a brief discussion of the potential benefits of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 May 2008 13:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Harding", "Peter J.", ""], ["Amos", "Martyn", ""], ["Gwynne", "Steve", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.1806", "submitter": "Mark van der Zwaag", "authors": "J.A.
