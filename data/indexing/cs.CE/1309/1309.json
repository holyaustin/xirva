The characteristics of our\napplication provided both opportunities and challenges for increasing\nperformance.

Synthetic cells are built\nby encapsulating biomolecules inside lipid vesicles (liposomes), allowing the\nsynthesis of one or more functional proteins. Thanks to the in situ synthesized\nproteins, synthetic cells become able to perform several biomolecular\nfunctions, which can be exploited for a large variety of applications. This\npaves the way to several advanced uses of synthetic cells in basic science and\nbiotechnology, thanks to their versatility, modularity, biocompatibility, and\nprogrammability. In the previous WIVACE (2012) we presented the\nstate-of-the-art of semi-synthetic minimal cell (SSMC) technology and\nintroduced, for the first time, the idea of chemical communication between\nsynthetic cells and natural cells. The development of a proper synthetic\ncommunication protocol should be seen as a tool for the nascent field of\nbio/chemical-based Information and Communication Technologies (bio-chem-ICTs)\nand ultimately aimed at building soft-wet-micro-robots.

We firstly discuss how our research goal\n(based on the natural capabilities of biological systems to manipulate chemical\nsignals) finds a proper place in the current scientific and technological\ncontexts. Then, we shortly comment on the experimental approaches from the\nviewpoints of (i) synthetic cell construction, and (ii) bioengineering of\nmicroorganisms, providing up-to-date results from our laboratory.
