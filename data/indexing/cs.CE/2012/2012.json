We propose an alternate method based\non Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of\nmicrostructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green\nfunction of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the\ncase of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative\nprocedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally\narises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents\nby a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed\nby varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of\nthe method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures.

A fundamental problem is whether and how recovery\nguided by government policies is able to meet the challenge of a wide range of\ndisruptions. Prior research on this problem is scant due to lack of sharing\nlarge-scale granular data at the operational energy grid, stigma of revealing\nlimitations of services, and complex recovery coupled with policies and\ncustomers. As such, both quantification and firsthand information are lacking\non capabilities and fundamental limitation of energy services in response to\nextreme events. Furthermore, government policies that guide recovery are often\nsidelined by prior study. This work studies the fundamental problem through the\nlens of recovery guided by two commonly adopted policies. We develop data\nanalysis on unsupervised learning from non-stationary data. The data span\nfailure events, from moderate to extreme, at the operational distribution grid\nduring the past nine years in two service regions at the state of New York and\nMassachusetts. We show that under the prioritization policy favoring large\nfailures, recovery exhibits a surprising scaling property which counteracts\nfailure scaling on the infrastructure vulnerability. However, heterogeneous\nrecovery widens with the severity of failure events: large failures that cannot\nbe prioritized increase customer interruption time by 47 folds. And, prolonged\nsmall failures dominate the entire temporal evolution of recovery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 03:12:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Afsharinejad", "Amir Hossein", ""], ["Ji", "Chuanyi", ""], ["Wilcox", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15579", "submitter": "Chun Yui Wong", "authors": "Chun Yui Wong, Pranay Seshadri, Ashley Scillitoe, Bryn Noel Ubald,\n  Andrew B.

In Part I of this\ntwo-part paper, a workflow for the formulation of blade envelopes is described\nand demonstrated. In Part II, this workflow is extended to accommodate multiple\nobjectives. This allows engineers to prescribe manufacturing guidelines that\ntake into account multiple performance criteria. The quality of a manufactured\nblade can be correlated with features derived from the distribution of primal\nflow quantities over the surface. We show that these distributions can be\naccounted for in the blade envelope using vector-valued models derived from\ndiscrete surface flow measurements. Our methods result in a set of variables\nthat allows flexible and independent control over multiple flow characteristics\nand performance metrics, similar in spirit to inverse design methods. The\naugmentations to the blade envelope workflow presented in this paper are\ndemonstrated on the LS89 turbine blade, focusing on the control of loss, mass\nflow and the isentropic Mach number distribution. Finally, we demonstrate how\nblade envelopes can be used to visualize invariant designs by producing a 3D\nrender of the envelope using 3D modelling software.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 12:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Chun Yui", ""], ["Seshadri", "Pranay", ""], ["Scillitoe", "Ashley", ""], ["Ubald", "Bryn Noel", ""], ["Duncan", "Andrew B.", ""], ["Parks", "Geoffrey", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15744", "submitter": "Siddhant Kumar", "authors": "Li Zheng, Siddhant Kumar, Dennis M.

The\nchosen spinodoid topology for the cellular network on the microscale (which is\ninspired by natural microstructures forming during spinodal decomposition)\nadmits a seamless spatial grading as well as tunable elastic anisotropy, and it\nis parametrized by a small set of design parameters associated with the\nunderlying Gaussian random field. The macroscale boundary value problem is\ndiscretized by finite elements, which in addition to the displacement field\ncontinuously interpolate the microscale design parameters. By assuming a\nseparation of scales, the local constitutive behavior on the macroscale is\nidentified as the homogenized elastic response of the microstructure based on\nthe local design parameters. As a departure from classical FE$^2$-type\napproaches, we replace the costly microscale homogenization by a data-driven\nsurrogate model, using deep neural networks, which accurately and efficiently\nmaps design parameters onto the effective elasticity tensor. The model is\ntrained on homogenized stiffness data obtained from numerical homogenization by\nfinite elements. As an added benefit, the machine learning setup admits\nautomatic differentiation, so that sensitivities (required for the optimization\nproblem) can be computed exactly and without the need for numerical derivatives\n- a strategy that holds promise far beyond the elastic stiffness. Therefore,\nthis framework presents a new opportunity for multiscale topology optimization\nbased on data-driven surrogate models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 17:30:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2021 20:48:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Li", ""], ["Kumar", "Siddhant", ""], ["Kochmann", "Dennis M.", ""]]}]
