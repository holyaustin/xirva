This model uses a moving-grid technique to solve the\nNavier--Stokes equations expressed in the arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian\nkinematics. The discretization in space is based on the spectral element\nmethod. The coupling of the fluid equations and the moving-grid equations is\nessentially done through the conditions on the moving boundaries. Two- and\nthree-dimensional simulations are presented: translation and rotation of a\ncylinder in a fluid, and large-amplitude sloshing in a rectangular tank. The\naccuracy and robustness of the present numerical model is studied and\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 14:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bodard", "Nicolas", ""], ["Bouffanais", "Roland", ""], ["Deville", "Michel O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0787", "submitter": "Toshiya Takami", "authors": "Taizo Kobayashi, Toshiya Takami, Kin'ya Takahashi, Ryota Mibu, Mutsumi\n  Aoyagi", "title": "Sound Generation by a Turbulent Flow in Musical Instruments -\n  Multiphysics Simulation Approach -", "comments": "6 pages, 10 figure files, to appear in the proceedings of HPCAsia07", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.CE physics.flu-dyn", "license": null, "abstract": "  Total computational costs of scientific simulations are analyzed between\ndirect numerical simulations (DNS) and multiphysics simulations (MPS) for sound\ngeneration in musical instruments.

In our approach, we consider an investment\nmodel where the agent decides at every time step the proportion of wealth to\ninvest in a risky asset, keeping the rest of the budget in a risk-free asset.\nEvery investment is evaluated in the market via a stylized return on investment\nfunction (RoI), which is modeled by a stochastic process with unknown\nperiodicities and levels of noise. For comparison reasons, we present two\nreference strategies which represent the case of agents with zero-knowledge and\ncomplete-knowledge of the dynamics of the returns. We consider also an\ninvestment strategy based on technical analysis to forecast the next return by\nfitting a trend line to previous received returns. To account for the\nperformance of the different strategies, we perform some computer experiments\nto calculate the average budget that can be obtained with them over a certain\nnumber of time steps. To assure for fair comparisons, we first tune the\nparameters of each strategy. Afterwards, we compare the performance of these\nstrategies for RoIs with different periodicities and levels of noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2007 19:04:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 16:13:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Navarro", "J. -Emeterio", ""]]}]
