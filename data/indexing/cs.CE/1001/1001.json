Testing on yeast\nproteins, our results show that SimIC efficiently addresses the shallow\nannotation issue in GO, thus improves the correlations between GO similarities\nof yeast proteins and their expression similarities as well as between GO\nsimilarities of yeast proteins and their sequence similarities. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed SimIC is superior in predicting yeast protein\ninteractions. We predict 20484 yeast protein-protein interactions (PPIs)\nbetween 2462 proteins based on the high SimIC values of biological process (BP)\nand cellular component (CC). Examining the 214 MIPS complexes in our predicted\nPPIs shows that all members of 159 MIPS complexes can be found in our PPI\npredictions, which is more than those (120/214) found in PPIs predicted by\nrelative specificity similarity (RSS). Integrating IC and structural\ninformation of GO hierarchy can improve the effectiveness of the semantic\nsimilarity measure of GO terms. The new SimIC can effectively correct the\neffect of shallow annotation, and then provide an effective way to measure\nsimilarity between proteins based on Gene Ontology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 19:57:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 21:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Bo", ""], ["Wang", "James Z.", ""], ["Feltus", "F.
