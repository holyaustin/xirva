Perfusion deconvolution has been widely accepted\nas the principal numerical tool for perfusion analysis, and is used routinely\nin clinical applications. This extensive use of perfusion in clinical\ndecision-making makes numerical stability and robustness of perfusion\ncomputations vital for accurate diagnostics and patient safety. The main goal\nof this paper is to propose a novel approach for validating numerical\nproperties of perfusion algorithms. The approach is based on Perfusion\nLinearity Property (PLP), which we find in perfusion deconvolution, as well as\nin many other perfusion techniques. PLP allows one to study perfusion values as\nweighted averages of the original imaging data. This, in turn, uncovers hidden\nproblems with the existing deconvolution techniques, and may be used to suggest\nmore reliable computational approaches and methodology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2010 15:49:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pianykh", "Oleg", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0392", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Stefano Galatolo (Dipartiento di matematica applicata, Universita di\n  Pisa), Mathieu Hoyrup (LORIA, Vandoeuvre-l es-Nancy, France), Crist\\'obal\n  Rojas (Fields Institute, Toronto, Canada)", "title": "Computing the speed of convergence of ergodic averages and pseudorandom\n  points in computable dynamical systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 24, 2010, pp. 7-18", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.24.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NA cs.CE cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A pseudorandom point in an ergodic dynamical system over a computable metric\nspace is a point which is computable but its dynamics has the same statistical\nbehavior as a typical point of the system.\n  It was proved in [Avigad et al. 2010, Local stability of ergodic averages]\nthat in a system whose dynamics is computable the ergodic averages of\ncomputable observables converge effectively.

The design problem considers three essential\nrequirements of control problems, namely load disturbance rejection, setpoint\nregulation and robustness of closed-loop system against model uncertainties.\nThe primary design goal is to optimize load disturbance rejection. Robustness\nis guaranteed by requiring that the maximum sensitivity is less than or equal\nto a specified value. In the first step, PI controller parameters are\ndetermined such that the IAE criterion to a load disturbance step is minimized\nand the robustness constraint on maximum sensitivity is satisfied. Using a\nstructure with two degrees of freedom which introduces an extra parameter, the\nsetpoint weight, good setpoint regulation is achieved in the second step. The\nmain advantage of the proposed method is its simplicity. Once the equivalent\nfirst order plus dead time model is determined, the PI parameters are\nexplicitly given by a set of tuning formulae.
