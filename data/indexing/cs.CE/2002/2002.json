The process of extracting information about a localized panel (nodal\ncoordinates, mesh connectivity) from a finite element model, input file is\nusually a problem-specific task. In this work, a generalized process to extract\nlocalized panels from the two-dimensional (2D) mesh is discussed. The process\nemploys set operations on elemental connectivity information and is independent\nof nodal coordinates. Thus, it is capable of extracting panel of any shape\ngiven the boundary and thus can be used during optimization of a wide range of\nstructures. A method to create stiffeners on the resulting local panels is also\npresented, and the effect of stiffener element size on buckling is studied. The\nlocal panel extraction process is demonstrated by integrating it into a\ndistributed MDO framework for optimization of an aircraft wing having\ncurvilinear spars and ribs (SpaRibs). A range of examples is included wherein\nthe process is used to create panels on the wing-skin, bounded by adjacent\nSpaRibs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Feb 2020 01:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2020 22:11:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 08:33:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["De", "Shuvodeep", ""], ["Kapania", "Rakesh K.", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00885", "submitter": "Alexis Arnaudon Dr", "authors": "Alexis Arnaudon, Frank van der Meulen, Moritz Schauer, Stefan Sommer", "title": "Diffusion bridges for stochastic Hamiltonian systems and shape\n  evolutions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.CE cs.NA physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Stochastically evolving geometric systems are studied in shape analysis and\ncomputational anatomy for modelling stochastic evolution of human organ shapes,\nand in geometric mechanics for modelling turbulence parts of multi-scale fluid\nflows.

Remarkably, the\nfractional-order nonlocal model gives rise to a self-adjoint and\npositive-definite system that accepts a unique solution. Further, owing to the\ndifficulty in obtaining analytical solutions to this fractional-order\ndiffer-integral problem, a 2D finite element model for the fractional-order\ngoverning equations is presented. Following a thorough validation with\nbenchmark problems, the 2D fractional finite element model is used to study the\nstatic as well as the free dynamic response of fractional-order plates subject\nto various loading and boundary conditions. It is established that the\nfractional-order nonlocality leads to a reduction in the stiffness of the plate\nstructure thereby increasing the displacements and reducing the natural\nfrequency of vibration of the plates. Further, it is seen that the effect of\nnonlocality is stronger on the higher modes of vibration when compared to the\nfundamental mode. These effects of the fractional-order nonlocality are noted\nirrespective of the nature of the boundary conditions. More specifically, the\nfractional-order model of nonlocal plates is free from boundary effects that\nlead to paradoxical predictions such as hardening and absence of nonlocal\neffects in classical integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity. This\nconsistency in the predictions is a result of the well-posed nature of the\nfractional-order governing equations that accept a unique solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 22:01:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Patnaik", "Sansit", ""], ["Sidhardh", "Sai", ""], ["Semperlotti", "Fabio", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.10246", "submitter": "Nigel Morris", "authors": "Nigel Morris, Adrian Butscher and Francesco Iorio", "title": "A subtractive manufacturing constraint for level set topology\n  optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization (2020)", "doi": "10.1007/s00158-019-02436-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE math.OC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a method for enforcing manufacturability constraints in generated\nparts such that they will be automatically ready for fabrication using a\nsubtractive approach.
