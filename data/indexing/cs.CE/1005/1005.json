Our results\nobtained for various versions of the Linux Kernel show that the spectrum is\ncharacterized by the fractal Weyl law established recently for systems of\nquantum chaotic scattering and the Perron-Frobenius operators of dynamical\nmaps. The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be $\\nu \\approx 0.63$ that\ncorresponds to the fractal dimension of the network $d \\approx 1.2$. The\neigenmodes of the Google matrix of Linux Kernel are localized on certain\nprincipal nodes. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for\ndirected networks with the fractal dimension $d<2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 May 2010 13:25:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 08:57:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Sep 2010 08:54:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ermann", "L.", ""], ["Chepelianskii", "A.

SABRE implements fast adaptive uniformization\n(FAU), a direct numerical approximation algorithm for computing transient\nsolutions of biochemical reaction networks. Biochemical reactions networks\nrepresent biological systems studied at a molecular level and these reactions\ncan be modeled as transitions of a Markov chain. SABRE accepts as input the\nformalism of guarded commands, which it interprets either as continuous-time or\nas discrete-time Markov chains. Besides operating in a stochastic mode, SABRE\nmay also perform a deterministic analysis by directly computing a mean-field\napproximation of the system under study. We illustrate the different\nfunctionalities of SABRE by means of biological case studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 May 2010 06:58:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Didier", "Frederic", ""], ["Henzinger", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Mateescu", "Maria", ""], ["Wolf", "Verena", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3439", "submitter": "Hamed O.
