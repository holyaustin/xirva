Computational\nrequirements in particular will quickly become unmanageable if adequate\ntechniques are not employed. In this work we describe a novel approach, based\non equivalent elements, that enables the simulation of large chambers with\nmodest computational resources. The method is then validated against real\nmeasurement results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 15:09:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chialina", "Silvano", ""], ["Cicuttin", "Matteo", ""], ["Codecasa", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Solari", "Giovanni", ""], ["Specogna", "Ruben", ""], ["Trevisan", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08920", "submitter": "Jan Zeman", "authors": "Filip Kola\\v{r}\\'ik, Bo\\v{r}ek Patz\\'ak, Jan Zeman", "title": "Computational Homogenization of Fresh Concrete Flow Around Reinforcing\n  Bars", "comments": "23 pages, 15 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE physics.flu-dyn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by casting of fresh concrete in reinforced concrete structures, we\nintroduce a numerical model of a steady-state non-Newtonian fluid flow through\na porous domain. Our approach combines homogenization techniques to represent\nthe reinforced domain by the Darcy law with an interface coupling of the Stokes\nand Darcy flows through the Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions. The ensuing\ntwo-scale problem is solved by the Finite Element Method with consistent\nlinearization and the results obtained from the homogenization approach are\nverified against fully resolved direct numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2015 19:08:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kola\u0159\u00edk", "Filip", ""], ["Patz\u00e1k", "Bo\u0159ek", ""], ["Zeman", "Jan", ""]]}]
