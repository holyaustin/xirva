In this paper we establish to which extent several\ndistance measures for the comparison of evolutionary networks are metrics for\ngalled trees, and hence when they can be safely used to evaluate galled tree\nreconstruction methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2009 16:55:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cardona", "Gabriel", ""], ["Llabres", "Merce", ""], ["Rossello", "Francesc", ""], ["Valiente", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.4454", "submitter": "Patrick Coquillard", "authors": "Patrick Coquillard (IBSV), Alexandre Muzy (LISA), Eric Wajnberg (IBSV)", "title": "Activatability for simulation tractability of NP problems: Application\n  to Ecology", "comments": "Complex Systems: Activity-Based Modeling and Simulation, Cargese\n  Interdisciplinary Seminar, Corsica, France., France (2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dynamics of biological-ecological systems is strongly depending on spatial\ndimensions. Most of powerful simulators in ecology take into account for system\nspatiality thus embedding stochastic processes. Due to the difficulty of\nresearching particular trajectories, biologists and computer scientists aim at\npredicting the most probable trajectories of systems under study. Doing that,\nthey considerably reduce computation times. However, because of the largeness\nof space, the execution time remains usually polynomial in time. In order to\nreduce execution times we propose an activatability-based search cycle through\nthe process space. This cycle eliminates the redundant processes on a\nstatistical basis (Generalized Linear Model), and converges to the minimal\nnumber of processes required to match simulation objectives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2009 11:59:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Coquillard", "Patrick", "", "IBSV"], ["Muzy", "Alexandre", "", "LISA"], ["Wajnberg", "Eric", "", "IBSV"]]}]
