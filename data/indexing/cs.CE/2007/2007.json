This work concerns the conceptual and numerical\nmodelling of poroelastically coupled dual-scale materials such as naturally\nfractured rock. Apart from a few exceptions, previous poroelastic DC models\nhave assumed isotropy of the constituents and the dual-material. Additionally,\nit is common to assume that only one continuum has intrinsic stiffness\nproperties. Finally, little has been done into validating whether the DC\nparadigm can capture the global poroelastic behaviours of explicit numerical\nrepresentations at the DC modelling scale. We address the aforementioned\nknowledge gaps in two steps. First, we utilise a homogenisation approach based\non Levin's theorem to develop a previously derived anisotropic poroelastic\nconstitutive model. Our development incorporates anisotropic intrinsic\nstiffness properties of both continua. This addition is in analogy to\nanisotropic fractured rock masses with stiff fractures. Second, we perform\nnumerical modelling to test the dual-continuum model against fine-scale\nexplicit equivalents. In doing, we present our hybrid numerical framework, as\nwell as the conditions required for interpretation of the numerical results.\nThe tests themselves progress from materials with isotropic to anisotropic\nmechanical and flow properties. The fine-scale simulations show anisotropy can\nhave noticeable effects on deformation and flow behaviour.

We observe\nsignificant variation between nodal characteristics and optimal connections\nacross network types. This result along with the computational costs of the\nsearch for optimal solutions highlights the difficulty of finding effective\nheuristics. A novel genetic algorithm is proposed and we find this optimization\nheuristic outperforms existing techniques and describe how it can be applied to\nother combinatorial and dynamic problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 16:07:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Auerbach", "Jeremy", ""], ["Kim", "Hyun", ""]]}]
