Our aims\nare: (i) to compare different phase-field fracture formulations applied to thin\nglass plates, (ii) to assess the consequences of the dimensional reduction of\nthe problem and mesh density and refinement, and (iii) to validate for\nquasi-static loading the time/temperature-dependent material properties we\nderived recently for two commonly used polymer foils made of Polyvinyl Butyral\nor Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate. As the nonlinear response prior to fracture, typical\nof the widely used Bourdin-Francfort-Marigo model, can lead to a significant\noverestimation of the response of thin plates under bending, the numerical\nstudy investigates two additional phase-field fracture models providing the\nlinear elastic phase of the stress-strain diagram. The typical values of the\ncritical fracture energy and tensile strength of glass lead to a phase-field\nlength-scale parameter that is challenging to resolve in the numerical\nsimulations. So, we show how to determine the fracture energy concerning the\napplied dimensional reduction and the value of the length-scale parameter\nrelative to the thickness of the plate. The comparison shows that the\nphase-field models provide very good agreement with the measured stresses and\nresistance of laminated glass, despite the fact that only one/two cracks\nlocalised using the quasi-static analysis, whereas multiple cracks evolved\nduring the experiment. It has also been observed that the stiffness and\nresistance of the partially fractured laminated glass can be well approximated\nusing a 2D plane-stress model with initially predefined cracks, which provides\na better estimation than the one-glass-layer limit.}\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 13:16:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Schmidt", "Jaroslav", ""], ["Zemanov\u00e1", "Alena", ""], ["Zeman", "Jan", ""], ["\u0160ejnoha", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00391", "submitter": "Sheng-Dong Zhang", "authors": "Shengdong Zhang, Shihui You, Longfei Chen, Xiaofei Liu", "title": "Topological feature study of slope failure process via persistent\n  homology-based machine learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.geo-ph cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using software UDEC to simulate the instability failure process of slope\nunder seismic load, studing the dynamic response of slope failure, obtaining\nthe deformation characteristics and displacement cloud map of slope, then\nanalyzing the instability state of slope by using the theory of persistent\nhomology, generates bar code map and extracts the topological characteristics\nof slope from bar code map.

A recent study showed that the\nuse of Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) for the spatial discretization significantly\nreduces the pollution error.\n  However, solving the resulting linear systems by means of a direct solver\nremains computationally expensive when large wave numbers or multiple\ndimensions are considered. An alternative lies in the use of (preconditioned)\nKrylov subspace methods. Recently, the use of the exact Complex Shifted\nLaplacian Preconditioner (CSLP) with a small complex shift has shown to lead to\nwave number independent convergence while obtaining more accurate numerical\nsolutions using IgA.\n  In this paper, we propose the use of deflation techniques combined with an\napproximated inverse of the CSLP using a geometric multigrid method. Numerical\nresults obtained for both one- and two-dimensional model problems, including\nconstant and non-constant wave numbers, show scalable convergence with respect\nto the wave number and approximation order p of the spatial discretization.\nFurthermore, when kh is kept constant, the proposed approach leads to a\nsignificant reduction of the computational time compared to the use of the\nexact inverse of the CSLP with a small shift.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2020 12:51:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Dwarka", "Vandana", ""], ["Tielen", "Roel", ""], ["M\u00f6ller", "Matthias", ""], ["Vuik", "Kees", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.10517", "submitter": "Shantenu Jha", "authors": "Hyungro Lee, Andre Merzky, Li Tan, Mikhail Titov, Matteo Turilli,\n  Dario Alfe, Agastya Bhati, Alex Brace, Austin Clyde, Peter Coveney, Heng Ma,\n  Arvind Ramanathan, Rick Stevens, Anda Trifan, Hubertus Van Dam, Shunzhou Wan,\n  Sean Wilkinson, Shantenu Jha", "title": "Scalable HPC and AI Infrastructure for COVID-19 Therapeutics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  COVID-19 has claimed more 1 million lives and resulted in over 40 million\ninfections.

State-of-Art methodologies for modelling and\nsimulating object shape error have limited defect fidelity, data versatility,\nand designer centricity that prevent their effective application during early\ndesign phase.

Such optimization\nproblems are particularly challenging due to the curse of dimensionality for\nhigh-dimensional parameters and the expensive solution of large-scale PDEs. To\naddress these challenges, we exploit two essential properties of such problems:\nthe low-rank structure of the Jacobian of the parameter-to-observable map to\nextract the intrinsically low-dimensional data-informed subspace, and the high\ncorrelation of the approximate EIGs by a series of approximations to reduce the\nnumber of PDE solves.
