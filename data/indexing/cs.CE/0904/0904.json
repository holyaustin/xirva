Each consumer demand is drawn from a\npredefined finite-size-support distribution, thus simulating the instantaneous\nload fluctuations. Each generator has a maximum power capability. A generator\nis not overloaded if the sum of the loads of consumers connected to a generator\ndoes not exceed its maximum production. In the standard grid each consumer is\nconnected only to its designated generator, while we consider a more general\norganization of the grid allowing each consumer to select one generator\ndepending on the load from a pre-defined consumer-dependent and sufficiently\nsmall set of generators which can all serve the load. The model grid is\ninterconnected in a graph with loops, drawn from an ensemble of random\nbipartite graphs, while each allowed configuration of loaded links represent a\nset of graph covering trees. Losses, the reactive character of the grid and the\ntransmission-level connections between generators (and many other details\nrelevant to realistic power grid) are ignored in this proof-of-principles\nstudy. We focus on the asymptotic limit and we show that the interconnects\nallow significant expansion of the parameter domains for which the probability\nof a generator overload is asymptotically zero. Our construction explores the\nformal relation between the problem of grid optimization and the modern theory\nof sparse graphical models. We also design heuristic algorithms that achieve\nthe asymptotically optimal selection of loaded links. We conclude discussing\nthe ability of this approach to include other effects, such as a more realistic\nmodeling of the power grid and related optimization and control algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 21:56:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2009 18:44:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 19:14:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Zdeborov\u00e1", "Lenka", ""], ["Decelle", "Aur\u00e9lien", ""], ["Chertkov", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1910", "submitter": "Andriyan Suksmono Bayu", "authors": "Andriyan Bayu Suksmono", "title": "Compressive Sampling with Known Spectral Energy Density", "comments": "Proc. of Int.

Instead of random\nsampling, the proposed method selects the location of samples to follow the\ndistribution of the spectral energy. Samples collected from three different\nmeasurement methods; the uniform sampling, random sampling, and energy\nequipartition sampling, are used to reconstruct a given monocycle signal whose\nspectral energy density is known. Objective performance evaluation in term of\nPSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) indicates empirically that the CS\nreconstruction of random sampling outperform the uniform sampling, while the\nenergy equipartition sampling outperforms both of them. These results suggest\nthat similar performance improvement can be achieved for the compressive SFCW\n(Stepped Frequency Continuous Wave) radar, allowing even higher acquisition\nspeed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Apr 2009 05:09:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2009 02:04:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2013 01:52:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Suksmono", "Andriyan Bayu", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2448", "submitter": "Francesc Rossell\\'o", "authors": "Francesc Rossello, Gabriel Valiente", "title": "All that Glisters is not Galled", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.CE q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Galled trees, evolutionary networks with isolated reticulation cycles, have\nappeared under several slightly different definitions in the literature.

To realize the compressive data\nmeasurement, in particular, to obtain the super-resolution reconstruction with\nhighly sparse data, the compressive system which is realized by surrounding the\nprobed obstacles by the random media has been proposed and empirically studied.\nSeveral interesting conclusions have been drawn: (a) if the desired resolution\nis within the range from to, the K-sparse N-unknowns imaging can be obtained\nexactly bymeasurements, which is comparable to the required number of\nmeasurement by the Gaussian random matrix in the literatures of compressive\nsensing. (b) With incorporating the random media which is used to enforce the\nmulti-path effect of wave propagation, the resulting measurement matrix is\nincoherence with wavelet matrix, in other words, when the probed obstacles are\nsparse with the framework of wavelet, the required number of measurements for\nsuccessful reconstruction is similar as above. (c) If the expected resolution\nis lower than, the required number of measurements of proposed compressive\nsystem is almost identical to the case of free space. (d) There is also a\nrequirement to make the tradeoff between the imaging resolutions and the number\nof measurements.
