Second, we extend a recently developed QB\nbalanced truncation method to be applicable to such lifted QB systems that\nshare the common feature of having a system matrix with zero eigenvalues. We\nillustrate this framework and the multi-stage lifting transformation on a\ntubular reactor model.

Such high-throughput and\nlow-cost generation of data underscores the need for commensurate acceleration\nin downstream computational analysis of the sequencing data. A fundamental step\nin downstream analysis is mapping of the reads to a long reference DNA\nsequence, such as a reference human genome. Sequence mapping is a\ncompute-intensive step that accounts for more than 30% of the overall time of\nthe GATK workflow.

A direct evaluation\nof the total interaction potential for general 3D bodies requires the\nintegration of contributions from molecule or charge distributions over the\nvolumes of the interaction partners, leading to a 6D integral (two nested 3D\nintegrals) that has to be solved numerically.

In a first step, the generic structure of SSIP laws, which is\nsuitable for the most general interaction scenario (e.g. fibers with arbitrary\ncross-section shape and inhomogeneous atomic/charge density within the\ncross-section) is presented.
