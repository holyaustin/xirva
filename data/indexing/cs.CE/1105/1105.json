We show\nthat by techniques borrowed from computational geometry we are not only able to\ncompute the continuous Haar transform directly, but also to do it quickly. This\nis achieved by massively pruning the transform tree and thus dramatically\ndecreasing the computational load when the number of vertices is small, as is\nthe case for VLSI layouts.

We think that the most\nfavorable methods for this purpose are blind tip reconstruction methods, since\nthey do not need any calibrated characterizers and might be performed on an\nordinary SPM setup. As in many other inverse problems also in case of these\nmethods the stability of the solution in presence of vibrational and electronic\nnoise needs application of so called regularization techniques. In this paper\nthe novel regularization technique (Regularized Blind Tip Reconstruction -\nRBTR) for blind tip reconstruction algorithm is presented. It improves the\nquality of the solution in presence of isotropic and anisotropic noise. The\nsuperiority of our approach is proved on the basis of computer simulations and\nanalysis of images of the Budget Sensors TipCheck calibration standard.

These fast algorithms are generally referred to as\nconstant-time or O(1) algorithms in the image processing literature. Along with\nthe spatial filter, the edge-preserving bilateral filter [Tomasi1998] involves\nan additional range kernel. This is used to restrict the averaging to those\nneighborhood pixels whose intensity are similar or close to that of the pixel\nof interest. The range kernel operates by acting on the pixel intensities. This\nmakes the averaging process non-linear and computationally intensive,\nespecially when the spatial filter is large. In this paper, we show how the\nO(1) averaging algorithms can be leveraged for realizing the bilateral filter\nin constant-time, by using trigonometric range kernels. This is done by\ngeneralizing the idea in [Porikli2008] of using polynomial range kernels. The\nclass of trigonometric kernels turns out to be sufficiently rich, allowing for\nthe approximation of the standard Gaussian bilateral filter. The attractive\nfeature of our approach is that, for a fixed number of terms, the quality of\napproximation achieved using trigonometric kernels is much superior to that\nobtained in [Porikli2008] using polynomials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 May 2011 01:44:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 May 2011 01:50:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 17:33:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhury", "Kunal Narayan", ""], ["Sage", "Daniel", ""], ["Unser", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5881", "submitter": "Mingyu Chen", "authors": "Mingyu Chen, David A.

Many\naviation accidents could be prevented if the precise aircraft positions and\nweather conditions on the aircraft's route were known. Existing studies propose\ndetermining the precise aircraft positions via a VHF channel with an air-to-air\nradio relay system that is based on mobile ad-hoc networks. However, due to the\nlong propagation delay, the existing TDMA MAC schemes underutilize the\nnetworks. The existing TDMA MAC sends data and receives ACK in one time slot,\nwhich requires two guard times in one time slot. Since aeronautical\ncommunications spans a significant distance, the guard time occupies a\nsignificantly large portion of the slot. To solve this problem, we propose a\npiggybacking mechanism ACK. Our proposed MAC has one guard time in one time\nslot, which enables the transmission of more data. Using this additional data,\nwe can send weather conditions that pertain to the aircraft's current position.\nOur analysis shows that this proposed MAC performs better than the existing\nMAC, since it offers better throughput and network utilization. In addition,\nour weather condition notification model achieves a much lower transmission\ndelay than a HF (high frequency) voice communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 10:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Jang", "Hyungjun", ""]]}]
