MinSolid and MinVoid mean that the\nsize of solid parts and cavities must be greater than the size of a prescribed\ncircle or sphere. This is ensured through the robust design approach based on\neroded, intermediate and dilated designs. MaxSolid seeks to restrict the\nformation of solid parts larger than a prescribed size, which is imposed\nthrough local volume restrictions. In the first part of this article, we show\nthat by proportionally restricting the maximum size of the eroded, intermediate\nand dilated designs, it is possible to obtain optimized designs satisfying,\nsimultaneously, MinSolid, MinVoid and MaxSolid. However, in spite of obtaining\ndesigns with crisp boundaries, some results can be difficult to manufacture due\nto the presence of multiple rounded cavities, which are introduced by the\nmaximum size restriction with the sole purpose of avoiding thick solid members\nin the structure. To address this issue, in the second part of this article we\npropose a new geometric constraint that seeks to control the minimum separation\ndistance between two solid members, also called the Minimum Gap (MinGap).\nDifferently from MinVoid, MinGap introduces large void areas that do not\nnecessarily have to be round. 2D and 3D test cases show that simultaneous\ncontrol of MinSolid, MinVoid, MaxSolid and MinGap can be useful to improve the\nmanufacturability of maximum size constrained designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Feb 2020 14:12:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Fern\u00e1ndez", "Eduardo", ""], ["Yang", "Kai-ke", ""], ["Koppen", "Stijn", ""], ["Alarc\u00f3n", "Pablo", ""], ["Bauduin", "Simon", ""], ["Duysinx", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.00379", "submitter": "Momchil Minkov", "authors": "Momchil Minkov, Ian A.

We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a\nphotonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in\na lithium niobate slab.

This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of\nfatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great\nimportance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with\nelastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural\nand hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present\nfrequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been\ncomputed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to\ninconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements\nand experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor\nof 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra\nconstraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the\nsimplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive\nparameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is\nto demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy\nby applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step\napproach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed\nto identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics.

The paper examines the\nreasons for slow, or lack of convergence, in terms of a variational\nperspective. In particular, when the material contains regions with zero or\nvery small stiffness, there is lack of uniqueness, and the energy landscape has\nflat or shallow directions. Therefore, in this work, the fixed-point iteration\nis replaced by the RPM iteration. The RPM uses the fixed-point iteration to\nadaptively identify the subspace on which fixed-point iterations are unstable,\nand performs Newton iterations only on the unstable subspace, while fixed-point\niterations are performed on the complementary stable subspace. This combination\nof efficient fixed-point iterations where possible, and expensive but\nwell-convergent Newton iterations where required, is shown to lead to robust\nand efficient convergence of the method.

Currently both\ngraph and 3D voxel representation methods are based on the heterogeneous\nelements of the crystal structures. Here, we propose to use electronic charge\ndensity (ECD) as a generic unified 3D descriptor for materials property\nprediction with the advantage of possessing close relation with the physical\nand chemical properties of materials. We developed an ECD based 3D\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting elastic properties of\nmaterials, in which CNNs can learn effective hierarchical features with\nmultiple convolving and pooling operations. Extensive benchmark experiments\nover 2,170 Fm-3m face-centered-cubic (FCC) materials show that our ECD based\nCNNs can achieve good performance for elasticity prediction. Especially, our\nCNN models based on the fusion of elemental Magpie features and ECD descriptors\nachieved the best 5-fold cross-validation performance. More importantly, we\nshowed that our ECD based CNN models can achieve significantly better\nextrapolation performance when evaluated over non-redundant datasets where\nthere are few neighbor training samples around test samples. As additional\nvalidation, we evaluated the predictive performance of our models on 329\nmaterials of space group Fm-3m by comparing to DFT calculated values, which\nshows better prediction power of our model for bulk modulus than shear modulus.\nDue to the unified representation power of ECD, it is expected that our ECD\nbased CNN approach can also be applied to predict other physical and chemical\nproperties of crystalline materials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Mar 2020 06:21:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 23:58:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Yong", ""], ["Yuan", "Kunpeng", ""], ["Liu", "Yinqiao", ""], ["Louis", "Steph-Yves", ""], ["Hu", "Ming", ""], ["Hu", "Jianjun", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13751", "submitter": "Sanne Van Den Boom", "authors": "Sanne J. van den Boom, Jian Zhang, Fred van Keulen and Alejandro M.\n  Arag\\'on", "title": "An Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method for\n  Levelset-based Topology Optimization", "comments": "Submitted to Structural and Multidisciplinary Optimization on\n  February 15th 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  During design optimization, a smooth description of the geometry is\nimportant, especially for problems that are sensitive to the way interfaces are\nresolved, e.g., wave propagation or fluid-structure interaction.

However, existing enriched methods have drawbacks,\nincluding ill-conditioning and difficulties in prescribing essential boundary\nconditions. In this work we introduce a new enriched topology optimization\nmethodology that overcomes the aforementioned drawbacks; boundaries are\nresolved accurately by means of the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite\nElement Method (IGFEM), coupled to a levelset function constructed by radial\nbasis functions. The enriched method used in this new approach to topology\noptimization has the same level of accuracy in the analysis as standard the\nfinite element method with matching meshes, but without the need for remeshing.\nWe derive the analytical sensitivities and we discuss the behavior of the\noptimization process in detail.
