We\ntest dynABE on three cobalt-related companies, and it achieves the best-case\nmisclassification error of 31.12% and an annualized absolute return of 359.55%\nwith zero maximum drawdown. dynABE also consistently outperforms the baseline\nmodels of support vector machine, neural network, and random forest in all case\nstudies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2018 04:03:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 02:39:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2018 03:00:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 23 Feb 2019 00:47:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Zhengyang", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12223", "submitter": "Sameh Abdulah", "authors": "Sara Shehab, Sameh Abdulah, Arabi E.

These\napplications mainly depend on identifying the evolutionary history of existing\norganisms and understanding the relations between them, which is possible\nthrough the deep analysis of their biological sequences. Multiple Sequence\nAlignment (MSA) is considered an important tool in such applications, where it\ngives an accurate representation of the relations between different biological\nsequences. In literature, many efforts have been put into presenting a new MSA\nalgorithm or even improving existing ones. However, little efforts on\noptimizing parallel MSA algorithms have been done. Nowadays, large datasets\nbecome a reality, and big data become a primary challenge in various fields,\nwhich should be also a new milestone for new bioinformatics algorithms. This\nsurvey presents four of the state-of-the-art parallel MSA algorithms, TCoffee,\nMAFFT, MSAProbs, and M2Align. We provide a detailed discussion of each\nalgorithm including its strengths, weaknesses, and implementation details and\nthe effectiveness of its parallel implementation compared to the other\nalgorithms, taking into account the MSA accuracy on two different datasets,\nBAliBASE and OXBench.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 20:48:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shehab", "Sara", ""], ["Abdulah", "Sameh", ""], ["Keshk", "Arabi E.", ""]]}]
