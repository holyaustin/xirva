The common method for\nidentifying proteins and characterising their amino acid sequences is to digest\nthe proteins into peptides, analyse the peptides using mass spectrometry and\nassign the resulting tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) to peptides using database\nsearch tools. However, database search algorithms are highly dependent on a\nreference protein database and they cannot identify peptides and proteins not\nincluded in the database. Therefore, de novo sequencing algorithms are\ndeveloped to overcome the problem by directly reconstructing the peptide\nsequence of an MS/MS spectrum without using any protein database. Current de\nnovo sequencing algorithms often fail to construct the completely matched\nsequences, and produce partial matches. In this study, we propose a genetic\nalgorithm based method, GA-Novo, to solve the complex optimisation task of de\nnovo peptide sequencing, aiming at constructing full length sequences. Given an\nMS/MS spectrum, GA-Novo optimises the amino acid sequences to best fit the\ninput spectrum. On the testing dataset, GA-Novo outperforms PEAKS, the most\ncommonly used software for this task, by constructing 8% higher number of fully\nmatched peptide sequences, and 4% higher recall at partially matched sequences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Feb 2019 04:51:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Azari", "Samaneh", ""], ["Xue", "Bing", ""], ["Zhang", "Mengjie", ""], ["Peng", "Lifeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00867", "submitter": "Yusuke Imoto", "authors": "Y.

We test our system across multiple\ncombinations of smart beta strategies and the resulting portfolios show an\nimprovement in risk-adjusted returns, especially on more return oriented\nportfolios (up to 50$\\%$ in excess of market annually). In addition, we propose\na novel smart beta allocation system based on the Feature Saliency HMM (FSHMM)\nalgorithm that performs feature selection simultaneously with the training of\nthe HMM, to improve regime identification. We evaluate our systematic trading\nsystem with real life assets using MSCI indices; further, the results (up to\n60$\\%$ in excess of market annually) show model performance improvement with\nrespect to portfolios built using full feature HMMs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 00:40:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fons", "Elizabeth", ""], ["Dawson", "Paula", ""], ["Yau", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Zeng", "Xiao-jun", ""], ["Keane", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10948", "submitter": "Jinho Lee", "authors": "Jinho Lee, Raehyun Kim, Yookyung Koh, and Jaewoo Kang", "title": "Global Stock Market Prediction Based on Stock Chart Images Using Deep\n  Q-Network", "comments": "12 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2953542", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.CE q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We applied Deep Q-Network with a Convolutional Neural Network function\napproximator, which takes stock chart images as input, for making global stock\nmarket predictions. Our model not only yields profit in the stock market of the\ncountry where it was trained but generally yields profit in global stock\nmarkets. We trained our model only in the US market and tested it in 31\ndifferent countries over 12 years. The portfolios constructed based on our\nmodel's output generally yield about 0.1 to 1.0 percent return per transaction\nprior to transaction costs in 31 countries. The results show that there are\nsome patterns on stock chart image, that tend to predict the same future stock\nprice movements across global stock markets. Moreover, the results show that\nfuture stock prices can be predicted even if the training and testing\nprocedures are done in different countries. Training procedure could be done in\nrelatively large and liquid markets (e.g., USA) and tested in small markets.\nThis result demonstrates that artificial intelligence based stock price\nforecasting models can be used in relatively small markets (emerging countries)\neven though they do not have a sufficient amount of data for training.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 08:40:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Jinho", ""], ["Kim", "Raehyun", ""], ["Koh", "Yookyung", ""], ["Kang", "Jaewoo", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.11112", "submitter": "Nisha Chandramoorthy", "authors": "Nisha Chandramoorthy, Zhong-Nan Wang, Qiqi Wang, Paul Tucker", "title": "Toward computing sensitivities of average quantities in turbulent flows", "comments": "10 pages; Center for turbulence research summer program 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE nlin.CD", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Chaotic dynamical systems such as turbulent flows are characterized by an\nexponential divergence of infinitesimal perturbations to initial conditions.\nTherefore, conventional adjoint/tangent sensitivity analysis methods that are\nsuccessful with RANS simulations fail in the case of chaotic LES/DNS.
