A mutant with relative fitness $r$ is introduced into a population\nand the system evolves, either reaching fixation (in which every individual is\na mutant) or extinction (in which none is). In a widely cited paper (Nature,\n2005), Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak generalize the model to populations on the\nvertices of graphs. They describe a class of graphs (called \"superstars\"), with\na parameter $k$. Superstars are designed to have an increasing fixation\nprobability as $k$ increases. They state that the probability of fixation tends\nto $1-r^{-k}$ as graphs get larger but we show that this claim is untrue as\nstated. Specifically, for $k=5$, we show that the true fixation probability (in\nthe limit, as graphs get larger) is at most $1-1/j(r)$ where\n$j(r)=\\Theta(r^4)$, contrary to the claimed result. We do believe that the\nqualitative claim of Lieberman et al.\\ --- that the fixation probability of\nsuperstars tends to 1 as $k$ increases --- is correct, and that it can probably\nbe proved along the lines of their sketch. We were able to run larger computer\nsimulations than the ones presented in their paper. However, simulations on\ngraphs of around 40,000 vertices do not support their claim. Perhaps these\ngraphs are too small to exhibit the limiting behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2012 14:13:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 16:11:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Diaz", "Josep", ""], ["Goldberg", "Leslie Ann", ""], ["Mertzios", "George B.", ""], ["Richerby", "David", ""], ["Serna", "Maria", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.0501", "submitter": "Leo Lahti", "authors": "Leo Lahti, Juha E.

The processes, their\nactivating conditions, and the associated transcriptional responses are often\nunknown. Organism-wide modeling of network activation can reveal unique and\nshared mechanisms between physiological conditions, and potentially as yet\nunknown processes. We introduce a novel approach for organism-wide discovery\nand analysis of transcriptional responses in interaction networks. The method\nsearches for local, connected regions in a network that exhibit coordinated\ntranscriptional response in a subset of conditions. Known interactions between\ngenes are used to limit the search space and to guide the analysis. Validation\non a human pathway network reveals physiologically coherent responses,\nfunctional relatedness between physiological conditions, and coordinated,\ncontext-specific regulation of the genes.

The stationary periodic\nsolution of the linear equations can be alternately expressed as an explicit\nintegral or as a Fourier series.

Adaptation helps maintain essential variables within\nacceptable bounds and allows organisms to readjust themselves to an optimum and\nnon-saturating sensitivity range when faced with a prolonged change in their\nenvironment. Recently, it was shown theoretically and experimentally that many\nadapting systems, both at the organism and single-cell level, enjoy a\nremarkable additional feature: scale invariance, meaning that the initial,\ntransient behavior remains (approximately) the same even when the background\nsignal level is scaled. In this work, we set out to investigate under what\nconditions a broadly used model of biochemical enzymatic networks will exhibit\nscale-invariant behavior. An exhaustive computational study led us to discover\na new property of surprising simplicity and generality, uniform linearizations\nwith fast output (ULFO), whose validity we show is both necessary and\nsufficient for scale invariance of enzymatic networks. Based on this study, we\ngo on to develop a mathematical explanation of how ULFO results in scale\ninvariance. Our work provides a surprisingly consistent, simple, and general\nframework for understanding this phenomenon, and results in concrete\nexperimental predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2012 21:49:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Skataric", "Maja", ""], ["Sontag", "Eduardo", ""]]}]
