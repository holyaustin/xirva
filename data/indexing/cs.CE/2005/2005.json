Inspired by recent approaches advocating\nmeasure-valued solutions (Young measures as well as their generalization to\nstatistical solutions) and their numerical approximations in fluid mechanics,\nwe propose the stochastic relaxation of the variational brittle fracture\nproblem through random perturbations of the functional. We introduce the\nconcept of stochastic solution, with the main advantage that point-to-point\ncorrelations of the crack phase fields in the underlying domain can be\ncaptured. These stochastic solutions are represented by random fields or random\nvariables with values in the classical deterministic solution spaces. In the\nnumerical experiments, we use a simple Monte Carlo approach to compute\napproximations to such stochastic solutions.

As a proof of concept, we apply these tools to the\nnon-central matrix-variate Gamma (nc-mv-Gamma) distribution, whose covariance\ntensor was so far unknown, and design a new signal representation capturing\nintra-voxel heterogeneity via a single nc-mv-Gamma distribution: the\nmatrix-variate Gamma approximation. Methods: Furthering this proof of concept,\nwe evaluate the matrix-variate Gamma approximation in silico and in vivo, in a\nhuman-brain 'tensor-valued' diffusion MRI dataset. Results: The matrix-variate\nGamma approximation fails to capture the heterogeneity arising from orientation\ndispersion and from simultaneous variances in the trace (size) and anisotropy\n(shape) of the underlying diffusion tensors, which is explained by the\nstructure of the covariance tensor associated with the nc-mv-Gamma\ndistribution. Conclusion: The matrix moments promote a more widespread use of\nmatrix-variate distributions as plausible approximations of the DTD by\nalleviating their intractability, thereby facilitating the design/validation of\nmatrix-variate microstructural techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 00:33:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Reymbaut", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12802", "submitter": "Bence Toth", "authors": "B.

It is designed for computationally intensive\napplications using an MPI multi-code partitioned scheme. The algorithm allows\nto reuse information from previous time steps, feature that has been previously\nproposed to accelerate convergence. Through algebraic manipulation, an\nefficient usage of the computational resources is achieved by: avoiding\nconstruction of dense matrices and reduce every multiplication to a\nmatrix-vector product and reusing the computationally expensive loops. This\nleads to a compact version of the original quasi-Newton algorithm. Altogether\nwith an efficient communication, in this paper we show an efficient scalability\nup to 4800 cores. Three examples with qualitatively different dynamics are\nshown to prove that the algorithm can efficiently deal with added mass\ninstability and two-field coupled problems. We also show how reusing histories\nand filtering does not necessarily makes a more robust scheme and, finally, we\nprove the necessity of this HPC version of the algorithm. The novelty of this\narticle lies in the HPC focused implementation of the algorithm, detailing how\nto fuse and combine the composing blocks to obtain an scalable MPI\nimplementation.

The\nquestion of how floating wind systems can be optimized to operate smoothly in\nharsh wind and wave conditions is the subject of the present work. An\nintegrated optimization was conducted, where the hull shape of a\nsemi-submersible, as well as the wind turbine controller were varied with the\ngoal of finding a cost-efficient design, which does not respond to wind and\nwave excitations, resulting in small structural fatigue and extreme loads. The\noptimum design was found to have a remarkably low tower-base fatigue load\nresponse and small rotor fore-aft amplitudes. Further investigations showed\nthat the reason for the good dynamic behavior is a particularly favorable\nresponse to first-order wave loads: The floating wind turbine rotates in\npitch-direction about a point close to the rotor hub and the rotor fore-aft\nmotion is almost unaffected by the wave excitation. As a result, the power\nproduction and the blade loads are not influenced by the waves. A comparable\neffect was so far known for Tension Leg Platforms but not for semi-submersible\nwind turbines. The methodology builds on a low-order simulation model, coupled\nto a parametric panel code model, a detailed viscous drag model and an\nindividually tuned blade pitch controller. The results are confirmed by the\nhigher-fidelity model FAST. A new indicator to express the optimal behavior\nthrough a single design criterion has been developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 11:39:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Lemmer", "Frank", ""], ["Yu", "Wei", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Kolja", ""], ["Cheng", "Po Wen", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13459", "submitter": "Julio Stern", "authors": "Julio Michael Stern, Carlos Alberto de Braganca Pereira, Celma de\n  Oliveira Ribeiro, Cibele Dunder, Fabio Nakano, Marcelo Lauretto", "title": "Otimizacao e Processos Estocasticos Aplicados a Economia e Financas", "comments": "in Portuguese", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Optimization and Stochastic Processes Applied to Economy and Finance -- is\nthe name of this book translated to English; It has been used at the IME-USP -\nThe Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of the University of Sao Paulo,\nsince 1993.\n  Contents: Ch.1: Linear Programming; Ch.2: Non-Linear Programming; Ch.3:\nQuadratic Programming; Ch.4: Markowitz Model; Ch.5: Dynamic Programming; Ch.6:\nLQG Estimation and Control; Ch.7: Decision Trees; Ch.8: Pension Funds; Ch.9:\nMixed Portfolios Including Derivative Contracts; Appendices: App.A: Matlab;\nApp.B: Critical-Point Software; App.C: Computational Linear Algebra; App.D:\nProbability; App.E: Computer Codes.\n  This book is written in Portuguese language.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 21:30:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Stern", "Julio Michael", ""], ["Pereira", "Carlos Alberto de Braganca", ""], ["Ribeiro", "Celma de Oliveira", ""], ["Dunder", "Cibele", ""], ["Nakano", "Fabio", ""], ["Lauretto", "Marcelo", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13461", "submitter": "Moonseop Kim", "authors": "Moonseop Kim, Guang Lin", "title": "Peri-Net-Pro: The neural processes with quantified uncertainty for crack\n  patterns", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper uses the peridynamic theory, which is well-suited to crack\nstudies, to predict the crack patterns in a moving disk and classify them\naccording to the modes and finally perform regression analysis.
