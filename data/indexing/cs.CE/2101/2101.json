A good example is to represent the time series in\nline segments which is often used as a pre-processing step for learning\nmarketing signal patterns in financial computing. In this paper, we focus on\nthe problem of computing the optimal segmentations of such time series based on\nsegmented linear regression models. The major contribution of this paper is to\ndefine the problem of Multi-Segment Linear Regression (MSLR) of computing the\noptimal segmentation of a financial time series, denoted as the MSLR problem,\nsuch that the global mean square error of segmented linear regression is\nminimized. We present an optimum algorithm with two-level dynamic programming\n(DP) design and show the optimality of OMSLR algorithm. The two-level DP design\nof OMSLR algorithm can mitigate the complexity for searching the best trading\nstrategies in financial markets.

Therefore, satellites manufacturers and mission operators\nneed to perform a disposal through a controlled re-entry, which has a higher\ncost and increased complexity. Through the design-for-demise paradigm, this\nadditional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly\ncompliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft\nsuch that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more\nvulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the\nmission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the\nsurvivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off\nsolutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise\nmeasures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris\nimpacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the\nauthors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary\ndesign solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the\nsurvivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design.

DNA sequencers, the\nmachines which perform DNA sequencing, have evolved from the size of a fridge\nto that of a mobile phone over the last two decades. The cost of sequencing a\nhuman genome also has reduced from billions of dollars to hundreds of dollars.\nDespite these improvements, DNA sequencers output hundreds or thousands of\ngigabytes of data that must be analysed on computers to discover meaningful\ninformation with biological implications. Unfortunately, the analysis\ntechniques have not kept the pace with rapidly improving sequencing\ntechnologies. Consequently, even today, the process of DNA analysis is\nperformed on high-performance computers, just as it was a couple of decades\nago. Such high-performance computers are not portable. Consequently, the full\nutility of an ultra-portable sequencer for sequencing in-the-field or at the\npoint-of-care is limited by the lack of portable lightweight analytic\ntechniques. This thesis proposes computer architecture-aware optimisation of\nDNA analysis software. DNA analysis software is inevitably convoluted due to\nthe complexity associated with biological data. Modern computer architectures\nare also complex. Performing architecture-aware optimisations requires the\nsynergistic use of knowledge from both domains, (i.e, DNA sequence analysis and\ncomputer architecture). This thesis aims to draw the two domains together. In\nthis thesis, gold-standard DNA sequence analysis workflows are systematically\nexamined for algorithmic components that cause performance bottlenecks.\nIdentified bottlenecks are resolved through architecture-aware optimisations at\ndifferent levels, i.e., memory, cache, register and processor. The optimised\nsoftware tools are used in complete end-to-end analysis workflows and their\nefficacy is demonstrated by running on prototypical embedded systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:29:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gamaarachchi", "Hasindu", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.05090", "submitter": "Daniel Hilger", "authors": "Daniel Hilger, Norbert Hosters, Fabian Key, Stefanie Elgeti and Marek\n  Behr", "title": "A novel approach to fluid-structure interaction simulations involving\n  large translation and contact", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.CE cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we present a novel method for the mesh update in flow problems\nwith moving boundaries, the phantom domain deformation mesh update method\n(PD-DMUM).

At the macroscale, fibrin forms a gel and has a mechanical\nresponse that is dictated by the mechanics of a microscale fiber network.\nHence, accurate description of fibrin gels can be achieved using representative\nvolume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete fiber networks of the\nmicroscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be efficiently used to model the\nmacroscale due to the challenges and computational demands of multiscale\ncoupling. Here, we propose the use of an artificial, fully connected neural\nnetwork (FCNN) to efficiently capture the behavior of the RVE models. The FCNN\nwas trained on 1100 fiber networks subjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The\nstress data from the RVE, together with the total energy on the fibers and the\ncondition of incompressibility of the surrounding matrix, were used to\ndetermine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy function with respect to\nthe deformation invariants. During training, the loss function was modified to\nensure convexity of the strain energy function and symmetry of its Hessian. A\ngeneral FCNN model was coded into a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the\nsoftware Abaqus. The UMAT implementation takes in the structure and parameters\nof an arbitrary FCNN as material parameters from the input file. The inputs to\nthe FCNN include the first two isochoric invariants of the deformation. The\nFCNN outputs the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the isochoric\ninvariants. In this work, the FCNN trained on the discrete fiber network data\nwas used in finite element simulations of fibrin gels using our UMAT. We\nanticipate that this work will enable further integration of machine learning\ntools with computational mechanics. It will also improve computational modeling\nof biological materials characterized by a multiscale structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Jan 2021 23:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Leng", "Yue", ""], ["Calve", "Sarah", ""], ["Tepole", "Adrian Buganza", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.11810", "submitter": "Teeratorn Kadeethum", "authors": "T.

As the conductivity of porous media can be highly heterogeneous and\nspan several orders of magnitude, we utilize the interior penalty discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) method as a full order solver to handle discontinuity and ensure\nlocal mass conservation during the offline stage. We then use POD as a data\ncompression tool and compare the nested POD technique, in which time and\nuncertain parameter domains are compressed consecutively, to the classical POD\nmethod in which all domains are compressed simultaneously. The neural networks\nare finally trained to map the set of uncertain parameters, which could\ncorrespond to material properties, boundary conditions, or geometric\ncharacteristics, to the collection of coefficients calculated from an $L^2$\nprojection over the reduced basis. We then perform a non-intrusive evaluation\nof the neural networks to obtain coefficients corresponding to new values of\nthe uncertain parameters during the online stage. We show that our framework\nprovides reasonable approximations of the DG solution, but it is significantly\nfaster. Moreover, the reduced order framework can capture sharp discontinuities\nof both displacement and pressure fields resulting from the heterogeneity in\nthe media conductivity, which is generally challenging for intrusive reduced\norder methods. The sources of error are presented, showing that the nested POD\ntechnique is computationally advantageous and still provides comparable\naccuracy to the classical POD method.

These\nvariations typically arise from surface energy dependence on temperature and/or\nconcentration. Furthermore, since the surface energy is an interfacial property\ndepending on the types of materials on either side of an interface, spatial\nvariation is required for modeling the contact angle at the triple junction\nbetween a liquid, solid and surrounding air. Our discretization is based on the\nsurface energy itself, rather than on the associated traction condition most\ncommonly used for discretization with particle methods. Our energy based\napproach automatically captures surface gradients without the explicit need to\nresolve them as in traction condition based approaches. We include an implicit\ndiscretization of thermomechanical material coupling with a novel\nparticle-based enforcement of Robin boundary conditions associated with\nconvective heating. Lastly, we design a particle resampling approach needed to\nachieve perfect conservation of linear and angular momentum with\nAffineParticle-In-Cell (APIC) [Jiang et al. 2015]. We show that our approach\nenables implicit time stepping for complex behaviors like the Marangoni effect\nand hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.
