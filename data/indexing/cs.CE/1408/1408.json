This discrete interface is used to divide the space-time\ndomain into its subdomains. An important component within this decomposition is\na new method for dividing four-dimensional prisms intersected by a piecewise\nplanar space-time interface into simplices. Such a subdivision algorithm is\nnecessary for numerical integration on the subdomains as well as on the\nspace-time interface.

The deviations between the predictions and experimental data for\nthe surface tension are of the order of 20 percent. The surface tension is\nusually overestimated by the models. For further improvements, data on the\nsurface tension can be included in the model development. A suitable strategy\nfor this is multi-criteria optimization based on Pareto sets. This is\ndemonstrated using the model for carbon dioxide as an example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2014 04:43:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Werth", "Stephan", ""], ["St\u00f6bener", "Katrin", ""], ["Klein", "Peter", ""], ["K\u00fcfer", "Karl-Heinz", ""], ["Horsch", "Martin", ""], ["Hasse", "Hans", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4965", "submitter": "Gordon Inggs", "authors": "Gordon Inggs, David Thomas, Wayne Luk", "title": "A Domain Specific Approach to Heterogeneous Computing: From Availability\n  to Accessibility", "comments": "Presented at First International Workshop on FPGAs for Software\n  Programmers (FSP 2014) (arXiv:1408.4423)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "FSP/2014/11", "categories": "cs.CE cs.DC cs.PF cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We advocate a domain specific software development methodology for\nheterogeneous computing platforms such as Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs.

We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use\ndifferential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients.

Next we include\nthese GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more\ncomplex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we\ntruncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty\nterm, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by\nincorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find\nminimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:56:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia-Bernardo", "Javier", ""], ["Eppstein", "Margaret J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5405", "submitter": "Khalid Raza", "authors": "Khalid Raza and Mansaf Alam", "title": "Recurrent Neural Network Based Hybrid Model of Gene Regulatory Network", "comments": "18 pages, 9 figures and 4 tables", "journal-ref": "Computational Biology and Chemistry, 64: 322-334, 2016", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2016.08.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.CE q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Systems biology is an emerging interdisciplinary area of research that\nfocuses on study of complex interactions in a biological system, such as gene\nregulatory networks. The discovery of gene regulatory networks leads to a wide\nrange of applications, such as pathways related to a disease that can unveil in\nwhat way the disease acts and provide novel tentative drug targets. In\naddition, the development of biological models from discovered networks or\npathways can help to predict the responses to disease and can be much useful\nfor the novel drug development and treatments. The inference of regulatory\nnetworks from biological data is still in its infancy stage. This paper\nproposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based gene regulatory network (GRN)\nmodel hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in\nbackpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural\nnetwork that gives a better settlement between the biological closeness and\nmathematical flexibility to model GRN. The RNN is able to capture complex,\nnon-linear and dynamic relationship among variables. Gene expression data are\ninherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation even in noisy\ndata. Hence, non-linear version of Kalman filter, i.e., generalized extended\nKalman filter has been applied for weight update during network training. The\ndeveloped model has been applied on DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and\ntwo synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We compared our results with other\nstate-of-the-art techniques that show superiority of our model.

Thus, there have been many paradigms\ndeveloped to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious\ncombinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of $k$ to vary; having a\nlarger value of $k$ where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of $k$\nwhere the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One\nopen problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the\nvalue of $k$ prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values\nof $k$ can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in\na phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple\nvalues of $k$ practical for genome assembly.\n  Results: We present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses\nhomology information to choose a value of $k$ for each read prior to the de\nBruijn graph construction. The chosen $k$ is optimal if there are no sequencing\nerrors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the\nconstruction of the {\\em maximal sequence landscape}, which is a data structure\nthat stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated\nsubstring containing that position. In particular, we show the maximal sequence\nlandscape can be constructed in $O(n + n \\log n)$-time and $O(n)$-space.\nHyDA-Vista first constructs the maximal sequence landscape for a homologous\ngenome. The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of $k$\nare assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the\nalignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn\ngraph construction method. Our results and comparison to other assemblers\ndemonstrate that HyDA-Vista achieves the best assembly of {\\em E. coli} before\nrepeat resolution or scaffolding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Aug 2014 11:26:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Razavi", "Seyed Basir Shariat", ""], ["Tabrizi", "Narjes Sadat Movahedi", ""], ["Chitsaz", "Hamidreza", ""], ["Boucher", "Christina", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5634", "submitter": "R.
