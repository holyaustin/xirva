Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) often\ndoes not protect against knee OA development. Accordingly, a multiscale\nformulation for Data Driven Prognosis (DDP) of post ACLR is developed. Unlike\ntraditional predictive strategies that require controlled off-line measurements\nor training for determination of constitutive parameters to derive the\ntransitional statistics, the proposed DDP algorithm relies solely on in situ\nmeasurements. The proposed DDP scheme is capable of predicting onset of\ninstabilities. Since the need for off line testing (or training) is obviated,\nit can be easily implemented for ACLR, where such controlled a priori testing\nis almost impossible to conduct. The DDP algorithm facilitates hierarchical\nhandling of the large data set, and can assess the state of recovery in post\nACLR conditions based on data collected from stair ascent and descent exercises\nof subjects. The DDP algorithm identifies inefficient knee varus motion and\nknee rotation as primary difficulties experienced by some of the post ACLR\npopulation. In such cases, levels of energy dissipation rate at the knee, and\nits fluctuation may be used as measures for assessing progress after ACL\nreconstruction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 22:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chandra", "Abhijit", ""], ["Kar", "Oliva", ""], ["Wu", "Kuan-Chuen", ""], ["Hall", "Michelle", ""], ["Gillette", "Jason", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.0416", "submitter": "Sebastian Meyer", "authors": "Sebastian Meyer, Leonhard Held, Michael H\\\"ohle", "title": "Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Epidemic Phenomena Using the R Package\n  surveillance", "comments": "53 pages, 20 figures, package homepage:\n  http://surveillance.r-forge.r-project.org/", "journal-ref": "Journal of Statistical Software (2017); 77 (11): 1-55", "doi": "10.18637/jss.v077.i11", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO cs.CE physics.data-an stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The availability of geocoded health data and the inherent temporal structure\nof communicable diseases have led to an increased interest in statistical\nmodels and software for spatio-temporal data with epidemic features.

Most of the traditional techniques\nrequire a model structure to be defined apriori and in case of helicopter\ndynamics, this is difficult due to its complexity and the interplay between\nvarious subsystems.To overcome this difficulty, non-parametric approaches are\ncommonly adopted for helicopter system identification. Artificial Neural\nNetwork are a widely used class of algorithms for non-parametric system\nidentification, among them, the Nonlinear Auto Regressive eXogeneous input\nnetwork (NARX) model is very popular, but it also necessitates some in depth\nknowledge regarding the system being modeled. There have been many approaches\nproposed to circumvent this and yet still retain the advantageous\ncharacteristics. In this paper we carry out an extensive study of one such\nnewly proposed approach using a modified NARX model with a two tiered,\nexternally driven recurrent neural network architecture. This is coupled with\nan outer optimization routine for evolving the order of the system. This\ngeneric architecture is comprehensively explored to ascertain its usability and\ncritically asses its potential.

This limits the\napplicability of two-field preconditioners in certain regimes of practical\ninterest. We address this issue by reformulating the governing equations as a\nthree-field problem, which removes a term that was problematic in the two-field\nformulation in favour of an additional equation for a pressure-like field. For\nthe three-field problem, we develop and analyse new preconditioners and we show\nnumerically that they are optimal in terms of problem size and less sensitive\nto model parameters, compared to the two-field preconditioner. This extends the\napplicability of optimal preconditioners for coupled mantle/magma dynamics into\nparameter regimes of physical interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 14:28:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 18:51:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Rhebergen", "Sander", ""], ["Wells", "Garth N.", ""], ["Wathen", "Andrew J.", ""], ["Katz", "Richard F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.5890", "submitter": "Martin Muggli", "authors": "Martin D.

As a non-gradient method, PTO is simple to\nunderstand, easy to implement, and is also efficient and accurate at the same\ntime. It is implemented into two MATLAB programs to solve the stress\nconstrained and minimum compliance problems. Descriptions of the algorithm and\ncomputer programs are provided in detail. The method is applied to solve three\nnumerical examples for both types of problems. The method shows comparable\nefficiency and accuracy with an existing gradient optimality criteria method.\nAlso, the PTO stress constrained algorithm and minimum compliance algorithm are\ncompared by feeding output from one algorithm to the other in an alternative\nmanner, where the former yields lower maximum stress and volume fraction but\nhigher compliance compared to the latter. Advantages and disadvantages of the\nproposed method and future works are discussed.

In this paper, we model\nthe problem of mitigating water hammer during valve closure by an optimal\nboundary control problem involving a nonlinear hyperbolic PDE system that\ndescribes the fluid flow along the pipeline. The control variable in this\nsystem represents the valve boundary actuation implemented at the pipeline\nterminus. To solve the boundary control problem, we first use {the method of\nlines} to obtain a finite-dimensional ODE model based on the original PDE\nsystem. Then, for the boundary control design, we apply the control\nparameterization method to obtain an approximate optimal parameter selection\nproblem that can be solved using nonlinear optimization techniques such as\nSequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). We conclude the paper with simulation\nresults demonstrating the capability of optimal boundary control to\nsignificantly reduce flow fluctuation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 03:45:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Tehuan", ""], ["Xu", "Chao", ""], ["Ren", "Zhigang", ""], ["Loxton", "Ryan", ""]]}]
