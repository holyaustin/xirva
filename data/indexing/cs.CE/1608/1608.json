The goal is\nto improve the accuracy of electronic nose measurements for continuous\nmonitoring by processing data from simultaneous readings of environmental\nhumidity and temperature. The electronic nose setup built for this study\nincluded eight metal-oxide sensors, temperature and humidity sensors with a\nwireless communication link to external computer. This wireless electronic nose\nwas used to monitor air for two years in the residence of one of the authors\nand it collected data continuously during 537 days with a sampling rate of 1\nsamples per second. To estimate the effects of variations in air humidity and\ntemperature on the chemical sensors signals, we used a standard energy band\nmodel for an n-type metal-oxide (MOX) gas sensor. The main assumption of the\nmodel is that variations in sensor conductivity can be expressed as a nonlinear\nfunction of changes in the semiconductor energy bands in the presence of\nexternal humidity and temperature variations. Fitting this model to the\ncollected data, we confirmed that the most statistically significant factors\nare humidity changes and correlated changes of temperature and humidity. This\nsimple model achieves excellent accuracy with a coefficient of determination\n$R^2$ close to 1. To show how the humidity-temperature correction model works\nfor gas discrimination, we constructed a model for online discrimination among\nbanana, wine and baseline response. This shows that pattern recognition\nalgorithms improve performance and reliability by including the filtered signal\nof the chemical sensors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 23:54:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 03:01:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Huerta", "Ramon", ""], ["Mosqueiro", "Thiago S.", ""], ["Fonollosa", "Jordi", ""], ["Rulkov", "Nikolai F", ""], ["Rodriguez-Lujan", "Irene", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02375", "submitter": "Dan Wang", "authors": "Dan Wang, Shuaicheng Li, Fei Guo, Lusheng Wang", "title": "Core-genome scaffold comparison reveals the prevalence that inversion\n  events are associated with pairs of inverted repeats", "comments": "8 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: Genome rearrangement plays an important role in evolutionary\nbiology and has profound impacts on phenotype in organisms ranging from\nmicrobes to humans. The mechanisms for genome rearrangement events remain\nunclear. Lots of comparisons have been conducted among different species. To\nreveal the mechanisms for rearrangement events, comparison of different\nindividuals/strains within the same species or genus (pan-genomes) is more\nhelpful since they are much closer to each other. Results: We study the\nmechanism for inversion events via core-genome scaffold comparison of different\nstrains within the same species. We focus on two kinds of bacteria, Pseudomonas\naeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and investigate the inversion events among\ndifferent strains of the same specie. We find an interesting phenomenon that\nlong (larger than 10,000 bp) inversion regions are flanked by a pair of\nInverted Repeats (IRs) (with lengths ranging from 385 bp to 27476 bp) which are\noften Insertion Sequences (ISs).This mechanism can also explain why the\nbreakpoint reuses for inversion events happen. We study the prevalence of the\nphenomenon and find that it is a major mechanism for inversions. The other\nobservation is that for different rearrangement events such as transposition\nand inverted block interchange, the two ends of the swapped regions are also\nassociated with repeats so that after the rearrangement operations the two ends\nof the swapped regions remain unchanged. To our knowledge, this is the first\ntime such a phenomenon is reported for transposition event.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 10:36:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Dan", ""], ["Li", "Shuaicheng", ""], ["Guo", "Fei", ""], ["Wang", "Lusheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02567", "submitter": "Nathan Roberts", "authors": "Nathan V.
