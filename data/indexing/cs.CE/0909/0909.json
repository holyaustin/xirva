It is shown numerically that, compared to single\nbalancing tasks, balancing tasks coupled by mechanical structures exhibit\nenhanced stability against balancing errors in terms of both amplitude and\nvelocity and also improve the tracking ability of the controllers. We then\nperform an experiment in which numerical pseudo-neural controllers are replaced\nwith natural human balancing tasks carried out using computer mice. The results\nreveal that the coupling structure generates asymmetric tracking abilities in\nsubjects whose tracking abilities are nearly symmetric in their single\nbalancing tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2009 09:38:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2010 00:02:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Yoshida", "Katsutoshi", ""], ["Higeta", "Atsushi", ""], ["Watanabe", "Shinichi", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1405", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Mohsen lashkargir, S.

Biclustering\nis a very useful data mining technique for discovering genes which have similar\nbehavior. In microarray data, several objectives have to be optimized\nsimultaneously and often these objectives are in conflict with each other. A\nMulti Objective model is capable of solving such problems. Our method proposes\na Hybrid algorithm which is based on the Multi Objective Particle Swarm\nOptimization for discovering biclusters in gene expression data. In our method,\nwe will consider a low level of overlapping amongst the biclusters and try to\ncover all elements of the gene expression matrix. Experimental results in the\nbench mark database show a significant improvement in both overlap among\nbiclusters and coverage of elements in the gene expression matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2009 06:43:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["lashkargir", "Mohsen", ""], ["Monadjemi", "S.

The grid consists of large number of\ngenerator and consumer nodes. The net power consumption is determined by the\ndifference between the gross consumption and the level of renewable generation.\nThe gross consumption is drawn from a narrow distribution representing the\npredictability of aggregated loads, and we consider two different distributions\nrepresenting wind and solar resources. Each generator is connected to D\nconsumers, and redundancy is built in by connecting R of these consumers to\nother generators. The lines are switchable so that at any instance each\nconsumer is connected to a single generator.
