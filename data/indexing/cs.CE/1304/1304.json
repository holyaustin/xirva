In order to extract an economically useful amount of\npower, hundreds of tidal turbines must typically be deployed in an array. This\nnaturally leads to the question of how these turbines should be configured to\nextract the maximum possible power: the positioning and the individual tuning\nof the turbines could significantly influence the extracted power, and hence is\nof major economic interest. However, manual optimisation is difficult due to\nlegal site constraints, nonlinear interactions of the turbine wakes, and the\ncubic dependence of the power on the flow speed. The novel contribution of this\npaper is the formulation of this problem as an optimisation problem constrained\nby a physical model, which is then solved using an efficient gradient-based\noptimisation algorithm. In each optimisation iteration, a two-dimensional\nfinite element shallow water model predicts the flow and the performance of the\ncurrent array configuration. The gradient of the power extracted with respect\nto the turbine positions and their tuning parameters is then computed in a\nfraction of the time taken for a flow solution by solving the associated\nadjoint equations. These equations propagate causality backwards through the\ncomputation, from the power extracted back to the turbine positions and the\ntuning parameters. This yields the gradient at a cost almost independent of the\nnumber of turbines, which is crucial for any practical application. The utility\nof the approach is demonstrated by optimising turbine arrays in four idealised\nscenarios and a more realistic case with up to 256 turbines in the Inner Sound\nof the Pentland Firth, Scotland.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Apr 2013 17:20:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 12 Oct 2013 18:48:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Funke", "S.

The major obstacle to a routine\napplication of this class of models is, however, the calibration of\nmicroplane-related constants from macroscopic data. The goal of this paper is\ntwo-fold: (i) to introduce the basic ingredients of a robust inverse procedure\nfor the determination of dominant parameters of the M4 model proposed by Bazant\nand co-workers based on cascade Artificial Neural Networks trained by\nEvolutionary Algorithm and (ii) to validate the proposed methodology against a\nrepresentative set of experimental data. The obtained results demonstrate that\nthe soft computing-based method is capable of delivering the searched response\nwith an accuracy comparable to the values obtained by expert users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 08:11:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 10:10:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kucerova", "A.", ""], ["Leps", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.6476", "submitter": "Noah Daniels", "authors": "Noah M.

Since structure is typically more\nconserved than sequence over long evolutionary distances, recognizing remote\nprotein homologs from their sequence poses a challenge.\n  We first consider all proteins of known three-dimensional structure, and\nexplore how they cluster according to different levels of homology. An\nautomatic computational method reasonably approximates a human-curated\nhierarchical organization of proteins according to their degree of homology.\n  Next, we return to homology prediction, based only on the one-dimensional\namino acid sequence of a protein. Menke, Berger, and Cowen proposed a Markov\nrandom field model to predict remote homology for beta-structural proteins, but\ntheir formulation was computationally intractable on many beta-strand\ntopologies.\n  We show two different approaches to approximate this random field, both of\nwhich make it computationally tractable, for the first time, on all protein\nfolds. One method simplifies the random field itself, while the other retains\nthe full random field, but approximates the solution through stochastic search.\nBoth methods achieve improvements over the state of the art in remote homology\ndetection for beta-structural protein folds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2013 03:29:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Daniels", "Noah M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.6613", "submitter": "Tom Kelsey", "authors": "Thomas W.

By\nsearching the published literature for ovarian volume in healthy females, and\nusing our own data from multiple sources (combined n = 59,994) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of ovarian volume from\nconception to 82 years of age. This model shows that 69% of the variation in\novarian volume is due to age alone. We have shown that in the average case\novarian volume rises from 0.7 mL (95% CI 0.4 -- 1.1 mL) at 2 years of age to a\npeak of 7.7 mL (95% CI 6.5 -- 9.2 mL) at 20 years of age with a subsequent\ndecline to about 2.8mL (95% CI 2.7 -- 2.9 mL) at the menopause and smaller\nvolumes thereafter. Our model allows us to generate normal values and ranges\nfor ovarian volume throughout life.

These two tasks are tightly coupled because underlying\nassociations between genetic variations and phenotypical features contain the\nbiological basis for a disease. While a variety of sparse models have been\napplied for disease diagnosis and canonical correlation analysis and its\nextensions have bee widely used in association studies (e.g., eQTL analysis),\nthese two tasks have been treated separately. To unify these two tasks, we\npresent a new sparse Bayesian approach for joint association study and disease\ndiagnosis. In this approach, common latent features are extracted from\ndifferent data sources based on sparse projection matrices and used to predict\nmultiple disease severity levels based on Gaussian process ordinal regression;\nin return, the disease status is used to guide the discovery of relationships\nbetween the data sources. The sparse projection matrices not only reveal\ninteractions between data sources but also select groups of biomarkers related\nto the disease. To learn the model from data, we develop an efficient\nvariational expectation maximization algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate\nthat our approach achieves higher accuracy in both predicting ordinal labels\nand discovering associations between data sources than alternative methods.
