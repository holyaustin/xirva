That is, we aim to select both the network structure and\nthe line conductances (line sizes) so as to optimize the trade-off between\nnetwork efficiency (low power dissipation within the transmission network) and\nthe cost to build the network. We begin with a convex optimization method based\non the paper ``Minimizing Effective Resistance of a Graph'' [Ghosh, Boyd \\&\nSaberi]. We show that this (DC) resistive network method can be adapted to the\ncontext of AC power flow. However, that does not address the combinatorial\naspect of selecting network structure. We approach this problem as selecting a\nsubgraph within an over-complete network, posed as minimizing the (convex)\nnetwork power dissipation plus a non-convex cost on line conductances that\nencourages sparse networks where many line conductances are set to zero. We\ndevelop a heuristic approach to solve this non-convex optimization problem\nusing: (1) a continuation method to interpolate from the smooth, convex problem\nto the (non-smooth, non-convex) combinatorial problem, (2) the\nmajorization-minimization algorithm to perform the necessary intermediate\nsmooth but non-convex optimization steps. Ultimately, this involves solving a\nsequence of convex optimization problems in which we iteratively reweight a\nlinear cost on line conductances to fit the actual non-convex cost. Several\nexamples are presented which suggest that the overall method is a good\nheuristic for network design. We also consider how to obtain sparse networks\nthat are still robust against failures of lines and/or generators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2010 23:07:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 20:25:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "Jason K.", ""], ["Chertkov", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3147", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Uwe Aickelin", "title": "Genetic Algorithms for Multiple-Choice Problems", "comments": "258 pages, PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea)", "journal-ref": "PhD thesis, University of Wales (Swansea), 1999", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This thesis investigates the use of problem-specific knowledge to enhance a\ngenetic algorithm approach to multiple-choice optimisation problems.It shows\nthat such information can significantly enhance performance, but that the\nchoice of information and the way it is included are important factors for\nsuccess.Two multiple-choice problems are considered.The first is constructing a\nfeasible nurse roster that considers as many requests as possible.In the second\nproblem, shops are allocated to locations in a mall subject to constraints and\nmaximising the overall income.Genetic algorithms are chosen for their\nwell-known robustness and ability to solve large and complex discrete\noptimisation problems.However, a survey of the literature reveals room for\nfurther research into generic ways to include constraints into a genetic\nalgorithm framework.Hence, the main theme of this work is to balance\nfeasibility and cost of solutions.In particular, co-operative co-evolution with\nhierarchical sub-populations, problem structure exploiting repair schemes and\nindirect genetic algorithms with self-adjusting decoder functions are\nidentified as promising approaches.The research starts by applying standard\ngenetic algorithms to the problems and explaining the failure of such\napproaches due to epistasis.To overcome this, problem-specific information is\nadded in a variety of ways, some of which are designed to increase the number\nof feasible solutions found whilst others are intended to improve the quality\nof such solutions.As well as a theoretical discussion as to the underlying\nreasons for using each operator,extensive computational experiments are carried\nout on a variety of data.These show that the indirect approach relies less on\nproblem structure and hence is easier to implement and superior in solution\nquality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Apr 2010 10:16:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3571", "submitter": "Vishal Goyal", "authors": "Vikas Gupta, K.S.Kasana, Puneet Tandon", "title": "Computer Aided Design Modeling for Heterogeneous Objects", "comments": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues online at\n  http://ijcsi.org/articles/Computer-Aided-Design-Modeling-for-Heterogeneous-Objects.php", "journal-ref": "IJCSI, Volume 7, Issue 2, March 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Heterogeneous object design is an active research area in recent years.
