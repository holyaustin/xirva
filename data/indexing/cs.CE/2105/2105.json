These simulators usually require\ndedicated software development and maintenance, and suffer low efficiency from\na runtime and memory standpoint. Therefore, developing cost-effective,\ndata-driven models can become a practical choice since deep learning approaches\nare considered to be universal approximations. In this paper, we describe a\ngradient-based deep neural network (GDNN) constrained by the physics related to\nmultiphase flow in porous media. We tackle the nonlinearity of flow in porous\nmedia induced by rock heterogeneity, fluid properties and fluid-rock\ninteractions by decomposing the nonlinear PDEs into a dictionary of elementary\ndifferential operators. We use a combination of operators to handle rock\nspatial heterogeneity and fluid flow by advection. Since the augmented\ndifferential operators are inherently related to the physics of fluid flow, we\ntreat them as first principles prior knowledge to regularize the GDNN training.\nWe use the example of pressure management at geologic CO2 storage sites, where\nCO2 is injected in saline aquifers and brine is produced, and apply GDNN to\nconstruct a predictive model that is trained from physics-based simulation data\nand emulates the physics process. We demonstrate that GDNN can effectively\npredict the nonlinear patterns of subsurface responses including the\ntemporal-spatial evolution of the pressure and saturation plumes. GDNN has\ngreat potential to tackle challenging problems that are governed by highly\nnonlinear physics and enables development of data-driven models with higher\nfidelity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 02:14:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Bicheng", ""], ["Harp", "Dylan Robert", ""], ["Pawar", "Rajesh J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.02782", "submitter": "Johannes Rude Jensen Mr.", "authors": "Johannes Rude Jensen, Mohsen Pourpouneh, Kurt Nielsen, Omri Ross", "title": "The Homogenous Properties of Automated Market Makers", "comments": "Automated Market Maker, DeFi, Blockchain, Constant Function Market\n  Maker", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR cs.CE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Automated market makers (AMM) have grown to obtain significant market share\nwithin the cryptocurrency ecosystem, resulting in a proliferation of new\nproducts pursuing exotic strategies for horizontal differentiation.

This task, among others, is frequently encountered in the\nnumerical simulation of three-phase flows when resorting to the geometric\nVolume-of-Fluid method. For two-phase flows, the recent work of Kromer and\nBothe (arXiv:2101.03861) addresses the positioning of a single plane by\ncombining an implicit bracketing of the sought position with up to third-order\nderivatives of the volume fraction. An analogous application of their highly\nefficient root-finding scheme to three-material configurations requires\ncomputing the volume of a twice truncated arbitrary polyhedron. The present\nmanuscript achieves this by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence\ntheorem in appropriate form, which allows to compute the volume as a sum of\nquantities associated to the faces of the original polyhedron. With a suitable\nchoice of the coordinate origin, accounting for the sequential character of the\ntruncation, the volume parametrization becomes co-moving with respect to the\nplanes. This eliminates the necessity to establish topological connectivity and\ntetrahedron decomposition after each truncation. After a detailed mathematical\ndescription of the concept, we conduct a series of carefully designed numerical\nexperiments to assess the performance in terms of polyhedron truncations. The\nhigh efficiency of the two-phase positioning persists for sequential\napplication, thereby being robust with respect to input data and possible\nintersection topologies.

Through careful\nconstruction of basis functions to expand electric fields and the equivalent\ncurrent density, the discretized formulation is compatible on the interface of\nthe SIE and PDE domain. Finally, its accuracy and efficiency are validated\nthrough two numerical examples. Results show that the proposed SIE-PDE\nformulation can obtain accurate results including both near and far fields, and\nsignificant performance improvements in terms of CPU time and memory\nconsumption compared with the FEM are achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2021 08:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Aipeng", ""], ["Zhu", "Zekun", ""], ["Yang", "Shunchuan", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14831", "submitter": "Chennakesava Kadapa", "authors": "Chennakesava Kadapa", "title": "Insights into the performance of loosely-coupled FSI schemes based on\n  Robin boundary conditions", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NA math.NA", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Robin boundary conditions are a natural consequence of employing Nitsche's\nmethod for imposing the kinematic velocity constraint at the fluid-solid\ninterface.
