Research on the\npossible application of such automatons to detect and control cancer cells in\nthe human body are greatly focused MRI and PET scans finds the affected regions\nat the tissue level even as we can find the affected regions at the cellular\nlevel using the framework. The AIA may be designed to ensure optimum\nutilization as they record and might control the presence of affected cells in\na human body. The proposed models and techniques can be generalized and used in\nany application where cells are injured or affected by some disease or\naccident. The best method to import AIA into the body without surgery or\ninjection is to insert small pill like automata, carrying material viz drugs or\nleukocytes that is needed to correct the infection. In this process, the AIA\ncan be compared to nano pills to deliver or support therapy. NanoHive\nsimulation software was used to validate the framework of this paper. The\nexisting nanomedicine models such as obstacle avoidance algorithm based models\n(Hla K H S et al 2008) and the framework in this model were tested in different\nsimulation based experiments. The existing models such as obstacle avoidance\nbased models failed in complex environmental conditions (such as changing\nenvironmental conditions, presence of semi-solid particles, etc) while the\nmodel in this paper executed its framework successfully.Come systems biology,\nthis field of automatons deserves a bigger leap of understanding especially\nwhen pharmacogenomics is at its peak. The results also indicate the importance\nof artificial intelligence and other computational capabilities in the proposed\nmodel for the successful detection of affected cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 20:11:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Dundas", "Jitesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1128", "submitter": "Seeja K.

However, due to the unstable, noncrystalline\nand insoluble nature of the amyloid fibril, to date structural information on\nAGAAAAGA region (113-120) has been very limited. This region falls just within\nthe N-terminal unstructured region PrP (1-123) of prion proteins.

Under\nthis background, this paper introduces a novel approach of the canonical dual\ntheory to address the 3D atomic-resolution structure of prion AGAAAAGA amyloid\nfibrils. The novel and powerful canonical dual computational approach\nintroduced in this paper is for the molecular modeling of prion AGAAAAGA\namyloid fibrils, and that the optimal atomic-resolution structures of prion\nAGAAAAGA amyloid fibils presented in this paper are useful for the drive to\nfind treatments for prion diseases in the field of medicinal chemistry.\nOverall, this paper presents an important method and provides useful\ninformation for treatments of prion diseases.

To analysis the fluid flow complexity in fracture networks with\nrespect to the variation of connectivity patterns, two different approaches are\nemployed, namely, the Lattice Boltzmann method and graph theory. The Lattice\nBoltzmann method is used to show the sensitivity of the permeability and fluid\nvelocity distribution to synthetic fracture networks' connectivity patterns.\nFurthermore, the fracture networks are mapped into the graphs, and the\ncharacteristics of these graphs are compared to the main spatial fracture\nnetworks. Among different characteristics of networks, we distinguish the\nmodularity of networks and sub-graphs distributions. We map the flow regimes\ninto the proper regions of the network's modularity space. Also, for each type\nof fluid regime, corresponding motifs shapes are scaled. Implemented power law\ndistributions of fracture length in spatial fracture networks yielded the same\nnode's degree distribution in transformed networks. Two general spatial\nnetworks are considered: random networks and networks with \"hubness\" properties\nmimicking a spatial damage zone (both with power law distribution of fracture\nlength). In the first case, the fractures are embedded in uniformly distributed\nfracture sets; the second case covers spatial fracture zones. We prove\nnumerically that the abnormal change (transition) in permeability is controlled\nby the hub growth rate. Also, comparing LBM results with the characteristic\nmean length of transformed networks' links shows a reverse relationship between\nthe aforementioned parameters. In addition, the abnormalities in advection\nthrough nodes are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2011 12:28:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 02:27:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ghaffari", "H.
