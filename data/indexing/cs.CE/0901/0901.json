In this paper we define a class of stochastic\nvolatility models that uses opening and closing prices along with the minimum\nand maximum prices within a trading period to infer the dynamics underlying the\nvolatility process of asset prices and compares it with similar models that\nhave been previously presented in the literature. The paper also discusses\nsequential Monte Carlo algorithms to fit this class of models and illustrates\nits features using both a simulation study and data form the SP500 index.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Jan 2009 21:08:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Abel", ""], ["Gzyl", "Henryk", ""], ["Molina", "German", ""], ["ter Horst", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1945", "submitter": "Michel Fliess", "authors": "Michel Fliess (LIX, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), C\\'edric Join\n  (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, CRAN)", "title": "A mathematical proof of the existence of trends in financial time series", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Systems Theory: Modelling, Analysis and Control (2009) 43-62", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.CE math.CA math.PR q-fin.CP stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We are settling a longstanding quarrel in quantitative finance by proving the\nexistence of trends in financial time series thanks to a theorem due to P.\nCartier and Y.
