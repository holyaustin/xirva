Using spatio-temporal analysis of vehicular mobility, promising\nsolutions can be proposed to alleviate these major challenges, utilizing shared\nmobility and crowd-sourcing. The rise of transportation networks (e.g. Uber,\nLyft), is a mere beginning to shared mobility. In this paper, we address\nproblems of trip representation and matching. Particularly, we study a\nreal-world dataset of trips (from Cologne, Germany), from spatial and temporal\nperspectives. Comparison of trajectories is desired for applications relying on\nspatio-temporal phenomena. For that purpose, we present a novel combined\nspatio-temporal similarity score, based on the weighted geometric mean (WGM)\nand conduct experiments on its applicability and strengths. First, we use the\nscore to find clusters of trips that were spatially and/or temporally separable\nusing spectral clustering. The score is then used in a real-time matching of\ntrips for Catch-a-Ride (CaR) and CarPooling (CP) scenarios. CaR and CP achieve\n$\\approx40\\%$ and $\\approx25\\%$ decrease in traveled distances respectively, at\nthe cost of moving to pick-up and from drop-off locations (i.e. drivers going\non average $<700m$ out of their way on pick-up and drop-off for CP).\nAdditionally, a comparison with the metrics available in the literature is\npresented on CaR scenario. We find that main advantages of WGM include the\nflexibility to favor time or space components, and linearity of runtime\ncomplexity.

Specialised fast algorithms for efficient bubble search are needed\nfor coloured de bruijn graph variant calling applications. In coloured de\nBruijn graphs, bubble paths coverages are used in downstream variants calling\nanalysis. Results: In this paper, we introduce a fast parallel graph search for\ndifferent K-mer cycle sizes. Coloured path coverages are used for SNP\nprediction. The graph search method uses a combined multi-node and multi-core\ndesign to speeds up cycles enumeration. The search algorithm uses an index\nextracted from the raw assembly of a coloured de Bruijn graph stored in a hash\ntable.

Traditional solutions for\nstock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of\ndeep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a\npromising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning\nsolutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting\nthe best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically\nformulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a\nregression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely\ntreat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich\nrelations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same\nsector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.\nIn this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational\nStock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing\nsolutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock\nranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The\nkey novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network\nmodeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal\nevolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform\nback-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method.

Classically, objects are defined by a Boundary Representation\n(B-Rep), where only the objects' surfaces with their corresponding edges and\nnodes are stored. One disadvantage concerning a numerical simulation is that\nB-Rep models are not necessarily watertight. These 'dirty geometries' cause\nmajor difficulties in computational analysis because even basic geometric\noperations such as point-in-membership tests fail, not to mention meshing as\nrequired by classical boundary conforming finite element methods.\nAlternatively, objects may be represented by Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG),\nwhich is strongly related to Procedural Modeling (PM). In this context, the\nmodel is created using Boolean operations on primitives. The modeling process\nis then either stored as a sequence (PM), or as a construction tree (CSG). In\ncontrast to B-Rep models, CSG models are intrinsically water-tight. To run a\nfinite element simulation on a water-tight CSG model, two alternatives are\npossible: (i) it can either be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite\nelement mesh or (ii) its implicit description can be used directly by applying\nan embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method (FCM). In this\ncontribution, we present a design-through analysis methodology using CSG and\nFCM. A crucial point in FCM is a fast and reliable point-in-membership test\nwhich can be directly derived from the CSG model.

Specifically, we introduced a\nclassifier to distinguish cancer types using somatic mutations obtained from\nwhole-exome sequencing data. Mutations were identified from multiple cancers\nand scored using SIFT, PP2, and CADD, and grouped at the individual gene level.\nThe nsNMF was then applied to reduce dimensionality and to obtain coefficient\nand basis matrices. A feature matrix was derived from the obtained matrices to\ntrain a classifier for cancer type classification with the SVM model. We have\ndemonstrated that the classifier was able to distinguish the cancer types with\nreasonable accuracy. In five-fold cross-validations using mutation counts as\nfeatures, the average prediction accuracy was 77.1% (SEM=0.1%), significantly\noutperforming baselines and outperforming models using mutation scores as\nfeatures.

Several approaches have been developed to\novercome this time-consuming step, e.g. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which\napplies the shape functions used for the geometry description (typically\nB-Splines and NURBS) directly to the numerical analysis. In contrast to IGA,\nwhich deals with boundary represented models (B-Rep), our approach focuses on\nparametric volumetric models such as Constructive Solid Geometries (CSG). These\nmodels have several advantages, as their geometry description is inherently\nwatertight and they provide a description of the model's interior.
