Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to obtain the optimum cutting\nparameters by minimizing the unit production cost for a given amount of\nmaterial removal. Cutting speed, feed and depth of cut for the finish and rough\npasses are the cutting parameters. An equal depth of cut for roughing passes\nhas been considered. A lookup table containing the feasible combinations of\ndepth of cut in finish and rough passes is generated so as to reduce the number\nof variables by one. The resulting mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem\nis solved in a single step using GA. The entire technique is demonstrated in a\ncase study. Post optimality analysis of the example problem is done to develop\na strategy for optimizing without running GA again for different values of\ntotal depth of cut.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2009 18:29:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sourabh", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1037", "submitter": "Anna Kucerova", "authors": "A.

First, we present a non-standard formulation of the\noptimal design and optimal control problems, relying on the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers in order to make the mechanics state variables independent from\neither design or control variables and thus provide the most general basis for\ndeveloping the best possible solution procedure. Two different solution\nprocedures are then explored, one based on the diffuse approximation of\nresponse function and gradient method and the other one based on genetic\nalgorithm.
