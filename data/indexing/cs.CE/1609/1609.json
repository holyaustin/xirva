It aims at the proposal of novel formulations of Kirchhoff-Love\ntype, a detailed review of existing formulations of Kirchhoff-Love and\nSimo-Reissner type as well as a careful evaluation and comparison of the\nproposed and existing formulations. Two different rotation interpolation\nschemes with strong or weak Kirchhoff constraint enforcement, respectively, as\nwell as two different choices of nodal triad parametrizations in terms of\nrotation or tangent vectors are proposed. The combination of these schemes\nleads to four novel finite element variants, all of them based on a\nC1-continuous Hermite interpolation of the beam centerline. Essential\nrequirements such as representability of general 3D, large-deformation, dynamic\nproblems involving slender beams with arbitrary initial curvatures and\nanisotropic cross-section shapes or preservation of objectivity and\npath-independence will be investigated analytically and verified numerically\nfor the different formulations. It will be shown that the geometrically exact\nKirchhoff-Love beam elements proposed in this work are the first ones of this\ntype that fulfill all the considered requirements. On the contrary,\nSimo-Reissner type formulations fulfilling these requirements can be found in\nthe literature very well. However, it will be argued that the shear-free\nKirchhoff-Love formulations can provide considerable numerical advantages when\napplied to highly slender beams. Concretely, several representative numerical\ntest cases confirm that the proposed Kirchhoff-Love formulations exhibit a\nlower discretization error level as well as a considerably improved nonlinear\nsolver performance in the range of high beam slenderness ratios as compared to\ntwo representative Simo-Reissner element formulations from the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 06:11:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Meier", "Christoph", ""], ["Wall", "Wolfgang A.", ""], ["Popp", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.01088", "submitter": "Evgeny Burnaev", "authors": "Mikhail Belyaev, Evgeny Burnaev, Ermek Kapushev, Maxim Panov, Pavel\n  Prikhodko, Dmitry Vetrov, Dmitry Yarotsky", "title": "GTApprox: surrogate modeling for industrial design", "comments": "31 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe GTApprox - a new tool for medium-scale surrogate modeling in\nindustrial design.

Similarly to the current\ntrend of removing the segregation between discretizations and solution methods\nin scientific computing, we anticipate that the future of multiscale simulation\nwill provide a closer interaction with also the models and the statistical\nmethods. This will yield better strategies for transferring the information\nacross different scales and for a more seamless transition in selecting and\nadapting the level of details in the models. Finally, we note that machine\nlearning and Bayesian techniques have shown a promising capability to capture\ncomplex model dependencies and enrich the results with statistical information;\ntherefore, they can complement traditional physics-based and numerical analysis\napproaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 09:28:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2018 16:26:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Favino", "Marco", ""], ["Quaglino", "Alessio", ""], ["Pozzi", "Sonia", ""], ["Krause", "Rolf", ""], ["Pivkin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.07902", "submitter": "Roberto M\\'inguez", "authors": "Roberto M\\'inguez and Raquel Garc\\'ia-Bertrand and Jos\\'e Manuel\n  Arroyo and Natalia Alguacil", "title": "On the Solution of Large-Scale Robust Transmission Network Expansion\n  Planning under Uncertain Demand and Generation Capacity", "comments": "8 pages and 2 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Power Systems 2017", "doi": "10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2734562", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two-stage robust optimization has emerged as a relevant approach to deal with\nuncertain demand and generation capacity in the transmission network expansion\nplanning problem. Unfortunately, available solution methodologies for the\nresulting trilevel robust counterpart are unsuitable for large-scale problems.\nIn order to overcome this shortcoming, this paper presents an alternative\ncolumn-and-constraint generation algorithm wherein the max-min problem\nassociated with the second stage is solved by a novel coordinate descent\nmethod. As a major salient feature, the proposed approach does not rely on the\ntransformation of the second-stage problem to a single-level equivalent. As a\nconsequence, bilinear terms involving dual variables or Lagrange multipliers do\nnot arise, thereby precluding the use of computationally expensive big-M-based\nlinearization schemes. Thus, not only is the computational effort reduced, but\nalso the typically overlooked non-trivial tuning of bounding parameters for\ndual variables or Lagrange multipliers is avoided. The practical applicability\nof the proposed methodology is confirmed by numerical testing on several\nbenchmarks including a case based on the Polish 2383-bus system, which is well\nbeyond the capability of the robust methods available in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 09:28:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00ednguez", "Roberto", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Bertrand", "Raquel", ""], ["Arroyo", "Jos\u00e9 Manuel", ""], ["Alguacil", "Natalia", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.08395", "submitter": "Juan Pablo Carbajal", "authors": "Juan Pablo Carbajal, Jo\\~ao Paulo Leit\\~ao, Carlo Albert, J\\\"org\n  Rieckermann", "title": "Appraisal of data-driven and mechanistic emulators of nonlinear\n  hydrodynamic urban drainage simulators", "comments": "This article was published in Environmental Modelling and Software, 7\n  figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.envsoft.2017.02.006", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME cs.CE cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Many model based scientific and engineering methodologies, such as system\nidentification, sensitivity analysis, optimization and control, require a large\nnumber of model evaluations. In particular, model based real-time control of\nurban water infrastructures and online flood alarm systems require fast\nprediction of the network response at different actuation and/or parameter\nvalues. General purpose urban drainage simulators are too slow for this\napplication. Fast surrogate models, so-called emulators, provide a solution to\nthis efficiency demand. Emulators are attractive, because they sacrifice\nunneeded accuracy in favor of speed. However, they have to be fine-tuned to\npredict the system behavior satisfactorily. Also, some emulators fail to\nextrapolate the system behavior beyond the training set. Although, there are\nmany strategies for developing emulators, up until now the selection of the\nemulation strategy remains subjective. In this paper, we therefore compare the\nperformance of two families of emulators for open channel flows in the context\nof urban drainage simulators. We compare emulators that explicitly use\nknowledge of the simulator's equations, i.e. mechanistic emulators based on\nGaussian Processes, with purely data-driven emulators using matrix\nfactorization. Our results suggest that in many urban applications, naive\ndata-driven emulation outperforms mechanistic emulation. Nevertheless, we\ndiscuss scenarios in which we think that mechanistic emulation might be\nfavorable for i) extrapolation in time and ii) dealing with sparse and unevenly\nsampled data. We also provide many references to advances in the field of\nMachine Learning that have not yet permeated into the Bayesian environmental\nscience community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 21:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 12:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Carbajal", "Juan Pablo", ""], ["Leit\u00e3o", "Jo\u00e3o Paulo", ""], ["Albert", "Carlo", ""], ["Rieckermann", "J\u00f6rg", ""]]}]
