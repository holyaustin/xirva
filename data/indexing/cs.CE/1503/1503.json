In\nthis article we use Monadic Second Order logic (MSOL) to give alternative,\ncompact proofs of fixed parameter tractability for several well-known\nincongruency measures. In doing so we wish to demonstrate the considerable\npotential of MSOL - machinery still largely unknown outside the algorithmic\ngraph theory community - within phylogenetics. A crucial component of this work\nis the observation that many of these measures, when bounded, imply the\nexistence of an 'agreement forest' of bounded size, which in turn implies that\nan auxiliary graph structure, the display graph, has bounded treewidth. It is\nthis bound on treewidth that makes the machinery of MSOL available for proving\nfixed parameter tractability. We give a variety of different MSOL formulations.\nSome are based on explicitly encoding agreement forests, while some only use\nthem implicitly to generate the treewidth bound.

Elegans}, the common\nroundworm. TW is a reflexive behavior exhibited by \\emph{C. Elegans} in\nresponse to vibrating the surface on which it is moving; the neural circuit\nunderlying this response is the subject of this investigation. Specifically, we\nperform reachability analysis on the TW circuit model of Wicks et al. (1996),\nwhich enables us to estimate key circuit parameters. Underlying our approach is\nthe use of Fan and Mitra's recently developed technique for automatically\ncomputing local discrepancy (convergence and divergence rates) of general\nnonlinear systems. We show that the results we obtain are in agreement with the\nexperimental results of Wicks et al. (1995). As opposed to the fixed parameters\nfound in most biological models, which can only produce the predominant\nbehavior, our techniques characterize ranges of parameters that produce (and do\nnot produce) all three observed behaviors: reversal of movement, acceleration,\nand lack of response.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2015 21:12:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Islam", "Md.

The contribution of\nthis hybrid spreading mechanism, which is also a characteristic of some\nimportant computer worm outbreaks, to HIV-1 progression in vivo remains\nunknown. Here we present a new mathematical model that explicitly incorporates\nthe ability of HIV-1 to use hybrid spreading mechanisms and evaluate the\nconsequences for HIV-1 pathogenenesis. The model captures the major phases of\nthe HIV-1 infection course of a cohort of treatment naive patients and also\naccurately predicts the results of the Short Pulse Anti-Retroviral Therapy at\nSeroconversion (SPARTAC) trial. Using this model we find that hybrid spreading\nis critical to seed and establish infection, and that cell-to-cell spread and\nincreased CD4+ T cell activation are important for HIV-1 progression. Notably,\nthe model predicts that cell-to-cell spread becomes increasingly effective as\ninfection progresses and thus may present a considerable treatment barrier.\nDeriving predictions of various treatments' influence on HIV-1 progression\nhighlights the importance of earlier intervention and suggests that treatments\neffectively targeting cell-to-cell HIV-1 spread can delay progression to AIDS.\nThis study suggests that hybrid spreading is a fundamental feature of HIV\ninfection, and provides the mathematical framework incorporating this feature\nwith which to evaluate future therapeutic strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 10:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Changwang", ""], ["Zhou", "Shi", ""], ["Groppelli", "Elisabetta", ""], ["Pellegrino", "Pierre", ""], ["Williams", "Ian", ""], ["Borrow", "Persephone", ""], ["Chain", "Benjamin M.", ""], ["Jolly", "Clare", ""]]}]
