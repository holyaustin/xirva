In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to filter an image with a Gaussian-like\nelliptic window of varying size, elongation and orientation using a fixed\nnumber of computations per pixel. The associated algorithm, which is based on a\nfamily of smooth compactly supported piecewise polynomials, the\nradially-uniform box splines, is realized using pre-integration and local\nfinite-differences. The radially-uniform box splines are constructed through\nthe repeated convolution of a fixed number of box distributions, which have\nbeen suitably scaled and distributed radially in an uniform fashion. The\nattractive features of these box splines are their asymptotic behavior, their\nsimple covariance structure, and their quasi-separability. They converge to\nGaussians with the increase of their order, and are used to approximate\nanisotropic Gaussians of varying covariance simply by controlling the scales of\nthe constituent box distributions. Based on the second feature, we develop a\ntechnique for continuously controlling the size, elongation and orientation of\nthese Gaussian-like functions. Finally, the quasi-separable structure, along\nwith a certain scaling property of box distributions, is used to efficiently\nrealize the associated space-variant elliptical filtering, which requires O(1)\ncomputations per pixel irrespective of the shape and size of the filter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Mar 2010 05:53:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2011 22:16:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chaudhury", "Kunal Narayan", ""], ["Munoz-Barrutia", "Arrate", ""], ["Unser", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.3766", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Peer-Olaf Siebers, Uwe Aickelin, Helen Celia, Chris Clegg", "title": "Modelling and simulating retail management practices: a first approach", "comments": "33 pages, INFORMS Simulation Society Workshop,", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Simulation and Process Modelling 5 (3),\n  215-232 , 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CE cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multi-agent systems offer a new and exciting way of understanding the world\nof work.

Best practices have\nbeen developed, but when it comes down to the actual application of these\nguidelines considerable ambiguity remains regarding their effectiveness within\nparticular contexts (Siebers et al., forthcoming a). Most Operational Research\n(OR) methods can only be used as analysis tools once management practices have\nbeen implemented. Often they are not very useful for giving answers to\nspeculative 'what-if' questions, particularly when one is interested in the\ndevelopment of the system over time rather than just the state of the system at\na certain point in time. Simulation can be used to analyse the operation of\ndynamic and stochastic systems. ABS is particularly useful when complex\ninteractions between system entities exist, such as autonomous decision making\nor negotiation. In an ABS model the researcher explicitly describes the\ndecision process of simulated actors at the micro level. Structures emerge at\nthe macro level as a result of the actions of the agents and their interactions\nwith other agents and the environment. 3 We will show how ABS experiments can\ndeal with testing and optimising management practices such as training,\nempowerment or teamwork.
