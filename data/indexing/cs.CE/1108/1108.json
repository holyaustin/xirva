We\nexplicitly write the local speed equation, which facilitates using the theory\nof propagating interfaces. It is shown that when neglecting the lag between the\nliquid front and the crack tip, the lubrication PDE yields that a solution\nsatisfies the speed equation identically. This implies that for zero or small\nlag, the boundary value problem appears ill-posed when solved numerically. We\nsuggest e - regularization, which consists in employing the speed equation\ntogether with a prescribed BC on the front to obtain a new BC formulated at a\nsmall distance behind the front rather than on the front itself. It is shown\nthat - regularization provides accurate and stable results with reasonable time\nexpense. It is also shown that the speed equation gives a key to proper choice\nof unknown functions when solving a hydraulic fracture problem numerically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 07:47:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Linkov", "Alexander M.", "", "Institute for Problems of Mechanical Engineering,\n  Saint Petersburg, Russia, Presently at Rzeszow University of Technology,\n  Poland"]]}]
