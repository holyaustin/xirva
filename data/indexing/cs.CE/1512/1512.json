The notion of frequency and filters\ntraditionally defined for signals supported on regular domains such as discrete\ntime and image grids has been recently generalized to irregular graph domains,\nand defines brain graph frequencies associated with different levels of spatial\nsmoothness across the brain regions. Brain network frequency also enables the\ndecomposition of brain signals into pieces corresponding to smooth or rapid\nvariations. We relate graph frequency with principal component analysis when\nthe networks of interest denote functional connectivity. The methods are\nutilized to analyze brain networks and signals as subjects master a simple\nmotor skill. We observe that brain signals corresponding to different graph\nfrequencies exhibit different levels of adaptability throughout learning.\nFurther, we notice a strong association between graph spectral properties of\nbrain networks and the level of exposure to tasks performed, and recognize the\nmost contributing and important frequency signatures at different task\nfamiliarity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 19:25:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2016 16:00:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Weiyu", ""], ["Goldsberry", "Leah", ""], ["Wymbs", "Nicholas F.", ""], ["Grafton", "Scott T.", ""], ["Bassett", "Danielle S.", ""], ["Ribeiro", "Alejandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01263", "submitter": "Simone Ciccarone", "authors": "Alberto Berretti and Simone Ciccarone", "title": "A Monte Carlo method for the spread of mobile malware", "comments": "11 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new model for the spread of mobile malware based on proximity (i.e.\nBluetooth, ad-hoc WiFi or NFC) is introduced.

The post-processing method is needed because of spurious\ndivergence growth at element interfaces due to the discontinuous nature of the\ndiscretization used. This spurious divergence eventually leads to a numerical\ninstability. Previous work has shown that a discontinuous element-local\nprojection onto the space of divergence-free basis functions is capable of\nstabilizing the projection method, but the discontinuity inherent in this\ntechnique may lead to instability in under-resolved simulations. By enforcing\ninter-element discontinuity and requiring a divergence-free result in the weak\nsense only, a new post-processing technique is developed that simultaneously\nimproves smoothness and reduces divergence in the pressure-projected velocity\nfield at the same time.

The quartic nonlinear terms present in the Zakharov\nform of the free surface conditions can cause severe aliasing problems and\nconsequently numerical instability for marginally resolved or very steep waves.\nWe show how the scheme can be stabilised through a combination of\nover-integration of the Galerkin projections and a mild spectral filtering on a\nper element basis. This effectively removes any aliasing driven instabilities\nwhile retaining the high-order accuracy of the numerical scheme. The additional\ncomputational cost of the over-integration is found insignificant compared to\nthe cost of solving the Laplace problem. The model is applied to several\nbenchmark cases in two dimensions. The results confirm the high order accuracy\nof the model (exponential convergence), and demonstrate the potential for\naccuracy and speedup.
