The mathematical analysis\nunderlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest\ndo not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach.\nIn an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low\nautocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and\nVingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated\nk-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of\noccurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the\nwaiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing\nTF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting\nautocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the\naccuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to\nappear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0\nmodel; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly\nin terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens\nand Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the\nresults to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability\nthat a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves\nlinearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic\nbehaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the\npromoter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 10:03:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Behrens", "S.", ""], ["Nicaud", "C.", ""], ["Nicodeme", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.1051", "submitter": "Huina Mao", "authors": "Huina Mao, Scott Counts and Johan Bollen", "title": "Predicting Financial Markets: Comparing Survey, News, Twitter and Search\n  Engine Data", "comments": "This paper includes 10 pages, 6 figures and 10 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.CE physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial market prediction on the basis of online sentiment tracking has\ndrawn a lot of attention recently. However, most results in this emerging\ndomain rely on a unique, particular combination of data sets and sentiment\ntracking tools. This makes it difficult to disambiguate measurement and\ninstrument effects from factors that are actually involved in the apparent\nrelation between online sentiment and market values. In this paper, we survey a\nrange of online data sets (Twitter feeds, news headlines, and volumes of Google\nsearch queries) and sentiment tracking methods (Twitter Investor Sentiment,\nNegative News Sentiment and Tweet & Google Search volumes of financial terms),\nand compare their value for financial prediction of market indices such as the\nDow Jones Industrial Average, trading volumes, and market volatility (VIX), as\nwell as gold prices. We also compare the predictive power of traditional\ninvestor sentiment survey data, i.e. Investor Intelligence and Daily Sentiment\nIndex, against those of the mentioned set of online sentiment indicators. Our\nresults show that traditional surveys of Investor Intelligence are lagging\nindicators of the financial markets. However, weekly Google Insight Search\nvolumes on financial search queries do have predictive value. An indicator of\nTwitter Investor Sentiment and the frequency of occurrence of financial terms\non Twitter in the previous 1-2 days are also found to be very statistically\nsignificant predictors of daily market log return.
