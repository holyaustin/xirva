The method is based on the optimized on order\nand noise dispersion autoregressive model of a sought signal. A new approach of\nmodel order determination is being offered. Available estimation of the noise\ndispersion is close to the real one. The optimized model allows to define\nfunction of empirical data spectral and dynamic features changes. The analysis\nof the signal as dynamic invariant in respect of the linear shift\ntransformation yields the function of model consistency. Use of these both\nfunctions enables to detect short-time and nonstationary wave packets at signal\nto noise ratio as from -20 dB and above.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2007 09:47:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bunyak", "Yu.", ""], ["Bunyak", "O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0336", "submitter": "Erhan Bayraktar", "authors": "Erhan Bayraktar", "title": "Pricing Options on Defaultable Stocks", "comments": "Key Words: Option pricing, multiscale perturbation methods,\n  defaultable stocks, stochastic intensity of default, implied volatility skew", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this note, we develop stock option price approximations for a model which\ntakes both the risk o default and the stochastic volatility into account.
