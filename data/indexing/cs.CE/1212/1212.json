This framework\nis absent of any Riemann solvers while it achieves numerical conservation\nnaturally. This paper focuses on the accuracy and linear stability of the\nproposed FD-FV methods, thus we suppose in addition that the solutions are\nsufficiently smooth. In particular, we prove that the spatial-order of the\nFD-FV method is typically one-order higher than that of the discrete\ndifferential operator, which is involved in the construction of the method. In\naddition, the methods are linearly stable subjected to a Courant-Friedrich-Lewy\ncondition when appropriate time-integrators are used. The numerical performance\nof the methods is assessed by a number of benchmark problems in one and two\ndimensions. These examples include the linear advection equation, nonlinear\nEuler equations, the solid dynamics problem for linear elastic orthotropic\nmaterials, and the Buckley-Leverett equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 02:13:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 20:54:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Zeng", "Xianyi", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.5359", "submitter": "Hannah Inbarani", "authors": "K.
