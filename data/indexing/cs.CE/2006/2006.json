The proposed optimization can automatically fit these\nparameters from the results of an oedometric and a triaxial drained compression\ntest, by combining the GA with a numerical solver that integrates the SH in the\ntest conditions. By repeating the same calibration several times, the\nstochastic nature of the optimizer enables the uncertainty quantification of\nthe calibration parameters and allows studying their relative importance on the\nmodel prediction. After validating the numerical solver on the\nExCaliber-Laboratory software from the SoilModels' website, the GA calibration\nis tested on a synthetic dataset to analyze the convergence and the statistics\nof the results. In particular, a correlation analysis reveals that two couples\nof the eight model parameters are strongly correlated. Finally, the calibration\nprocedure is tested on the results from von Wolffersdorff, 1996, and Herle &\nGudehus, 1999, on the Hochstetten sand. The model parameters identified by the\nGenetic Algorithm optimization improves the matching with the experimental data\nand hence lead to a better calibration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2020 20:07:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mendez", "Francisco J.", ""], ["Pasculli", "Antonio", ""], ["Mendez", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Sciarra", "Nicola", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.08434", "submitter": "Remy Priem", "authors": "Remy Priem, Hugo Gagnon, Ian Chittick, Stephane Dufresne, Youssef\n  Diouane and Nathalie Bartoli", "title": "An efficient application of Bayesian optimization to an industrial MDO\n  framework for aircraft design", "comments": "16 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables.

A salient aspect that distinguishes these\nnumerical methods is how they approximate the physical fields of interest.\nPhysics-informed deep learning is a novel approach recently developed for\nmodeling PDE solutions and shows promise to solve computational mechanics\nproblems without using any labeled data. The philosophy behind it is to\napproximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep\nneural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network. To\nthis end, training the network is equivalent to minimization of a well-designed\nloss function that contains the PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions\n(I/BCs). In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN)\nwith mixed-variable output to model elastodynamics problems without resort to\nlabeled data, in which the I/BCs are hardly imposed. In particular, both the\ndisplacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the\nhybrid finite element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and\ntrainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all\nthe residual loss components in a \"soft\" manner with Lagrange multipliers, the\nweakly imposed I/BCs cannot not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs\nare present. To overcome this issue, a composite scheme of DNNs is established\nbased on multiple single DNNs such that the I/BCs can be satisfied forcibly in\na \"hard\" manner. The propose PINN framework is demonstrated on several\nnumerical elasticity examples with different I/BCs, including both static and\ndynamic problems as well as wave propagation in truncated domains.

This paper presents a three-dimensional design\nmethodology that alleviates this shortcoming using both deterministic and\nrobust problem formulations. The robust formulation, based on the three-field\ndensity projection approach, is extended to handle manufacturing uncertainty in\nthree-dimensional stress-constrained problems. Several numerical examples are\nsolved and further post-processed with body-fitted meshes using commercial\nsoftware. The numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the employed\nsolution approach based on the augmented Lagrangian method is able to handle\nlarge problems, with hundreds of millions of stress constraints; (2) if\nappropriate interpolation parameters are adopted, voxel-based (fixed grid)\nmodels can be used to compute von Mises stresses with excellent accuracy; and\n(3) in order to ensure manufacturing tolerance in three-dimensional\nstress-constrained topology optimization, a combination of double filtering and\nmore than three realizations may be required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2020 12:05:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["da Silva", "Gustavo Assis", ""], ["Aage", "Niels", ""], ["Beck", "Andr\u00e9 Te\u00f3filo", ""], ["Sigmund", "Ole", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.12977", "submitter": "Kelly Kochanski", "authors": "Kelly Kochanski, Ivana Cvijanovic, Donald Lucas", "title": "Surrogate sea ice model enables efficient tuning", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "Presented at the AI for Earth Sciences workshop at the\n  International Conference on Learning Representations, 2020", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ao-ph cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Predicting changes in sea ice cover is critical for shipping, ecosystem\nmonitoring, and climate modeling.

Here, we\nconstruct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing\nmodel physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model\n(CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to\nchanges in the parameters governing: ice's ridging and albedo; snow's albedo,\naging, and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the\neffect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE's sensitivity to these model\nparameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers\nseparate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal\nand inter-hemispheric basis, and we recommend optimal values of these\nparameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of\nboth Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely.

These spikes make direct forecasting of\ntravel time using standard time series models difficult on the timescales of\nhours to days that are relevant to forward planning. The problem is that some\nsuch spikes are caused by unpredictable incidents and should be filtered out,\nwhereas others are caused by recurrent peaks in demand and should be factored\ninto estimates.

Based on these insights, systematic data-driven\nmethods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and\nmultiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical\nproperties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by\nsimple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further\nextended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of\nmechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale\nmetamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly\ngenerated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then\nassembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure\ncompatibility between adjacent microstructures.
