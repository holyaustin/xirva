Biological membranes\nplay a fundamental role in the complex reactions which take place in cells of\nliving organisms. The importance of this role has been considered in two\ndifferent types of formalisms introduced recently. Membrane systems were\nintroduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices inspired by the\nobservation that any biological system is a complex hierarchical structure,\nwith a flow of biochemical substances and information that underlies their\nfunctioning. The modeling and analysis of biological systems has also attracted\nconsiderable interest of the process algebra research community. Thus the\nnotions of membranes and compartments have been explicitly represented in a\nfamily of calculi, such as ambients and brane calculi. A cross fertilization of\nthese two research areas has recently started. A deeper investigation of the\nrelationships between these related formalisms is interesting, as it is\nimportant to understand the crucial similarities and the differences. The main\naim of the workshop is to bring together researchers working on membrane\ncomputing, in biologically inspired process calculi, and in other related\nfields, in order to present recent results and to discuss new ideas concerning\nsuch formalisms, their properties and relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Oct 2010 07:48:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ciobanu", "Gabriel", "", "Iasi, Romania"], ["Koutny", "Maciej", "", "Newcastle, UK"]]}, {"id": "1011.0250", "submitter": "Yogendra Namjoshi Mr.", "authors": "Sangeeta Soni and Yogendra Namjoshi", "title": "Delineation of Raw Plethysmograph using Wavelets for Mobile based Pulse\n  Oximeters", "comments": "Proceedings of 5th Innovative Conference on Embedded Systems, Mobile\n  Communication and Computing, Pg. 74-84, ISBN 023-033-045-2", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The non-invasive pulse-oximeter is a crucial parameter in continuous\nmonitoring systems.

An approach that has gathered\nmomentum since the late 1990's, looks at protein hetero-polymers and their\nfolding process through the lens of complex network analysis. Consequently,\nthere is now a body of empirical studies describing topological characteristics\nof protein macro-molecules through their contact networks and linking these\ntopological characteristics to protein folding. The present paper is primarily\na review of this rich area. But it delves deeper into certain aspects by\nemphasizing short-range and long-range links, and suggests unconventional\nplaces where \"power-laws\" may be lurking within protein contact networks.\nFurther, it considers the dynamical view of protein contact networks. This\ncloser scrutiny of protein contact networks raises new questions for further\nresearch, and identifies new regularities which may be useful to parameterize a\nnetwork approach to protein folding. Preliminary experiments with such a model\nconfirm that the regularities we identified cannot be easily reproduced through\nrandom effects. Indeed, the grand challenge of protein folding is to elucidate\nthe process(es) which not only generates the specific and diverse linkage\npatterns of protein contact networks, but also reproduces the dynamic behavior\nof proteins as they fold.

By considering the high drilling cost and\nthe potential improvement in well productivity, well placement decision is an\nimportant issue in field development. Considering complex reservoir geology and\nhigh reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most\nsuitable approaches for optimum well placement. This paper proposes an\noptimization methodology to determine optimal well location and trajectory\nbased upon the Covariance Matrix Adaptation - Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) which\nis a variant of Evolution Strategies recognized as one of the most powerful\nderivative-free optimizers for continuous optimization. To improve the\noptimization procedure, two new techniques are investigated: (1). Adaptive\npenalization with rejection is developed to handle well placement constraints.\n(2). A meta-model, based on locally weighted regression, is incorporated into\nCMA-ES using an approximate ranking procedure. Therefore, we can reduce the\nnumber of reservoir simulations, which are computationally expensive. Several\nexamples are presented. Our new approach is compared with a Genetic Algorithm\nincorporating the Genocop III technique. It is shown that our approach\noutperforms the genetic algorithm: it leads in general to both a higher NPV and\na significant reduction of the number of reservoir simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 20:08:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bouzarkouna", "Zyed", "", "IFP, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"], ["Ding", "Didier Yu", "", "IFP"], ["Auger", "Anne", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"]]}]
