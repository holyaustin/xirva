The new approach is based on a\nhybrid fluid formulation that combines the advantages of purely Eulerian\n(fixed-grid) and Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE moving mesh) formulations\nin the context of FSI. The structure - as commonly given in Lagrangian\ndescription - is surrounded by a fine resolved layer of fluid elements based on\nan ALE-framework. This ALE-fluid patch, which is embedded in an Eulerian\nbackground fluid domain, follows the deformation and motion of the structural\ninterface. This approximation technique is not limited to Finite Element\nMethods, but can can also be realized within other frameworks like Finite\nVolume or Discontinuous Galerkin Methods. In this work, the surface coupling\nbetween the two disjoint fluid subdomains is imposed weakly using a stabilized\nNitsche's technique in a Cut Finite Element Method (CutFEM) framework. At the\nfluid-solid interface, standard weak coupling of node-matching or non-matching\nfinite element approximations can be utilized. As the fluid subdomains can be\nmeshed independently, a sufficient mesh quality in the vicinity of the common\nfluid-structure interface can be assured. To our knowledge the proposed method\nis the only method (despite some overlapping domain decomposition approaches\nthat suffer from other issues) that allows for capturing boundary layers and\nflow detachment via appropriate grids around largely moving and deforming\nbodies and is able to do this e.g. without the necessity of costly remeshing\nprocedures. In addition it might also help to safe computational costs as now\nbackground grids can be much coarser.

The fact that the used genetic programming tool does not know the\nstructure of the Colebrook equation which is based on computationally expensive\nlogarithmic law, is used to obtain better structure of the approximations which\nis less demanding for calculation but also enough accurate. All generated\napproximations are with low computational cost because they contain a limited\nnumber of logarithmic forms used although for normalization of input parameters\nor for acceleration, but they are also sufficiently accurate. The relative\nerror regarding the friction factor in best case is up to 0.13% with only two\nlogarithmic forms used. As the second logarithm can be accurately approximated\nby the Pade approximation, practically the same error is obtained also using\nonly one logarithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2018 14:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Praks", "Pavel", ""], ["Brkic", "Dejan", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10420", "submitter": "Thang Duong", "authors": "Thang X.

The aim of this work is to extend the contact\ntheory based on surface potentials (Sauer and De Lorenzis, 2013) to account for\nfriction. Coulomb friction under isothermal conditions is considered here. For\na consistent friction formulation, we start with the first and second laws of\nthermodynamics and derive the governing equations at the contact interface. A\nso-called interacting gap can then be defined as a kinematic variable unifying\nboth sliding/sticking and normal/tangential contact. A variational principle\nfor the frictional system can then be formulated based on a purely kinematical\nconstraint. The direct elimination approach applied to the tangential part of\nthis constraint leads to the so-called moving friction cone approach of\nWriggers and Haraldsson (2003). Compared with existing friction formulations,\nour approach reduces the theoretical and computational complexity. Several\nnumerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of\nthe proposed friction formulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2018 17:40:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2019 10:26:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Duong", "Thang X.", ""], ["Sauer", "Roger A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10680", "submitter": "Philippe Blondeel", "authors": "Philippe Blondeel, Pieterjan Robbe, C\\'edric van hoorickx, Geert\n  Lombaert, Stefan Vandewalle", "title": "Multilevel Monte Carlo for uncertainty quantification in structural\n  engineering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Practical structural engineering problems often exhibit a significant degree\nof uncertainty in the material properties being used, the dimensions of the\nmodeled structures, etc. In this paper, we consider a cantilever beam and a\nbeam clamped at both ends, both subjected to a static and a dynamic load.
