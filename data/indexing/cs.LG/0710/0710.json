Association rules represent significant relationships between items in\ntransactions. We extend the concept of association rule to represent a much\nbroader class of associations, which we refer to as \\emph{entity-relationship\nrules.} Semantically, entity-relationship rules express associations between\nproperties of related objects. Syntactically, these rules are based on a broad\nsubclass of safe domain relational calculus queries. We propose a new\ndefinition of support and confidence for entity-relationship rules and for the\nfrequency of entity-relationship queries.

The reduction guarantees an average pairwise\nmisranking regret of at most that of the binary classifier regret, improving a\nrecent result of Balcan et al which only guarantees a factor of 2. Moreover,\nour reduction applies to a broader class of ranking loss functions, admits a\nsimpler proof, and the expected running time complexity of our algorithm in\nterms of number of calls to a classifier or preference function is improved\nfrom $\\Omega(n^2)$ to $O(n \\log n)$. In addition, when the top $k$ ranked\nelements only are required ($k \\ll n$), as in many applications in information\nextraction or search engines, the time complexity of our algorithm can be\nfurther reduced to $O(k \\log k + n)$. Our reduction and algorithm are thus\npractical for realistic applications where the number of points to rank exceeds\nseveral thousands. Much of our results also extend beyond the bipartite case\npreviously studied.\n  Our rediction is a randomized one. To complement our result, we also derive\nlower bounds on any deterministic reduction from binary (preference)\nclassification to ranking, implying that our use of a randomized reduction is\nessentially necessary for the guarantees we provide.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2007 18:25:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2007 00:02:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ailon", "Nir", ""], ["Mohri", "Mehryar", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5116", "submitter": "Taneli Mielik\\\"ainen", "authors": "Matti K\\\"a\\\"ari\\\"ainen, Niels Landwehr, Sampsa Lappalainen and Taneli\n  Mielik\\\"ainen", "title": "Combining haplotypers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "C-2007-57", "categories": "cs.LG cs.CE q-bio.QM", "license": null, "abstract": "  Statistically resolving the underlying haplotype pair for a genotype\nmeasurement is an important intermediate step in gene mapping studies, and has\nreceived much attention recently.

Instead of choosing a single method,\nwe explore combining predictions returned by different methods in a principled\nway, and thereby circumvent the problem of method selection.\n  We propose several techniques for combining haplotype reconstructions and\nanalyze their computational properties. In an experimental study on real-world\nhaplotype data we show that such techniques can provide more accurate and\nrobust reconstructions, and are useful for outlier detection.
