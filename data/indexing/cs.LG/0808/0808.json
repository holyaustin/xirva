Within this framework, fuzzy learning methods, if properly used,\ncan greatly help human experts. Amongst these methods, the aim of orthogonal\ntransformations, which have been proven to be mathematically robust, is to\nbuild rules from a set of training data and to select the most important ones\nby linear regression or rank revealing techniques. The OLS algorithm is a good\nrepresentative of those methods. However, it was originally designed so that it\nonly cared about numerical performance. Thus, we propose some modifications of\nthe original method to take interpretability into account. After recalling the\noriginal algorithm, this paper presents the changes made to the original\nmethod, then discusses some results obtained from benchmark problems. Finally,\nthe algorithm is applied to a real-world fault detection depollution problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2008 19:54:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Destercke", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "IRSN, IRIT"], ["Guillaume", "Serge", "", "ITAP"], ["Charnomordic", "Brigitte", "", "ASB"]]}, {"id": "0808.3231", "submitter": "Zhi-Hua Zhou", "authors": "Zhi-Hua Zhou, Min-Ling Zhang, Sheng-Jun Huang, Yu-Feng Li", "title": "Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning", "comments": "64 pages, 10 figures; Artificial Intelligence, 2011", "journal-ref": "Artificial Intelligence, 2012, 176(1): 2291-2320", "doi": "10.1016/j.artint.2011.10.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose the MIML (Multi-Instance Multi-Label learning)\nframework where an example is described by multiple instances and associated\nwith multiple class labels. Compared to traditional learning frameworks, the\nMIML framework is more convenient and natural for representing complicated\nobjects which have multiple semantic meanings. To learn from MIML examples, we\npropose the MimlBoost and MimlSvm algorithms based on a simple degeneration\nstrategy, and experiments show that solving problems involving complicated\nobjects with multiple semantic meanings in the MIML framework can lead to good\nperformance. Considering that the degeneration process may lose information, we\npropose the D-MimlSvm algorithm which tackles MIML problems directly in a\nregularization framework. Moreover, we show that even when we do not have\naccess to the real objects and thus cannot capture more information from real\nobjects by using the MIML representation, MIML is still useful. We propose the\nInsDif and SubCod algorithms. InsDif works by transforming single-instances\ninto the MIML representation for learning, while SubCod works by transforming\nsingle-label examples into the MIML representation for learning. Experiments\nshow that in some tasks they are able to achieve better performance than\nlearning the single-instances or single-label examples directly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Aug 2008 06:31:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 19:47:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2011 10:51:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 23 Oct 2011 16:22:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Zhi-Hua", ""], ["Zhang", "Min-Ling", ""], ["Huang", "Sheng-Jun", ""], ["Li", "Yu-Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3746", "submitter": "Vladimir Vyugin", "authors": "Vladimir V.
