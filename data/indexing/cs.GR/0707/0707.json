Fast and correct\nanalysis of such information is important in for instance geospatial and social\nvisualization applications. Information visualization researchers have\npreviously argued that space time cube representation is beneficial in\nrevealing complex spatiotemporal patterns in a dataset to users. The argument\nis based on the fact that both time and spatial information are displayed\nsimultaneously to users, an effect difficult to achieve in other\nrepresentations. However, to our knowledge the actual usefulness of space time\ncube representation in conveying complex spatiotemporal patterns to users has\nnot been empirically validated. To fill this gap we report on a\nbetween-subjects experiment comparing novice users error rates and response\ntimes when answering a set of questions using either space time cube or a\nbaseline 2D representation. For some simple questions the error rates were\nlower when using the baseline representation. For complex questions where the\nparticipants needed an overall understanding of the spatiotemporal structure of\nthe dataset, the space time cube representation resulted in on average twice as\nfast response times with no difference in error rates compared to the baseline.\nThese results provide an empirical foundation for the hypothesis that space\ntime cube representation benefits users when analyzing complex spatiotemporal\npatterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Jul 2007 13:39:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kristensson", "Per Ola", ""], ["Dahlback", "Nils", ""], ["Anundi", "Daniel", ""], ["Bjornstad", "Marius", ""], ["Gillberg", "Hanna", ""], ["Haraldsson", "Jonas", ""], ["Martensson", "Ingrid", ""], ["Nordvall", "Matttias", ""], ["Stahl", "Josefin", ""]]}]
