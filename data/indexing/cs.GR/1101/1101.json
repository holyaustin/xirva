Most quantization methods are essentially based\non data clustering algorithms.

In this paper, we investigate the\nperformance of k-means as a color quantizer. We implement fast and exact\nvariants of k-means with several initialization schemes and then compare the\nresulting quantizers to some of the most popular quantizers in the literature.\nExperiments on a diverse set of images demonstrate that an efficient\nimplementation of k-means with an appropriate initialization strategy can in\nfact serve as a very effective color quantizer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jan 2011 10:09:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Celebi", "M.

Driven by\nthe findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with\nimportant options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real-time,\nand accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a\nbrowser engine.

Reflections from neighboring surface patches\nrepresented by local BSDFs are mutually independent. However, in many surfaces\nwith wavelength-scale microstructures, interference and diffraction requires a\njoint analysis of reflected wavefronts from neighboring patches. We demonstrate\na simple method to compute the BSDF for the entire microstructure, which can be\nused independently for each patch. This allows us to use traditional ray--based\nrendering pipelines to synthesize wave effects of light and sound. We exploit\nthe Wigner Distribution Function (WDF) to create transmissive, reflective, and\nemissive BSDFs for various diffraction phenomena in a physically accurate way.\nIn contrast to previous methods for computing interference, we circumvent the\nneed to explicitly keep track of the phase of the wave by using BSDFs that\ninclude positive as well as negative coefficients. We describe and compare the\ntheory in relation to well understood concepts in rendering and demonstrate a\nstraightforward implementation. In conjunction with standard raytracers, such\nas PBRT, we demonstrate wave effects for a range of scenarios such as\nmulti--bounce diffraction materials, holograms and reflection of high frequency\nsurfaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 09:41:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cuypers", "Tom", ""], ["Oh", "Se Baek", ""], ["Haber", "Tom", ""], ["Bekaert", "Philippe", ""], ["Raskar", "Ramesh", ""]]}]
