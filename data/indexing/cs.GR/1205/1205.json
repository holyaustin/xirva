The main design target for this framework is to provide an\nin-core visualization solution able to provide three-dimensional interactive\nviews of terabyte-sized data cubes. We tested the presented framework using a\ncomputing cluster comprising 64 nodes with a total of 128 GPUs. The framework\nproved to be scalable to render a 204 GB data cube with an average of 30 frames\nper second. Our performance analyses also compare between using NVIDIA Tesla\n1060 and 2050 GPU architectures and the effect of increasing the visualization\noutput resolution on the rendering performance. Although our initial focus, and\nthe examples presented in this work, is volume rendering of spectral data cubes\nfrom radio astronomy, we contend that our approach has applicability to other\ndisciplines where close to real-time volume rendering of terabyte-order 3D data\nsets is a requirement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 23:17:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "A.

We propose to\ngenerate dynamic versions of such representations for 2D unsteady flow fields.\nOur algorithm smoothly animates arrows along the flow while controlling their\ndensity in the domain over time. Several strategies have been combined to lower\nthe unavoidable popping artifacts arising when arrows appear and disappear and\nto achieve visually pleasing animations. Disturbing arrow rotations in low\nvelocity regions are also handled by continuously morphing arrow glyphs to\nsemi-transparent discs. To substantiate our method, we provide results for\nsynthetic and real velocity field datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2012 15:29:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Jobard", "Bruno", ""], ["Ray", "Nicolas", ""], ["Sokolov", "Dmitry", ""]]}]
