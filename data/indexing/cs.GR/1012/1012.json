MT4j is designed for rapid\ndevelopment of graphically rich applications on a variety of contemporary\nhardware, from common PCs and notebooks to large-scale ambient displays, as\nwell as different operating systems. The framework has a special focus on\nmaking multi-touch software development easier and more efficient. Architecture\nand abstractions used by MT4j are described, and implementations of several\ncommon use cases are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Dec 2010 16:01:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Laufs", "Uwe", ""], ["Ruff", "Christopher", ""], ["Zibuschka", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.3057", "submitter": "Bernd R.

VESTA is used to determine implicit surfaces that are potentially\ncontained in 3D data sets, such as 3D image data and/or 3D simulation data.\nVESTA surfaces are non-degenerate, i.e., they always enclose a volume that is\nlarger than zero and they never self-intersect, prior to a further processing,\ne.g., towards isosurfaces. In addition to its ability to deal with local cell\nambiguities consistently - and thereby avoiding the accidental generation of\nholes in the final surfaces - the information of the interior and/or exterior\nof enclosed 3D volumes is propagated correctly to each of the final surface\ntiles. Particular emphasis is put here on the speed up of the original\nformulation of VESTA, while applying the algorithm to 2x2x2 voxel\nneighborhoods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Dec 2010 15:24:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jul 2011 19:19:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schlei", "B.

To take care of the local topological changes of the manifold, the\ntubular neighbourhood is constructed in consideration with the injectivity\nradius of the underlying Riemannian manifold.
