Therefore, the pathogenesis of several\ncardiovascular diseases is directly affected by the blood-flow dynamics.\nUnderstanding flow behavior is of vital importance to understand the\ncardiovascular system and potentially harbors a considerable value for both\ndiagnosis and risk assessment. The analysis of hemodynamic characteristics\ninvolves qualitative and quantitative inspection of the blood-flow field.\nVisualization plays an important role in the qualitative exploration, as well\nas the definition of relevant quantitative measures and its validation. There\nare two main approaches to obtain information about the blood flow: simulation\nby computational fluid dynamics, and in-vivo measurements. Although research on\nblood flow simulation has been performed for decades, many open problems remain\nconcerning accuracy and patient-specific solutions. Possibilities for real\nmeasurement of blood flow have recently increased considerably by new\ndevelopments in magnetic resonance imaging which enable the acquisition of 3D\nquantitative measurements of blood-flow velocity fields. This chapter presents\nthe visualization challenges for both simulation and real measurements of\nunsteady blood-flow fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2012 14:47:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Vilanova", "Anna", ""], ["Preim", "Bernhard", ""], ["van Pelt", "Roy", ""], ["Gasteiger", "Rocco", ""], ["Neugebauer", "Mathias", ""], ["Wischgoll", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4982", "submitter": "Ingmar Steiner", "authors": "Ingmar Steiner (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA, Trinity College Dublin), Korin\n  Richmond (CSTR), Slim Ouni (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA)", "title": "Using multimodal speech production data to evaluate articulatory\n  animation for audiovisual speech synthesis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "3rd International Symposium on Facial Analysis and Animation\n  (2012)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The importance of modeling speech articulation for high-quality audiovisual\n(AV) speech synthesis is widely acknowledged.

In this paper, we review, analyze and compare different\nstatistical models: from those that analyze the variation in geometry globally\nto those that analyze the variation in geometry locally. We first review how\ndifferent types of models have been used in the literature, then proceed to\ndefine the models and analyze them theoretically, in terms of both their\nstatistical and computational aspects. We then perform extensive experimental\ncomparison on the task of model fitting, and give intuition about which type of\nmodel is better for a few applications.

We show that even with such scarce\ninformation, it is possible to establish very accurate correspondence between\nthe shapes by using methods from the field of sparse modeling, being this, the\nfirst non-trivial use of sparse models in shape correspondence. We formulate\nthe problem of permuted sparse coding, in which we solve simultaneously for an\nunknown permutation ordering the regions on two shapes and for an unknown\ncorrespondence in functional representation. We also propose a robust variant\ncapable of handling incomplete matches. Numerically, the problem is solved\nefficiently by alternating the solution of a linear assignment and a sparse\ncoding problem. The proposed methods are evaluated qualitatively and\nquantitatively on standard benchmarks containing both synthetic and scanned\nobjects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 16:05:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Pokrass", "J.", ""], ["Bronstein", "A.
