At first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level\nbased on intensity variance. This makes the foreground components distinct from\neach other. Then the non-text components are removed using various\ncharacteristic features of text and graphics. Finally, the text regions are\nskew corrected and binarized for further processing. Experimenting with\nbusiness card images of various resolutions, we have found an optimum\nperformance of 98.54% with 0.75 MP images, that takes 0.17 seconds processing\ntime and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately powerful computer (DualCore 1.73\nGHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache).

The locations of the critical points\nwithin a cell are determined analytically to achieve accurate results. This\napproach leads to a correct treatment of cases with two first-order critical\npoints or one second-order critical point of bilinearly interpolated vector\nfields within one cell, which would be missed by examining the linearized field\nonly. We show that for the considered interpolation schemes determining the\nindex of a critical point can be seen as a coloring problem of cell edges. A\ncomplete classification of all possible colorings in terms of the types and\nnumber of critical points yielded by each coloring is given using computational\ngroup theory. We present an efficient algorithm that makes use of these\nprecomputed classifications in order to find and classify critical points in a\ncell-by-cell fashion.
