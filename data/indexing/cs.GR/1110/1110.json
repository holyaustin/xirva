We present\nalgorithms to automatically determine these distances as well as geometric\ncorrespondences. This is motivated by the aspiration of students of natural\nscience to understand the continuity of form that unites the diversity of life.\nAt present, scientists using physical traits to study evolutionary\nrelationships among living and extinct animals analyze data extracted from\ncarefully defined anatomical correspondence points (landmarks). Identifying and\nrecording these landmarks is time consuming and can be done accurately only by\ntrained morphologists. This renders these studies inaccessible to\nnon-morphologists, and causes phenomics to lag behind genomics in elucidating\nevolutionary patterns. Unlike other algorithms presented for morphological\ncorrespondences our approach does not require any preliminary marking of\nspecial features or landmarks by the user. It also differs from other seminal\nwork in computational geometry in that our algorithms are polynomial in nature\nand thus faster, making pairwise comparisons feasible for significantly larger\nnumbers of digitized surfaces. We illustrate our approach using three datasets\nrepresenting teeth and different bones of primates and humans, and show that it\nleads to highly accurate results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 12:23:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Oct 2011 09:16:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 13:36:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boyer", "D.", ""], ["Lipman", "Y.", ""], ["Clair", "E.

Previous implementations are insufficient due to the\ndiscrepancies in hardware and programming model of the GPU and CPU. We create\nnew implementations in CUDA and analyze the performance of spinning on the GPU,\nas well as a method of sleeping on the GPU, by running a set of memory-system\nbenchmarks on two of the most common GPUs in use, the Tesla- and Fermi-class\nGPUs from NVIDIA. From our results we define higher-level principles that are\nvalid for generic many-core processors, the most important of which is to limit\nthe number of atomic accesses required for a synchronization operation because\natomic accesses are slower than regular memory accesses. We use the results of\nthe benchmarks to critique existing synchronization algorithms and guide our\nnew implementations, and then define an abstraction of GPUs to classify any GPU\nbased on the behavior of the memory system. We use this abstraction to create\nsuitable implementations of the primitives specifically targeting the GPU, and\nanalyze the performance of these algorithms on Tesla and Fermi. We then predict\nperformance on future GPUs based on characteristics of the abstraction. We also\nexamine the roles of spin waiting and sleep waiting in each primitive and how\ntheir performance varies based on the machine abstraction, then give a set of\nguidelines for when each strategy is useful based on the characteristics of the\nGPU and expected contention.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Oct 2011 19:43:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Stuart", "Jeff A.", ""], ["Owens", "John D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5015", "submitter": "Alex Bronstein", "authors": "Alexander M.

For example, they have been successfully employed in\ncorrespondence, registration, and retrieval tasks. In the recent years,\nsignificant attention has been devoted to descriptors obtained from the\nspectral decomposition of the Laplace-Beltrami operator associated with the\nshape. Notable examples in this family are the heat kernel signature (HKS) and\nthe wave kernel signature (WKS). Laplacian-based descriptors achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance in numerous shape analysis tasks; they are\ncomputationally efficient, isometry-invariant by construction, and can\ngracefully cope with a variety of transformations. In this paper, we formulate\na generic family of parametric spectral descriptors. We argue that in order to\nbe optimal for a specific task, the descriptor should take into account the\nstatistics of the corpus of shapes to which it is applied (the \"signal\") and\nthose of the class of transformations to which it is made insensitive (the\n\"noise\"). While such statistics are hard to model axiomatically, they can be\nlearned from examples. Following the spirit of the Wiener filter in signal\nprocessing, we show a learning scheme for the construction of optimal spectral\ndescriptors and relate it to Mahalanobis metric learning. The superiority of\nthe proposed approach is demonstrated on the SHREC'10 benchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Oct 2011 04:26:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bronstein", "Alexander M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5360", "submitter": "Stuart Weston", "authors": "Stuart Weston, Tim Natusch, Sergei Gulyaev", "title": "New Zealand involvement in Radio Astronomical VLBI Image Processing", "comments": "6 pages, 11 figures, accepted for presentation at IVCNZ 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the establishment of the AUT University 12m radio telescope at\nWarkworth, New Zealand has now become a part of the international Very Long\nBaseline Interferometry (VLBI) community.
