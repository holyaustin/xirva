The first condition\non `inverse temperature' is tight if the distribution is restricted to\nferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic Ising models.\n  Thanks to Weitz's self-avoiding tree, we extends the result for sparse on\naverage graphs, which generalizes part of the recent work of Mossel and\nSly\\cite{MS08}, who proved the strong spatial mixing property for ferromagnetic\nIsing model. Our proof yields a different approach, carefully exploiting the\nmonotonicity of local recursion. To our best knowledge, the second condition of\n`external field' for strong spatial mixing in this paper is first considered\nand stated in term of `maximum average degree' and `interaction energy'. As an\napplication, we present an FPTAS for partition functions of two-state spin\nmodels without hard constrains under the above assumptions in a general family\nof graphs including interesting bounded degree graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 16:56:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2009 03:16:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jinshan", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.0893", "submitter": "Darren Strash", "authors": "David Eppstein, Michael T.
