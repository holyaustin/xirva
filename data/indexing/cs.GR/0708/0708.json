In this paper we put forward a model of humanoid that\nsuits both virtual humans and representations of real users, according to\ncollaborative training activities. We suggest adaptations to the scenario model\nof our platform making it possible to write collaborative procedures. We\nintroduce a mechanism of action selection made up of a global repartition and\nan individual choice. These models are currently being integrated and validated\nin GVT, a virtual training tool for maintenance of military equipments,\ndeveloped in collaboration with the French company NEXTER-Group.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2007 07:42:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gerbaud", "St\u00e9phanie", "", "IRISA"], ["Mollet", "Nicolas", "", "IRISA"], ["Arnaldi", "Bruno", "", "IRISA"]]}]
