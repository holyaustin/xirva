The availability of protein structures\nenables the study of their surfaces and surface properties such as\nelectrostatic potential (EP) and hydropathy (MLP), based on atomic\ncontribution. Recent advances in 3D animation and rendering software have not\nyet been exploited for the representation of proteins and other biological\nmolecules in an intuitive, animated form. Taking advantage of an open-source,\n3D animation and rendering software, Blender, we developed BioBlender, a\npackage dedicated to biological work: elaboration of proteins' motions with the\nsimultaneous visualization of chemical and physical features. EP and MLP are\ncalculated using physico-chemical programs and custom programs and scripts,\norganized and accessed within BioBlender interface. A new visual code is\nintroduced for MLP visualization: a range of optical features that permits a\nphotorealistic rendering of its spatial distribution on the surface of the\nprotein. EP is represented as animated line particles that flow along field\nlines proportional to the total charge of the protein. Our system permits EP\nand MLP visualization of molecules and, in the case of moving proteins, the\ncontinuous perception of these features, calculated for each intermediate\nconformation. Using real world tactile/sight feelings, the nanoscale world of\nproteins becomes more understandable, familiar to our everyday life, making it\neasier to introduce \"un-seen\" phenomena (concepts) such as hydropathy or\ncharges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Sep 2010 18:19:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Sep 2010 10:37:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 08:48:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Andrei", "Raluca Mihaela", ""], ["Callieri", "Marco", ""], ["Zini", "Maria Francesca", ""], ["Loni", "Tiziana", ""], ["Maraziti", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Pan", "Mike Chen", ""], ["Zopp\u00e8", "Monica", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5183", "submitter": "Florian Reitz", "authors": "Florian Reitz", "title": "A Framework for an Ego-centered and Time-aware Visualization of\n  Relations in Arbitrary Data Repositories", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding constellations in large data collections has become a common\ntask.

In this paper we present a visualization\nframework which presents the collection as a set of entities and relations (on\nthe data level). Using rating functions, we divide large relation networks into\nsmall graphs which resemble ego-centered networks. These graphs are connected\nso the user can browse from one to another. To further assist the user, we\npresent two views which embed information on the evolution of the relations\ninto the graphs. Each view emphasizes another aspect of temporal development.\nThe framework can be adapted to any repository by a flexible data interface and\na graph configuration file.
