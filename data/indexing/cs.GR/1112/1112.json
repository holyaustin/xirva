This\npaper investigates techniques for real-time processing of the resulting images,\nparticularly on-device utilizing a graphical processing unit. Issues and\nlimitations of image processing on mobile devices are discussed, and the\nperformance of graphical processing units on a range of devices measured\nthrough a programmable shader implementation of Canny edge detection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 03:46:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ensor", "Andrew", ""], ["Hall", "Seth", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.6032", "submitter": "Daniel Ruderman", "authors": "Daniel L.

When raw data can be read but lack\nsuitable annotations as to provenance, the ability to interpret them is more\nstraightforward if they can be assessed through simple visual techniques. In\nthis regard digital images are a special case since their data have a natural\nrepresentation on two-dimensional media surfaces. This paper presents a novel\nbinary image pixel encoding that produces an approximate analog rendering of\nencoded images when the image bits are arranged spatially in an appropriate\nmanner. This simultaneous digital and analog representation acts to inseparably\nannotate bits as image data, which may contribute to the longevity of\nso-encoded images.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2011 23:40:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ruderman", "Daniel L.", ""]]}]
