These\nstatistical models represent prior knowledge of the human shape and enable us\nto solve shape reconstruction problems from partial information. Generating\nhuman shape from traditional anthropometric measurements is such a problem,\nsince these 1-D measurements encode 3-D shape information. Combined with a\nstatistical shape model, these easy-to-obtain measurements can be leveraged to\ncreate 3D human shapes. However, existing methods limit the creation of the\nshapes to the space spanned by the database and thus require a large amount of\ntraining data. In this paper, we introduce a technique that extrapolates the\nstatistically inferred shape to fit the measurement data using nonlinear\noptimization. This method ensures that the generated shape is both human-like\nand satisfies the measurement conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe method and compare it to existing approaches through extensive experiments,\nusing both synthetic data and real human measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 13:22:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 15:01:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wuhrer", "Stefanie", ""], ["Shu", "Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1914", "submitter": "Jean-Marc Thiery", "authors": "Jean-Marc Thiery (LTCI), Julien Tierny (LTCI), Tamy Boubekeur (LTCI)", "title": "Jacobians and Hessians of Mean Value Coordinates for Closed Triangular\n  Meshes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this technical note, we present the formulae of the derivatives of the\nMean Value Coordinates based transformations, using an enclosing triangle mesh,\nacting as a cage for the deformation of an interior object.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Sep 2011 06:49:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 05:56:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Thiery", "Jean-Marc", "", "LTCI"], ["Tierny", "Julien", "", "LTCI"], ["Boubekeur", "Tamy", "", "LTCI"]]}, {"id": "1109.4095", "submitter": "J\\\"org P\\\"uhrer", "authors": "Christian Kloim\\\"ullner, Johannes Oetsch, J\\\"org P\\\"uhrer, and Hans\n  Tompits", "title": "Kara: A System for Visualising and Visual Editing of Interpretations for\n  Answer-Set Programs", "comments": "Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on Applications of\n  Declarative Programming and Knowledge Management (INAP 2011) and 25th\n  Workshop on Logic Programming (WLP 2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.GR cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In answer-set programming (ASP), the solutions of a problem are encoded in\ndedicated models, called answer sets, of a logical theory. These answer sets\nare computed from the program that represents the theory by means of an ASP\nsolver and returned to the user as sets of ground first-order literals. As this\ntype of representation is often cumbersome for the user to interpret, tools\nlike ASPVIZ and IDPDraw were developed that allow for visualising answer sets.\nThe tool Kara, introduced in this paper, follows these approaches, using ASP\nitself as a language for defining visualisations of interpretations. Unlike\nexisting tools that position graphic primitives according to static coordinates\nonly, Kara allows for more high-level specifications, supporting graph\nstructures, grids, and relative positioning of graphical elements. Moreover,\ngeneralising the functionality of previous tools, Kara provides modifiable\nvisualisations such that interpretations can be manipulated by graphically\nediting their visualisations. This is realised by resorting to abductive\nreasoning techniques. Kara is part of SeaLion, a forthcoming integrated\ndevelopment environment (IDE) for ASP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Sep 2011 17:09:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Oct 2011 10:03:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kloim\u00fcllner", "Christian", ""], ["Oetsch", "Johannes", ""], ["P\u00fchrer", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["Tompits", "Hans", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6073", "submitter": "Julian Heinrich", "authors": "Julian Heinrich, Yuan Luo, Arthur E.

We will see that this type of methods\nessentially allows the simulation of ocean scenes in the deep water domain,\nwithout breaking waves. On the other hand, physically-based methods use\nNavier-Stokes Equations (NSE) to represent breaking waves and more generally\nocean surface near the shore.
