However, the reliability\nof GPUs in error-intolerant applications is largely unproven. In particular, a\nlack of error checking and correcting (ECC) capability in the memory subsystems\nof graphics cards has been cited as a hindrance to the acceptance of GPUs as\nhigh-performance coprocessors, but the impact of this design has not been\npreviously quantified.\n  In this article we present MemtestG80, our software for assessing memory\nerror rates on NVIDIA G80 and GT200-architecture-based graphics cards.\nFurthermore, we present the results of a large-scale assessment of GPU error\nrate, conducted by running MemtestG80 on over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home\ndistributed computing network. Our control experiments on consumer-grade and\ndedicated-GPGPU hardware in a controlled environment found no errors. However,\nour survey over cards on Folding@home finds that, in their installed\nenvironments, two-thirds of tested GPUs exhibit a detectable, pattern-sensitive\nrate of memory soft errors. We demonstrate that these errors persist after\ncontrolling for overclocking and environmental proxies for temperature, but\ndepend strongly on board architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2009 02:04:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Nov 2009 04:14:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Haque", "Imran S.", ""], ["Pande", "Vijay S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4084", "submitter": "Andrew Gillette", "authors": "Chandrajit Bajaj, Andrew Gillette, Samrat Goswami, Bong June Kwon, and\n  Jose Rivera", "title": "Complementary Space for Enhanced Uncertainty and Dynamics Visualization", "comments": "12 pages.

This problem is further\namplified when dealing with hierarchical representations containing varying\nlevels of detail and / or shapes undergoing dynamic deformations. In this\npaper, we compute, quantify and visualize the complementary topological and\ngeometrical features of 3D shape models, namely, the tunnels, pockets and\ninternal voids of the object. We find that this approach sheds a unique light\non how a model is affected by local uncertainty, errors or modifications and\nshow how the presence or absence of complementary shape features can be\nessential to an object's structural form and function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2009 22:00:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bajaj", "Chandrajit", ""], ["Gillette", "Andrew", ""], ["Goswami", "Samrat", ""], ["Kwon", "Bong June", ""], ["Rivera", "Jose", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4854", "submitter": "Serguei Mokhov", "authors": "Serguei A.
