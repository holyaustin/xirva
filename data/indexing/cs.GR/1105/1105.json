This device can capture highly detailed facial\ngeometry (down to the level of skin pores detail) and Multispectral reflectance\nmap which can be used to estimate biophysical skin parameters such as the\ndistribution of pigmentation and blood beneath the surface of the skin. We\nextend the analysis of the original spherical gradient photometric stereo\nmethod to study the effects of deformed diffuse lobes on the quality of\nrecovered surface normals. Based on our modified radiance equations, we develop\na minimal image set method to recover high quality photometric normals using\nonly four, instead of six, spherical gradient images. Using the same radiance\nequations, we explore a Quadratic Programming (QP) based algorithm for\ncorrection of surface normals obtained using spherical gradient photometric\nstereo. Based on the proposed minimal image sets method, we present a\nperformance capture sequence that significantly reduces the data capture\nrequirement and post-processing computational cost of existing photometric\nstereo based performance geometry capture methods. Furthermore, we explore the\nuse of images captured in our Light Stage to generate stimuli images for a\npsychology experiment exploring the neural representation of 3D shape and\ntexture of a human face.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2011 13:00:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dutta", "Abhishek", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5678", "submitter": "Filip Sadlo", "authors": "Filip Sadlo and Daniel Weiskopf", "title": "Time-Dependent 2-D Vector Field Topology: An Approach Inspired by\n  Lagrangian Coherent Structures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Computer Graphics Forum, Volume 29, Issue 1, pages 88-100, March\n  2010", "doi": "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01546.x", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR math.AP math.DS nlin.CD physics.data-an physics.flu-dyn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents an approach to a time-dependent variant of the concept of\nvector field topology for 2-D vector fields. Vector field topology is defined\nfor steady vector fields and aims at discriminating the domain of a vector\nfield into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. The presented approach\nrepresents a generalization for saddle-type critical points and their\nseparatrices to unsteady vector fields based on generalized streak lines, with\nthe classical vector field topology as its special case for steady vector\nfields. The concept is closely related to that of Lagrangian coherent\nstructures obtained as ridges in the finite-time Lyapunov exponent field. The\nproposed approach is evaluated on both 2-D time-dependent synthetic and vector\nfields from computational fluid dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 May 2011 02:28:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Sadlo", "Filip", ""], ["Weiskopf", "Daniel", ""]]}]
