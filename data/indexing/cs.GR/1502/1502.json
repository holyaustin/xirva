These subtle stylizations may emphasize anatomy,\ndraw the viewer's focus to characteristic features of the subject, or symbolize\ntextures that might not be accurately reproduced in a particular sculptural\nmedium, while still retaining fidelity to the unique proportions of an\nindividual. In this work we demonstrate an interactive system for enhancing\nface geometry using a class of stylizations based on visual decomposition into\nabstract semantic regions, which we call sculptural abstraction. We propose an\ninteractive two-scale optimization framework for stylization based on\nsculptural abstraction, allowing real-time adjustment of both global and local\nparameters. We demonstrate this system's effectiveness in enhancing physical 3D\nprints of scans from various sources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 16:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Jachnik", "Jan", ""], ["Goldman", "Dan B", ""], ["Luo", "Linjie", ""], ["Davison", "Andrew J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02139", "submitter": "Gustavo I.

Given a 3D grid of\nscalar values, an underlying curve network is formed using second order\ninformation and cubic Hermite splines. Circular arc fitting defines the tangent\nvectors for the Hermite curves at specified isovalues. Once the boundary curve\nnetwork is formed, a loop of curves is determined for each grid cell and then\ninterpolated with multi-sided surface patches, which are $G^1$ continuous at\nthe joins. The data economy of the method and its continuity preserving\nproperties provide an effective compression scheme, ideal for indirect volume\nrendering on mobile devices, or collaborating on the Internet, while enhancing\nvisual fidelity. The use of multi-sided patches enables a more natural way to\napproximate the isosurfaces than using a fixed number of sides or polygons as\nis proposed in the literature. This assertion is supported with comparisons to\nthe traditional Marching Cubes algorithm and other $G^1$ methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 13:13:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ch\u00e1vez", "Gustavo", ""], ["Rockwood", "Alyn", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02961", "submitter": "Richard Kennaway", "authors": "Richard Kennaway", "title": "Avatar-independent scripting for real-time gesture animation", "comments": "23 pages, 12 figures.

The core of all midpoint methods is the accurate measurement of the\ndifference of the squared distances of two points to the polar of their\nmidpoint with respect to the conic. When this measurement is valid, it also\nmeasures the difference of the squared distances of these points to the conic,\nalthough it may be inaccurate, called Out-of-Accuracy or OoA. The primary\ncondition is the necessary and sufficient condition that a measurement is\nvalid. It is comletely new and it can be checked ultra fast and before the\nactual measurement starts. Modeling an incremental algorithm, shows that the\ncurve must be subdivided into piecewise monotonic sections, the start point\nmust be optimal, and it explains that the 2D-incremental method can find,\nlocally, the global Least Square Distance. Locally means that there are at most\nthree candidate points for a given monotonic direction; therefore the\n2D-midpoint method has, locally, at most three measurements. When all the\npossible measurements are invalid, the midpoint method cannot be applied, and\nin that case the ultra fast OoC-rule selects the candidate point.
