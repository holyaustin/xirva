We have\nimplemented a system that uses hierarchical level-of-detailing for the results\nof cosmological simulations, in order to display visually accurate results\nwithout loading in the full dataset (containing over 10 billion points). The\nguiding principle of the program is that the user should not be able to\ndistinguish what they are seeing from a full rendering of the original data.\nFurthermore, by using a tree-based system for levels of detail, the size of the\nunderlying data is limited only by the capacity of the IO system containing it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Nov 2008 09:34:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2008 20:31:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Szalay", "Tamas", ""], ["Springel", "Volker", ""], ["Lemson", "Gerard", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.4121", "submitter": "Sarad  AV", "authors": "Sankar K and Sarad AV", "title": "String Art: Circle Drawing Using Straight Lines", "comments": "12 pages, code included", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  An algorithm to generate the locus of a circle using the intersection points\nof straight lines is proposed. The pixels on the circle are plotted independent\nof one another and the operations involved in finding the locus of the circle\nfrom the intersection of straight lines are parallelizable. Integer only\narithmetic and algorithmic optimizations are used for speedup. The proposed\nalgorithm makes use of an envelope to form a parabolic arc which is consequent\ntransformed into a circle. The use of parabolic arcs for the transformation\nresults in higher pixel errors as the radius of the circle to be drawn\nincreases. At its current state, the algorithm presented may be suitable only\nfor generating circles for string art.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2008 17:12:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["K", "Sankar", ""], ["AV", "Sarad", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.4681", "submitter": "Ga?tan Le Guelvouit", "authors": "Ga\\\"etan Le Guelvouit, Teddy Furon, Fran\\c{c}ois Cayre", "title": "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: three different approaches to break\n  their watermarking system", "comments": "8 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Proc.
