To identify prominent symmetric\nregions which overlap in space and vary in form, the proposed framework is\ndecoupled into a Correspondence Space Voting procedure followed by a\nTransformation Space Mapping procedure. In the correspondence space voting\nprocedure, significant symmetries are first detected by identifying surface\npoint pairs on the input shape that exhibit local similarity in terms of their\nintrinsic geometry while simultaneously maintaining an intrinsic distance\nstructure at a global level. Since different point pairs can share a common\npoint, the detected symmetric shape regions can potentially overlap. To this\nend, a global intrinsic distance-based voting technique is employed to ensure\nthe inclusion of only those point pairs that exhibit significant symmetry. In\nthe transformation space mapping procedure, the Functional Map framework is\nemployed to generate the final map of symmetries between point pairs. The\ntransformation space mapping procedure ensures the retrieval of the underlying\ndense correspondence map throughout the 3D shape that follows a particular\nsymmetry. Additionally, the formulation of a novel cost matrix enables the\ninner product to succesfully indicate the complexity of the underlying symmetry\ntransformation. The proposed transformation space mapping procedure is shown to\nresult in the formulation of a semi-metric symmetry space where each point in\nthe space represents a specific symmetry transformation and the distance\nbetween points represents the complexity between the corresponding\ntransformations. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can\nsuccessfully process complex 3D shapes that possess rich symmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Sep 2013 16:11:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mukhopadhyay", "Anirban", ""], ["Bhandarkar", "Suchendra M.", ""], ["Porikli", "Fatih", ""]]}]
