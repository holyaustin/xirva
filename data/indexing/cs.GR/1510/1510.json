We present RAID, a relation-augmented image descriptor that\nsupports queries based on inter-region relations. The key idea of our\ndescriptor is to capture the spatial distribution of simple point-to-region\nrelationships to describe more complex relationships between two image regions.\nWe evaluate the proposed descriptor by querying into a large subset of the\nMicrosoft COCO database and successfully extract nontrivial images\ndemonstrating complex inter-region relations, which are easily missed or\nerroneously classified by existing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 11:58:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 12:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Guerrero", "Paul", ""], ["Mitra", "Niloy J.", ""], ["Wonka", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02710", "submitter": "Daisuke Iwai", "authors": "Kosuke Sato, Daisuke Iwai, Sei Ikeda, Noriko Takemura", "title": "Procams-Based Cybernetics", "comments": "2 pages, 2 figures, IEEE VR 2015 Lab/Project presentation", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Procams-based cybernetics is a unique, emerging research field, which aims at\nenhancing and supporting our activities by naturally connecting human and\ncomputers/machines as a cooperative integrated system via projector-camera\nsystems (procams).

Given the\ngeometry of the lampshade and a target grayscale image, our method computes a\ndistribution of tiny holes over the shell, such that the combined footprints of\nthe light emanating through the holes form the target image on a nearby diffuse\nsurface. Our objective is to approximate the continuous tones and the spatial\ndetail of the target image, to the extent possible within the constraints of\nthe fabrication process.\n  To ensure structural integrity, there are lower bounds on the thickness of\nthe shell, the radii of the holes, and the minimal distances between adjacent\nholes. Thus, the holes are realized as thin tubes distributed over the\nlampshade surface. The amount of light passing through a single tube may be\ncontrolled by the tube's radius and by its direction (tilt angle). The core of\nour technique thus consists of determining a suitable configuration of the\ntubes: their distribution across the relevant portion of the lampshade, as well\nas the parameters (radius, tilt angle) of each tube. This is achieved by\ncomputing a capacity-constrained Voronoi tessellation over a suitably defined\ndensity function, and embedding a tube inside the maximal inscribed circle of\neach tessellation cell. The density function for a particular target image is\nderived from a series of simulated images, each corresponding to a different\nuniform density tube pattern on the lampshade.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Oct 2015 08:13:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Haisen", ""], ["Lu", "Lin", ""], ["Wei", "Yuan", ""], ["Lischinski", "Dani", ""], ["Sharf", "Andrei", ""], ["Cohen-Or", "Daniel", ""], ["Chen", "Baoquan", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.03935", "submitter": "Yiqi Cai", "authors": "Yiqi Cai, Xiaohu Guo, Yang Liu, Wenping Wang, Weihua Mao, Zichun Zhong", "title": "Surface Approximation via Asymptotic Optimal Geometric Partition", "comments": "14 pages, 20 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a surface remeshing method with high approximation\nquality based on Principal Component Analysis.

Secondly, it\ncaptures sharp features on practical models without any pre-tagging.

Going in this direction, this paper introduces a\ncomputational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in\nnon-Newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity\nincreases with increased stress. These fluids have unique and unconventional\nbehavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in\nquicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures.\nWhile interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in\nthe real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been\nsimulated before in computer graphics. The fluid exhibits unique phase changes\nbetween solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and\nstrong hysteresis effects. Our proposed approach builds on existing\nnon-Newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient\nhistory-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting\nshear thickening phenomena. The history-based stiffness is formulated through\nthe use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability\nto depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of\nhistory-dependent systems.
