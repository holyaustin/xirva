We maintain multiple levels of coarseness using\na dynamic, randomized coarsening algorithm. To ensure the vertices follow\nsmooth trajectories, we employ dynamics simulation techniques, treating the\nvertices as point particles. We simulate fine and coarse levels of the graph\nsimultaneously, coupling the dynamics of adjacent levels. Projection from\ncoarser to finer levels is adaptive, with the projection determined by an\naffine transformation that evolves alongside the graph layouts. The result is a\ndynamic graph visualizer that quickly and smoothly adapts to changes in a\ngraph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2007 17:42:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Veldhuizen", "Todd L.", ""]]}]
