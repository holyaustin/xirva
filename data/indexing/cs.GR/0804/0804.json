In multimodal\ninteractive simulations, haptic feedback computation often comes from contact\nforces. Subsequently, the fidelity of haptic rendering depends significantly on\ncontact space modeling. Contact and friction laws between deformable models are\noften simplified in up to date methods. They do not allow a \"realistic\"\nrendering of the subtleties of contact space physical phenomena (such as slip\nand stick effects due to friction or mechanical coupling between contacts). In\nthis paper, we use Signorini's contact law and Coulomb's friction law as a\ncomputer haptics basis. Real-time performance is made possible thanks to a\nlinearization of the behavior in the contact space, formulated as the so-called\nDelassus operator, and iteratively solved by a Gauss-Seidel type algorithm.\nDynamic deformation uses corotational global formulation to obtain the Delassus\noperator in which the mass and stiffness ratio are dissociated from the\nsimulation time step. This last point is crucial to keep stable haptic\nfeedback. This global approach has been packaged, implemented, and tested.\nStable and realistic 6D haptic feedback is demonstrated through a clipping task\nexperiment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 13:49:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Duriez", "Christian", "", "INRIA Lille - Nord Europe"], ["Dubois", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "LMGC"], ["Kheddar", "Abderrahmane", "", "JRL"], ["Andriot", "Claude", "", "LIST"]]}, {"id": "0804.1046", "submitter": "Xu Zhiqiang", "authors": "Zhiqiang Xu, Guoliang Xu", "title": "Discrete schemes for Gaussian curvature and their convergence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CG cs.GR cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, several discrete schemes for Gaussian curvature are surveyed.\nThe convergence property of a modified discrete scheme for the Gaussian\ncurvature is considered.
