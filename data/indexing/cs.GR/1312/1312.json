We consider both classical\ntransport theory with exponentially-distributed free paths in arbitrary\ndimensions as well as a number of non-classical transport theories\n(non-exponential random flights) that describe a broader class of transport\nprocesses within partially-correlated random media. New rigorous asymptotic\ndiffusion approximations are derived where possible. We also generalize\nGrosjean's moment-preserving approach of separating the first (or uncollided)\ndistribution from the collided portion and approximating only the latter using\ndiffusion. We find that for any spatial dimension and for many free-path\ndistributions Grosjean's approach produces compact, analytic approximations\nthat are, overall, more accurate for high absorption and for small\nsource-detector separations than either $P_1$ diffusion or rigorous asymptotic\ndiffusion. These diffusion-based approximations are exact in the first two even\nspatial moments, which we derive explicitly for various non-classical transport\ntypes. We also discuss connections between the random-flight-theory derivation\nof the Green's function and the discrete spectrum of the transport operator and\nreport some new observations regarding the discrete eigenvalues of the\ntransport operator for general dimensions and free-path distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 02:29:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Dec 2013 08:55:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 06:09:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 03:41:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 26 Mar 2014 01:36:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["d'Eon", "Eugene", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.1824", "submitter": "Rushan Ziatdinov", "authors": "Sajid Musa, Rushan Ziatdinov, Carol Griffiths", "title": "Introduction to computer animation and its possible educational\n  applications", "comments": "25 pages, 23 figures", "journal-ref": "New Challenges in Education.

In this book chapter we\nintroduce and discuss the history of computer animation, its well-known\nfundamental principles and some educational applications.

To solve this problem, statistical shape\nspaces encoding human body shape and posture variations are commonly used to\nconstrain the search space for the shape estimate. In this work, we propose a\nnovel method that uses a posture-invariant shape space to model body shape\nvariation combined with a skeleton-based deformation to model posture\nvariation. Our method can estimate the body shape and posture of both static\nscans and motion sequences of dressed human body scans. In case of motion\nsequences, our method takes advantage of motion cues to solve for a single body\nshape estimate along with a sequence of posture estimates. We apply our\napproach to both static scans and motion sequences and demonstrate that using\nour method, higher fitting accuracy is achieved than when using a variant of\nthe popular SCAPE model as statistical model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 21:01:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2014 13:03:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wuhrer", "Stefanie", ""], ["Pishchulin", "Leonid", ""], ["Brunton", "Alan", ""], ["Shu", "Chang", ""], ["Lang", "Jochen", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.6935", "submitter": "Branko Malesevic", "authors": "Branko Malesevic, Ratko Obradovic, Bojan Banjac, Ivana Jovovic, Milica\n  Makragic", "title": "Application of polynomial texture mapping in process of digitalization\n  of cultural heritage", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present modern texture mapping techniques and several\napplications of polynomial texture mapping in cultural heritage programs.
