Therefore it is convenient to\ndevelop efficient algorithms to compute the area of an heliostat blocked or\nshadowed by the rest of the field. In this paper we explore the possibility of\nusing very efficient clipping algorithms developed for the video game and\nimaging industry to compute the blocking and shadowing efficiency of a solar\nthermal plant layout. We propose an algorithm valid for arbitrary position,\norientation and size of the heliostats. This algorithm turns out to be very\naccurate, free of assumptions and fast. We show the feasibility of the use of\nthis algorithm to the optimization of a solar plant by studying a couple of\nexamples in detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 16:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ramos", "A.", ""], ["Ramos", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2190", "submitter": "Yasser Abd El-Latif", "authors": "Yasser M.

The algorithm aims at preserving sharp\nfeatures and trim regions, during the surfaces subdivision, using a set of\nrules. The implementation is nontrivial due to the computational, topological,\nand smoothness constraints, which should be satisfied by the underlying\nsurface. The fundamental innovation, in this research work, is the ability to\npreserve sharp features anywhere on a surface. In addition, the resulting\nrepresentation remains within the multiresolution subdivision framework.\nPreserving the original representation has a core advantage that all the\napplicable operations to the multiresolution subdivision surfaces can\nsubsequently be applied to the edited model. Experimental results, including\nsurfaces coarsening and smoothing, were performed using the proposed algorithm\nfor validation purposes, and the results revealed that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms the other recent state of the art algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 15:47:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["El-Latif", "Yasser M.

Answering this question requires identifying which shapes\nare more suitable for the defined avatar and pose; and moreover, to provide\nfast preview of how to alter the input geometry to better fit the deformed\nshapes to the given avatar pose? The problem naturally links physical\nproportions of human body and its interaction with object shapes in an attempt\nto connect ergonomics with shape geometry. We designed an interaction system\nthat allows users to explore shape collections using the deformation of human\ncharacters while at the same time providing interactive previews of how to\nalter the shapes to better fit the user-specified character. We achieve this by\nfirst mapping ergonomics guidelines into a set of simultaneous multi-part\nconstraints based on target contacts; and then, proposing a novel contact-based\ndeformation model to realize multi-contact constraints. We evaluate our\nframework on various chair models and validate the results via a small user\nstudy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 22:31:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Youyi", ""], ["Dorsey", "Julie", ""], ["Mitra", "Niloy", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6993", "submitter": "Gabriele Sicuro", "authors": "Sergio Caracciolo, Carlo Lucibello, Giorgio Parisi, Gabriele Sicuro", "title": "Scaling hypothesis for the Euclidean bipartite matching problem", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.
