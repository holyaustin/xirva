Mesh models of\ncommon deformable garments are simulated with the garments picked up in\nmultiple different poses under gravity, and stored in a database for fast and\nefficient retrieval. To validate this approach, we developed a comprehensive\npipeline for manipulating clothing as in a typical laundry task. First, the\ndatabase is used for category and pose estimation for a garment in an arbitrary\nposition. A fully featured 3D model of the garment is constructed in real-time\nand volumetric features are then used to obtain the most similar model in the\ndatabase to predict the object category and pose. Second, the database can\nsignificantly benefit the manipulation of deformable objects via non-rigid\nregistration, providing accurate correspondences between the reconstructed\nobject model and the database models. Third, the accurate model simulation can\nalso be used to optimize the trajectories for manipulation of deformable\nobjects, such as the folding of garments.

As a result, the availability of tutorials for a given\nobject or viewpoint is limited. How2Sketch addresses this problem by\nautomatically generating easy-to-follow tutorials for arbitrary 3D objects.\nGiven a segmented 3D model and a camera viewpoint,it computes a sequence of\nsteps for constructing a drawing scaffold comprised of geometric primitives,\nwhich helps the user draw the final contours in correct perspective and\nproportion. To make the drawing scaffold easy to construct, the algorithm\nsolves for an ordering among the scaffolding primitives and explicitly makes\nsmall geometric modifications to the size and location of the object parts to\nsimplify relative positioning. Technically, we formulate this scaffold\nconstruction as a single selection problem that simultaneously solves for the\nordering and geometric changes of the primitives.
