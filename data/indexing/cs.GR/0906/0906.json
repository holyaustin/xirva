These\nrelations restrict the choice of reparameterizations for geometric continuity.\nIn particular, when one bicubic tensor-product B-spline patch is associated\nwith each facet of a quadrilateral mesh with n-valent vertices and we do not\nwant segments of the boundary curves forced to be linear, then the relations\ndictate the minimal number and multiplicity of knots: For general data, the\ntensor-product spline patches must have at least two internal double knots per\nedge to be able to model a G^1-conneced complex of C^1 splines. This lower\nbound on the complexity of any construction is proven to be sharp by suitably\ninterpreting an existing surface construction. That is, we have a tight bound\non the complexity of smoothing quad meshes with bicubic tensor-product B-spline\npatches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2009 22:57:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Jorg", ""], ["Fan", "Jianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.2274", "submitter": "D\\v{z}enan Zuki\\'c", "authors": "D\\v{z}enan Zuki\\'c, Christof Rezk-Salama, Andreas Kolb", "title": "A Neural Network Classifier of Volume Datasets", "comments": "10 pages, 10 figures, 1 table, 3IA conference http://3ia.teiath.gr/", "journal-ref": "International Conference on Computer Graphics and Artificial\n  Intelligence, Proceedings (2009) 53-62", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many state-of-the art visualization techniques must be tailored to the\nspecific type of dataset, its modality (CT, MRI, etc.), the recorded object or\nanatomical region (head, spine, abdomen, etc.) and other parameters related to\nthe data acquisition process.

Also, meta-data might be incomplete,\ninappropriate or simply missing.\n  This paper presents a novel and simple method of determining the type of\ndataset from previously defined categories. 2D histograms based on intensity\nand gradient magnitude of datasets are used as input to a neural network, which\nclassifies it into one of several categories it was trained with. The proposed\nmethod is an important building block for visualization systems to be used\nautonomously by non-experts. The method has been tested on 80 datasets, divided\ninto 3 classes and a \"rest\" class.\n  A significant result is the ability of the system to classify datasets into a\nspecific class after being trained with only one dataset of that class.

To facilitate the\ncomparison, we implement initial timing measurements on the same hardware\nagainst that of Euler integrator in the softbody framework by varying different\nalgorithm parameters. Due to a relatively large number of such variations we\nimplement a GLUI-based user-interface to allow for much more finer control over\nthe simulation process at real-time, which was lacking completely in the\nprevious versions of the framework. We show our currents results based on the\nenhanced framework. The two-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer\nelastic mass-spring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of\nthe inner layer can be set differently from the density of the outer layer; the\nmotion of the inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer.\nThese special features, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object,\nresult in improved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquid\nnon-uniform deformation. The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well\nillustrated in environments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling,\nand floor. The collision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty\nmethod and the motion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential\nEquation computation. Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them,\nand observe the response to their action in real-time and we provide an\nextensible framework and its implementation for comparative studies of\ndifferent physical-based modeling and integration algorithm implementations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2009 05:39:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Miao", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3224", "submitter": "Sergey Andreyev", "authors": "Sergey Andreyev", "title": "Personal applications, based on moveable / resizable elements", "comments": "14 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  All the modern day applications have the interface, absolutely defined by the\ndevelopers.

The objectives of adopting this concept are to address the several\nmajor difficulties in the application of Active Contours. Primarily, a\ntechnique is developed to realize the topological changes of Parametric Active\nContours (Snakes). The key strategy is to imitate the process of a balloon\nexpanding and filling in a closed space with several objects. After removing\nthe touched balloon surfaces, the objects can be identified by surrounded\nremaining balloon surfaces. A burned region swept by Snakes is utilized to\ntrace the contour and to give a criterion for stopping the movement of Snake\ncurve. When the Snakes terminates evolution totally, through ignoring this\ncriterion, it can form a connected area by evolving the Snakes again and\ncontinuing the region burning. The contours extracted from the boundaries of\nthe burned area can represent the child snake of each object respectively.\nSecondly, a novel scheme is designed to solve the problems of leakage of the\ncontour from the large gaps, and the segmentation error in Geometric Active\nContours (GAC). It divides the segmentation procedure into two processing\nstages. By simulating the wave propagating in the isotropic substance at the\nfinal stage, it can significantly enhance the effect of image force in GAC\nbased on Level Set and give the satisfied solutions to the two problems.\nThirdly, to support the physical models for active contours above, we introduce\na general image force field created on a template plane over the image plane.\nThis force is more adaptable to noisy images with complicated geometric shapes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2009 16:38:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2009 03:03:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2009 15:53:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Hongyu", ""], ["Bao", "Shanglian", ""]]}]
