Surface reconstruction and mesh refinement impose a requirement on the\ndistribution of the points they process. I show how to use this assumption to\nlossily compress a set of n input points into a representation that takes only\nO(n) bits, independent of the word size. The loss can keep inter-point\ndistances to within 10% relative error while still achieving a factor of three\nspace savings. The representation allows standard quadtree operations, along\nwith computing the restricted Voronoi cell of a point, in time O(w^2 + log n),\nwhich can be improved to time O(log n) if w is in Theta(log n). Thus one can\nuse this compressed representation to perform mesh refinement or surface\nreconstruction in O(n) bits with only a logarithmic slowdown.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 01:39:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hudson", "Beno\u00eet", ""]]}]
