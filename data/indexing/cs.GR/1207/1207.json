It is a functional that captures the notions of order/disorder\nand of distance to an equilibrium distribution. The former is computed by a\nmeasure of entropy, while the latter depends on the definition of a stochastic\ndivergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is\ncorrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats,\nthis noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized\ntechniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful\nfamily of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which\nleads, among other probability distributions, to the G0 law. This distribution\nhas been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model,\ndeserving the \"universal\" denomination for its ability to describe most types\nof targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an\nimage corrupted by speckle noise, we assume that the equilibrium distribution\nis that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format,\nwhich appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy\nalong with the Hellinger distance to measure the statistical complexity of\nintensity SAR images, and we show that it is an expressive feature capable of\nidentifying many types of targets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 17:25:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["de Almeida", "Eliana S.", ""], ["de Medeiros", "Antonio Carlos", ""], ["Rosso", "Osvaldo A.", ""], ["Frery", "Alejandro C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0771", "submitter": "Alejandro Frery", "authors": "Leonardo Torres, Antonio C.
