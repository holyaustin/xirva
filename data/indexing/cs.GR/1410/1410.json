Therefore, techniques to synthesize animations have been developed.\nHowever, these procedural techniques offer limited adaptability by animation\nartists. In order to solve this, a fuzzy neural network model of the animation\nis proposed, where the parameters can be tuned either by machine learning\ntechniques that use motion capture data as training data or by the animation\nartist himself. This paper illustrates how this real time procedural animation\nsystem can be developed, taking the human gait on flat terrain and inclined\nsurfaces as example.

The magnitude of a difference\ndetermines the loss rate of the compression. The bigger difference usually\nmeans a smaller file, but also worse image quality and noticable differences\nfrom the original image.
