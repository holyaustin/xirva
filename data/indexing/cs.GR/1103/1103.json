The merging of the real world model and\ndigital objects allows streamline the work with the model and speed up the\nwhole production phase significantly. The main advantage of augmented reality\nis the possibility of direct manipulation with the scene using a portable\ndigital camera. Also adding digital objects into the scene could be done using\nidentification markers placed on the surface of the model. Therefore it is not\nnecessary to work with special input devices and lose the contact with the real\nworld model. Adjustments are done directly on the model. The key problem of\noutlined solution is the ability of identification of an object within the\ncamera picture and its replacement with the digital object. The second part of\nthe article is focused especially on the identification of exact position and\norientation of the marker within the picture. The identification marker is\ngeneralized into the triple of points which represents a general plane in\nspace. There is discussed the space identification of these points and the\ndescription of representation of their position and orientation be means of\ntransformation matrix. This matrix is used for rendering of the graphical\nobjects (e. g. in OpenGL and Direct3D).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Mar 2011 16:00:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Stastny", "Jiri", ""], ["Prochazka", "David", ""], ["Koubek", "Tomas", ""], ["Landa", "Jaromir", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.4271", "submitter": "Emilio Ferrara", "authors": "Salvatore Catanese, Emilio Ferrara, Giacomo Fiumara, Francesco Pagano", "title": "Rendering of 3D Dynamic Virtual Environments", "comments": "8 pages, 11 figures, Proceedings of the 4th International ICST\n  Conference on Simulation Tools and Techniques (2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.4108/icst.simutools.2011.245524", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a framework for the rendering of dynamic 3D virtual\nenvironments which can be integrated in the development of videogames. It\nincludes methods to manage sounds and particle effects, paged static\ngeometries, the support of a physics engine and various input systems. It has\nbeen designed with a modular structure to allow future expansions. We exploited\nsome open-source state-of-the-art components such as OGRE, PhysX,\nParticleUniverse, etc.; all of them have been properly integrated to obtain\npeculiar physical and environmental effects. The stand-alone version of the\napplication is fully compatible with Direct3D and OpenGL APIs and adopts OpenAL\nAPIs to manage audio cards. Concluding, we devised a showcase demo which\nreproduces a dynamic 3D environment, including some particular effects: the\nalternation of day and night infuencing the lighting of the scene, the\nrendering of terrain, water and vegetation, the reproduction of sounds and\natmospheric agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Mar 2011 14:16:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2011 18:11:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Catanese", "Salvatore", ""], ["Ferrara", "Emilio", ""], ["Fiumara", "Giacomo", ""], ["Pagano", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5028", "submitter": "Johannes Courtial", "authors": "Dean Lambert, Alasdair C.
