The proposed analytical solution depicts a novel\nway of solving the point in polygon problem by employing the properties of\nepigraphs and hypographs, explicitly. Contrary to the ambiguous solutions given\nby the cross over for the simple and self intersecting polygons and the\nsolution of a point being multiply inside a self intersecting polygon given by\nthe winding number rule, the current solution gives unambiguous and singular\nresult for both kinds of polygons. Finally, the current theoretical solution\nproves to be mathematically correct for simple and self intersecting polygons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Oct 2010 11:49:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Jul 2011 00:22:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Shriprakash", ""], ["Nanetti", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2623", "submitter": "Konstantin Kolchin", "authors": "Konstantin Kolchin", "title": "Surface Curvature Effects on Reflectance from Translucent Materials", "comments": "10 pages, 2 figures.
