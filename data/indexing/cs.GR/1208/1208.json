A well-designed color scheme improves Web pages' visual aesthetic and\nfacilitates user interactions. As far as we know, existing color assessment\nstudies focus on images; studies on color assessment and editing for Web pages\nare rare. This paper investigates color assessment for Web pages based on\nexisting online color theme-rating data sets and applies this assessment to Web\ncolor edit. This study consists of three parts. First, we study the extraction\nof a Web page's color theme. Second, we construct color assessment models that\nscore the color compatibility of a Web page by leveraging machine learning\ntechniques. Third, we incorporate the learned color assessment model into a new\napplication, namely, color transfer for Web pages. Our study combines\ntechniques from computer graphics, Web mining, computer vision, and machine\nlearning. Experimental results suggest that our constructed color assessment\nmodels are effective, and useful in the color transfer for Web pages, which has\nreceived little attention in both Web mining and computer graphics communities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2012 02:24:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Ou", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.1983", "submitter": "Sukhpal  Singh Gill", "authors": "Sukhpal Singh", "title": "An algorithm for improving the quality of compacted JPEG image by\n  minimizes the blocking artifacts", "comments": "18 pages with 19 Figures, To appear in the Proceedings of\n  International Journal of Computer Graphics & Animation (IJCGA) Vol.2, No.2/3,\n  July 2012, 17-35", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Graphics & Animation (IJCGA)\n  Vol.2, No.2/3, July 2012, 17-35", "doi": null, "report-no": "2212ijcga02", "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  The Block Transform Coded, JPEG- a lossy image compression format has been\nused to keep storage and bandwidth requirements of digital image at practical\nlevels. However, JPEG compression schemes may exhibit unwanted image artifacts\nto appear - such as the 'blocky' artifact found in smooth/monotone areas of an\nimage, caused by the coarse quantization of DCT coefficients. A number of image\nfiltering approaches have been analyzed in literature incorporating\nvalue-averaging filters in order to smooth out the discontinuities that appear\nacross DCT block boundaries. Although some of these approaches are able to\ndecrease the severity of these unwanted artifacts to some extent, other\napproaches have certain limitations that cause excessive blurring to\nhigh-contrast edges in the image. The image deblocking algorithm presented in\nthis paper aims to filter the blocked boundaries. This is accomplished by\nemploying smoothening, detection of blocked edges and then filtering the\ndifference between the pixels containing the blocked edge. The deblocking\nalgorithm presented has been successful in reducing blocky artifacts in an\nimage and therefore increases the subjective as well as objective quality of\nthe reconstructed image.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2012 17:47:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sukhpal", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.3794", "submitter": "Qi Chen", "authors": "Qi Chen, Hartmut Prautzsch", "title": "General Midpoint Subdivision", "comments": "19 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce two generalizations of midpoint subdivision and\nanalyze the smoothness of the resulting subdivision surfaces at regular and\nextraordinary points.\n  The smoothing operators used in midpoint and mid-edge subdivision connect the\nmidpoints of adjacent faces or of adjacent edges, respectively. An arbitrary\ncombination of these two operators and the refinement operator that splits each\nface with m vertices into m quadrilateral subfaces forms a general midpoint\nsubdivision operator. We analyze the smoothness of the resulting subdivision\nsurfaces by estimating the norm of a special second order difference scheme and\nby using established methods for analyzing midpoint subdivision. The surfaces\nare smooth at their regular points and they are also smooth at extraordinary\npoints for a certain subclass of general midpoint subdivision schemes.\n  Generalizing the smoothing rules of non general midpoint subdivision schemes\naround extraordinary and regular vertices or faces results in a class of\nsubdivision schemes, which includes the Catmull-Clark algorithm with restricted\nparameters.
