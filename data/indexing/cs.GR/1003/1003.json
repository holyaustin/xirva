Via macro views on chaotic attractor is obtained\nnot only visual space illustration of representative point motion in state\nspace, but also its relation to planes of singularity elements. Our created\nprogram enables view on chaotic attractor both in 2D and 3D space together with\nplane objects visualization -- elements of singularities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Mar 2010 16:42:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Sobota", "Branislav", ""], ["Guzan", "Milan", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.1410", "submitter": "Seungyeon Kim", "authors": "Seungyeon Kim, Guy Lebanon", "title": "Local Space-Time Smoothing for Version Controlled Documents", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Computational\n  Linguistics (Coling 2010); 2010 Aug 23-27; Beijing, CN", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.CL cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Unlike static documents, version controlled documents are continuously edited\nby one or more authors.

To plot this 3-D functions on 2-D screen it requires some kind of\nmapping. Though OpenGL, DirectX etc 3-D rendering libraries have made this job\nvery simple, still these libraries come with many complex pre- operations that\nare simply not intended, also to integrate these libraries with any kind of\nsystem is often a tough trial. This article presents a very simple method of\nmapping from 3D to 2D, that is free from any complex pre-operation, also it\nwill work with any graphics system where we have some primitive 2-D graphics\nfunction. Also we discuss the inverse transform and how to do basic computer\ngraphics transformations using our coordinate mapping system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Mar 2010 23:32:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Sandipan", ""], ["Abraham", "Ajith", ""], ["Sanyal", "Sugata", ""]]}]
