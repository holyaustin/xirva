The two black holes are evolved using post-Newtonian\napproximations starting with initially randomly distributed spin vectors. We\ncharacterize certain aspects of the distribution shortly before merger. In\nparticular we note the uniform distribution of black hole spin vector dot\nproducts shortly before merger and a high correlation between the initial and\nfinal black hole spin vector dot products in the equal-mass, maximally spinning\ncase. These simulations were performed on Graphics Processing Units, and we\ndemonstrate a speed-up of a factor 50 over a more conventional CPU\nimplementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2009 20:00:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 17:39:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Herrmann", "Frank", ""], ["Silberholz", "John", ""], ["Bellone", "Matias", ""], ["Guerberoff", "Gustavo", ""], ["Tiglio", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4374", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Ratnesh Kumar Jain, Dr. Suresh Jain, Dr. R.

But representation of the mined patterns is often not in a form\nsuitable for direct human consumption. Hence mechanisms and tools that can\nrepresent mined patterns in easily understandable format are utilized.\nDifferent techniques are used for pattern analysis, one of them is\nvisualization. Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data analysis\nand decision making tasks. In the data visualization process, technical\nrepresentations of web pages are replaced by user attractive text\ninterpretations. Experiments with the real world problems showed that the\nvisualization can significantly increase the quality and usefulness of web log\nmining results. However, how decision makers perceive and interact with a\nvisual representation can strongly influence their understanding of the data as\nwell as the usefulness of the visual presentation. Human factors therefore\ncontribute significantly to the visualization process and should play an\nimportant role in the design and evaluation of visualization tools.
