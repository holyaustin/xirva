On the other hand, recent developments of 3D scanning and\ncomputer vision technologies have produced a large number of 3D surface models\nrepresented as point clouds. Herein, we develop a simple and efficient method\nfor solving PDEs on closed surfaces represented as point clouds. By projecting\nthe radial vector of standard radial basis function(RBF) kernels onto the local\ntangent plane, we are able to produce a representation of functions that\npermits the replacement of surface differential operators with their Cartesian\nequivalent.

With the ever-increasing resolution of modern\nmicroscopes the data set size of the scanned specimen grows steadily. On\ncommodity hardware this size easily exceeds the available main memory and the\neven more limited GPU memory. Common volume rendering techniques require the\nentire data set to be present in the GPU memory. Existing out-of-core rendering\napproaches for large volume data sets either are limited to single-channel\nvolumes, or require a computer cluster, or have long preprocessing times.\nResults: We introduce a ray-casting technique for rendering large volumetric\nmulti-channel microscopy data streams on commodity hardware. The volumetric\ndata is managed at different levels of detail by an octree structure. In\ncontrast to previous octree-based techniques, the octree is built incrementally\nand therefore supports streamed microscopy data as well as data set sizes\nexceeding the available main memory. Furthermore, our approach allows the user\nto interact with the partially rendered data set at all stages of the octree\nconstruction. After a detailed description of our method, we present\nperformance results for different multi-channel data sets with a size of up to\n24 GB on a standard desktop PC. Conclusions: Our rendering technique allows\nbiologists to visualize their scanned specimen on their standard desktop\ncomputers without high-end hardware requirements. Furthermore, the user can\ninteract with the data set during the initial loading to explore the already\nloaded parts, change rendering parameters like color maps or adjust clipping\nplanes. Thus, the time of biologists being idle is reduced. Also, streamed data\ncan be visualized to detect and stop flawed scans early during the scan\nprocess.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2014 13:24:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Brix", "Tobias", ""], ["Pra\u00dfni", "J\u00f6rg-Stefan", ""], ["Hinrichs", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.2089", "submitter": "Andrew Cohen", "authors": "Eric Wait, Mark Winter, Chris Bjornsson, Erzsebet Kokovay, Yue Wang,\n  Susan Goderie, Sally Temple and Andrew Cohen", "title": "Visualization and Correction of Automated Segmentation, Tracking and\n  Lineaging from 5-D Stem Cell Image Sequences", "comments": "BioVis 2014 conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Results: We present an application that enables the quantitative analysis of\nmultichannel 5-D (x, y, z, t, channel) and large montage confocal fluorescence\nmicroscopy images.

The structure of GPMs is a uniquely good\nmatch for biological problems that range from aligning sequences to modeling\nthe genome-to-phenome relationship. The fundamental questions that GPMs address\ninvolve making decisions based on a complex web of interacting factors.\nUnfortunately, while GPMs ideally fit many questions in biology, they are not\nan easy solution to apply. Building a GPM is not a simple task for an end user.\nMoreover, applying GPMs is also impeded by the insidious fact that the complex\nweb of interacting factors inherent to a problem might be easy to define and\nalso intractable to compute upon. Discussion: We propose that the visualization\nsciences can contribute to many domains of the bio-sciences, by developing\ntools to address archetypal representation and user interaction issues in GPMs,\nand in particular a variety of GPM called a Conditional Random Field(CRF). CRFs\nbring additional power, and additional complexity, because the CRF dependency\nnetwork can be conditioned on the query data. Conclusions: In this manuscript\nwe examine the shared features of several biological problems that are amenable\nto modeling with CRFs, highlight the challenges that existing visualization and\nvisual analytics paradigms induce for these data, and document an experimental\nsolution called StickWRLD which, while leaving room for improvement, has been\nsuccessfully applied in several biological research projects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2014 14:34:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ray", "William C.", ""], ["Wolock", "Samuel L.", ""], ["Callahan", "Nicholas W", ""], ["Dong", "Min", ""], ["Li", "Q.

Results: We\npresent Multiresolution Correlation Analysis (MCA), a method for visually\nidentifying subpopulations based on the local pairwise correlation between\ncovariates, without needing to define an a priori interaction scale. We\ndemonstrate that MCA facilitates the identification of differentially regulated\nsubpopulations in simulated data from a small gene regulatory network, followed\nby application to previously published single-cell qPCR data from mouse\nembryonic stem cells.

Conclusions: MCA is a useful method for the\nidentification of subpopulations in low-dimensional expression data, as\nemerging from qPCR or FACS measurements. With MCA it is possible to investigate\nthe robustness of covariate correlations with respect subpopulations,\ngraphically identify outliers, and identify factors contributing to\ndifferential regulation between pairs of covariates.
