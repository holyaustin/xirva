This\narticle presents a general mathematical framework to efficiently allocate the\navailable computational resources to process the parts of the input that are\nrelevant to solve a given perceptual problem. By this we mean to find the\nhypothesis H (i.e., the state of the world) that maximizes a function L(H),\nrepresenting how well each hypothesis \"explains\" the input. Given the large\nbandwidth of the sensory input, fully evaluating L(H) for each hypothesis H is\ncomputationally infeasible (e.g., because it would imply checking a large\nnumber of pixels). To address this problem we propose a mathematical framework\nwith two key ingredients. The first one is a Bounding Mechanism (BM) to compute\nlower and upper bounds of L(H), for a given computational budget. These bounds\nare much cheaper to compute than L(H) itself, can be refined at any time by\nincreasing the budget allocated to a hypothesis, and are frequently enough to\ndiscard a hypothesis. To compute these bounds, we develop a novel theory of\nshapes and shape priors. The second ingredient is a Focus of Attention\nMechanism (FoAM) to select which hypothesis' bounds should be refined next,\nwith the goal of discarding non-optimal hypotheses with the least amount of\ncomputation. The proposed framework: 1) is very efficient since most hypotheses\nare discarded with minimal computation; 2) is parallelizable; 3) is guaranteed\nto find the globally optimal hypothesis; and 4) its running time depends on the\nproblem at hand, not on the bandwidth of the input. We instantiate the proposed\nframework for the problem of simultaneously estimating the class, pose, and a\nnoiseless version of a 2D shape in a 2D image.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 18:59:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Aug 2011 19:31:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rother", "Diego", ""], ["Sch\u00fctz", "Simon", ""], ["Vidal", "Ren\u00e9", ""]]}]
