Their performance is on par\nwith previously presented GPU implementations of noise, they are very\nconvenient to use, and they scale well with increasing parallelism in present\nand upcoming GPU architectures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 12:03:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["McEwan", "Ian", ""], ["Sheets", "David", ""], ["Gustavson", "Stefan", ""], ["Richardson", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.4734", "submitter": "Chantal Racette", "authors": "Chantal Racette", "title": "Numerical Analysis of Diagonal-Preserving, Ripple-Minimizing and\n  Low-Pass Image Resampling Methods", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Image resampling is a necessary component of any operation that changes the\nsize of an image or its geometry.\n  Methods tuned for natural image upsampling (roughly speaking, image\nenlargement) are analyzed and developed with a focus on their ability to\npreserve diagonal features and suppress overshoots.

The accuracy and frequency response of the approximations are\ntabulated and plotted against the original, establishing their rapid\nconvergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2012 20:05:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Racette", "Chantal", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6216", "submitter": "Keenan Crane", "authors": "Keenan Crane, Clarisse Weischedel, Max Wardetzky", "title": "Geodesics in Heat", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ACM Trans.

The heat method is\nrobust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair\nof standard linear elliptic problems. The method represents a significant\nbreakthrough in the practical computation of distance on a wide variety of\ngeometric domains, since the resulting linear systems can be prefactored once\nand subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance can be\nupdated via the heat method an order of magnitude faster than with\nstate-of-the-art methods while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. We\nprovide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact geodesic\ndistance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of\ndistance suitable for applications where more regularity is required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2012 20:26:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2012 16:53:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Crane", "Keenan", ""], ["Weischedel", "Clarisse", ""], ["Wardetzky", "Max", ""]]}]
