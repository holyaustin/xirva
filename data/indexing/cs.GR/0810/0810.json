The problem of automatic selection of an optimized set of views,\nwhich better describes an on-going simulation over a virtual environment is\naddressed in the context of the RoboCup Rescue Simulation domain. A generic\narchitecture for optimization is proposed and described. We outline the\npossible extensions of this architecture and argue on how several problems\nwithin the fields of Interactive Rendering and Visualization can benefit from\nit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Oct 2008 12:53:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Moreira", "Pedro Miguel", ""], ["Reis", "Lu\u00eds Paulo", ""], ["de Sousa", "Ant\u00f3nio Augusto", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3418", "submitter": "Elka Korutcheva", "authors": "K.Koroutchev and E.
