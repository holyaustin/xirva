Some numerical\nmethods of 3D surface morphing by deformable modeling and conformal mapping are\nshown in this study. It is well known that there exists a unique Riemann\nconformal mapping from a simply connected surface into a unit disk by the\nRiemann mapping theorem. The dilation and relative orientations of the 3D\nsurfaces can be linked through the M\\\"obius transformation due to the conformal\ncharacteristic of the Riemann mapping. On the other hand, a 3D surface\ndeformable model can be built via various approaches such as mutual\nparameterization from direct interpolation or surface matching using landmarks.\nIn this paper, we take the advantage of the unique representation of 3D\nsurfaces by the mean curvatures and the conformal factors associated with the\nRiemann mapping. By registering the landmarks on the conformal parametric\ndomains, the correspondence of the mean curvatures and the conformal factors\nfor each surfaces can be obtained. As a result, we can construct the 3D\ndeformation field from the surface reconstruction algorithm proposed by Gu and\nYau. Furthermore, by composition of the M\\\"obius transformation and the 3D\ndeformation field, the morphing sequence can be generated from the mean\ncurvatures and the conformal factors on a unified mesh structure by using the\ncubic spline homotopy. Several numerical experiments of the face morphing are\npresented to demonstrate the robustness of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 03:27:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yueh", "Mei-Heng", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng David", ""], ["Lin", "Wen-Wei", ""], ["Wu", "Chin-Tien", ""], ["Yau", "Shing-Tung", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01025", "submitter": "Zhihan Lv", "authors": "Zhihan Lv, Liangbing Feng, Shengzhong Feng, Haibo Li", "title": "Preprint Extending Touch-less Interaction on Vision Based Wearable\n  Device", "comments": "This is the preprint version of our paper on IEEE Virtual Reality\n  Conference 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CV cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is the preprint version of our paper on IEEE Virtual Reality Conference\n2015.
