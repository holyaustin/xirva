The\ninjectivity (one-to-one property) of a mapping function is typically necessary\nfor these applications. Toric B\\'{e}zier patches are generalizations of\nclassical patches (triangular, tensor product) which are defined on the convex\nhull of a set of integer lattice points. We give a geometric condition on the\ncontrol points that we show is equivalent to the injectivity of every 2D toric\nB\\'{e}zier patch with those control points for all possible choices of weights.\nThis condition refines that of Craciun, et al., which only implied injectivity\non the interior of a patch.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2011 05:35:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Sottile", "Frank", ""], ["Zhu", "Chungang", ""]]}]
