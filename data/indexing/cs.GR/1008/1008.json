It includes the classical Enneper surface for cubic case.\nThe proposed minimal surfaces also have some interesting properties such as\nsymmetry, containing straight lines and self-intersections. According to the\nshape properties, the proposed minimal surface can be classified into four\ncategories with respect to $n=4k-1$ $n=4k+1$, $n=4k$ and $n=4k+2$. The explicit\nparametric form of corresponding conjugate minimal surfaces is given and the\nisometric deformation is also implemented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 22:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 08:15:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Gang", ""], ["Wang", "Guozhao", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0502", "submitter": "Akisato Kimura", "authors": "Akamine Kazuma, Ken Fukuchi, Akisato Kimura and Shigeru Takagi", "title": "Fully automatic extraction of salient objects from videos in near\n  real-time", "comments": "submitted to Special Issue on High Performance Computation on\n  Hardware Accelerators, the Computer Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Automatic video segmentation plays an important role in a wide range of\ncomputer vision and image processing applications.

To this end, we propose a new and quite fast method for\nautomatic video segmentation with the help of 1) efficient optimization of\nMarkov random fields with polynomial time of number of pixels by introducing\ngraph cuts, 2) automatic, computationally efficient but stable derivation of\nsegmentation priors using visual saliency and sequential update mechanism, and\n3) an implementation strategy in the principle of stream processing with\ngraphics processor units (GPUs).

As a consequence,\nthere exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a\nmore quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the\nanalysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political\nscience must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative\ninformation; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of\nnumerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for\nvisualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially\nmultivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization\napproaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating\ninformative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and\nending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional\ntables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this\narticle we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization\nmethods with applications in political and social science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Aug 2010 13:29:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zinovyev", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1664", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz (University of Calgary), Mitra Shirmohammadi\n  (University of Calgary), Faramarz Samavati (University of Calgary)", "title": "L-systems in Geometric Modeling", "comments": "In Proceedings DCFS 2010, arXiv:1008.1270", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 31, 2010, pp. 3-14", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.31.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that parametric context-sensitive L-systems with affine geometry\ninterpretation provide a succinct description of some of the most fundamental\nalgorithms of geometric modeling of curves.

In the\npast, dedicated graphics systems at supercomputing centers were required to\nvisualize large data sets, but as the price of commodity graphics hardware has\ndropped and its capability has increased, it is now possible, in principle, to\nview large complex data sets on a single workstation. To do this in practice,\nan investigator will need software that is written to take advantage of the\nrelevant graphics hardware. The Viewpoints visualization package described\nherein is an example of such software. Viewpoints is an interactive tool for\nexploratory visual analysis of large, high-dimensional (multivariate) data. It\nleverages the capabilities of modern graphics boards (GPUs) to run on a single\nworkstation or laptop. Viewpoints is minimalist: it attempts to do a small set\nof useful things very well (or at least very quickly) in comparison with\nsimilar packages today. Its basic feature set includes linked scatter plots\nwith brushing, dynamic histograms, normalization and outlier detection/removal.\nViewpoints was originally designed for astrophysicists, but it has since been\nused in a variety of fields that range from astronomy, quantum chemistry, fluid\ndynamics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance to information\ntechnology server log mining.
