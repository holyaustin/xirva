In this paper, we have presented a novel\ntext/graphics separation technique and a method for skew correction of text\nregions extracted from business card images captured with a cell-phone camera.\nAt first, the background is eliminated at a coarse level based on intensity\nvariance. This makes the foreground components distinct from each other. Then\nthe non-text components are removed using various characteristic features of\ntext and graphics. Finally, the text regions are skew corrected for further\nprocessing. Experimenting with business card images of various resolutions, we\nhave found an optimum performance of 98.25% (recall) with 0.75 MP images, that\ntakes 0.17 seconds processing time and 1.1 MB peak memory on a moderately\npowerful computer (DualCore 1.73 GHz Processor, 1 GB RAM, 1 MB L2 Cache). The\ndeveloped technique is computationally efficient and consumes low memory so as\nto be applicable on mobile devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Feb 2010 19:46:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mollah", "Ayatullah Faruk", ""], ["Basu", "Subhadip", ""], ["Nasipuri", "Mita", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4317", "submitter": "Amelia Carolina Sparavigna", "authors": "Amelia Carolina Sparavigna, Roberto Marazzato", "title": "CLD-shaped Brushstrokes in Non-Photorealistic Rendering", "comments": "Keywords: Image processing, Non-photorealistic processing,\n  Image-based rendering Coherence Length Diagram", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Software Engineering and Computing, 2011,\n  Volume 3, Issue 1, Pages 11-15", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rendering techniques based on a random grid can be improved by adapting\nbrushstrokes to the shape of different areas of the original picture.
