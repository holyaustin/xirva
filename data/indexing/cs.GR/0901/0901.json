Following the attempt to separate the real information from noise,\nwe considered also the family of all band-pass filters with the same band-width\n(specified as parameter). The fractal dimension can be thus represented as a\nfunction of the pixel color code. The program was used for the study of\npaintings cracks, as an additional tool which can help the critic to decide if\nan artistic work is original or not. In its second version, the application was\nextended for working also with csv files and three-dimensional images.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 14:41:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2009 17:46:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 27 Dec 2009 08:40:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Grossu", "I.
