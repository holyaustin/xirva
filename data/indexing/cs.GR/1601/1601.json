The framework considers as input time incoherent 3D\nobservations of a moving shape, and is thus particularly suitable for the\noutput of performance capture platforms. In our system, a suitable virtual\nrepresentation of the actor is built from real captures that allows seamless\ncombination and simulation with virtual external forces and objects, in which\nthe original captured actor can be reshaped, disassembled or reassembled from\nuser-specified virtual physics. Instead of using the dominant surface-based\ngeometric representation of the capture, which is less suitable for volumetric\neffects, our pipeline exploits Centroidal Voronoi tessellation decompositions\nas unified volumetric representation of the real captured actor, which we show\ncan be used seamlessly as a building block for all processing stages, from\ncapture and tracking to virtual physic simulation. The representation makes no\nhuman specific assumption and can be used to capture and re-simulate the actor\nwith props or other moving scenery elements. We demonstrate the potential of\nthis pipeline for virtual reanimation of a real captured event with various\nunprecedented volumetric visual effects, such as volumetric distortion,\nerosion, morphing, gravity pull, or collisions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 16:30:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Allain", "Benjamin", ""], ["Wang", "Li", ""], ["Franco", "Jean-Sebastien", ""], ["Hetroy", "Franck", ""], ["Boyer", "Edmond", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01754", "submitter": "Shizuo Kaji", "authors": "Genki Matsuda, Shizuo Kaji, Hiroyuki Ochiai", "title": "Anti-commutative Dual Complex Numbers and 2D Rigid Transformation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a new presentation of the two dimensional rigid transformation\nwhich is more concise and efficient than the standard matrix presentation.

Face surface is expressed as a B-spline surface\nthat can be reconstructed by optimizing B-spline control points. Therefore,\nnormals and 3D feature points computed from shading and motion of images\nrespectively are used as the 1st- and 0th- order derivative information, to be\njointly applied in optimizing the B-spline face. Additionally, an IMLS\n(iterative multi-least-square) algorithm is proposed to handle the difficult\ncontrol point optimization.
