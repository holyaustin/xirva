The\nmethod is based on nth root and nth power equalization approach but with\noptimization of the mean of the image in different colour channels such as RGB\nand HSI. The performance of the proposed method has been measured by the means\nof peak signal to noise ratio. The proposed algorithm has been compared with\nconventional histogram equalization and the visual and quantitative\nexperimental results are showing that the proposed method over perform the\nhistogram equalization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Dec 2014 10:53:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Anbarjafari", "Gholamreza", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.03032", "submitter": "Przemys{\\l}aw Gospodarczyk MSc.", "authors": "Przemys{\\l}aw Gospodarczyk, Stanis{\\l}aw Lewanowicz, Pawe{\\l} Wo\\'zny", "title": "$G^{k,l}$-constrained multi-degree reduction of B\\'ezier curves", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Numerical Algorithms 71, 121-137 (2016)", "doi": "10.1007/s11075-015-9988-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new approach to the problem of $G^{k,l}$-constrained ($k,l \\leq\n3$) multi-degree reduction of B\\'{e}zier curves with respect to the least\nsquares norm. First, to minimize the least squares error, we consider two\nmethods of determining the values of geometric continuity parameters. One of\nthem is based on quadratic and nonlinear programming, while the other uses some\nsimplifying assumptions and solves a system of linear equations. Next, for\nprescribed values of these parameters, we obtain control points of the\nmulti-degree reduced curve, using the properties of constrained dual Bernstein\nbasis polynomials. Assuming that the input and output curves are of degree $n$\nand $m$, respectively, we determine these points with the complexity $O(mn)$,\nwhich is significantly less than the cost of other known methods. Finally, we\ngive several examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 15:13:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Jan 2015 16:15:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 09:42:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Gospodarczyk", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["Lewanowicz", "Stanis\u0142aw", ""], ["Wo\u017any", "Pawe\u0142", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.03605", "submitter": "Kai Lawonn", "authors": "Kai Lawonn and Bernhard Preim", "title": "Feature Lines for Illustrating Medical Surface Models: Mathematical\n  Background and Survey", "comments": "33 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper provides a tutorial and survey for a specific kind of illustrative\nvisualization technique: feature lines.
