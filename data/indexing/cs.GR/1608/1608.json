For these cases, we introduce a method for\nvolumetric registration using curvature flow. Multiple prostate datasets are\nmapped to canonical solid spheres, which are in turn aligned and registered\nthrough the use of identified landmarks on or within the gland. Theoretical\nproof and experimental results show that our method produces homeomorphisms\nwith feature constraints. We provide thorough validation of our method by\nregistering prostate scans of the same patient in different orientations, from\ndifferent days and using different modes of MRI. Our method also provides the\nfoundation for a general group-wise registration using a standard reference,\ndefined on the complex plane, for any input. In the present context, this can\nbe used for registering as many scans as needed for a single patient or\ndifferent patients on the basis of age, weight or even malignant and\nnon-malignant attributes to study the differences in general population.

Thus, there may be false negatives, but there should never be\nfalse positives. Intuitively, the ability to find solutions can be considered a\nmeasure of solver's competence. We consider static constraint problems and\ntheir solvers. We do not consider dynamic constraint solvers, also known as\ndynamic geometry programs, in which specific geometric elements are moved,\ninteractively or along prescribed trajectories, while continually maintaining\nall stipulated constraints.

Interesting patterns of behavior typically\nmanifest at several key areas of a city over multiple temporal resolutions.\nStudying these patterns can greatly help a variety of experts ranging from city\nplanners and architects to human behavioral experts.

The prominent pulses\nin a city are obtained using the topology of the data sets, and are\ncharacterized as a set of beats. The beats are then used to analyze and compare\ndifferent pulses. We also design a visual exploration framework that allows\nusers to explore the pulses within and across multiple cities under different\nconditions. Finally, we present three case studies carried out by experts from\ntwo different domains that demonstrate the utility of our framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 20:02:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 18:04:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Miranda", "Fabio", ""], ["Doraiswamy", "Harish", ""], ["Lage", "Marcos", ""], ["Zhao", "Kai", ""], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Bruno", ""], ["Wilson", "Luc", ""], ["Hsieh", "Mondrian", ""], ["Silva", "Cl\u00e1udio T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08570", "submitter": "Nils Thuerey", "authors": "Nils Thuerey", "title": "Interpolations of Smoke and Liquid Simulations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ACM Transactions on Graphics, 36(1), 2017", "doi": "10.1145/2956233", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel method to interpolate smoke and liquid simulations in\norder to perform data-driven fluid simulations. Our approach calculates a dense\nspace-time deformation using grid-based signed-distance functions of the\ninputs. A key advantage of this implicit Eulerian representation is that it\nallows us to use powerful techniques from the optical flow area. We employ a\nfive-dimensional optical flow solve. In combination with a projection\nalgorithm, and residual iterations, we achieve a robust matching of the inputs.\nOnce the match is computed, arbitrary in between variants can be created very\nefficiently. To concatenate multiple long-range deformations, we propose a\nnovel alignment technique. Our approach has numerous advantages, including\nautomatic matches without user input, volumetric deformations that can be\napplied to details around the surface, and the inherent handling of topology\nchanges. As a result, we can interpolate swirling smoke clouds, and splashing\nliquid simulations. We can even match and interpolate phenomena with\nfundamentally different physics: a drop of liquid, and a blob of heavy smoke.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 17:31:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Thuerey", "Nils", ""]]}]
