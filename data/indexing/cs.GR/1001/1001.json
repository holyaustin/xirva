Let $S$ be a set of $n$ disjoint line segments in $\\R^2$ and let $s$\nbe an element of $S$. Visibility testing is to preprocess $S$ so that we can\nquickly determine if $s$ is visible from a query point $q$. Visibility counting\ninvolves preprocessing $S$ so that one can quickly estimate the number of\nsegments in $S$ visible from a query point $q$.\n  We present several data structures for the two query problems. The structures\nbuild upon a result by O'Rourke and Suri (1984) who showed that the subset,\n$V_S(s)$, of $\\R^2$ that is weakly visible from a segment $s$ can be\nrepresented as the union of a set, $C_S(s)$, of $O(n^2)$ triangles, even though\nthe complexity of $V_S(s)$ can be $\\Omega(n^4)$. We define a variant of their\ncovering, give efficient output-sensitive algorithms for computing it, and\nprove additional properties needed to obtain approximation bounds. Some of our\nbounds rely on a new combinatorial result that relates the number of segments\nof $S$ visible from a point $p$ to the number of triangles in $\\bigcup_{s\\in S}\nC_S(s)$ that contain $p$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2010 19:45:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Gudmundsson", "Joachim", ""], ["Morin", "Pat", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3481", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "U.Vijayasankar, S.Prasadh., A.Arul Lawrence Selvakumar", "title": "Resolution scalability improvement for JPEG2000 standard color image", "comments": "Removed by arXiv administration.

A colored-image is divided into blocks after converting the RGB\ncolored image to YCbCr color space. A monochrome image of 1024 bytes is used as\nthe watermark. To embed the watermark, 16 blocks of size 8X8 are selected and\nused to embed the watermark image into the original image. The selected blocks\nare chosen spirally (beginning form the center of the image) among the blocks\nthat have log-average luminance higher than or equal the log-average luminance\nof the entire image. Each byte of the monochrome watermark is added by updating\na luminance value of a pixel of the image. If the byte of the watermark image\nrepresented white color (255) a value <alpha> is added to the image pixel\nluminance value, if it is black (0) the <alpha> is subtracted from the\nluminance value. To extract the watermark, the selected blocks are chosen as\nthe above, if the difference between the luminance value of the watermarked\nimage pixel and the original image pixel is greater than 0, the watermark pixel\nis supposed to be white, otherwise it supposed to be black. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed scheme is efficient against changing the\nwatermarked image to grayscale, image cropping, and JPEG compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2010 08:08:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Hussein", "Jamal A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3974", "submitter": "C\\'esar Mena Labra\\~na", "authors": "C\\'esar Mena Labra\\~na, Ricardo S\\'anchez Schulz, Lautaro Salazar\n  Silva", "title": "Modelacion y Visualizacion Tridimensional Interactiva de Variables\n  Electricas en Celdas de Electro-Obtencion con Electrodos Bipolares", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures, in Spanish.
