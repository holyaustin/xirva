The restoration\nreveals a possible self-portrait of the artist, drawn when he was young. Here,\nwe discuss the discovery of this self-portrait and the procedure used for\nrestoration. Actually, this is a restoration performed on the digital image of\nthe sketch, a procedure that can easily extended and applied to ancient\ndocuments for studies of art and palaeography.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 08:06:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sparavigna", "Amelia", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2119", "submitter": "Martin Ziegler", "authors": "Matthias Fischer, Claudius J\\\"ahn and Martin Ziegler", "title": "Adaptive Mesh Approach for Predicting Algorithm Behavior with\n  Application to Visibility Culling in Computer Graphics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a concise approximate description, and a method for efficiently\nobtaining this description, via adaptive random sampling of the performance\n(running time, memory consumption, or any other profileable numerical quantity)\nof a given algorithm on some low-dimensional rectangular grid of inputs.
