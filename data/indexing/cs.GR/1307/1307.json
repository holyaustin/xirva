Compared with other magnification methods (e.g.,\ngeometric optics, mesh editing), 4D differential geometry theory and its\npractices are much more flexible and powerful for preserving shape features\n(i.e., minimizing angle distortion), and easier to adapt to versatile solid\nmodels. The primary advantage of 4D space lies at the following fact: we can\nnow easily magnify the volume of regions of interest (ROIs) from the additional\ndimension, while keeping the rest region unchanged. To achieve this primary\ngoal, we first embed a 3D volumetric input into 4D space and magnify ROIs in\nthe 4th dimension. Then we flatten the 4D shape back into 3D space to\naccommodate other typical applications in the real 3D world. In order to\nenforce distortion minimization, in both steps we devise the high dimensional\ngeometry techniques based on rigorous 4D geometry theory for 3D/4D mapping back\nand forth to amend the distortion. Our system can preserve not only focus\nregion, but also context region and global shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness, robustness, and efficacy of our framework with a variety of\nmodels ranging from tetrahedral meshes to volume datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 20:20:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 21:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Bo", ""], ["Zhao", "Xin", ""], ["Qin", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0155", "submitter": "Lucas Fran\\c{c}a", "authors": "Norberto Pe\\~na, Bruno Cec\\'ilio Credidio, Lorena Peixoto Nogueira\n  Rodriguez Martinez Salles Corr\\^ea, Lucas Gabriel Souza Fran\\c{c}a, Marcelo\n  do Vale Cunha, Marcos Cavalcanti de Sousa, Jo\\~ao Paulo Bomfim Cruz Vieira\n  and Jos\\'e Garcia Vivas Miranda", "title": "Free Instrument for Movement Measure", "comments": "Accepted for publication at the RBEF - Revista Brasileira de Ensino\n  de F\\'isica", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ins-det cs.GR physics.pop-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents the validation of a computational tool that serves to\nobtain continuous measurements of moving objects.

Scans might be\nacquired at different times, with patient movement between scans, or with\ndifferent equipment, resulting in multiple datasets that need to be registered.\nFor this issue, we introduce a registration method using anatomical\nfeature-guided mutual information. Prostate scans of the same patient taken in\nthree different orientations are first aligned for the accurate detection of\nanatomical features in 3D. Then, our pipeline allows for multiple modalities\nregistration through the use of anatomical features, such as the interior\nurethra of prostate and gland utricle, in a bijective way. The novelty of this\napproach is the application of anatomical features as the pre-specified\ncorresponding landmarks for prostate registration. We evaluate the registration\nresults through both artificial and clinical datasets. Registration accuracy is\nevaluated by performing statistical analysis of local intensity differences or\nspatial differences of anatomical landmarks between various MR datasets.\nEvaluation results demonstrate that our method statistics-significantly\nimproves the quality of registration. Although this strategy is tested for\nMRI-guided brachytherapy, the preliminary results from these experiments\nsuggest that it can be also applied to other settings such as transrectal\nultrasound-guided or CT-guided therapy, where the integration of preoperative\nMRI may have a significant impact upon treatment planning and guidance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Jul 2013 00:30:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 21:38:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Xin", ""], ["Kaufman", "Arie", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.2457", "submitter": "Roxana Bujack", "authors": "Roxana Bujack and Gerik Scheuermann and Eckhard Hitzer", "title": "Detection of Outer Rotations on 3D-Vector Fields with Iterative\n  Geometric Correlation and its Efficiency", "comments": "accepted for publication in Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras,\n  (2013). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1306.2195", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Correlation is a common technique for the detection of shifts.

The purpose of this color\ntransfer is to change the \"look and feel\" of images, i.e., evoking different\nemotions. Colors are confirmed as the most attractive factor in images. In\naddition, various studies in both art and science areas have concluded that\nother than single color, color combinations are necessary to evoke specific\nemotions. Therefore, we propose a novel framework to transfer color of images\nbased on color combinations, using a predefined color emotion model. The\ncontribution of this new framework is three-fold. First, users do not need to\nprovide reference images as used in traditional color transfer algorithms. In\nmost situations, users may not have enough aesthetic knowledge or path to\nchoose desired reference images. Second, because of the usage of color\ncombinations instead of single color for emotions, a new color transfer\nalgorithm that does not require an image library is proposed. Third, again\nbecause of the usage of color combinations, artifacts that are normally seen in\ntraditional frameworks using single color are avoided. We present encouraging\nresults generated from this new framework and its potential in several possible\napplications including color transfer of photos and paintings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jul 2013 21:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Nov 2014 05:26:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Li", ""], ["Qi", "Hairong", ""], ["Zaretzki", "Russell", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.4214", "submitter": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "authors": "Peter Apian-Bennewitz", "title": "Review of simulating four classes of window materials for daylighting\n  with non-standard BSDF using the simulation program Radiance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.CE cs.GR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  This review describes the currently available simulation models for window\nmaterial to calculate daylighting with the program \"Radiance\".
