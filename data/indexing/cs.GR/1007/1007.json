The aim of this article is to document problems with the\nPhong illumination model that are encountered by an important professional user\ngroup, namely digital designers. This leads to a visual evaluation of Phong\nillumination, which at least in this condensed form seems still to be missing\nin the literature. It is hoped that by explicating these flaws, awareness about\nthe limitations and interdependencies of the model will increase, both among\nfellow users, and among researchers and developers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jul 2010 21:09:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Hahn", "J\u00f6rg M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.3726", "submitter": "Tobias Preis", "authors": "Benjamin Block, Peter Virnau, Tobias Preis", "title": "Multi-GPU Accelerated Multi-Spin Monte Carlo Simulations of the 2D Ising\n  Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Benjamin Block, Peter Virnau, Tobias Preis, Computer Physics\n  Communications 181 (2010) 1549-1556", "doi": "10.1016/j.cpc.2010.05.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph cs.GR math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A modern graphics processing unit (GPU) is able to perform massively parallel\nscientific computations at low cost. We extend our implementation of the\ncheckerboard algorithm for the two dimensional Ising model [T. Preis et al., J.\nComp. Phys. 228, 4468 (2009)] in order to overcome the memory limitations of a\nsingle GPU which enables us to simulate significantly larger systems. Using\nmulti-spin coding techniques, we are able to accelerate simulations on a single\nGPU by factors up to 35 compared to an optimized single Central Processor Unit\n(CPU) core implementation which employs multi-spin coding. By combining the\nCompute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) with the Message Parsing Interface\n(MPI) on the CPU level, a single Ising lattice can be updated by a cluster of\nGPUs in parallel. For large systems, the computation time scales nearly\nlinearly with the number of GPUs used. As proof of concept we reproduce the\ncritical temperature of the 2D Ising model using finite size scaling\ntechniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 19:30:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Block", "Benjamin", ""], ["Virnau", "Peter", ""], ["Preis", "Tobias", ""]]}]
