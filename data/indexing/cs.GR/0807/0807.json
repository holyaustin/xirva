Depending on particular\nperturbation, visual forms of quasi-Mandelbrot set changes either sharply (when\nthe perturbation reaches some critical value) or continuously. In the latter\ncase we have a smooth transition from the classical form of the set to some\nforms, constructed from mostly linear structures, as it is typical for\ntwo-dimensional real number dynamics. Two examples of continuous evolution of\nthe quasi-Mandelbrot set are described.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2008 14:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Toporensky", "A.
