The main idea is to locally\nproject each surfel to the tangent plane, therefore deforming its aspect-ratio.\nIt is a generalization of the theory known for polyhedral surfaces. The main\ndifference is that the conformal ratios that appear are no longer real in\ngeneral. It yields a generalization of the standard Laplacian on weighted\ngraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2008 11:06:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mercat", "Christian", "", "I3M"]]}, {"id": "0802.3355", "submitter": "Francisco R Villatoro", "authors": "Francisco R.

In order to generate exactly the\nsame primary rays with both the sequential and the parallel codes, the quincunx\nsampling technique used in Radiance for the reduction of the number of primary\nrays by interpolation, must be left untouched in the parallel implementation.\nThe octree of local ambient values used in Radiance for the indirect\nillumination has been shared among all the processors. Both static and dynamic\nimage partitioning techniques which replicate the octree of the complete scene\nin all the processors and have load-balancing, have been developed for one\nframe rendering. Speedups larger than 7.5 have been achieved in a network of 8\nworkstations. For animation sequences, a new dynamic partitioning distribution\ntechnique with superlinear speedups has also been developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2008 17:32:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Villatoro", "Francisco R.", ""], ["Nebro", "Antonio J.", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez", "Jose E.", ""]]}]
