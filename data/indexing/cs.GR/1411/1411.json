Nevertheless, current\nimplementations have not examined the generation of continuous motion based on\nfootprints, where different behaviours can be generated automatically.\nTherefore, in this paper a flexible approach for footprint-driven locomotion\ncomposition is presented. The presented solution is based on the ability to\ngenerate footprint-driven locomotion, with flexible features like jumping,\nrunning, and stair stepping. In addition, the presented system examines the\nability of generating the desired motion of the character based on predefined\nfootprint patterns that determine which behaviour should be performed. Finally,\nit is examined the generation of transition patterns based on the velocity of\nthe root and the number of footsteps required to achieve the target behaviour\nsmoothly and naturally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 13:29:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Mousas", "Christos", ""], ["Newbury", "Paul", ""], ["Anagnostopoulos", "Christos-Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.3632", "submitter": "Yongliang Yang", "authors": "Yong-Liang Yang, Jun Wang, Niloy J.

The algorithm adapts both the part\ngeometry and the inter-part topology of the input shape to better align with\nmaterial specific fabrication requirements. As output, we produce the reshaped\nmodel along with respective part dimensions and inter-part junction\nspecifications. We evaluate our algorithm on a range of man-made models and\ndemonstrate non-trivial model reshaping examples focusing only on metal and\nwooden materials.

We present\na robust solution for ascertaining potentially dense surface patch (superpixel)\nassociations, requiring just range information. Our approach involves\ndecomposition of a view into regularized surface patches. We represent them as\nsequences expressing geometry invariantly over their superpixel neighborhoods,\nas uniquely consistent partial orderings. We match these representations\nthrough an optimal sequence comparison metric based on the Damerau-Levenshtein\ndistance - enabling robust association with quadratic complexity (in contrast\nto hitherto employed joint matching formulations which are NP-complete). The\napproach is able to perform under wide baselines, heavy rotations, partial\noverlaps, significant occlusions and sensor noise.\n  The technique does not require any priors -- motion or otherwise, and does\nnot make restrictive assumptions on scene structure and sensor movement. It\ndoes not require appearance -- is hence more widely applicable than appearance\nreliant methods, and invulnerable to related ambiguities such as textureless or\naliased content.
