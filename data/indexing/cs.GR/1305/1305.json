However, the high computational cost of the existing geodesic\nalgorithms means that they are not practical for large-scale models or\ntime-critical applications. To tackle this challenge, we propose the parallel\nChen-Han (or PCH) algorithm, which extends the classic Chen-Han (CH) discrete\ngeodesic algorithm to the parallel setting. The original CH algorithm and its\nvariant both lack a parallel solution because the windows (a key data structure\nthat carries the shortest distance in the wavefront propagation) are maintained\nin a strict order or a tightly coupled manner, which means that only one window\nis processed at a time. We propose dividing the CH's sequential algorithm into\nfour phases, window selection, window propagation, data organization, and\nevents processing so that there is no data dependence or conflicts in each\nphase and the operations within each phase can be carried out in parallel. The\nproposed PCH algorithm is able to propagate a large number of windows\nsimultaneously and independently. We also adopt a simple yet effective strategy\nto control the total number of windows. We implement the PCH algorithm on\nmodern GPUs (such as Nvidia GTX 580) and analyze the performance in detail. The\nperformance improvement (compared to the sequential algorithms) is highly\nconsistent with GPU double-precision performance (GFLOPS). Extensive\nexperiments on real-world models demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement\nin execution time compared to the state-of-the-art.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2013 14:09:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ying", "Xiang", ""], ["Xin", "Shi-Qing", ""], ["He", "Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.1473", "submitter": "Rushan Ziatdinov", "authors": "Rushan Ziatdinov, Kenjiro T.

Surface registration between simple surfaces,\nsuch as simply-connected open surfaces, has been well studied. However, very\nfew works have been carried out for the registration of high-genus surfaces.\nThe high-genus topology of the surface poses great challenge for surface\nregistration. A possible approach is to partition surfaces into\nsimply-connected patches and registration is done patch by patch. Consistent\ncuts are required, which are usually difficult to obtain and prone to error. In\nthis work, we propose an effective way to obtain geometric registration between\nhigh-genus surfaces without introducing consistent cuts. The key idea is to\nconformally parameterize the surface into its universal covering space, which\nis either the Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic disk embedded in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$. Registration can then be done on the universal covering space\nby minimizing a shape mismatching energy measuring the geometric dissimilarity\nbetween the two surfaces. Our proposed algorithm effectively computes a smooth\nregistration between high-genus surfaces that matches geometric information as\nmuch as possible. The algorithm can also be applied to find a smooth and\nbijective registration minimizing any general energy functionals. Numerical\nexperiments on high-genus surface data show that our proposed method is\neffective for registering high-genus surfaces with geometric matching. We also\napplied the method to register anatomical structures for medical imaging, which\ndemonstrates the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2013 08:48:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wen", "Chengfeng", ""], ["Lui", "Lok Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3971", "submitter": "Mingli Song", "authors": "Chengxi Ye, Dacheng Tao, Mingli Song, David W.

This paper derives a new type of image filter called sparse norm\nfilter (SNF) from optimization-based filtering. SNF has a very simple form,\nintroduces a general class of filtering techniques, and explains several\nclassic filters as special implementations of SNF, e.g. the averaging filter\nand the median filter. It has advantages of being halo free, easy to implement,\nand low time and memory costs (comparable to those of the bilateral filter).\nThus, it is more generic than a smoothing operator and can better adapt to\ndifferent tasks. We validate the proposed SNF by a wide variety of applications\nincluding edge-preserving smoothing, outlier tolerant filtering, detail\nmanipulation, HDR compression, non-blind deconvolution, image segmentation, and\ncolorization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 03:13:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ye", "Chengxi", ""], ["Tao", "Dacheng", ""], ["Song", "Mingli", ""], ["Jacobs", "David W.", ""], ["Wu", "Min", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4583", "submitter": "Xin Zhao", "authors": "Xin Zhao", "title": "Parallel Coordinates Guided High Dimensional Transfer Function Design", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures.
