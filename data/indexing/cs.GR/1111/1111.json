This problem is often\nformulated as a nonlinear least squares problem, where data arises from\ninterest point matching. Mismatched interest points cause serious problems in\nthis approach, as a single mismatch will affect the entire reconstruction. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel robust Student's t BA algorithm (RST-BA). We\nmodel reprojection errors using the heavy tailed Student's t-distribution, and\nuse an implicit trust region method to compute the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimate of the camera and viewing parameters in this model. The resulting\nalgorithm exploits the sparse structure essential for reconstructing\nmulti-image scenarios, has the same time complexity as standard L2 bundle\nadjustment (L2-BA), and can be implemented with minimal changes to the standard\nleast squares framework. We show that the RST-BA is more accurate than either\nL2-BA or L2-BA with a sigma-edit rule for outlier removal for a range of\nsimulated error generation scenarios. The new method has also been used to\nreconstruct lunar topography using data from the NASA Apollo 15 orbiter, and we\npresent visual and quantitative comparisons of RST-BA and L2-BA methods for\nthis application. In particular, using the RST-BA algorithm we were able to\nreconstruct a DEM from unprocessed data with many outliers and no ground\ncontrol points, which was not possible with the L2-BA method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Nov 2011 10:56:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aravkin", "Aleksandr Y.", ""], ["Styer", "Michael", ""], ["Moratto", "Zachary", ""], ["Nefian", "Ara", ""], ["Broxton", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3969", "submitter": "Luis Quesada", "authors": "Luis Quesada, Alejandro J.

These requirements\ndiscourage the wide spread of commercial applications based on 3D motion\ntracking. 3D motion tracking systems that require no knowledge on the target\nobject and run on a single low-budget camera require estimations of the object\nprojection features (namely, area and position). In this paper, we define the\nobject projection feature estimation problem and we present a novel 3D motion\ntracking system that needs no knowledge on the target object and that only\nrequires a single low-budget camera, as installed in most computers and\nsmartphones. Our system estimates, in real time, the three-dimensional position\nof a non-modeled unmarked object that may be non-rigid, non-convex, partially\noccluded, self occluded, or motion blurred, given that it is opaque, evenly\ncolored, and enough contrasting with the background in each frame. Our system\nis also able to determine the most relevant object to track in the screen. Our\n3D motion tracking system does not impose hard constraints, therefore it allows\na market-wide implementation of applications that use 3D motion tracking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Nov 2011 21:26:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2011 11:17:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Quesada", "Luis", ""], ["Le\u00f3n", "Alejandro J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.6321", "submitter": "Kamen Lozev", "authors": "Kamen Lozev", "title": "Shape and Trajectory Tracking of Moving Obstacles", "comments": "22 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DS math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work presents new methods and algorithms for tracking the shape and\ntrajectory of moving reflecting obstacles with broken rays, or rays reflecting\nat an obstacle. While in tomography the focus of the reconstruction method is\nto recover the velocity structure of the domain, the shape and trajectory\nreconstruction procedure directly finds the shape and trajectory of the\nobstacle. The physical signal carrier for this innovative method are ultrasonic\nbeams. When the speed of sound is constant, the rays are straight line segments\nand the shape and trajectory of moving objects will be reconstructed with\nmethods based on the travel time equation and ellipsoid geometry. For variable\nspeed of sound, we start with the eikonal equation and a system of differential\nequations that has its origins in acoustics and seismology. In this case, the\nrays are curves that are not necessarily straight line segments and we develop\nalgorithms for shape and trajectory tracking based on the numerical solution of\nthese equations. We present methods and algorithms for shape and trajectory\ntracking of moving obstacles with reflected rays when the location of the\nreceiver of the reflected ray is not known in advance. The shape and trajectory\ntracking method is very efficient because it is not necessary for the reflected\nsignal to traverse the whole domain or the same path back to the transmitter.\nIt could be received close to the point of reflection or far away from the\ntransmitter. This optimizes the energy spent by transmitters for tracking the\nobject, reduces signal attenuation and improves image resolution. It is a safe\nand secure method. We also present algorithms for tracking the shape and\ntrajectory of absorbing obstacles. The new methods and algorithms for shape and\ntrajectory tracking enable new applications and an application to one-hop\nInternet routing is presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2011 00:10:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Lozev", "Kamen", ""]]}]
