The limits of the screen\nspace and often opposite requirements from different users are the cause of the\ninfinite discussions between designers and users, but the source of this\nongoing conflict is not in the level of interface design, but in the basic\nprinciple of current graphical output: user may change some views and details,\nbut in general the output view is absolutely defined and fixed by the\ndeveloper. Author was working for several years on the algorithm that will\nallow eliminating this problem thus allowing stepping from designer-driven\napplications to user-driven. Such type of applications in which user is\ndeciding what, when and how to show on the screen, is the dream of scientists\nand engineers working on the analysis of the most complicated tasks. The new\nparadigm is based on movable and resizable graphics, and such type of graphics\ncan be widely used not only for scientific and engineering applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2007 13:19:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Andreyev", "Sergey", ""]]}]
