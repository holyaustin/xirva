Such a working two-stage bundle\nadjustment approach features: first, the algorithm is initialized by symmedian\npoint triangulation, a multiple-view generalization of the mid-point method;\nsecond, a symbolic-numeric method is employed to compute derivatives\naccurately; third, globalizing strategy such as line search or trust region is\nsmoothly applied to the underlying iteration which assures algorithm robustness\nin general cases.\n  Numerical comparison with tfml method shows that the local minimizers\nobtained by the two-stage iterative bundle adjustment approach proposed here\nare also the L2 optimal solutions to all the calibrated data sets available\nonline by the Oxford visual geometry group. Extensive numerical experiments\nindicate the bundle adjustment approach solves more than 99% the real\ntriangulation problems optimally.

In recent times, volumetric approaches in which the motion is captured\nfrom a number of cameras and a voxel-set representation of the body is built\nfrom the camera views, have gained ground due to attractive features such as\ninherent view-invariance and robustness to occlusions. Automatic, unsupervised\nsegmentation of moving bodies along entire sequences, in a temporally-coherent\nand robust way, has the potential to provide a means of constructing a\nbottom-up model of the moving body, and track motion cues that may be later\nexploited for motion classification. Spectral methods such as locally linear\nembedding (LLE) can be useful in this context, as they preserve \"protrusions\",\ni.e., high-curvature regions of the 3D volume, of articulated shapes, while\nimproving their separation in a lower dimensional space, making them in this\nway easier to cluster. In this paper we therefore propose a spectral approach\nto unsupervised and temporally-coherent body-protrusion segmentation along time\nsequences. Volumetric shapes are clustered in an embedding space, clusters are\npropagated in time to ensure coherence, and merged or split to accommodate\nchanges in the body's topology. Experiments on both synthetic and real\nsequences of dense voxel-set data are shown. This supports the ability of the\nproposed method to cluster body-parts consistently over time in a totally\nunsupervised fashion, its robustness to sampling density and shape quality, and\nits potential for bottom-up model construction\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 May 2014 13:12:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Cuzzolin", "Fabio", ""], ["Mateus", "Diana", ""], ["Horaud", "Radu", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7457", "submitter": "Jinesh Machchhar", "authors": "Bharat Adsul, Jinesh Machchhar, Milind Sohoni", "title": "Incorporating Sharp Features in the General Solid Sweep Framework", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper extends a recently proposed robust computational framework for\nconstructing the boundary representation (brep) of the volume swept by a given\nsmooth solid moving along a one parameter family $h$ of rigid motions. Our\nextension allows the input solid to have sharp features, i.e., to be of class\nG0 wherein, the unit outward normal to the solid may be discontinuous. In the\nearlier framework, the solid to be swept was restricted to be G1, and thus this\nis a significant and useful extension of that work. This naturally requires a\nprecise description of the geometry of the surface generated by the sweep of a\nsharp edge supported by two intersecting smooth faces. We uncover the geometry\nalong with the related issues like parametrization, self-intersection and\nsingularities via a novel mathematical analysis. Correct trimming of such a\nsurface is achieved by a delicate analysis of the interplay between the cone of\nnormals at a sharp point and its trajectory under $h$. The overall topology is\nexplicated by a key lifting theorem which allows us to compute the adjacency\nrelations amongst entities in the swept volume by relating them to\ncorresponding adjacencies in the input solid. Moreover, global issues related\nto body-check such as orientation are efficiently resolved. Many examples from\na pilot implementation illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our\nframework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 04:11:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Adsul", "Bharat", ""], ["Machchhar", "Jinesh", ""], ["Sohoni", "Milind", ""]]}]
