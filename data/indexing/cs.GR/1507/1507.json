We called it a\nhybrid algorithm because it is an implementation of a series of already known\ngraph-drawing and graph-theoretic procedures. We remedy in this hybrid the\nproblematic nature of the current force-based GDA which has the inability to\nscale to large, naturally-clustered, and disconnected graphs. These kinds of\ngraph usually model the complex inter-relationships among entities in social,\nbiological, natural, and artificial networks. Obviously, the hybrid runs longer\nthan the current GDAs. By using two extreme cases of graphs as inputs, we\npresent in this paper the derivation of the time complexity of the hybrid which\nwe found to be $O(|\\V|^3)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 02:24:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Monserrat", "Toni-Jan Keith P.", ""], ["Pabico", "Jaderick P.", ""], ["Albacea", "Eliezer A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.02800", "submitter": "Shuo Jin", "authors": "Chuhua Xian, Shuo Jin, Charlie C.L.

Criteria to ensure the quality of\ndeformation are preserved by the basis functions after decomposing the shape\ndomain according to the Voronoi diagram of handles. The cost of inserting a new\nhandle is only the time to evaluate the distances from the new handle to all\nsample points in the space of deformation. Moreover, a virtual handle insertion\nalgorithm has been developed to allow users freely placing handles while\npreserving the criteria on weights. Experimental examples for real-time 2D/3D\ndeformations are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 08:12:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Xian", "Chuhua", ""], ["Jin", "Shuo", ""], ["Wang", "Charlie C.
