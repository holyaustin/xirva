Information graphics and\ninteractive information visualization systems employ a variety of metaphorical\ndevices to make abstract, complex, voluminous, or otherwise\ndifficult-to-comprehend information understandable in graphical terms. This\npaper explores the use of metaphor in information visualization, advancing the\ntheory previously argued by Johnson, Lakoff, Tversky et al. that many\ninformation graphics are metaphorically understood in terms of cognitively\nentrenched spatial patterns known as image schemas. These patterns serve to\nstructure and constrain abstract reasoning processes via metaphorical\nprojection operations that are grounded in everyday perceptual experiences with\nphenomena such as containment, movement, and force dynamics. Building on\nprevious research, I argue that information graphics promote comprehension of\ntheir target information through the use of graphical patterns that invoke\nthese preexisting schematic structures. I further theorize that the degree of\nstructural alignment of a particular graphic with one or more corresponding\nimage schemas accounts for its perceived degree of intuitiveness. Accordingly,\nimage schema theory can provide a powerful explanatory and predictive framework\nfor visualization research. I review relevant theories of analogy and metaphor,\nand discuss the image schematic properties of several common types of\ninformation graphic. I conclude with the proposal that the inventory of image\nschemas culled from linguistic studies can serve as the basis for an inventory\nof design elements suitable for developing intuitive and effective new\ninformation visualization techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2008 19:55:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Risch", "John S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.4093", "submitter": "Ignacio Vega-Paez M en C", "authors": "Ignacio Vega-Paez, Jose Angel Ortega, Georgina G.
