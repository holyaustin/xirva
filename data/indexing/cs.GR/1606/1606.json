Recent work has shown\nthat indirect diffuse light reflections can be used to reconstruct objects and\ntwo-dimensional (2D) patterns around a corner. However, these prior methods\nalways require some specialized setup involving either ultrafast detectors or\nnarrowband light sources. Here we show that occluded objects can be tracked in\nreal time using a standard 2D camera and a laser pointer. Unlike previous\nmethods based on the backprojection approach, we formulate the problem in an\nanalysis-by-synthesis sense. By repeatedly simulating light transport through\nthe scene, we determine the set of object parameters that most closely fits the\nmeasured intensity distribution. We experimentally demonstrate that this\napproach is capable of following the translation of unknown objects, and\ntranslation and orientation of a known object, in real time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 09:17:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Klein", "Jonathan", ""], ["Peters", "Christoph", ""], ["Mart\u00edn", "Jaime", ""], ["Laurenzis", "Martin", ""], ["Hullin", "Matthias B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.02959", "submitter": "Gang Xu", "authors": "Gang Xu, Tsz-Ho Kwok, Charlie C.L.

These techniques\n(sometimes referred to as manifold learning) assume that the scattered input\ndata is lying on a lower dimensional manifold, thus the high dimensionality\nproblem can be overcome by learning the lower dimensionality behavior. However,\nin real life applications, data is often very noisy. In this work, we propose a\nmethod to approximate $\\mathcal{M}$ a $d$-dimensional $C^{m+1}$ smooth\nsubmanifold of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ ($d \\ll n$) based upon noisy scattered data\npoints (i.e., a data cloud). We assume that the data points are located \"near\"\nthe lower dimensional manifold and suggest a non-linear moving least-squares\nprojection on an approximating $d$-dimensional manifold. Under some mild\nassumptions, the resulting approximant is shown to be infinitely smooth and of\nhigh approximation order (i.e., $O(h^{m+1})$, where $h$ is the fill distance\nand $m$ is the degree of the local polynomial approximation). The method\npresented here assumes no analytic knowledge of the approximated manifold and\nthe approximation algorithm is linear in the large dimension $n$. Furthermore,\nthe approximating manifold can serve as a framework to perform operations\ndirectly on the high dimensional data in a computationally efficient manner.\nThis way, the preparatory step of dimension reduction, which induces\ndistortions to the data, can be avoided altogether.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 20:59:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 19:21:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Nov 2017 21:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 16 Jan 2018 16:33:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 7 Mar 2019 07:58:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:52:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:06:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sober", "Barak", ""], ["Levin", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09540", "submitter": "Nobuyuki Umetani Dr", "authors": "Nobuyuki Umetani, Ryan Schmidt", "title": "SurfCuit: Surface Mounted Circuits on 3D Prints", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present, SurfCuit, a novel approach to design and construction of electric\ncircuits on the surface of 3D prints.
