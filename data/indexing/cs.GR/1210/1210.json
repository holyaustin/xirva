In\npractice, surface maps are usually represented and stored as 3D coordinates\neach vertex is mapped to, which often requires lots of storage memory. This\ncauses inconvenience in data transmission and data storage. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose an effective algorithm for compressing surface\nhomeomorphisms using Fourier approximation of the Beltrami representation. The\nBeltrami representation is a complex-valued function defined on triangular\nfaces of the surface mesh with supreme norm strictly less than 1. Under\nsuitable normalization, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of\nsurface homeomorphisms and the set of Beltrami representations. Hence, every\nbijective surface map is associated with a unique Beltrami representation.\nConversely, given a Beltrami representation, the corresponding bijective\nsurface map can be exactly reconstructed using the Linear Beltrami Solver\nintroduced in this paper. Using the Beltrami representation, the surface\nhomeomorphism can be easily compressed by Fourier approximation, without\ndistorting the bijectivity of the map. The storage memory can be effectively\nreduced, which is useful for many practical problems in computer graphics and\nimaging. In this paper, we proposed to apply the algorithm to texture map\ncompression and video compression. With our proposed algorithm, the storage\nrequirement for the texture properties of a textured surface can be\nsignificantly reduced. Our algorithm can further be applied to compressing\nmotion vector fields for video compression, which effectively improve the\ncompression ratio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 12:17:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Lui", "Lok Ming", ""], ["Lam", "Ka Chun", ""], ["Wong", "Tsz Wai", ""], ["Gu", "XianFeng", ""]]}]
