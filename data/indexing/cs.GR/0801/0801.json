We measure a 822 times speedup over a Pentium IV on a 6144\nprocessor Blue Gene/L. We measure the computational performance as a function\nof number of processors and problem size to determine the scaling performance\nof the raytracing calculation on the Blue Gene. We find nontrivial scaling\nbehavior at large number of processors. We discuss applications of this\ntechnology to scientific visualization with advanced lighting and high\nresolution. We utilize three racks of a Blue Gene/L in our calculations which\nis less than three percent of the the capacity of the worlds largest Blue Gene\ncomputer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jan 2008 20:51:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["McGuigan", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.2175", "submitter": "Johannes Gro{\\ss}e", "authors": "Johannes Gro{\\ss}e", "title": "MathPSfrag 2: Convenient LaTeX Labels in Mathematica", "comments": "9 pages, package can be found at\n  http://wwwth.mppmu.mpg.de/members/jgrosse/mathpsfrag/", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": null, "abstract": "  This article introduces the next version of MathPSfrag.

In many areas of scientific study, understanding the\ncorrelations between those dimensions and their uncertainties is pivotal to\nmining useful information from a dataset. Obtaining this insight can\nnecessitate visualizing the many relationships among temporal, spatial, and\nother dimensionalities of data and its uncertainties. We utilize multiple views\nfor interactive dataset exploration and selection of important features, and we\napply those techniques to the unique challenges of cosmological particle\ndatasets. We show how interactivity and incorporation of multiple visualization\ntechniques help overcome the problem of limited visualization dimensions and\nallow many types of uncertainty to be seen in correlation with other variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 22:57:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2009 08:09:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Haroz", "Steve", ""], ["Ma", "Kwan-Liu", ""], ["Heitmann", "Katrin", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3249", "submitter": "Christian Kuehn", "authors": "Christian Kuehn", "title": "Complex Eigenvalues for Binary Subdivision Schemes", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.NA", "license": null, "abstract": "  Convergence properties of binary stationary subdivision schemes for curves\nhave been analyzed using the techniques of z-transforms and eigenanalysis.\nEigenanalysis provides a way to determine derivative continuity at specific\npoints based on the eigenvalues of a finite matrix.
