Object properties variability and different\nsituations of object combination represent important aspects of such type of\napplication which makes that the user can be interested as much in the\nrestitution of certain global properties of an entire object domain as in the\nrestitution of properties that are specific to an isolate object. In the\ntraditional approaches, the usual criteria are founded on the paradigm of\ntransparency and are related to the impedance error introduced by the technical\naspects of the system. As a general aim, rather than to minimize these effects,\nwe look to characterize them by physical metaphors conferring to haptic medium\nthe role of a tool. This positioning leads to firstly analyze the natural human\nobject interaction as a simplified evolutive system and then considers its\nsynthesis in the case of the interactive physical simulation.

This place was a\nsocial theater in which two kinds of collective phenomena took place:\ninterpersonal interactions (small group discussion and negotiation, etc.) and\nglobal collective phenomena, such as flowing and jamming. In this paper, we\nfocus on the second type of collective human phenomena, called non-deliberative\nemergent crowd phenomena. This is a typical case of collective emergent\nself-organization. When a great number of individuals move within a confined\nenvironment and under a common fate, collective structures appear\nspontaneously: jamming with inner collapses, organized flowing with queues,\ncurls, and vortices, propagation effects, etc. These are particularly relevant\nfeatures to enhance the realism - more precisely the \"truthfulness\" - of models\nof this kind of collective phenomena. We assume that this truthfulness is\nstrongly associated with the concept of emergence: evolutions are not\npredetermined by the individual characters, but emerge from the interaction of\nnumerous characters. The evolutions are not repetitive, and evolve on the basis\nof small changes. This paper demonstrates that the physically-based interacting\nparticles system is an adequate candidate to model emergent crowd effects: it\nassociates a large number of elementary dynamic actors via elementary\nnon-linear dynamic interactions. Our model of the scene is regulated as a\nlarge, dynamically coupled network of second order differential automata. We\ntake advantage of symbolic non-photorealistic and efficient visualization to\nrender the style of the person, rather than the person itself. As an artistic\nrepresentation, NPR reinforces the symbolic acceptance of the scene by the\nobserver, triggering an immediate and intuitive recognition of the scene as a\nplausible scene from ancient Greece.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2010 06:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["He\u00efgeas", "Laure", "", "IMAG-INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / GRAVIR"], ["Luciani", "Annie", "", "ACROE"], ["Thollot", "Jo\u00eblle", "", "IMAG-INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / GRAVIR"], ["Castagn\u00e9", "Nicolas", "", "ACROE, ICA"]]}, {"id": "1005.4563", "submitter": "Isabel Rodet", "authors": "Claire Guilbaud (ICA), Annie Luciani (ACROE), Nicolas Castagn\\'e\n  (ACROE)", "title": "Physically-based particle simulation and visualization of pastes and\n  gels", "comments": "Graphicon 2003, Moscou : Russie, F\\'ed\\'eration De (2003)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is focused on the question of simulation and visualiza- tion of 3D\ngel and paste dynamic effects.

The article argues that,\ngiven its growing presence in virtual reality situations, the \"gesture signal\"\nitself must be encoded, and that a specific format is needed. The proposed\nformat features the inner properties of such signals: dimensionality,\nstructural features, types of variables, and spatial and temporal properties.\nThe article first reviews the various situations with multisensory virtual\nobjects in which gesture controls intervene.
