Since sorting is one of the most common analytical tasks performed\non individual attributes of a multi-dimensional data set, this motivates the\nhypothesis that introducing glyph sorting would significantly enhance the\nusability of glyph-based visualization. In this paper, we present a glyph-based\nconceptual framework as part of a visualization process for interactive sorting\nof multivariate data. We examine several technical aspects of glyph sorting and\nprovide design principles for developing effective, visually sortable glyphs.\nGlyphs that are visually sortable provide two key benefits: 1) performing\ncomparative analysis of multiple attributes between glyphs and 2) to support\nmulti-dimensional visual search. We describe a system that incorporates focus\nand context glyphs to control sorting in a visually intuitive manner and for\nviewing sorted results in an Interactive, Multi-dimensional Glyph (IMG) plot\nthat enables users to perform high-dimensional sorting, analyse and examine\ndata trends in detail. To demonstrate the usability of glyph sorting, we\npresent a case study in rugby event analysis for comparing and analysing trends\nwithin matches. This work is undertaken in conjunction with a national rugby\nteam. From using glyph sorting, analysts have reported the discovery of new\ninsight beyond traditional match analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2013 09:50:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chung", "David H.

The main objective is to\nselect homogeneous pixels in the filtering area through statistical tests\nbetween distributions. This proposal uses the complex Wishart model to describe\nPolSAR data, but the technique can be extended to other models. The weights of\nthe location-variant linear filter are function of the p-values of tests which\nverify the hypothesis that two samples come from the same distribution and,\ntherefore, can be used to compute a local mean. The test stems from the family\nof (h-phi) divergences which originated in Information Theory. This novel\ntechnique was compared with the Boxcar, Refined Lee and IDAN filters. Image\nquality assessment methods on simulated and real data are employed to validate\nthe performance of this approach. We show that the proposed filter also\nenhances the polarimetric entropy and preserves the scattering information of\nthe targets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 22:11:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Torres", "Leonardo", ""], ["Sant'Anna", "Sidnei J.
