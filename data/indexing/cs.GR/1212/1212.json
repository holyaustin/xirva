In\npractical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes\nwhere the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes\neffectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is\nnecessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint\nsurface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic\nidea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean\ncurvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be\nuniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid\nmotion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal\nfactor $\\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.\nConversely, given $\\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely\nreconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter\ndomain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric\nquantities fully describing the surface. With this $\\lambda$-$H$ representation\nof the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem\nof image inpainting of $\\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.\nOnce $\\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed\nwhich effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the\ninpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\\lambda$ and $H$, the\nrestored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results\nshow that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to\nfill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 10:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lui", "Lok Ming", ""], ["Wen", "Chengfeng", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1617", "submitter": "Anil Maheshwari", "authors": "Jean-Lou De Carufel, Amin Gheibi, Anil Maheshwari, J\\\"org-R\\\"udiger\n  Sack, Christian Scheffer", "title": "Similarity of Polygonal Curves in the Presence of Outliers", "comments": "Replaces the earlier version of this paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.CV cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Fr\\'{e}chet distance is a well studied and commonly used measure to\ncapture the similarity of polygonal curves. Unfortunately, it exhibits a high\nsensitivity to the presence of outliers. Since the presence of outliers is a\nfrequently occurring phenomenon in practice, a robust variant of Fr\\'{e}chet\ndistance is required which absorbs outliers. We study such a variant here. In\nthis modified variant, our objective is to minimize the length of subcurves of\ntwo polygonal curves that need to be ignored (MinEx problem), or alternately,\nmaximize the length of subcurves that are preserved (MaxIn problem), to achieve\na given Fr\\'{e}chet distance. An exact solution to one problem would imply an\nexact solution to the other problem. However, we show that these problems are\nnot solvable by radicals over $\\mathbb{Q}$ and that the degree of the\npolynomial equations involved is unbounded in general. This motivates the\nsearch for approximate solutions.

The irregular locations\nand extensions of the refined regions in the SAMR scheme and the fact that\ndifferent resolution levels partially overlap, poses a challenge for GPU-based\ndirect volume rendering methods. kD-trees have proven to be advantageous to\nsubdivide the data domain into non-overlapping blocks of equally sized cells,\noptimal for the texture units of current graphics hardware, but previous\nGPU-supported raycasting approaches for SAMR data using this data structure\nrequired a separate rendering pass for each node, preventing the application of\nmany advanced lighting schemes that require simultaneous access to more than\none block of cells.

The tree is efficiently\nencoded by a set of 3D-textures, which allows to adaptively sample complete\nrays entirely on the GPU without any CPU interaction.
