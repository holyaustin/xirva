We model the morphs as linear\ninterpolations in a suitable shape space $\\mathcal{S}$. For triangulated 3D\npolygons, we prove that interpolating linearly in this shape space corresponds\nto the most isometric morph in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We then extend this shape space\nto arbitrary triangulations in 3D using a heuristic approach and show the\npractical use of the approach using experiments. Furthermore, we discuss a\nmodified shape space that is useful for isometric skeleton morphing. All of the\nnewly presented approaches solve the morphing problem without the need to solve\na minimization problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2008 23:08:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 20:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wuhrer", "Stefanie", ""], ["Bose", "Prosenjit", ""], ["Shu", "Chang", ""], ["O'Rourke", "Joseph", ""], ["Brunton", "Alan", ""]]}]
