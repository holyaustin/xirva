Using appropriate augmentations, the HO can\ninteract faster, safer and easier with the remote real world. In this paper, we\npresent an extension of an existing distributed software and network\narchitecture for collaborative teleoperation based on networked human-scaled\nmixed reality and mobile platform. The first teleoperation system was composed\nby a VR application and a Web application. However the 2 systems cannot be used\ntogether and it is impossible to control a distant robot simultaneously. Our\ngoal is to update the teleoperation system to permit a heterogeneous\ncollaborative teleoperation between the 2 platforms. An important feature of\nthis interface is based on different Mobile platforms to control one or many\nrobots.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2009 11:21:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Domingues", "Christophe", "", "IBISC"], ["Otmane", "Samir", "", "IBISC"], ["Davesne", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "IBISC"], ["Mallem", "Malik", "", "IBISC"]]}]
