Quasicrystals\nproduce space-filling, non-periodic point sets that are uniformly discrete and\nrelatively dense, thereby ensuring the sample sites are evenly spread out\nthroughout the sampled image. Their self-similar structure can be attractive\nfor creating sampling patterns endowed with a decorative symmetry. We present a\nbrief general overview of the algebraic theory of cut-and-project quasicrystals\nbased on the geometry of the golden ratio. To assess the practical utility of\nquasicrystal sampling, we evaluate the visual effects of a variety of\nnon-adaptive image sampling strategies on photorealistic image reconstruction\nand non-photorealistic image rendering used in multiresolution image\nrepresentations. For computer visualization of point sets used in image\nsampling, we introduce a mosaic rendering technique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jul 2009 10:08:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Grundland", "Mark", ""], ["Patera", "Jiri", ""], ["Masakova", "Zuzana", ""], ["Dodgson", "Neil A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4364", "submitter": "Miao Song", "authors": "Miao Song", "title": "Dynamic Deformation of Uniform Elastic Two-Layer Objects", "comments": "96 pages, 46 pages; master's thesis; August 2007; also available at\n  http://clues.concordia.ca/record=b2343207~S0", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This thesis presents a two-layer uniform facet elastic object for real-time\nsimulation based on physics modeling method. It describes the elastic object\nprocedural modeling algorithm with particle system from the simplest\none-dimensional object, to more complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional\nobjects.\n  The double-layered elastic object consists of inner and outer elastic mass\nspring surfaces and compressible internal pressure. The density of the inner\nlayer can be set different from the density of the outer layer; the motion of\nthe inner layer can be opposite to the motion of the outer layer. These special\nfeatures, which cannot be achieved by a single layered object, result in\nimproved imitation of a soft body, such as tissue's liquidity non-uniform\ndeformation. The construction of the double-layered elastic object is closer to\nthe real tissue's physical structure.\n  The inertial behavior of the elastic object is well illustrated in\nenvironments with gravity and collisions with walls, ceiling, and floor. The\ncollision detection is defined by elastic collision penalty method and the\nmotion of the object is guided by the Ordinary Differential Equation\ncomputation.\n  Users can interact with the modeled objects, deform them, and observe the\nresponse to their action in real time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2009 19:13:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Jul 2009 22:54:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Miao", ""]]}]
