These\nvolume datasets contain different materials which are difficult to extract and\nvisualize with 1D transfer functions based solely on the attenuation\ncoefficient. Multi-dimensional transfer functions allow a much more precise\nclassification of data which makes it easier to separate different surfaces\nfrom each other. Unfortunately, setting up multi-dimensional transfer functions\ncan become a fairly complex task, generally accomplished by trial and error.\nThis paper explains neural networks, and then presents an efficient way to\nspeed up visualization process by semi-automatic transfer function generation.\nWe describe how to use neural networks to detect distinctive features shown in\nthe 2D histogram of the volume data and how to use this information for data\nclassification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 08:36:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2009 08:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zuki\u0107", "D\u017eenan", ""], ["Elsner", "Andreas", ""], ["Avdagi\u0107", "Zikrija", ""], ["Domik", "Gitta", ""]]}]
