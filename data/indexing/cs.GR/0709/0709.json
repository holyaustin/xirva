They store all sensory observations as they come - the\ndata is holy. At any time, given some agent's current coding capabilities, part\nof the data is compressible by a short and hopefully fast program / description\n/ explanation / world model. In the agent's subjective eyes, such data is more\nregular and more \"beautiful\" than other data. It is well-known that knowledge\nof regularity and repeatability may improve the agent's ability to plan actions\nleading to external rewards. In absence of such rewards, however, known beauty\nis boring. Then \"interestingness\" becomes the first derivative of subjective\nbeauty: as the learning agent improves its compression algorithm, formerly\napparently random data parts become subjectively more regular and beautiful.\nSuch progress in compressibility is measured and maximized by the curiosity\ndrive: create action sequences that extend the observation history and yield\npreviously unknown / unpredictable but quickly learnable algorithmic\nregularity. We discuss how all of the above can be naturally implemented on\ncomputers, through an extension of passive unsupervised learning to the case of\nactive data selection: we reward a general reinforcement learner (with access\nto the adaptive compressor) for actions that improve the subjective\ncompressibility of the growing data. An unusually large breakthrough in\ncompressibility deserves the name \"discovery\". The \"creativity\" of artists,\ndancers, musicians, pure mathematicians can be viewed as a by-product of this\nprinciple. Several qualitative examples support this hypothesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2007 15:20:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schmidhuber", "Juergen", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3553", "submitter": "Sergey Andreyev", "authors": "Sergey Andreyev", "title": "Design of moveable and resizable graphics", "comments": "21 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  We are communicating with computers on two different levels.

This can\nnot only significantly improve the existing applications, but this will bring\nthe applications to another level.
