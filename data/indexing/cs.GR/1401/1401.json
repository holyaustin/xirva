We obtain a V-matrix with respect to the original mesh, whose elements\nare vertices of the mesh, which intrinsically preserves the vertex-set and the\nconnectivity of the original mesh in the sense of allowing round-off errors. We\ngenerate a CGIM array by using the Cartesian coordinates of corresponding\nvertices of the V-matrix. To reconstruct a mesh, we obtain a vertex-set and an\nedge-set by collecting all the elements with different pixels, and all\ndifferent pairwise adjacent elements from the CGIM array respectively. Compared\nwith traditional geometry images, CGIMs achieve minimum reconstruction errors\nwith an efficient parametrization-free algorithm via elementary permutation\ntechniques. We apply CGIMs to lossy compression of meshes, and the experimental\nresults show that CGIMs perform well in reconstruction precision and detail\npreservation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 08:50:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Jan 2014 08:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 14:31:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shaofan", ""], ["Kong", "Dehui", ""], ["Xue", "Juan", ""], ["Zhu", "Weijia", ""], ["Xu", "Min", ""], ["Yin", "Baocai", ""], ["Roth", "Hubert", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0608", "submitter": "Ali Sheharyar", "authors": "Ali Sheharyar, Othmane Bouhali", "title": "A Framework for Creating a Distributed Rendering Environment on the\n  Compute Clusters", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses the deployment of existing render farm manager in a\ntypical compute cluster environment such as a university. Usually, both a\nrender farm and a compute cluster use different queue managers and assume total\ncontrol over the physical resources. But, taking out the physical resources\nfrom an existing compute cluster in a university-like environment whose primary\nuse of the cluster is to run numerical simulations may not be possible. It can\npotentially reduce the overall resource utilization in a situation where\ncompute tasks are more than rendering tasks. Moreover, it can increase the\nsystem administration cost.
