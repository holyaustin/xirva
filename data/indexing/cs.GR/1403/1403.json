The proposed technique builds\nupon previous research in exposure fusion and expands it to deal with the\nlimited Temporal Dynamic Range of existing sensors and camera technologies. In\nparticular, temporal image fusion enables the rendering of long-exposure\neffects on full frame-rate video, as well as the generation of arbitrarily long\nexposures from a sequence of images of the same scene taken over time. We\nexplore the problem of temporal under-exposure, and show how it can be\naddressed by selectively enhancing dynamic structure. Finally, we show that the\nuse of temporal image fusion together with content-selective image filters can\nproduce a range of striking visual effects on a given input sequence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2014 14:08:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Estrada", "Francisco J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0728", "submitter": "Tolga Birdal", "authors": "Tolga Birdal, Emrah Bala", "title": "A Novel Method for Vectorization", "comments": "Prepared in Siggraph format, not published in a conference, 7 pages,\n  9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CG cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vectorization of images is a key concern uniting computer graphics and\ncomputer vision communities.

In our new algorithm a self intersecting\npolygon has been divided into non self intersecting contours and then perform\nthe Weiler Atherton clipping algorithm on those sub polygons. For holes we have\nto store the edges that is not own boundary of hole contour from recently\nclipped polygon.

However, in sufficiently transparent\nregions, classical diffusion approximation suffers from non-physical radiative\nfluxes which leads to a poor match to correct light transport. In particular,\nthis prevents the application of classical diffusion approximation to\nheterogeneous media, where opaque material is embedded within transparent\nregions. To address this limitation, we introduce flux-limited diffusion, a\ntechnique from the astrophysics domain. This method provides a better\napproximation to light transport than classical diffusion approximation,\nparticularly when applied to heterogeneous media, and hence broadens the\napplicability of diffusion-based techniques. We provide an algorithm for\nflux-limited diffusion, which is validated using the transport theory for a\npoint light source in an infinite homogeneous medium. We further demonstrate\nthat our implementation of flux-limited diffusion produces more accurate\nrenderings of multiple scattering in various heterogeneous datasets than\nclassical diffusion approximation, by comparing both methods to ground truth\nrenderings obtained via volumetric path tracing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 17:54:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Koerner", "David", ""], ["Portsmouth", "Jamie", ""], ["Sadlo", "Filip", ""], ["Ertl", "Thomas", ""], ["Eberhardt", "Bernd", ""]]}]
