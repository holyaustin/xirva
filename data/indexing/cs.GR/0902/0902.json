The primary aim of this work\nis to allow the development of standalone augmented reality applications for\nhandheld devices based on natural feature tracking. In order to achieve this\ngoal, a subset of two computer vision libraries was ported to the Pocket PC\nplatform. They were also adapted to use fixed point math, with the purpose of\nimproving the overall performance of the routines. The port of these libraries\nopens up the possibility of having other computer vision tasks being executed\non mobile platforms. A model based tracking approach that relies on edge\ninformation was adopted. Since it does not require a high processing power, it\nis suitable for constrained devices such as handhelds. The OpenGL ES graphics\nlibrary was used to perform computer vision tasks, taking advantage of existing\ngraphics hardware acceleration. An augmented reality application was created\nusing the implemented technique and evaluations were done regarding tracking\nperformance and accuracy\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2009 18:25:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lima", "Joao Paulo", ""], ["Teichrieb", "Veronica", ""], ["Kelner", "Judith", ""]]}]
