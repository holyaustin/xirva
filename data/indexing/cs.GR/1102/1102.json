Such a method is only valid based on\ndense sample points. The manifold usually needs to be triangulated into meshes\n(or patches) and each node on the mesh will have an initial value. While the\nmesh is refined the algorithm will provide a smooth function on the redefined\nmanifolds. However, when data points are not dense and the original mesh is not\nallowed to be changed, how is the \"continuous and/or smooth\" reconstruction\npossible? This paper will present a new method using harmonic functions to\nsolve the problem. Our method contains the following steps: (1) Partition the\nboundary surfaces of the 3D manifold based on sample points so that each sample\npoint is on the edge of the partition. (2) Use gradually varied interpolation\non the edges so that each point on edge will be assigned a value. In addition,\nall values on the edge are gradually varied. (3) Use discrete harmonic function\nto fit the unknown points, i.e. the points inside each partition patch.\n  The fitted function will be a harmonic or a local harmonic function in each\npartitioned area. The function on edge will be \"near\" continuous (or \"near\"\ngradually varied). If we need a smoothed surface on the manifold, we can apply\nsubdivision algorithms. This paper has also a philosophical advantage over\ntriangulation meshes. People usually use triangulation for data reconstruction.\nThis paper employs harmonic functions, a generalization of triangulation\nbecause linearity is a form of harmonic. Therefore, local harmonic\ninitialization is more sophisticated then triangulation. This paper is a\nconceptual and methodological paper. This paper does not focus on detailed\nmathematical analysis nor fine algorithm design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Feb 2011 16:15:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2011 15:58:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2011 02:59:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Li", ""], ["Luo", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.0634", "submitter": "D\\v{z}enan Zuki\\'c", "authors": "D\\v{z}enan Zuki\\'c and Jan Egger and Miriam H.

Topology-based geometric modelling deals with objects of\nvarious dimensions and shapes. Usually, objects are defined by a graph-based\ntopological data structure and by an embedding that associates each topological\nelement (vertex, edge, face, etc.) with relevant data as their geometric shape\n(position, curve, surface, etc.) or application dedicated data (e.g. molecule\nconcentration level in a biological context). We propose to define\ntopology-based geometric objects as labelled graphs. The arc labelling defines\nthe topological structure of the object whose topological consistency is then\nensured by labelling constraints. Nodes have as many labels as there are\ndifferent data kinds in the embedding. Labelling constraints ensure then that\nthe embedding is consistent with the topological structure. Thus,\ntopology-based geometric objects constitute a particular subclass of a category\nof labelled graphs in which nodes have multiple labels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Feb 2011 01:09:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bellet", "Thomas", "", "University of Poitiers"], ["Arnould", "Agn\u00e8s", "", "University of\n  Poitiers"], ["Gall", "Pascale Le", "", "Ecole Centrale Paris"]]}, {"id": "1102.3165", "submitter": "Anil Maheshwari", "authors": "Lyudmil Aleksandrov and Hristo Djidjev and Anil Maheshwari and\n  Joerg-Rudiger Sack", "title": "An Approximation Algorithm for Computing Shortest Paths in Weighted 3-d\n  Domains", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.DS cs.GR cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithm for computing\nshortest paths in weighted three-dimensional domains.
