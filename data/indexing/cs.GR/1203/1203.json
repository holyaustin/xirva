The framework also provides an interface to articulatory animation\nsynthesis, as well as an example application to illustrate its use with a 3D\ngame engine. We rely on cross-platform, open-source software and open standards\nto provide a lightweight, accessible, and portable workflow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2012 21:23:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Steiner", "Ingmar", "", "INRIA Lorraine - LORIA"], ["Ouni", "Slim", "", "INRIA Lorraine -\n  LORIA"]]}]
