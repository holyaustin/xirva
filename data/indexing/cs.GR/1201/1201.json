In traditional methods, optimization of control points and foot\npoints are performed in two very time-consuming steps in each iteration: 1)\ncontrol points are updated by setting up and solving a linear system of\nequations; and 2) foot points are computed by projecting each data point onto a\nB-spline curve. Our method uses the L-BFGS optimization method to optimize\ncontrol points and foot points simultaneously and therefore it does not need to\nperform either matrix computation or foot point projection in every iteration.\nAs a result, our method is much faster than existing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 06:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Wenni", ""], ["Bo", "Pengbo", ""], ["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Wang", "Wenping", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.1409", "submitter": "Yongquan Lai", "authors": "Ranch Y.Q.

It is difficult due to\nits dependence on inverse kinematics (IK) techniques and articulate property of\nhuman characters . To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on\nnumerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can\nnot guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by\nlearning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses\nhowever, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be\napplicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion\nde-noising and completion model in \\cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel\nmodel for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional\napproaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to\nprovide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A\npose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are\nsynthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing\nmodels for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model\nobtains lower de-noising and completion error. We also provide User\nInterface(UI) examples illustrating that our model is effective for interactive\ncharacter posing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jan 2012 13:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lai", "Ranch Y.
