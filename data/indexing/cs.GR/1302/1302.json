Recently there has been rapid progress on\ncorrecting irregular blur patterns caused by camera shake, but there is still\nmuch room for improvement. We propose a new blind deconvolution method using\nincremental sparse edge approximation to recover images blurred by camera\nshake. We estimate the blur kernel first from only the strongest edges in the\nimage, then gradually refine this estimate by allowing for weaker and weaker\nedges. Our method competes with the benchmark deblurring performance of the\nstate-of-the-art while being significantly faster and easier to generalize.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Feb 2013 00:46:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2013 14:34:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shearer", "Paul", ""], ["Gilbert", "Anna C.", ""], ["Hero", "Alfred O.", "III"]]}, {"id": "1302.1547", "submitter": "Eric J.

A k-d dart is\na set of independent, mutually orthogonal, k-dimensional subspaces called k-d\nflats. Each dart has d choose k flats, aligned with the coordinate axes for\nefficiency. We show that k-d darts are useful for exploring a function's\nproperties, such as estimating its integral, or finding an exemplar above a\nthreshold. We describe a recipe for converting an algorithm from point sampling\nto k-d dart sampling, assuming the function can be evaluated along a k-d flat.\n  We demonstrate that k-d darts are more efficient than point-wise samples in\nhigh dimensions, depending on the characteristics of the sampling domain: e.g.\nthe subregion of interest has small volume and evaluating the function along a\nflat is not too expensive. We present three concrete applications using line\ndarts (1-d darts): relaxed maximal Poisson-disk sampling, high-quality\nrasterization of depth-of-field blur, and estimation of the probability of\nfailure from a response surface for uncertainty quantification. In these\napplications, line darts achieve the same fidelity output as point darts in\nless time. We also demonstrate the accuracy of higher dimensional darts for a\nvolume estimation problem. For Poisson-disk sampling, we use significantly less\nmemory, enabling the generation of larger point clouds in higher dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2013 01:14:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ebeida", "Mohamed S.", ""], ["Patney", "Anjul", ""], ["Mitchell", "Scott A.", ""], ["Dalbey", "Keith R.", ""], ["Davidson", "Andrew A.", ""], ["Owens", "John D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.5666", "submitter": "Jan Egger", "authors": "Tina Kapur, Jan Egger, Antonio Damato, Ehud J.

Initial studies of MR-guidance in gynecologic\nbrachtherapy demonstrate the ability to optimize tumor coverage and reduce\nradiation dose to normal tissues, resulting in improved outcomes for patients.\nIn this article we describe a methodology to aid applicator placement and\ntreatment planning for 3 Tesla (3T) MR-guided brachytherapy that was developed\nspecifically for gynecologic cancers. This has been used in 18 cases to date in\nthe Advanced Multimodality Image Guided Operating suite at Brigham and Women's\nHospital. It is comprised of state of the art methods for MR imaging, image\nanalysis, and treatment planning. An MR sequence using 3D-balanced steady state\nfree precession in a 3T MR scan was identified as the best sequence for\ncatheter identification with ballooning artifact at the tip. 3D treatment\nplanning was performed using MR images. Item in development include a software\nmodule designed to support virtual needle trajectory planning that includes\nprobabilistic bias correction, graph based segmentation, and image registration\nalgorithms.
