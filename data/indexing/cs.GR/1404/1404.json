The boundary representation (simply brep) of the\ninput solid naturally induces a brep of the swept volume. We show that it is\nlocally similar to the input brep and this serves as the basis of the\nframework. All the same, it admits several intricacies: (i) geometric, in terms\nof parametrizations and, (ii) topological, in terms of orientations. We provide\na novel analysis for their resolution. More specifically, we prove a\nnon-trivial lifting theorem which allows to locally orient the output using the\norientation of the input. We illustrate the framework by providing many\nexamples from a pilot implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 03:44:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Adsul", "Bharat", ""], ["Machchhar", "Jinesh", ""], ["Sohoni", "Milind", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0981", "submitter": "Suman Joshi", "authors": "Suman Joshi, Dr. Yashwant Singh Chauhan, Dr. Ashish Negi", "title": "New Julia and Mandelbrot Sets for Jungck Ishikawa Iterates", "comments": "8 pages,18 tables,18 charts,18 figures Published with International\n  Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The generation of fractals and study of the dynamics of polynomials is one of\nthe emerging and interesting field of research nowadays.

An\nideal decolorization algorithm should preserve the original color contrast as\nmuch as possible. Meanwhile, it should provide the final decolorized result as\nfast as possible. However, most of the current methods are suffering from\neither unsatisfied color information preservation or high computational cost,\nlimiting their application value. In this paper, a simple but effective\ntechnique is proposed for real-time decolorization. Based on the typical\nrgb2gray() color conversion model, which produces a grayscale image by linearly\ncombining R, G, and B channels, we propose a dominant color hypothesis and a\ncorresponding distance measurement metric to evaluate the quality of grayscale\nconversion. The local optimum scheme provides several \"good\" candidates in a\nconfidence interval, from which the \"best\" result can be extracted.\nExperimental results demonstrate that remarkable simplicity of the proposed\nmethod facilitates the process of high resolution images and videos in\nreal-time using a common CPU.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:25:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 02:26:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Wei", ""], ["Li", "Wei", ""], ["Zhang", "Fan", ""], ["Du", "Qian", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.3109", "submitter": "Daniel Karrasch", "authors": "Daniel Karrasch, Florian Huhn, George Haller", "title": "Automated detection of coherent Lagrangian vortices in two-dimensional\n  unsteady flows", "comments": "17 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, accepted for publication in Proc.
