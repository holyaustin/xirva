Often, small multiples\nare used to visualize 1 or 2 dimensions at a time, such as in a scatterplot\nmatrix. Associating data points between different views can be difficult\nthough, as the points are not fixed. Other times, dimensional reduction\ntechniques are employed to summarize the whole dataset in one image, but\nindividual dimensions are lost in this view. In this paper, we present a means\nof augmenting a dimensional reduction plot with isocontours to reintroduce the\noriginal dimensions. By applying this to each dimension in the original data,\nwe create multiple views where the points are consistent, which facilitates\ntheir comparison. Our approach employs a combination of a novel, graph-based\nprojection technique with a GPU accelerated implementation of moving least\nsquares to interpolate space between the points. We also present evaluations of\nthis approach both with a case study and with a user study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2014 13:27:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Muelder", "Chris W.", ""], ["Leaf", "Nick", ""], ["Sigovan", "Carmen", ""], ["Ma", "Kwan-Liu", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1118", "submitter": "Scott Mitchell", "authors": "Scott A.

We present a blue\nnoise sampling method with good quality and performance across different\ndimensions. The method, spoke-dart sampling, shoots rays from prior samples and\nselects samples from these rays. It combines the advantages of two major\nhigh-dimensional sampling methods: the locality of advancing front with the\ndimensionality-reduction of hyperplanes, specifically line sampling. We prove\nthat the output sampling is saturated with high probability, with bounds on\ndistances between pairs of samples and between any domain point and its nearest\nsample. We demonstrate spoke-dart applications for approximate Delaunay graph\nconstruction, global optimization, and robotic motion planning. Both the\nblue-noise quality of the output distribution and the adaptability of the\nintermediate processes of our method are useful in these applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 21:15:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 23:11:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2018 23:27:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mitchell", "Scott A.", ""], ["Ebeida", "Mohamed S.", ""], ["Awad", "Muhammad A.", ""], ["Park", "Chonhyon", ""], ["Patney", "Anjul", ""], ["Rushdi", "Ahmad A.", ""], ["Swiler", "Laura P.", ""], ["Manocha", "Dinesh", ""], ["Wei", "Li-Yi", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.3326", "submitter": "Tino Weinkauf", "authors": "Yeara Kozlov, Janick Martinez Esturo, Hans-Peter Seidel, Tino Weinkauf", "title": "Regularized Harmonic Surface Deformation", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Harmonic surface deformation is a well-known geometric modeling method that\ncreates plausible deformations in an interactive manner. However, this method\nis susceptible to artifacts, in particular close to the deformation handles.\nThese artifacts often correlate with strong gradients of the deformation\nenergy.In this work, we propose a novel formulation of harmonic surface\ndeformation, which incorporates a regularization of the deformation energy. To\ndo so, we build on and extend a recently introduced generic linear\nregularization approach. It can be expressed as a change of norm for the linear\noptimization problem, i.e., the regularization is baked into the optimization.\nThis minimizes the implementation complexity and has only a small impact on\nruntime. Our results show that a moderate use of regularization suppresses many\ndeformation artifacts common to the well-known harmonic surface deformation\nmethod, without introducing new artifacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Aug 2014 16:05:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kozlov", "Yeara", ""], ["Esturo", "Janick Martinez", ""], ["Seidel", "Hans-Peter", ""], ["Weinkauf", "Tino", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6591", "submitter": "Nico Pietroni", "authors": "Nico Pietroni, Davide Tonelli, Enrico Puppo, Maurizio Froli, Roberto\n  Scopigno, Paolo Cignoni", "title": "Voronoi Grid-Shell Structures", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a framework for the generation of grid-shell structures that is\nbased on Voronoi diagrams and allows us to design tessellations that achieve\nexcellent static performances.
