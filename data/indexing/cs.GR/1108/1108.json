A\nfurther application to the existence of quasiconformal mappings between\nmanifolds, as well as an extension of the triangulation result to the case of\nalmost Riemannian manifolds, are also given. In addition, the notion of fatness\nof triangulations and its relation to metric curvature and to excess is\nexplored. Moreover, applications of the main results, and in particular a\npurely metric approach to Regge calculus, are also investigated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2011 17:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Saucan", "Emil", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5673", "submitter": "Niklaus Berger", "authors": "Niklaus Berger", "title": "Partial wave analysis at BES III harnessing the power of GPUs", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures, prepared for the proceedings of Computing in High\n  Energy Physics (CHEP) 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.3647201", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an cs.GR hep-ex", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Partial wave analysis is a core tool in hadron spectroscopy.
