This paper proposes a watermarking scheme that can embed a watermark to an\narbitrarily shaped object in an image. Before embedding, the image owner\nspecifies an object of arbitrary shape that is of a concern to him. Then the\nobject is transformed into the wavelet domain using in place lifting shape\nadaptive DWT(SADWT) and a watermark is embedded by modifying the wavelet\ncoefficients. In order to make the watermark robust and transparent, the\nwatermark is embedded in the average of wavelet blocks using the visual model\nbased on the human visual system. Wavelet coefficients n least significant bits\n(LSBs) are adjusted in concert with the average. Simulation results shows that\nthe proposed watermarking scheme is perceptually invisible and robust against\nmany attacks such as lossy compression (e.g.JPEG, JPEG2000), scaling, adding\nnoise, filtering, etc.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2009 18:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Essaouabi", "A.", ""], ["Ibnelhaj", "E.", ""], ["Fegragui", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3349", "submitter": "Alyssa A.
