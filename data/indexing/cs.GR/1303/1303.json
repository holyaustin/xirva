This process involves geometric display which can only be carried\nout with high end graphics display. There are many approaches practiced and one\nof the so-called easiest approaches is by using C/C++ programming language and\nOpenGL application program interface, API. There are practitioners uses C/C++\nprogramming language to develop the algorithms and finally utilize AutoCAD for\ngraphics display. On the other hand, high end CAD users manage to use Auto Lisp\nas their programming language in AutoCAD. Nevertheless, these traditional ways\nare definitely time consuming.

However, they are also notoriously difficult to generate and\nmanipulate. Previous methods start with a smooth surface and then apply\nelaborate meshing schemes to create polyhedral meshes approximating the\nsurface. In this paper, we describe a reverse approach: given the topology of a\nmesh, we explore the space of possible planar meshes with that topology.\n  Our approach is based on a complete characterization of the maximal linear\nspaces of polyhedral meshes contained in the curved manifold of polyhedral\nmeshes with a given topology. We show that these linear spaces can be described\nas nullspaces of differential operators, much like harmonic functions are\nnullspaces of the Laplacian operator. An analysis of this operator provides\ntools for global and local design of a polyhedral mesh, which fully expose the\ngeometric possibilities and limitations of the given topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Mar 2013 22:00:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Poranne", "Roi", ""], ["Chen", "Renjie", ""], ["Gotsman", "Craig", ""]]}]
