The method is\nillustrated here with specifications of gates, latches, and other simple\ncircuits and via the construction of devices starting with a SR latch built\nfrom gates and then moving on to more complex devices. Circuit timing and\ntransients are treated in some detail. The method is based on \"classical\"\nautomata and recursive functions on strings. No formal methods, extended state\nmachines, or process algebras are involved but a reference is made to potential\napplications of the Krohn-Rhodes theorem and other group/monoid based algebraic\ntechniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 08:43:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yodaiken", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.0588", "submitter": "Pierre Guillon", "authors": "Anahi Gajardo, Pierre Guillon", "title": "Zigzags in Turing machines", "comments": "17p", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-13182-0_11", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study one-head machines through symbolic and topological dynamics.
