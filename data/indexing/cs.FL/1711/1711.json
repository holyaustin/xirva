This can be used to scale up applications of\nautomata in formal verification tools and decision procedures for logical\ntheories. The algorithms are based on new techniques for removing transitions\n(pruning) and adding transitions (saturation), as well as extensions of classic\nquotienting of the state space. These techniques use criteria based on\ncombinations of backward and forward trace inclusions and simulation relations.\nSince trace inclusion relations are themselves PSPACE-complete, we introduce\nlookahead simulations as good polynomial time computable approximations\nthereof. Extensive experiments show that the average-case time complexity of\nour algorithms scales slightly above quadratically. (The space complexity is\nworst-case quadratic.) The size reduction of the automata depends very much on\nthe class of instances, but our algorithm consistently reduces the size far\nmore than all previous techniques. We tested our algorithms on NBA derived from\nLTL-formulae, NBA derived from mutual exclusion protocols and many classes of\nrandom NBA and NFA, and compared their performance to the well-known automata\ntool GOAL.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Nov 2017 19:33:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Apr 2018 19:42:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2018 17:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2019 12:45:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Clemente", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Mayr", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.10216", "submitter": "Mathias Ruggaard Pedersen", "authors": "Mathias Ruggaard Pedersen and Nathana\\\"el Fijalkow and Giorgio Bacci\n  and Kim Guldstrand Larsen and Radu Mardare", "title": "Timed Comparisons of Semi-Markov Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Semi-Markov processes are Markovian processes in which the firing time of the\ntransitions is modelled by probabilistic distributions over positive reals\ninterpreted as the probability of firing a transition at a certain moment in\ntime.
