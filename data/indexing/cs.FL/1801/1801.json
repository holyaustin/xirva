J.\nCombin. 24.1 (2017)], we introduced a symbolic square root map. Every optimal\nsquareful infinite word $s$ contains exactly six minimal squares and can be\nwritten as a product of these squares: $s = X_1^2 X_2^2 \\cdots$. The square\nroot $\\sqrt{s}$ of $s$ is the infinite word $X_1 X_2 \\cdots$ obtained by\ndeleting half of each square. We proved that the square root map preserves the\nlanguages of Sturmian words (which are optimal squareful words). The dynamics\nof the square root map on a Sturmian subshift are well understood. In our\nearlier work, we introduced another type of subshift of optimal squareful words\nwhich together with the square root map form a dynamical system. In this paper,\nwe study these dynamical systems in more detail and compare their properties to\nthe Sturmian case. The main results are characterizations of periodic points\nand the limit set. The results show that while there is some similarity it is\npossible for the square root map to exhibit quite different behavior compared\nto the Sturmian case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jan 2018 08:09:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Peltom\u00e4ki", "Jarkko", ""], ["Whiteland", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.02484", "submitter": "Srinivas Pinisetty", "authors": "Srinivas Pinisetty, Thibaud Antignac, David Sands, Gerardo Schneider", "title": "Monitoring Data Minimisation", "comments": "24 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.CR cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Data minimisation is a privacy enhancing principle, stating that personal\ndata collected should be no more than necessary for the specific purpose\nconsented by the user.

Additionally, our investigations concerning the non-delayable\nrequirement of consistent learning underpin the claim for \\emph{delayability}\nbeing the right structural property to gain a deeper understanding concerning\nthe nature of learning success criteria. Moreover, we obtain an anomalous\n\\emph{hierarchy} when allowing for an increasing finite number of\n\\emph{anomalies} of the hypothesized language by the learner compared with the\nlanguage to be learned. In contrast to the vacillatory hierarchy for learning\nfrom solely positive information, we observe a \\emph{duality} depending on\nwhether infinitely many \\emph{vacillations} between different (almost) correct\nhypotheses are still considered a successful learning behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:41:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2018 13:27:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2018 11:40:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 12:53:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Aschenbach", "Martin", ""], ["K\u00f6tzing", "Timo", ""], ["Seidel", "Karen", ""]]}]
