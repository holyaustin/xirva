This\ncorrelation is beneficial for learning algorithms, and indeed it was recently\nshown that $\\omega$-regular languages can be learned from membership and\nequivalence queries, using FDFAs as the acceptors.\n  In this paper, we look into the question of how suitable FDFAs are for\ndefining omega-regular languages.
