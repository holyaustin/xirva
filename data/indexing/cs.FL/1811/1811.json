The\nverification problem asks whether a given program satisfies a postcondition\nwritten using quantifier-free formulas with equality on the final state, with\nno loop invariants, contracts, etc. being provided. We show that this problem\nis undecidable in general.

The state complexity of\ntransformation refers to the cost of converting one type of finite automata to\nanother type, where the cost is measured in terms of the increase of the number\nof inner states of the converted automata from that of the original automata.\nWe relate the linear space hypothesis to the state complexity of transforming\nrestricted 2-way nondeterministic finite automata to computationally equivalent\n2-way alternating finite automata having narrow computation graphs. For this\npurpose, we present state complexity characterizations of 3DSTCON and PsubLIN.\nWe further characterize a nonuniform version of the linear space hypothesis in\nterms of the state complexity of transformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2018 13:28:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Aug 2019 11:01:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Yamakami", "Tomoyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06968", "submitter": "Matteo Sammartino", "authors": "Loris D'Antoni, Tiago Ferreira, Matteo Sammartino, Alexandra Silva", "title": "Symbolic Register Automata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Symbolic Finite Automata and Register Automata are two orthogonal extensions\nof finite automata motivated by real-world problems where data may have\nunbounded domains.

This similarity is no coincidence: given a functor\nG, fulfilling certain conditions, we derive a path-category for pointed\nG-coalgebras and lax homomorphisms, such that the open morphisms turn out to be\nprecisely the G-coalgebra homomorphisms. The above construction provides\npath-categories and trace semantics for free for different flavours of\ntransition systems: (1) non-deterministic tree automata (2) regular\nnondeterministic nominal automata (RNNA), an expressive automata notion living\nin nominal sets (3) multisorted transition systems. This last instance relates\nto Lasota's construction, which is in the converse direction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 16:35:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2019 17:14:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wi\u00dfmann", "Thorsten", ""], ["Dubut", "J\u00e9r\u00e9my", ""], ["Katsumata", "Shin-ya", ""], ["Hasuo", "Ichiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12339", "submitter": "C\\'elia Borlido", "authors": "C\\'elia Borlido and Mai Gehrke", "title": "A note on powers of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.GN cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Boolean spaces with internal semigroups generalize profinite semigroups and\nare pertinent for the recognition of not-necessarily regular languages. Via\nrecognition, the study of existential quantification in logic on words amounts\nto the study of certain spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups. In\nturn, these can be understood as the superposition of a span of Boolean spaces\nand a span of semigroups. In this note, we first study these separately. More\nprecisely, we identify the conditions under which each of these spans gives\nrise to a morphism into the respective power or Vietoris construction of the\ncorresponding structure. Combining these characterizations, we obtain such a\ncharacterization for spans of Boolean spaces with internal semigroups which we\nuse to describe the topo-algebraic counterpart of monadic second-order\nexistential quantification. This is closely related to a part of the earlier\nwork on existential quantification in first-order logic on words by Gehrke,\nPetri\\c san and Reggio. The observation that certain morphisms lift\ncontravariantly to the appropriate power structures makes our analysis very\nsimple.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2018 17:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jan 2019 15:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Borlido", "C\u00e9lia", ""], ["Gehrke", "Mai", ""]]}]
