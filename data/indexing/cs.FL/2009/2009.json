In particular, this paper shows that reversible cellular\nautomata represent an adequate framework to obtain complex behaviors adding\nonly new random states.\n  Experimental results show that complexity can be obtained from reversible\ncellular automata appending a proportion of about two times more states at\nrandom than the original number of states in the reversible automaton. Thus, it\nis possible to obtain complex cellular automata with dozens of states.\nComplexity appears to be commonly obtained from reversible cellular automata,\nand using other operations such as permutations of states or row and column\npermutations in the evolution rule. The relevance of this paper is to present\nthat reversibility can be a useful structure to implement complex behaviors in\ncellular automata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2020 23:56:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Seck-Tuoh-Mora", "Juan Carlos", ""], ["Martinez", "Genaro J.", ""], ["Hernandez-Romero", "Norberto", ""], ["Medina-Marin", "Joselito", ""], ["Barragan-Vite", "Irving", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.09360", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Jean-Francois Raskin (Universit\\'e Libre de Bruxelles), Davide\n  Bresolin (Universit\\`a di Padova)", "title": "Proceedings 11th International Symposium on Games, Automata, Logics, and\n  Formal Verification", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 326, 2020", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.326", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on\nGames, Automata, Logic and Formal Verification (GandALF 2020).

For deterministic automata on infinite words, no\ncanonical minimal automaton exists, and a language may have different minimal\ndeterministic B\\\"uchi (DBW) or co-B\\\"uchi (DCW) automata. In recent years,\nresearchers have studied {\\em good-for-games\\/} (GFG) automata --\nnondeterministic automata that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a\nway that only depends on the past. Several applications of automata in formal\nmethods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic\nautomata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\\em minimization\\/}\nproblem for DBW and DCW is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG\nB\\\"uchi and co-B\\\"uchi automata. On the other hand, minimization of GFG\nco-B\\\"uchi automata with {\\em transition-based\\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs) can be\nsolved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set\n$\\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in\n$\\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal\ndeterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper\nwe study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe\ncomponents (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not\nin $\\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating\nthe automaton with transitions in $\\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal\nGFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in\npolynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs),\nand their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal\nautomata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and\nimplies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for\nwhich the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton,\nwhich do have a canonical minimal form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 01:27:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Radi", "Bader Abu", ""], ["Kupferman", "Orna", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.10886", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "\\'I\\~nigo X. \\'Incer Romeo (University of California, Berkeley),\n  Leonardo Mangeruca (Raytheon Technologies Research Center, Rome, Italy),\n  Tiziano Villa (Universit\\`a di Verona, Italy), Alberto\n  Sangiovanni-Vincentelli (University of California, Berkeley)", "title": "The Quotient in Preorder Theories", "comments": "In Proceedings GandALF 2020, arXiv:2009.09360", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 326, 2020, pp. 216-233", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.326.14", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Seeking the largest solution to an expression of the form A x <= B is a\ncommon task in several domains of engineering and computer science.

Compared to the\nexisting algorithm, our method computes smaller sets of constraints and\nguarantees termination for more UTA, making reachability faster and more\neffective. As the main application, we get an alternate proof of decidability\nand a more efficient algorithm for timed automata with bounded subtraction, a\nclass of UTA widely used for modelling scheduling problems. We have implemented\nour procedure in the tool TChecker and conducted experiments that validate the\nbenefits of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2020 12:28:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gastin", "Paul", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Sayan", ""], ["Srivathsan", "B", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.13459", "submitter": "Muhammad Najib", "authors": "Oliver Markgraf, Chih-Duo Hong, Anthony W.

Such systems occur\nnaturally in practice (e.g., in the form of distributed protocols where the\namount of processes is often unknown at design time and the protocol must work\nregardless of the number of processes). In this paper, we present a novel\nlearning based approach to the synthesis of reactive controllers for\nparameterized systems from safety specifications. We use the framework of\nregular model checking to model the synthesis problem as an infinite-duration\ntwo-player game and show how one can utilize Angluin's well-known L* algorithm\nto learn correct-by-design controllers. This approach results in a synthesis\nprocedure that is conceptually simpler than existing synthesis methods with a\ncompleteness guarantee, whenever a winning strategy can be expressed by a\nregular set. We have implemented our algorithm in a tool called L*-PSynth and\nhave demonstrated its performance on a range of benchmarks, including robotic\nmotion planning and distributed protocols. Despite the simplicity of L*-PSynth\nit competes well against (and in many cases even outperforms) the\nstate-of-the-art tools for synthesizing parameterized systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:41:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Markgraf", "Oliver", ""], ["Hong", "Chih-Duo", ""], ["Lin", "Anthony W.", ""], ["Najib", "Muhammad", ""], ["Neider", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14437", "submitter": "Karoliina Lehtinen", "authors": "Udi Boker, Denis Kuperberg, Karoliina Lehtinen, Micha{\\l} Skrzypczak", "title": "On the Succinctness of Alternating Parity Good-for-Games Automata", "comments": "Full version of an article of the same name in the proceedings of\n  40th IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and\n  Theoretical Computer Science (FSTTCS 2020). arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:2002.07278", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study alternating parity good-for-games (GFG) automata, i.e., alternating\nparity automata where both conjunctive and disjunctive choices can be resolved\nin an online manner, without knowledge of the suffix of the input word still to\nbe read.\n  We show that they can be exponentially more succinct than both their\nnondeterministic and universal counterparts.

The weight of a labeling is the semiring-product of the\nweights assigned to the nodes, and the weight of the graph is the semiring-sum\nof the weights of labelings.
