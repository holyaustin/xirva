As trees and more generally\nhedges can be linearized into (well) nested words, VPTs are a natural formalism\nto express tree transformations evaluated in streaming. This paper aims at\ncharacterizing precisely the expressive power of VPTs with respect to other\ntree transducer models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Nov 2013 21:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Caralp", "Mathieu", "", "Aix-Marseille Universit\u00e9 and CNRS"], ["Filiot", "Emmanuel", "", "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles"], ["Reynier", "Pierre-Alain", "", "Aix-Marseille\n  Universit\u00e9 and CNRS"], ["Servais", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "Hasselt University and\n  transnational University of Limburg"], ["Talbot", "Jean-Marc", "", "Aix-Marseille\n  Universit\u00e9 and CNRS"]]}, {"id": "1311.5572", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Kazuki Miyahara (NAIST), Kenji Hashimoto (Nagoya University), Hiroyuki\n  Seki (Nagoya University)", "title": "Node Query Preservation for Deterministic Linear Top-Down Tree\n  Transducers", "comments": "In Proceedings TTATT 2013, arXiv:1311.5058", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 134, 2013, pp. 27-37", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.134.4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses the decidability of node query preservation problems for\nXML document transformations.
