At\nthe same time it is a very promising approach, since concurrent programs are\ndifficult to get right, or to analyze with traditional verification techniques.\nThis paper gives an introduction to distributed synthesis in the setting of\nMazurkiewicz traces, and its applications to decentralized runtime monitoring.\n1 Context Modern computing systems are increasingly distributed and\nheterogeneous. Software needs to be able to exploit these advances, providing\nmeans for applications to be more performant. Traditional concurrent\nprogramming paradigms, as in Java, are based on threads, shared-memory, and\nlocking mechanisms that guard access to common data. More recent paradigms like\nthe reactive programming model of Erlang [4] and Scala [35,36] replace shared\nmemory by asynchronous message passing, where sending a message is\nnon-blocking. In all these concurrent frameworks, writing reliable software is\na serious challenge. Programmers tend to think about code mostly in a\nsequential way, and it is hard to grasp all possible schedulings of events in a\nconcurrent execution. For similar reasons, verification and analysis of\nconcurrent programs is a difficult task. Testing, which is still the main\nmethod for error detection in software, has low coverage for concurrent\nprograms. The reason is that bugs in such programs are difficult to reproduce:\nthey may happen under very specific thread schedules and the likelihood of\ntaking such corner-case schedules is very low. Automated verification, such as\nmodel-checking and other traditional exploration techniques, can handle very\nlimited instances of concurrent programs, mostly because of the very large\nnumber of possible states and of possible interleavings of executions. Formal\nanalysis of programs requires as a prerequisite a clean mathematical model for\nprograms. Verification of sequential programs starts usually with an\nabstraction step -- reducing the value domains of variables to finite domains,\nviewing conditional branching as non-determinism, etc. Another major\nsimplification consists in disallowing recursion. This leads to a very robust\ncomputational model, namely finite-state automata and regular languages.\nRegular languages of words (and trees) are particularly well understood\nnotions. The deep connections between logic and automata revealed by the\nfoundational work of B\\\"uchi, Rabin, and others, are the main ingredients in\nautomata-based verification .\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 07:09:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Muscholl", "Anca", "", "LaBRI"]]}, {"id": "1506.02455", "submitter": "Samy Abbes", "authors": "Samy Abbes and Jean Mairesse", "title": "Uniform generation in trace monoids", "comments": "Full version of the paper in MFCS 2015 with the same title", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of random uniform generation of traces (the elements\nof a free partially commutative monoid) in light of the uniform measure on the\nboundary at infinity of the associated monoid.
