We use this model to show that our analysis does\nnot contradict any previous findings. But we also obtain new knowledge about\nits behaviour: a better understanding of the size of its wild-type attractor\nbasin (larger than previously thought), the identification of novel minimal\nconditions and critical nodes that control wild-type behaviour, and the\nresilience of these to stochastic interventions. Our methodology is applicable\nto any complex network that can be modelled using automata, but we focus on\nbiochemical regulation and signalling, towards a better understanding of the\n(decentralized) control that orchestrates cellular activity -- with the\nultimate goal of explaining how do cells and tissues 'compute'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Jan 2013 16:28:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 16:18:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Marques-Pita", "Manuel", ""], ["Rocha", "Luis M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5842", "submitter": "Artur Je\\.z", "authors": "Artur Je\\.z", "title": "Approximation of grammar-based compression via recompression", "comments": "22 pages, some many small improvements, to be submited to a journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a simple linear-time algorithm constructing a\ncontext-free grammar of size O(g log(N/g)) for the input string, where N is the\nsize of the input string and g the size of the optimal grammar generating this\nstring.
