The papers are devoted to both membrane computing and\nbiologically inspired process calculi, as well as to other related formalisms.\nThe papers of this volume are selected by the programme committee due to their\nquality and relevance; they have defined an exciting programme highlighting\ninteresting problems and stimulating the search for novel ways of describing\nrelated biological phenomena. In addition, we had an invited talk given by Luca\nCardelli on a spatial process algebra for developmental biology. Membrane\nsystems were introduced as a class of distributed parallel computing devices\ninspired by the observation that any biological system is a complex\nhierarchical structure, with a flow of materials and information that underlies\ntheir functioning. The emphasis is on the computational properties of the\nmodel, and it makes use of automata, languages, and complexity theoretic tools.\nOn the other hand, certain calculi such as mobile ambients and brane calculi\nwork with similar notions (compartments, membranes). These calculi are used to\nmodel and analyze the various biological systems. The workshop on Membrane\nComputing and Biologically Inspired Process Calculi brings together researchers\nworking in these fields to present their recent work and discuss new ideas\nconcerning the formalisms, their properties and relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 22:24:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ciobanu", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0807", "submitter": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica", "authors": "Mugurel Ionut Andreica, Nicolae Tapus", "title": "Practical Algorithmic Techniques for Several String Processing Problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the 8th RoEduNet International Conference, pp.\n  136-141, Galati, Romania, 3-4 December, 2009.
