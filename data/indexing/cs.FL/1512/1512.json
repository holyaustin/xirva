It appears\nthat graph models are not expressive enough to tackle this problem. In this\npaper, we propose a new model of heterogeneous networks using Automata Theory.\nA network is modeled as a Push-Down Automaton (PDA) which is able to capture\nthe encapsulation and decapsulation capabilities, the PDA stack corresponding\nto the stack of encapsulated protocols. We provide polynomial algorithms that\ncompute the shortest path either in hops or in the number of encapsulations and\ndecapsulations along the inter-domain path, the latter reducing manual\nconfigurations and possible loops in the path.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 08:55:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Lamali", "Mohamed Lamine", "", "PRISM"], ["Pouyllau", "H\u00e9lia", "", "PRISM"], ["Barth", "Dominique", "", "PRISM"]]}, {"id": "1512.06788", "submitter": "Victor Yodaiken", "authors": "Victor Yodaiken", "title": "Practical State Machines for Computer Software and Engineering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces methods for describing properties of possibly very\nlarge state machines in terms of solutions to recursive functions and applies\nthose methods to computer systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 19:58:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 21:49:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Yodaiken", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.07956", "submitter": "Bardh Hoxha", "authors": "Bardh Hoxha, Adel Dokhanchi and Georgios Fainekos", "title": "Mining Parametric Temporal Logic Properties in Model Based Design for\n  Cyber-Physical Systems", "comments": "18 Pages, 15 figures, 2 tables, 2 algorithms", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10009-017-0447-4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the advantages of adopting a Model Based Development (MBD) process is\nthat it enables testing and verification at early stages of development.\nHowever, it is often desirable to not only verify/falsify certain formal system\nspecifications, but also to automatically explore the properties that the\nsystem satisfies. In this work, we present a framework that enables property\nexploration for Cyber-Physical Systems. Namely, given a parametric\nspecification with multiple parameters, our solution can automatically infer\nthe ranges of parameters for which the property does not hold on the system. In\nthis paper, we consider parametric specifications in Metric or Signal Temporal\nLogic (MTL or STL). Using robust semantics for MTL, the parameter mining\nproblem can be converted into a Pareto optimization problem for which we can\nprovide an approximate solution by utilizing stochastic optimization methods.\nWe include algorithms for the exploration and visualization of multi-parametric\nspecifications. The framework is demonstrated on an industrial size,\nhigh-fidelity engine model as well as examples from related literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2015 05:01:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 22:24:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 21:26:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 23:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hoxha", "Bardh", ""], ["Dokhanchi", "Adel", ""], ["Fainekos", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08106", "submitter": "Mickael Randour", "authors": "Patricia Bouyer and Nicolas Markey and Mickael Randour and Kim G.\n  Larsen and Simon Laursen", "title": "Average-energy games (full version)", "comments": "Full version of GandALF 2015 paper (arXiv:1509.07205)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two-player quantitative zero-sum games provide a natural framework to\nsynthesize controllers with performance guarantees for reactive systems within\nan uncontrollable environment.
