In a sequence of recent papers, we have shown that an\neffective means to reason with such specifications is to decompose them into\nprimitive constraints. We can then, for instance, use state of the art SAT\nsolvers and profit from their advanced features like fast unit propagation,\nclause learning, and conflict-based search heuristics. This approach holds\npromise for solving combinatorial problems in scheduling, rostering, and\nconfiguration, as well as problems in more diverse areas like bioinformatics,\nsoftware testing and natural language processing. In addition, decomposition\nmay be an effective method to propagate other global constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2009 08:53:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Quimper", "Claude-Guy", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1627", "submitter": "Fran\\c{c}ois Nicolas", "authors": "Julien Cassaigne and Francois Nicolas", "title": "On the Morse-Hedlund complexity gap", "comments": "7 pages.
