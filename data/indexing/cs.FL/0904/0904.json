OC-MDPs are equivalent to a controlled extension of\n(discrete-time) Quasi-Birth-Death processes (QBDs), a stochastic model studied\nheavily in queueing theory and applied probability. They can thus be viewed as\na natural ``adversarial'' version of a classic stochastic model. Alternatively,\nthey can also be viewed as a natural probabilistic/controlled extension of\nclassic one-counter automata. OC-MDPs also subsume (as a very restricted\nspecial case) a recently studied MDP model called ``solvency games'' that model\na risk-averse gambling scenario. Basic computational questions about these\nmodels include ``termination'' questions and ``limit'' questions, such as the\nfollowing: does the controller have a ``strategy'' (or ``policy'') to ensure\nthat the counter (which may for example count the number of jobs in the queue)\nwill hit value 0 (the empty queue) almost surely (a.s.)? Or that it will have\ninfinite limsup value, a.s.? Or, that it will hit value 0 in selected terminal\nstates, a.s.? Or, in case these are not satisfied a.s., compute the maximum\n(supremum) such probability over all strategies. We provide new upper and lower\nbounds on the complexity of such problems. For some of them we present a\npolynomial-time algorithm, whereas for others we show PSPACE- or BH-hardness\nand give an EXPTIME upper bound. Our upper bounds combine techniques from the\ntheory of MDP reward models, the theory of random walks, and a variety of\nautomata-theoretic methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2009 14:56:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2009 13:50:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2009 05:50:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2009 14:41:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e1zdil", "Tom\u00e1\u0161", ""], ["Bro\u017eek", "V\u00e1clav", ""], ["Etessami", "Kousha", ""], ["Ku\u010dera", "Anton\u00edn", ""], ["Wojtczak", "Dominik", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3366", "submitter": "Kai Salomaa", "authors": "Mark Daley, Michael Domaratzki, Kai Salomaa", "title": "State complexity of orthogonal catenation", "comments": "DCFS 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A language $L$ is the orthogonal catenation of languages $L_1$ and $L_2$ if\nevery word of $L$ can be written in a unique way as a catenation of a word in\n$L_1$ and a word in $L_2$.
