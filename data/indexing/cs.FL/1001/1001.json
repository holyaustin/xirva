In this paper we\npresent a few theoretical results on FISs (finite interactive systems), the\nunderlying mechanism used for specifying control and interaction in these\nsystems. First, we give a proof for the undecidability of the emptiness problem\nfor FISs, by reduction to the Post Correspondence Problem. Next, we use the\nconstruction in this proof to get other undecidability results, e.g., for the\naccessibility of a transition in a FIS, or for the finiteness of the language\nrecognized by a FIS. Finally, we present a simple proof of the equivalence\nbetween FISs and tile systems, making explicit that they precisely capture\nrecognizable two-dimensional languages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 15:19:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sofronia", "Alexandru", ""], ["Popa", "Alexandru", ""], ["Stefanescu", "Gheorghe", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0251", "submitter": "Pierre Guillon", "authors": "Julien Cervelle and Enrico Formenti and Pierre Guillon", "title": "Ultimate Traces of Cellular Automata", "comments": "12 pages + 5 of appendix conference STACS'10", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DM nlin.CG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A cellular automaton (CA) is a parallel synchronous computing model, which\nconsists in a juxtaposition of finite automata (cells) whose state evolves\naccording to that of their neighbors.

In previous work, it has been\nestablished that the sets of numbers that are recognizable by weak\ndeterministic automata in two bases that do not share the same set of prime\nfactors are exactly those that are definable in the first order additive theory\nof real and integer numbers. This result extends Cobham's theorem, which\ncharacterizes the sets of integer numbers that are recognizable by finite\nautomata in multiple bases.\n  In this article, we first generalize this result to multiplicatively\nindependent bases, which brings it closer to the original statement of Cobham's\ntheorem. Then, we study the sets of reals recognizable by Muller automata in\ntwo bases. We show with a counterexample that, in this setting, Cobham's\ntheorem does not generalize to multiplicatively independent bases. Finally, we\nprove that the sets of reals that are recognizable by Muller automata in two\nbases that do not share the same set of prime factors are exactly those\ndefinable in the first order additive theory of real and integer numbers. These\nsets are thus also recognizable by weak deterministic automata.
