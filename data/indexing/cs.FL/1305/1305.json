To describe such sets of regular languages, the FQL semantics uses\nan automata-theoretic concept known as rational sets of regular languages\n(RSRLs). RSRLs are automata whose alphabet consists of regular expressions.\nThus, the language accepted by the automaton is a set of regular expressions.\n  In this paper, we study RSRLs from a theoretic point of view. More\nspecifically, we analyze RSRL closure properties under common set theoretic\noperations, and the complexity of membership checking, i.e., whether a regular\nlanguage is an element of a RSRL. For all questions we investigate both the\ngeneral case and the case of finite sets of regular languages.
