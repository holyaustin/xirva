This graph is defined by a map acting on the\nfrontiers of $C^{\\infty}$-words. We show that this map can be defined\nrecursively and with no explicit references to $C^{\\infty}$-words.

The theoretical results imply that this problem is\nhighly intractable, e.g., synthesizing a system is 2EXPTIME-complete for an LTL\nspecification, and EXPTIME-complete for a CTL specification. However, an\nargument against it is that the temporal specification is highly compact, and\nthe complexity reflects the large size of the system constructed. In that\nrespect, the complexity should, perhaps, be specified relative to the size of\nthe minimal satisfying system. A careful observation reveals that the size of\nthe system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This\nview is a bit nonstandard, in the sense that the state space can be\nexponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation such as a\ncircuit or a program. Although this alternative measure of the size of the\nsynthesized system is more intuitive (e.g., this is the standard way model\nchecking problems are measured), research on synthesis has so far stayed with\nmeasuring the system in terms of the explicit state space. This raises the\nquestion of whether or not there always exists a small system. In this paper,\nwe show that this is the case if, and only if, PSPACE = EXPTIME.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 13:26:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2012 16:34:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Fearnley", "John", ""], ["Peled", "Doron", ""], ["Schewe", "Sven", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6275", "submitter": "Zoltan Esik", "authors": "Arnaud Carayol, Zoltan Esik", "title": "The FC-rank of a context-free language", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove that the finite condensation rank (FC-rank) of the lexicographic\nordering of a context-free language is strictly less than $\\omega^\\omega$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 16:41:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 Apr 2012 16:08:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Carayol", "Arnaud", ""], ["Esik", "Zoltan", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6583", "submitter": "Luis Quesada", "authors": "Luis Quesada, Fernando Berzal, Francisco J.
