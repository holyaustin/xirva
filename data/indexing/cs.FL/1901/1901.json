This class of monitors is more compositional, extensible, and\neasily implementable than other monitors based on rewriting and automata. I\nfirst explain the sequential network construction over discrete time behaviors\nand then extend it towards dense time by adopting a point-free approach. The\nformulation for dense time behaviors and MTL radically differs from the\ntraditional pointy definitions and in return, we avoid some longstanding\ncomplications.

By a theorem of McNaughton and Papert, these are\nalso the first-order definable languages. The dot-depth rose to prominence\nfollowing the work of Thomas, who proved an exact correspondence with the\nquantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic: each level in the\ndot-depth hierarchy consists of all languages that can be defined with a\nprescribed number of quantifier blocks. One of the most famous open problems in\nautomata theory is to settle whether the membership problem is decidable for\neach level: is it possible to decide whether an input regular language belongs\nto this level?\n  Despite a significant research effort, membership by itself has only been\nsolved for low levels. A recent breakthrough was achieved by replacing\nmembership with a more general problem: separation. Given two input languages,\none has to decide whether there exists a third language in the investigated\nlevel containing the first language and disjoint from the second. The\nmotivation is that: (1) while more difficult, separation is more rewarding (2)\nit provides a more convenient framework (3) all recent membership algorithms\nare reductions to separation for lower levels.\n  We present a separation algorithm for dot-depth two. While this is our most\nprominent application, our result is more general. We consider a family of\nhierarchies that includes the dot-depth: concatenation hierarchies. They are\nbuilt via a generic construction process. One first chooses an initial class,\nthe basis, which is the lowest level in the hierarchy. Further levels are built\nby applying generic operations. Our main theorem states that for any\nconcatenation hierarchy whose basis is finite, separation is decidable for\nlevel one.

The\ntranslation is enabled by using MONA, a powerful tool for symbolic, BDD-based,\nDFA construction from logic specifications. Recent works used a first-order\nencoding of LTLf formulas to translate LTLf to First Order Logic (FOL), which\nis then fed to MONA to get the symbolic DFA. This encoding was shown to perform\nwell, but other encodings have not been studied. Specifically, the natural\nquestion of whether second-order encoding, which has significantly simpler\nquantificational structure, can outperform first-order encoding remained open.\n  In this paper we address this challenge and study second-order encodings for\nLTLf formulas. We first introduce a specific MSO encoding that captures the\nsemantics of LTLf in a natural way and prove its correctness. We then explore\nis a Compact MSO encoding, which benefits from automata-theoretic minimization,\nthus suggesting a possible practical advantage. To that end, we propose a\nformalization of symbolic DFA in second-order logic, thus developing a novel\nconnection between BDDs and MSO. We then show by empirical evaluations that the\nfirst-order encoding does perform better than both second-order encodings. The\nconclusion is that first-order encoding is a better choice than second-order\nencoding in LTLf-to-Automata translation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2019 07:18:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Shufang", ""], ["Pu", "Geguang", ""], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06351", "submitter": "Narad Rampersad", "authors": "James Currie and Tero Harju and Pascal Ochem and Narad Rampersad", "title": "Some further results on squarefree arithmetic progressions in infinite\n  words", "comments": "13 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a recent paper, one of us posed three open problems concerning squarefree\narithmetic progressions in infinite words.
