While it is known that there exist pseudovarieties\nwith NP-complete or even undecidable membership problems, for many well-known\npseudovarieties the problem is known to be decidable in polynomial time. We\nshow that for many of these pseudovarieties, the membership problem is actually\nin AC^0. To this end, we show that these pseudovarieties can be characterized\nby first-order sentences with multiplication as the only predicate. We prove\nclosure properties of the class of pseudovarieties with such first-order\ndescriptions under various well-known operations; in particular, if V can be\ndescribed by a first-order sentence, then DV, LV, and the Mal'cev products of\nK, D, N, LI, and LG with V are first-order definable as well. Moreover, if H is\na first-order definable pseudovariety of finite groups, then the pseudovariety\nof all finite semigroups whose subgroups are in H is first-order definable. Our\nformalism is also powerful enough to capture all pseudovarieties characterized\nby finite sets of omega-identities. In view of lower bounds from circuit\ncomplexity, we obtain a new technique to prove that a pseudovariety V cannot be\ndefined by such a set: if membership in V is hard for PARITY, it cannot be\ndefined in this logic and thus cannot be described by finitely many\nomega-identities. We show that membership to EA is L-complete, thereby\nimproving previous complexity results and obtaining a new proof that the\npseudovariety cannot be described by finitely many omega-identities at the same\ntime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2018 07:08:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2018 07:29:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Fleischer", "Lukas", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.00847", "submitter": "Giovanni Bacci", "authors": "Giovanni Bacci and Patricia Bouyer and Uli Fahrenberg and Kim G.\n  Larsen and Nicolas Markey and Pierre-Alain Reynier", "title": "Optimal and Robust Controller Synthesis: using Energy Timed Automata\n  with Uncertainty", "comments": "long version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a novel framework for the synthesis of robust and\noptimal energy-aware controllers.
