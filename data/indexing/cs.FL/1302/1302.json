We consider two recent approaches to complementation. The first\nis the rank-based approach of Kupferman and Vardi, which operates over a DAG\nthat embodies all runs of the automaton. This approach is based on the\nobservation that the vertices of this DAG can be ranked in a certain way,\ntermed an odd ranking, iff all runs are rejecting. The second is the\nslice-based approach of K\\\"ahler and Wilke. This approach tracks levels of\n\"split trees\" - run trees in which only essential information about the history\nof each run is maintained. While the slice-based construction is conceptually\nsimple, the complementing automata it generates are exponentially larger than\nthose of the recent rank-based construction of Schewe, and it suffers from the\ndifficulty of symbolically encoding levels of split trees. In this work we\nreformulate the slice-based approach in terms of run DAGs and preorders over\nstates. In doing so, we begin to draw parallels between the rank-based and\nslice-based approaches. Through deeper analysis of the slice-based approach, we\nstrongly restrict the nondeterminism it generates. We are then able to employ\nthe slice-based approach to provide a new odd ranking, called a retrospective\nranking, that is different from the one provided by Kupferman and Vardi. This\nnew ranking allows us to construct a deterministic-in-the-limit rank-based\nautomaton with a highly restricted transition function. Further, by phrasing\nthe slice-based approach in terms of ranks, our approach affords a simple\nsymbolic encoding and achieves the tight bound of Schewe's construction\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Feb 2013 00:29:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 10:12:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Fogarty", "Seth J.", "", "Rice University"], ["Kupferman", "Orna", "", "School of Computer\n  Science and Engineering, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Isra"], ["Wilke", "Thomas", "", "Institut f\u00fcr Informatik, Christian-Albrechts-Universit\u00e4t zu Kiel"], ["Vardi", "Moshe Y.", "", "Department of Computer Science, Rice University, Houston, TX"]]}, {"id": "1302.2762", "submitter": "Radu Iosif", "authors": "Radu Iosif (Verimag/CNRS), Filip Konecny (Verimag/CNRS and FIT/BUT),\n  Marius Bozga (Verimag/CNRS)", "title": "Deciding Conditional Termination", "comments": "61 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 10, Issue 3 (August\n  21, 2014) lmcs:737", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-10(3:8)2014", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We address the problem of conditional termination, which is that of defining\nthe set of initial configurations from which a given program always terminates.\nFirst we define the dual set, of initial configurations from which a\nnon-terminating execution exists, as the greatest fixpoint of the function that\nmaps a set of states into its pre-image with respect to the transition\nrelation.

A sufficient and necessary condition is given for\nsuch a controller to exist as well as an algorithm that finds one in polynomial\ntime. We further generalise the model by adding costs on modes and present an\nalgorithm that constructs a safe controller which minimises the peak cost, the\naverage-cost or any cost expressed as a weighted sum of these two. Finally, we\npresent numerical simulation results based on our implementation of these\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Feb 2013 20:06:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wojtczak", "Dominik", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.5181", "submitter": "Mark Burgin", "authors": "Mark Burgin", "title": "Basic Classes of Grammars with Prohibition", "comments": "2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A practical tool for natural language modeling and development of\nhuman-machine interaction is developed in the context of formal grammars and\nlanguages. A new type of formal grammars, called grammars with prohibition, is\nintroduced. Grammars with prohibition provide more powerful tools for natural\nlanguage generation and better describe processes of language learning than the\nconventional formal grammars. Here we study relations between languages\ngenerated by different grammars with prohibition based on conventional types of\nformal grammars such as context-free or context sensitive grammars. Besides, we\ncompare languages generated by different grammars with prohibition and\nlanguages generated by conventional formal grammars. In particular, it is\ndemonstrated that they have essentially higher computational power and\nexpressive possibilities in comparison with the conventional formal grammars.\nThus, while conventional formal grammars are recursive and subrecursive\nalgorithms, many classes of grammars with prohibition are superrecursive\nalgorithms. Results presented in this work are aimed at the development of\nhuman-machine interaction, modeling natural languages, empowerment of\nprogramming languages, computer simulation, better software systems, and theory\nof recursion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2013 04:58:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Burgin", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.5793", "submitter": "Mikhail Volkov", "authors": "Dmitry S.

We\nfurther extend our result by allowing global arithmetic constraints for\ncounting the number of occurrences of some state or the number of different\nequivalence classes of subterms (modulo a given flat equational theory)\nreaching some state during a computation. We also adapt the model to unranked\nordered terms. As a consequence of our results for TABG, we prove the\ndecidability of a fragment of the monadic second order logic on trees extended\nwith predicates for equality and disequality between subtrees, and cardinality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2013 12:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2013 09:29:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bargu\u00f1\u00f3", "Luis", "", "Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya"], ["Creus", "Carles", "", "Universitat Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya"], ["Godoy", "Guillem", "", "Universitat\n  Polit\u00e9cnica de Catalunya"], ["Jacquemard", "Florent", "", "INRIA Saclay, LSV-CNRS"], ["Vacher", "Camille", "", "LIFL, Univ.
