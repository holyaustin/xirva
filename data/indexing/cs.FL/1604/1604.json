The main proof uses a large construction with the method of injective\nfunction. Since this bound is known to be reachable, and the values for $n \\le\n5$ are known, this completely settles the problem. We also prove that\n$(n-2)^{n-3} + (n-3)2^{n-3} - 1$ is the minimal size of the alphabet required\nto meet the bound for $n \\ge 6$. Finally, we show that the largest transition\nsemigroups of minimal DFAs which recognize bifix-free languages are unique up\nto renaming the states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Apr 2016 19:05:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 11:34:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2018 17:18:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Szyku\u0142a", "Marek", ""], ["Wittnebel", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07064", "submitter": "Yaron Velner", "authors": "Shaull Almagor, Orna Kupferman, Yaron Velner", "title": "Minimizing Expected Cost Under Hard Boolean Constraints, with\n  Applications to Quantitative Synthesis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In Boolean synthesis, we are given an LTL specification, and the goal is to\nconstruct a transducer that realizes it against an adversarial environment.\nOften, a specification contains both Boolean requirements that should be\nsatisfied against an adversarial environment, and multi-valued components that\nrefer to the quality of the satisfaction and whose expected cost we would like\nto minimize with respect to a probabilistic environment.\n  In this work we study, for the first time, mean-payoff games in which the\nsystem aims at minimizing the expected cost against a probabilistic\nenvironment, while surely satisfying an $\\omega$-regular condition against an\nadversarial environment. We consider the case the $\\omega$-regular condition is\ngiven as a parity objective or by an LTL formula. We show that in general,\noptimal strategies need not exist, and moreover, the limit value cannot be\napproximated by finite-memory strategies. We thus focus on computing the\nlimit-value, and give tight complexity bounds for synthesizing\n$\\epsilon$-optimal strategies for both finite-memory and infinite-memory\nstrategies.\n  We show that our game naturally arises in various contexts of synthesis with\nBoolean and multi-valued objectives. Beyond direct applications, in synthesis\nwith costs and rewards to certain behaviors, it allows us to compute the\nminimal sensing cost of $\\omega$-regular specifications -- a measure of quality\nin which we look for a transducer that minimizes the expected number of signals\nthat are read from the input.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Apr 2016 17:58:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Almagor", "Shaull", ""], ["Kupferman", "Orna", ""], ["Velner", "Yaron", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07190", "submitter": "Andrew Winslow", "authors": "Shinnosuke Seki and Andrew Winslow", "title": "The Complexity of Fixed-Height Patterned Tile Self-Assembly", "comments": "An abstract version appears in the proceedings of CIAA 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We characterize the complexity of the PATS problem for patterns of fixed\nheight and color count in variants of the model where seed glues are either\nchosen or fixed and identical (so-called non-uniform and uniform variants).

We propose a new\ntechnique to analyze such timed systems using finite tree automata instead of\nfinite word automata. The main idea is to consider timed behaviors as graphs\nwith matching edges capturing timing constraints. When a family of graphs has\nbounded tree-width, they can be interpreted in trees and MSO-definable\nproperties of such graphs can be checked using tree automata. The technique is\nquite general and applies to many timed systems.
