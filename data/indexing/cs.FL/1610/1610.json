We negatively solve this open question\nby presenting a special multi-valued partial CFL function as an example\nfunction and by proving that no refinement of this particular function becomes\na single-valued partial CFL function. This contrasts an early result of\nKobayashi [Inform. Control 15 (1969) 95-109] that multi-valued partial NFA\nfunctions are always refined by single-valued NFA functions, where NFA\nfunctions are computed by one-way nondeterministic finite automata with output\ntapes. Our example function turns out to be unambiguously 2-valued, and thus we\nobtain a stronger separation result, in which no refinement of unambiguously\n2-valued partial CFL functions can be single-valued. For the proof of this\nfact, we first introduce a new concept of colored automata having no output\ntapes but having \"colors,\" which can simulate pushdown automata equipped with\nconstant-space output tapes.

Specifically, we prove that, in Winfree's\nabstract Tile Assembly Model, when restricted to use only noncooperative\nbindings, any long enough path starting from the seed that can grow in all\nterminal assemblies is pumpable, meaning that this path can be extended into an\ninfinite, ultimately periodic path. This result can be seen as a geometric\ngeneralization of the pumping lemma of finite state automata, and closes the\nquestion of what can be computed deterministically in this model. Moreover,\nthis question has motivated the development of a new method called visible\nglues. We believe that this method can also be used to tackle other\nlong-standing problems in computational geometry, in relation for instance with\nself-avoiding paths. Tile assembly (including non-cooperative tile assembly)\nwas originally introduced by Winfree and Rothemund in STOC 2000 to understand\nhow to program shapes. The non-cooperative variant, also known as temperature 1\ntile assembly, is the model where tiles are allowed to bind as soon as they\nmatch on one side, whereas in cooperative tile assembly, some tiles need to\nmatch on several sides in order to bind.
