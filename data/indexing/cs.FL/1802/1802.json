Our key insight is that a graph's clique tree\nencodes robust and precise information. We show that a Hyperedge Replacement\nGrammar (HRG) can be extracted from the clique tree, and we develop a\nfixed-size graph generation algorithm that can be used to produce new graphs of\na specified size. In experiments on large real-world graphs, we show that\ngraphs generated from the HRG approach exhibit a diverse range of properties\nthat are similar to those found in the original networks. In addition to graph\nproperties like degree or eigenvector centrality, what a graph \"looks like\"\nultimately depends on small details in local graph substructures that are\ndifficult to define at a global level. We show that the HRG model can also\npreserve these local substructures when generating new graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 01:32:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Feb 2018 15:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Aguinaga", "Salvador", ""], ["Chiang", "David", ""], ["Weninger", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.08469", "submitter": "Nicolas Markey", "authors": "A.

The\nparameterized verification of such models aims at checking whether a given\nproperty holds irrespective of the initial configuration (number of agents,\ninitial states and initial communication topology). We focus here on the\nsynchronization property, asking whether all agents converge to a set of target\nstates after some execution. This problem is known to be decidable in\npolynomial time when no constraints are imposed on the evolution of the\ncommunication topology (while it is undecidable for static broadcast networks).\n  In this paper we investigate how various constraints on reconfigurations\naffect the decidability and complexity of the synchronization problem. In\nparticular, we show that when bounding the number of reconfigured links between\ntwo communications steps by a constant, synchronization becomes undecidable; on\nthe other hand, synchronization remains decidable in PTIME when the bound grows\nwith the number of agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Feb 2018 10:17:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Balasubramanian", "A.

A tower\ncontroller would be making many decisions in real-time to sequence aircraft.\nWhile some optimization tools exist to help the controller in some airports,\neven in these situations, the real sequence of the aircraft adopted by the\ncontroller is significantly different from the one proposed by the optimization\nalgorithm.

The\nobjective of this paper is to test the hypothesis that one can learn from the\nsequence adopted by the controller some strategies that can act as heuristics\nin decision support tools for aircraft sequencing.

The approach relies on a genetic\nalgorithm (GA) to learn these sequences using a society Probabilistic\nFinite-state Machines (PFSMs). Each PFSM learns a different sub-space; thus,\ndecomposing the learning problem into a group of agents that need to work\ntogether to learn the overall problem. Three sequence metrics (Levenshtein,\nHamming and Position distances) are compared as the fitness functions in GA.
