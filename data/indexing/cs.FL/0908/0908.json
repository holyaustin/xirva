The Spiral Rule automaton is a hexagonal ternary-state\ntwo-dimensional cellular automaton -- a finite-state machine imitation of an\nactivator-inhibitor reaction-diffusion system. The activator is self-inhibited\nin certain concentrations. The inhibitor dissociates in the absence of the\nactivator. The Spiral Rule cellular automaton has rich spatio-temporal dynamics\nof traveling (glider) and stationary (eater) patterns. When a glider brushes an\neater the eater may slightly change its configuration, which is updated once\nmore every next hit. We encode binary strings in the states of eaters and\nsequences of gliders. We study what types of binary compositions of binary\nstrings are implementable by sequences of gliders brushing an eater. The models\ndeveloped will be used in future laboratory designs of reaction-diffusion\nchemical computers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 12:42:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Adamatzky", "Andrew", ""], ["Martinez", "Genaro", ""], ["Zhang", "Liang", ""], ["Wuensche", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2083", "submitter": "Janusz Brzozowski", "authors": "J.
