However, this\nverification is facing severe challenges. First, in realistic settings, the\ncomputing entities only have imperfectly synchronized clocks. A proper timing\nmodel is essential to the interpretation of the trace of system execution.\nSecond, the specification should be able to express properties with real-time\nconstraints despite the asynchrony, and the semantics should be interpreted\nover the currently-observed and continuously-growing trace. To address these\nchallenges, we propose PARO - the partially synchronous system observation\nframework, which i) adopts the partially synchronous model of time, and\nintroduces the lattice and the timed automata theories to model the trace of\nsystem execution; ii) adopts a tailored subset of TCTL to specify temporal\nproperties, and defines the 3-valued semantics to interpret the properties over\nthe currently-observed finite trace; iii) constructs the timed automaton\ncorresponding to the trace at runtime, and reduces the satisfaction of the\n3-valued semantics over finite traces to that of the classical boolean\nsemantics over infinite traces. PARO is implemented over MIPA - the open-source\nmiddleware we developed. Performance measurements show the cost-effectiveness\nof PARO in different settings of key environmental factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2015 07:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yiling", ""], ["Huang", "Yu", ""], ["Cao", "Jiannong", ""], ["Lu", "Jian", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.01836", "submitter": "Kiran S.
