We used turn-based stochastic parity games to define acceptance of\nMarkov chains by a subclass of p-automata. Definition of acceptance required a\ncumbersome and complicated reduction to a series of turn-based stochastic\nparity games. The reduction could not support acceptance by general p-automata,\nwhich was left undefined as there was no notion of games that supported it.\n  Here we generalize two-player games by adding a structural acceptance\ncondition called obligations. Obligations are orthogonal to the linear winning\nconditions that define winning. Obligations are a declaration that player 0 can\nachieve a certain value from a configuration. If the obligation is met, the\nvalue of that configuration for player 0 is 1.\n  One cannot define value in obligation games by the standard mechanism of\nconsidering the measure of winning paths on a Markov chain and taking the\nsupremum of the infimum of all strategies. Mainly because obligations need\ndefinition even for Markov chains and the nature of obligations has the flavor\nof an infinite nesting of supremum and infimum operators. We define value via a\nreduction to turn-based games similar to Martin's proof of determinacy of\nBlackwell games with Borel objectives. Based on this definition, we show that\ngames are determined. We show that for Markov chains with Borel objectives and\nobligations, and finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations\nthere exists an alternative and simpler characterization of the value function.\nBased on this simpler definition we give an exponential time algorithm to\nanalyze finite turn-based stochastic parity games with obligations.
