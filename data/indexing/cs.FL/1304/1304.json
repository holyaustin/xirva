Such logics use conditions on paths expressed by regular\nlanguages and relations, but they often need to be extended by rational\nrelations such as subword or subsequence. Evaluating formulae in such extended\ngraph logics boils down to checking nonemptiness of the intersection of\nrational relations with regular or recognizable relations (or, more generally,\nto the generalized intersection problem, asking whether some projections of a\nregular relation have a nonempty intersection with a given rational relation).\n  We prove that for several basic and commonly used rational relations, the\nintersection problem with regular relations is either undecidable (e.g., for\nsubword or suffix, and some generalizations), or decidable with\nnon-primitive-recursive complexity (e.g., for subsequence and its\ngeneralizations). These results are used to rule out many classes of graph\nlogics that freely combine regular and rational relations, as well as to\nprovide the simplest problem related to verifying lossy channel systems that\nhas non-primitive-recursive complexity. We then prove a dichotomy result for\nlogics combining regular conditions on individual paths and rational relations\non paths, by showing that the syntactic form of formulae classifies them into\neither efficiently checkable or undecidable cases.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel technique of automatically learning the FA to be used as\nboxes that avoids the need of providing them manually.

First, we define the register complexity of an additive regular function\nto be the minimum number of registers that an ACRA needs to compute it. We\ncharacterize the register complexity by a necessary and sufficient condition\nregarding the largest subset of registers whose values can be made far apart\nfrom one another. We then use this condition to design a PSPACE algorithm to\ncompute the register complexity of a given ACRA, and establish a matching lower\nbound.

Armed with this formalism, we extend the notion of intrinsic\nsimulation between deterministic cellular automata, to the non-deterministic\nand stochas- tic settings. Although the intrinsic simulation relation is shown\nto become undecidable in dimension two and higher, we provide explicit tools to\nprove or disprove the existence of such a simulation between any two given\nstochastic cellular automata. Those tools rely upon a characterization of\nequality of stochastic global maps, shown to be equivalent to the existence of\na stochastic coupling between the random sources.
