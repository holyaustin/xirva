On unary languages, for\nquantum models, we obtain middle logarithmic space for counter machines. For\nbinary languages, arbitrary small non-constant space is enough for PTMs even\nusing only counter as memory. For counter machines, when restricted to\npolynomial time, we can obtain the same result for linear space.
