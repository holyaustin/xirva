The functioning of various\ncomputational devices may be expressed in terms of MPMRS (e.g., register\nmachines and many variants of P systems). In particular, this means that MPMRS\nare computationally complete; however, a direct translation leads to quite a\nbig number of rules. Like for other classes of computationally complete\ndevices, there is a challenge to find a universal system having the smallest\nnumber of rules. In this article we present different rule minimization\nstrategies for MPMRS based on encodings and structural transformations. We\napply these strategies to the translation of a small universal register machine\n(Korec, 1996) and we show that there exists a universal MPMRS with 23 rules.\nSince MPMRS are identical to a restricted variant of P systems with antiport\nrules, the results we obtained improve previously known results on the number\nof rules for those systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Sep 2010 16:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Alhazov", "Artiom", ""], ["Verlan", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2854", "submitter": "Mikolaj Bojanczyk", "authors": "Mikolaj Bojanczyk (Warsaw University), Luc Segoufin (INRIA)", "title": "Tree Languages Defined in First-Order Logic with One Quantifier\n  Alternation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 6, Issue 4 (October\n  20, 2010) lmcs:699", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-6(4:1)2010", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study tree languages that can be defined in \\Delta_2 .

In the present work we show that both slice graphs and\nHasse diagram generators are worth studying on their own. First, we prove that\nany slice graph SG can be effectively transformed into a Hasse diagram\ngenerator HG representing the same set of partial orders. Thus from an\nalgorithmic standpoint we introduce a method of transitive reducing infinite\nfamilies of DAGs specified by slice graphs. Second, we identify the class of\nsaturated slice graphs. By using our transitive reduction algorithm, we prove\nthat the class of partial order languages representable by saturated slice\ngraphs is closed under union, intersection and even under a suitable notion of\ncomplementation (cut-width complementation). Furthermore partial order\nlanguages belonging to this class can be tested for inclusion and admit\ncanonical representatives in terms of Hasse diagram generators. As an\napplication of our results, we give stronger forms of some results in our\nprevious work, and establish some unknown connections between the partial order\nbehavior of $p/t$-nets and other well known formalisms for the specification of\ninfinite families of partial orders, such as Mazurkiewicz trace languages and\nmessage sequence chart (MSC) languages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Sep 2010 17:49:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 11:55:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2011 10:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 11:17:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Mateus de Oliveira", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5759", "submitter": "Arseny Shur", "authors": "Arseny M.
