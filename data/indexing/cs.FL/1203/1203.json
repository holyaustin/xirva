Restricting the\nnumber of quantifier alternations yields an infinite hierarchy inside the class\nof FO^2[<]-definable languages. We show that each level of this hierarchy is\ndecidable.

While the reachability problem\nis undecidable for hybrid automata we show that it is decidable for ITA. More\nprecisely we prove that the untimed language of an ITA is regular, by building\na finite automaton as a generalized class graph. We then establish that the\nreachability problem for ITA is in NEXPTIME and in PTIME when the number of\nclocks is fixed. To prove the first result, we define a subclass ITA- of ITA,\nand show that (1) any ITA can be reduced to a language-equivalent automaton in\nITA- and (2) the reachability problem in this subclass is in NEXPTIME (without\nany class graph). In the next step, we investigate the verification of real\ntime properties over ITA. We prove that model checking SCL, a fragment of a\ntimed linear time logic, is undecidable. On the other hand, we give model\nchecking procedures for two fragments of timed branching time logic. We also\ncompare the expressive power of classical timed automata and ITA and prove that\nthe corresponding families of accepted languages are incomparable. The result\nalso holds for languages accepted by controlled real-time automata (CRTA), that\nextend timed automata. We finally combine ITA with CRTA, in a model which\nencompasses both classes and show that the reachability problem is still\ndecidable. Additionally we show that the languages of ITA are neither closed\nunder complementation nor under intersection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 07:43:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e9rard", "B\u00e9atrice", "", "LIP6"], ["Haddad", "Serge", "", "LSV"], ["Sassolas", "Mathieu", "", "LIP6"]]}, {"id": "1203.6792", "submitter": "Luca Ferrari", "authors": "Luca Ferrari, Emanuele Munarini", "title": "Enumeration of edges in some lattices of paths", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We enumerate the edges in the Hasse diagram of several lattices arising in\nthe combinatorial context of lattice paths.
