The equivalence of these\nproperties has not been formally shown.\n  We generalize all of these definitions to alternating automata and show their\nequivalence. We further show that alternating GFG automata are as expressive as\ndeterministic automata with the same acceptance conditions and indices. We then\nshow that alternating GFG automata over finite words, and weak automata over\ninfinite words, are not more succinct than deterministic automata, and that\ndeterminizing B\\\"uchi and co-B\\\"uchi alternating GFG automata involves a\n$2^{\\Theta(n)}$ state blow-up. We leave open the question of whether\nalternating GFG automata of stronger acceptance conditions allow for\ndoubly-exponential succinctness compared to deterministic automata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jun 2019 13:30:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 16:19:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Boker", "Udi", ""], ["Lehtinen", "Karoliina", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11718", "submitter": "Florin Manea", "authors": "Joel D.

Qualitative timed pattern matching is one of the\nmathematical formulations of monitoring, which gives a Boolean verdict for each\nsub-signal according to the satisfaction of the given specification. There are\ntwo orthogonal directions of extension of the qualitative timed pattern\nmatching. One direction on the result is quantitative: what engineers want is\noften not a qualitative verdict but the quantitative measurement of the\nsatisfaction of the specification. The other direction on the algorithm is\nonline checking: the monitor returns some verdicts before obtaining the entire\nsignal, which enables to monitor a running system. It is desired from\napplication viewpoints. In this paper, we conduct these two extensions, taking\nan automata-based approach. This is the first quantitative and online timed\npattern matching algorithm to the best of our knowledge. More specifically, we\nemploy what we call timed symbolic weighted automata to specify quantitative\nspecifications to be monitored, and we obtain an online algorithm using the\nshortest distance of a weighted variant of the zone graph and dynamic\nprogramming. Moreover, our problem setting is semiring-based and therefore,\ngeneral. Our experimental results confirm the scalability of our algorithm for\nspecifications with a time-bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 11:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Waga", "Masaki", ""]]}]
