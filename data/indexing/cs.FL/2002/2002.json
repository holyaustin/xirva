A\nfinal coalgebra then gives rise to the coinduction principle, which states that\ntwo bisimilar elements are equal. For polynomial functors, this leads to\nwell-known descriptions. In the present paper we look at the dual notion of\n\"apartness\". Intuitively, two elements are apart if there is a positive way to\ndistinguish them. Phrased differently: two elements are apart if and only if\nthey are not bisimilar. Since apartness is an inductive notion, described by a\nleast fixed point, we can give a proof system, to derive that two elements are\napart. This proof system has derivation rules and two elements are apart if and\nonly if there is a finite derivation (using the rules) of this fact.\n  We study apartness versus bisimulation in two separate ways. First, for weak\nforms of bisimulation on labelled transition systems, where silent (tau) steps\nare included, we define an apartness notion that corresponds to weak\nbisimulation and another apartness that corresponds to branching bisimulation.\nThe rules for apartness can be used to show that two states of a labelled\ntransition system are not branching bismilar. To support the apartness view on\nlabelled transition systems, we cast a number of well-known properties of\nbranching bisimulation in terms of branching apartness and prove them. Next, we\nalso study the more general categorical situation and show that indeed,\napartness is the dual of bisimilarity in a precise categorical sense: apartness\nis an initial algebra and gives rise to an induction principle.

The use of\nRV has led to interest in deciding whether a property is monitorable: whether\nit is always possible for the satisfaction or violation of the property to be\ndetermined after a finite future continuation. However, classical two-valued\nmonitorability suffers from two inherent limitations. First, a property can\nonly be evaluated as monitorable or non-monitorable; no information is\navailable regarding whether only one verdict (satisfaction or violation) can be\ndetected. Second, monitorability is defined at the language-level and does not\ntell us whether satisfaction or violation can be detected starting from the\ncurrent monitor state during system execution.\n  To address these limitations, this paper proposes a new notion of four-valued\nmonitorability for $\\omega$-languages and applies it at the state-level.\nFour-valued monitorability is more informative than two-valued monitorability\nas a property can be evaluated as a four-valued result, denoting that only\nsatisfaction, only violation, or both are active for a monitorable property. We\ncan also compute state-level weak monitorability, i.e., whether satisfaction or\nviolation can be detected starting from a given state in a monitor, which\nenables state-level optimizations of monitoring algorithms.
