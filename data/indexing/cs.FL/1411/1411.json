The well-known dynamic programming algorithm\nsolves this problem in $O(n^3)$ time (ignoring grammar size) where $n$ is the\nstring length [Aho, Peterson 1972, Myers 1985]. Despite its vast number of\napplications, there is no algorithm known till date that computes or\napproximates Lan-ED in true sub-cubic time.\n  In this paper we give the first such algorithm that computes Lan-ED almost\noptimally. For any arbitrary $\\epsilon > 0$, our algorithm runs in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n^{\\omega}}{poly(\\epsilon)})$ time and returns an estimate\nwithin a multiplicative approximation factor of $(1+\\epsilon)$, where $\\omega$\nis the exponent of ordinary matrix multiplication of $n$ dimensional square\nmatrices. It also computes the edit script. Further, for all substrings of $s$,\nwe can estimate their Lan-ED within $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$ factor in\n$\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n^{\\omega}}{poly(\\epsilon)})$ time with high probability. We\nalso design the very first sub-cubic ($\\tilde{O}(n^\\omega)$) algorithm to\nhandle arbitrary stochastic context free grammar (SCFG) parsing. SCFGs lie at\nthe foundation of statistical natural language processing, they generalize\nhidden Markov models, and have found widespread applications.\n  To complement our upper bound result, we show that exact computation of SCFG\nparsing, or Lan-ED with insertion as only edit operation in true sub-cubic time\nwill imply a truly sub-cubic algorithm for all-pairs shortest paths, and hence\nto a large range of problems in graphs and matrices. Known lower bound results\non parsing implies no improvement over our time bound of $O(n^\\omega)$ is\npossible for any nontrivial multiplicative approximation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 17:57:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 04:42:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 08:41:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Barna", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7647", "submitter": "Abuzer Yakaryilmaz", "authors": "A.
