As a natural restriction of NP-reducibility, we introduce a notion\nof many-one CFL reducibility and conduct a ground work to formulate a coherent\nframework for further expositions. Two more powerful reducibilities--bounded\ntruth-table and Turing CFL-reducibilities--are also discussed in comparison.\nThe Turing CFL-reducibility, in particular, helps us introduce an exquisite\nhierarchy, called the CFL hierarchy, built over the family CFL of context-free\nlanguages. For each level of this hierarchy, its basic structural properties\nare proven and three alternative characterizations are presented. The second\nlevel is not included in NC(2) unless NP= NC(2). The first and second levels of\nthe hierarchy are different. The rest of the hierarchy (more strongly, the\nBoolean hierarchy built over each level of the hierarchy) is also infinite\nunless the polynomial hierarchy over NP collapses. This follows from a\ncharacterization of the Boolean hierarchy over the k-th level of the polynomial\nhierarchy in terms of the Boolean hierarchy over the k+1st level of the CFL\nhierarchy using log-space many-one reductions. Similarly, the complexity class\nTheta(k) is related to the closure of the k-th level of the CFL hierarchy under\nlog-space truth-table reductions. We also argue that the CFL hierarchy\ncoincides with a hierarchy over CFL built by application of many-one\nCFL-reductions. We show that BPCFL--a bounded-error probabilistic version of\nCFL--is not included in CFL even in the presence of advice.

We take a comprehensive look at the issue, giving a\ncomparison of verification problems for FO2, LTL, and various sublogics thereof\nacross a wide range of models.

We give three logic-to-automata translations which\ncan be used to give upper bounds for FO2 and UTL and various sublogics. We\napply these to get new bounds for both non-deterministic systems (hierarchical\nand recursive state machines, games) and for probabilistic systems (Markov\nchains, recursive Markov chains, and Markov decision processes). We couple\nthese with matching lower-bound arguments. Next, we look at combining FO2\nverification techniques with those for LTL.
