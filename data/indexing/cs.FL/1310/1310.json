This is a problem when one\nconsiders implementing such model in a distributed architecture, since reading\nclocks a priori requires communications which are not explicitly described in\nthe model. We focus on the following question: given an NTA A1 || A2 where A2\nreads some clocks reset by A1, does there exist an NTA A'1 || A'2 without\nshared clocks with the same behavior as the initial NTA? For this, we allow the\nautomata to exchange information during synchronizations only, in particular by\ncopying the value of their neighbor's clocks. We discuss a formalization of the\nproblem and define an appropriate behavioural equivalence. Then we give a\ncriterion using the notion of contextual timed transition system, which\nrepresents the behavior of A2 when in parallel with A1. Finally, we effectively\nbuild A'1 || A'2 when it exists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2013 12:48:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 22:08:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Balaguer", "Sandie", "", "LSV, ENS Cachan, Inria, CNRS"], ["Chatain", "Thomas", "", "LSV,\n  ENS Cachan, Inria, CNRS"]]}, {"id": "1310.5590", "submitter": "Miha E.
