Thus advocating an automaton model specially\ntailored for working with modal $\\mu$-Calculus. The advantage of the automaton\nmodel is its ability to deal with arbitrary branching in a much simpler way as\ncompare to the one proposed by Janin and Walukiewicz. Both problems (i.e.,\nmodel checking and satisfiability) are solved by reduction to the corresponding\nproblems of alternating tree automata, namely to the acceptance and the\nnon-emptiness problems, respectively.

Examples of complex specifications of interest include\nproperties expressed as formulae in linear temporal logic (LTL) or as automata\non infinite strings. A general methodology to synthesize controllers for such\nproperties resorts to symbolic abstractions of the given stochastic systems.\nSymbolic models are discrete abstractions of the given concrete systems with\nthe property that a controller designed on the abstraction can be refined (or\nimplemented) into a controller on the original system. Although the recent\ndevelopment of techniques for the construction of symbolic models has been\nquite encouraging, the general goal of formal synthesis over stochastic control\nsystems is by no means solved. A fundamental issue with the existing techniques\nis the known \"curse of dimensionality,\" which is due to the need to discretize\nstate and input sets and that results in an exponential complexity over the\nnumber of state and input variables in the concrete system. In this work we\npropose a novel abstraction technique for incrementally stable stochastic\ncontrol systems, which does not require state-space discretization but only\ninput set discretization, and that can be potentially more efficient (and thus\nscalable) than existing approaches. We elucidate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach by synthesizing a schedule for the coordination of two\ntraffic lights under some safety and fairness requirements for a road traffic\nmodel. Further we argue that this 5-dimensional linear stochastic control\nsystem cannot be studied with existing approaches based on state-space\ndiscretization due to the very large number of generated discrete states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 16:18:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zamani", "Majid", ""], ["Tkachev", "Ilya", ""], ["Abate", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.01387", "submitter": "Janusz Brzozowski", "authors": "Janusz Brzozowski", "title": "Unrestricted State Complexity of Binary Operations on Regular Languages", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures.

Additionally,\nthe proposed formulation is shown to equal an analogous but formally quite\ndifferent notion of topological entropy from Symbolic Dynamics -- consequently\nalso showing Shannon's original formulation to be equivalent to topological\nentropy.
