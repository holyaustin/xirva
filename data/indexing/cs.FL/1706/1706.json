In our previous work we presented an efficient timed pattern\nmatching algorithm: it adopts a skipping mechanism inspired by the classic\nBoyer--Moore (BM) string matching algorithm. In this work we tackle the problem\nof online timed pattern matching, towards embedded applications where it is\nvital to process a vast amount of incoming data in a timely manner.\nSpecifically, we start with the Franek-Jennings-Smyth (FJS) string matching\nalgorithm---a recent variant of the BM algorithm---and extend it to timed\npattern matching. Our experiments indicate the efficiency of our FJS-type\nalgorithm in online and offline timed pattern matching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 08:58:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Waga", "Masaki", ""], ["Hasuo", "Ichiro", ""], ["Suenaga", "Kohei", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10049", "submitter": "Pengfei Yang", "authors": "Pengfei Yang, David N.

In contrast to those state-based\nbisimulations, our distribution bisimulation is weaker, but corresponds more\nclosely to linear properties. We construct a logic and a metric to describe our\ndistribution bisimulation and discuss linearity, continuity and compositional\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 08:01:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Pengfei", ""], ["Jansen", "David N.", ""], ["Zhang", "Lijun", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10206", "submitter": "Jeffrey Shallit", "authors": "Aayush Rajasekaran, Jeffrey Shallit, and Tim Smith", "title": "Sums of Palindromes: an Approach via Automata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL math.CO math.NT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, Cilleruelo, Luca, & Baxter proved, for all bases b >= 5, that every\nnatural number is the sum of at most 3 natural numbers whose base-b\nrepresentation is a palindrome.
