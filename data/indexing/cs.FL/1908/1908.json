This partial order compares large\nscale geometries; as such it presents an algebraic tool for classification of\nglobal patterns. We prove there is a greatest large scale geometry and\ninfinitely many minimal large scale geometries. The second question is related\nto understanding the quasi-isometric maps on various classes of strings. The\nthird question investigates the sets of large scale geometries of strings\naccepted by computational models, e.g. B\\\"uchi automata.

For instance, the regular spanners are the closure under the\nRelational Algebra (RA) of the regular expressions with capture variables, and\nthe expressive power of the regular spanners is precisely captured by the class\nof VSet-automata - a restricted class of transducers that mark the endpoints of\nselected spans.\n  In this work, we embark on the investigation of document spanners that can\nannotate extractions with auxiliary information such as confidence, support,\nand confidentiality measures. To this end, we adopt the abstraction of\nprovenance semirings by Green et al., where tuples of a relation are annotated\nwith the elements of a commutative semiring, and where the annotation\npropagates through the (positive) RA operators via the semiring operators.\nHence, the proposed spanner extension, referred to as an annotator, maps every\nstring into an annotated relation over the spans. As a specific instantiation,\nwe explore weighted VSet-automata that, similarly to weighted automata and\ntransducers, attach semiring elements to transitions. We investigate key\naspects of expressiveness, such as the closure under the positive RA, and key\naspects of computational complexity, such as the enumeration of annotated\nanswers and their ranked enumeration in the case of numeric semirings. For a\nnumber of these problems, fundamental properties of the underlying semiring,\nsuch as positivity, are crucial for establishing tractability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 10:39:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2019 13:46:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2020 12:11:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Doleschal", "Johannes", ""], ["Kimelfeld", "Benny", ""], ["Martens", "Wim", ""], ["Peterfreund", "Liat", ""]]}]
