With\nthis survey article we give an overview about relevant research to this topic\nduring the last twenty years including own investigations and some new results.\nIn Section 1 after recalling the most important notions from formal language\ntheory we illustrate the connection between coding theory and primitive words\nby some facts. We define primitive words as words having only a trivial\nrepresentation as the power of another word. Nonprimitive words (without the\nempty word) are exactly the periodic words. Every nonempty word is a power of\nan uniquely determined primitive word which is called the root of the former\none. The set of all roots of nonempty words of a language is called the root of\nthe language. The primitive words have interesting combinatorial properties\nwhich we consider in Section 2. In Section 3 we investigate the relationship\nbetween the set $Q$ of all primitive words over some fixed alphabet and the\nlanguage classes of the Chomsky Hierarchy and the contextual languages over the\nsame alphabet. The computational complexity of the set $Q$ and of the roots of\nlanguages are considered in Section 4. The set of all powers of the same degree\nof all words from a language is the power of this language. We examine the\npowers of languages for different sets of exponents, and especially their\nregularity and context-freeness, in Section 5, and the decidability of\nappropriate questions in Section 6. Section 7 is dedicated to several\ngeneralizations of the notions of periodicity and primitivity of words.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2011 12:25:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lischke", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4606", "submitter": "Zhaohua Luo", "authors": "Zhaohua Luo", "title": "Universal Algebra and Mathematical Logic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.LO cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, first-order logic is interpreted in the framework of universal\nalgebra, using the clone theory developed in three previous papers.

It is a generalization of weighted acceptors (one tape)\nand transducers (two tapes).\n  After recalling some basic definitions about n-ary weighted rational\nrelations and n-WFSMs, we summarize some central operations on these relations\nand machines, such as join and auto-intersection. Unfortunately, due to Post's\nCorrespondence Problem, a fully general join or auto-intersection algorithm\ncannot exist. We recall a restricted algorithm for a class of n-WFSMs.\n  Through a series of practical applications, we finally investigate the\naugmented descriptive power of n-WFSMs and their join, compared to classical\ntransducers and their composition. Some applications are not feasible with the\nlatter. The series includes: the morphological analysis of Semitic languages,\nthe preservation of intermediate results in transducer cascades, the induction\nof morphological rules from corpora, the alignment of lexicon entries, the\nautomatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora, and the search\nfor cognates in a bilingual lexicon.\n  All described operations and applications have been implemented with Xerox's\nWFSC tool.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 11:44:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 09:38:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kempe", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}]
