Multiple\ninteractions of finite state machines in complex systems are well captured by\nthe notion of non-flat systems. Non--flat systems are \"finite state machines\"\nwhere each \"state\" can be either a basic state or an aggregate of finite state\nmachines. By expanding a non-flat system, a flat system is obtained which is an\nordinary finite state machine. In this paper we introduce a novel class of\nnon--flat systems called Arena of Finite State Machines (AFSM). AFSMs are\ncollections of finite state machines that interact concurrently through a\ncommunication network. We propose a notion of compositional bisimulation that\nallows checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs by directly exploiting their\ncommunication networks and hence, without the need of expanding the AFSMs to\nfinite state machines. Compositional bisimulation allows a computational\ncomplexity reduction when checking bisimulation equivalence of AFSMs, as\nformally quantified in the paper. An application of the proposed framework to\nthe regulation of gene expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli is also\npresented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2011 23:57:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Dec 2011 16:01:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Pola", "Giordano", ""], ["Di Benedetto", "Maria D.", ""], ["De Santis", "Elena", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.1235", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Zhilin Wu (State Key Laboratory of Computer Science, Institute of\n  Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences)", "title": "A Decidable Extension of Data Automata", "comments": "In Proceedings GandALF 2011, arXiv:1106.0814", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 54, 2011, pp. 116-130", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.54.9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Data automata on data words is a decidable model proposed by Boja\\'nczyk et\nal. in 2006.

We use the well known framework of\nhybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and we define a Fault Diagnosis\nGame on them, using two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The\nenvironment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a\nfault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behaviour of the system and\nannounces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy\nfor the diagnoser implies that faults can be detected correctly, while\ncomputing such a winning strategy corresponds to implement a diagnoser for the\nsystem.
