In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of\nthe usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function\nthat penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its\nrelaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest\nrelaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further\nbenefit that the most problematic neurons are conditioned as early as possible,\nwhen conditioning layer by layer.

Moreover a polyregular\nfunction can be realized by: a transducer with two pebbles if and only if its\noutput has quadratic size in its input, a transducer with three pebbles if and\nonly if its output has cubic size in its input, etc. Moreover the\ncharacterization is decidable and, given a polyregular function, one can\ncompute a transducer realizing it with the minimal number of pebbles. We apply\nthe result to mso interpretations from words to words. We show that mso\ninterpretations of dimension k exactly coincide with k-pebble transductions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 10:13:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lhote", "Nathan", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16711", "submitter": "\\v{S}t\\v{e}p\\'an Holub", "authors": "\\v{S}t\\v{e}p\\'an Holub and \\v{S}t\\v{e}p\\'an Starosta", "title": "Binary intersection formalized", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a reformulation and a formalization of the classical result by\nJuhani Karhum\\\"aki characterizing intersections of two languages of the form\n$\\{x,y\\}^*\\cap \\{u,v\\}^*$.
