In computability theory the notion of\nencoding is crucial for defining computability on arbitrary domains, as well as\nfor comparing the power of models of computation. In language theory much\nattention has been devoted to regularity preserving functions.\n  A natural question arising in these contexts is: Is there a bijective\nencoding such that its image function preserves regularity of languages, but\nits pre-image function does not? Our main result answers this question in the\naffirmative: For every countable class C of languages there exists a bijective\nencoding f such that for every language L in C its image f[L] is regular.\n  Our construction of such encodings has several noteworthy consequences.\nFirstly, anomalies arise when models of computation are compared with respect\nto a known concept of implementation that is based on encodings which are not\nrequired to be computable: Every countable decision model can be implemented,\nin this sense, by finite-state automata, even via bijective encodings. Hence\ndeterministic finite-state automata would be equally powerful as Turing machine\ndeciders.\n  A second consequence concerns the recognizability of sets of natural numbers\nvia number representations and finite automata.

A rational series is a function from strings to real numbers that can\nbe computed by a finite WFA. Among others, this includes probability\ndistributions generated by hidden Markov models and probabilistic automata. The\nrelationship between rational series and WFA is analogous to the relationship\nbetween regular languages and ordinary automata. Associated with such rational\nseries are infinite matrices called Hankel matrices which play a fundamental\nrole in the theory of minimal WFA. Our contributions are: (1) an effective\nprocedure for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of such infinite\nHankel matrices based on their representation in terms of finite WFA; (2) a new\ncanonical form for finite WFA based on this SVD decomposition; and, (3) an\nalgorithm to construct approximate minimizations of a given WFA. The goal of\nour approximate minimization algorithm is to start from a minimal WFA and\nproduce a smaller WFA that is close to the given one in a certain sense.
