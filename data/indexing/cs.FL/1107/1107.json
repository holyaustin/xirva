We consider the structural aspect of induction. We answer\nthe question as to whether we can find a finite and minmalistic set of\noperations on structural elements in terms of which any theory can be\nexpressed. We identify abstraction (grouping similar entities) and\nsuper-structuring (combining topologically e.g., spatio-temporally close\nentities) as the essential structural operations in the induction process. We\nshow that only two more structural operations, namely, reverse abstraction and\nreverse super-structuring (the duals of abstraction and super-structuring\nrespectively) suffice in order to exploit the full power of Turing-equivalent\ngenerative grammars in induction. We explore the implications of this theorem\nwith respect to the nature of hidden variables, radical positivism and the\n2-century old claim of David Hume about the principles of connexion among\nideas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jul 2011 07:33:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Silvescu", "Adrian", ""], ["Honavar", "Vasant", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.0577", "submitter": "Juan Reutter L", "authors": "Pablo Barcel\\'o, Leonid Libkin, Juan Reutter", "title": "Parameterized Regular Expressions and their Languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study regular expressions that use variables, or parameters, which are\ninterpreted as alphabet letters.
