We prove that for a regular expression \\E of a size |\\E| and\nalphabetic width ||\\E||, the \\Follow sets can be computed in O(||\\E||\\cdot\n|\\E|) time complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Feb 2015 08:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sebti", "Nadia Ouali", ""], ["Ziadi", "Djelloul", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07014", "submitter": "James Currie", "authors": "James D.

In a recent contribution, Albert\nEschenmoser emphasised the importance of catalytic and autocatalytic cycles in\nestablishing such abiotic synthesis pathways. The accumulation of intermediate\nproducts furthermore provides additional catalysts that allow pathways to\nchange over time. We show here that generative models of chemical spaces based\non graph grammars make it possible to study such phenomena is a systematic\nmanner. In addition to repro- ducing the key steps of Eschenmoser's hypothesis\npaper, we discovered previously unexplored potentially autocatalytic pathways\nfrom HCN to glyoxylate. A cascading of autocatalytic cycles could efficiently\nre-route matter, distributed over the combinatorial complex network of HCN\nhydrolysation chemistry, towards a potential primordial metabolism. The\ngenerative approach also has it intrinsic limitations: the unsupervised\nexpansion of the chemical space remains infeasible due to the exponential\ngrowth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the\ncombinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks\nforms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the\ncomputational exploration by chemical experience is indispensable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:02:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Andersen", "Jakob L.", ""], ["Flamm", "Christoph", ""], ["Merkle", "Daniel", ""], ["Stadler", "Peter F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07796", "submitter": "Matilde Marcolli", "authors": "Matilde Marcolli and Alexander Port", "title": "Graph Grammars, Insertion Lie Algebras, and Quantum Field Theory", "comments": "19 pages, LaTeX, 3 jpeg figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Graph grammars extend the theory of formal languages in order to model\ndistributed parallelism in theoretical computer science.
