Nevertheless, such control methods cannot be directly applied for\nmany practical engineering systems nowadays since they are open systems and\ntheir operation heavily depends on nontrivial interactions between the systems\nand the external environments. These open systems should be controlled in such\na way that accomplishment of the control objective can be guaranteed for any\npossible environment, which may be dynamic, uncertain and sometimes\nunpredictable. In this paper, we aim at extending the conventional supervisory\ncontrol theory to open discrete event systems in a reactive manner. Starting\nfrom a novel input-output automaton model of an open system, we consider\ncontrol objectives that characterize the desired input-output behaviors of the\nsystem, based on which a game-theoretic approach is carried out to compute a\nreactive supervisor that steers the system to fulfill the specifications\nregardless of the environment behaviors. We present a necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the existence of such a reactive supervisor.

A nonhalting abelian network can be\nrealized as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on\nthe update order. We show that certain features of the dynamics, such as\nminimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that do not require\nspecifying an update order.\n  We give an intrinsic definition of the \\emph{torsion group} of a finite\nirreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides\nwith the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We\nshow that the torsion group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent\ncomponents of the trajectory digraph, and identify when this action is\ntransitive.\n  This perspective leads to new results even in the classical case of sinkless\nrotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al\n(2008) it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor\nnetwork with just one chip are precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with\na unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle). We generalize this result\nto abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips.

However, existing reactive synthesis techniques do not provide a\nway to ensure random behavior while maintaining functional correctness. Towards\nthis end, we generalize the recently-proposed framework of control\nimprovisation (CI) to add reactivity. The resulting framework of reactive\ncontrol improvisation provides a natural way to integrate a randomness\nrequirement with the usual functional specifications of reactive synthesis over\na finite window. We theoretically characterize when such problems are\nrealizable, and give a general method for solving them. For specifications\ngiven by reachability or safety games or by deterministic finite automata, our\nmethod yields a polynomial-time synthesis algorithm.

The simulation of a collision, a\nmacro-collision, consists of two phases.
