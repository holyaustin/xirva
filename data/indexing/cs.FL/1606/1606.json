Nested words are words with a\nnesting structure, allowing to model unranked trees as their depth-first-search\nlinearisations.

The model of visibly pushdown transducers allows to describe\nsuch transformations, and we propose a simple deterministic extension of this\nmodel with two-way moves that has the following properties: i) it is a simple\ncomputational model, that naturally has a good evaluation complexity; ii) it is\nexpressive: it subsumes nested word-to-word MSO transducers, and the exact\nexpressiveness of MSO transducers is recovered using a simple syntactic\nrestriction; iii) it has good algorithmic/closure properties: the model is\nclosed under composition with a unambiguous one-way letter-to-letter transducer\nwhich gives closure under regular look-around, and has a decidable equivalence\nproblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 11:32:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dartois", "Luc", ""], ["Filiot", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Reynier", "Pierre-Alain", ""], ["Talbot", "Jean-Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.00835", "submitter": "Michael Sollami", "authors": "Michael Sollami, Craig C.

Those objectives offer powerful abstraction\nmechanisms and often yield nice properties such as memoryless determinacy.\nHowever, their very nature provides no guarantee on time bounds within which\nsomething good can be witnessed.
