In these\nsituations, it is usually more relevant to quantify the probability of\nsatisfying/violating a given property than to just assess the possibility of\nsuch events to occur.\n  In this work, we introduce an approach for probabilistic analysis of open\nprograms (i.e. programs with undefined identifiers) based on game semantics and\nmodel counting. We use a symbolic representation of algorithmic game semantics\nto collect the symbolic constraints on the input data (context) that lead to\nthe occurrence of the target events (e.g. satisfaction/violation of a given\nproperty). The constraints are then analyzed to quantify how likely is an input\nto satisfy them. We use model counting techniques to count the number of\nsolutions (from a bounded integer domain) that satisfy given constraints.
