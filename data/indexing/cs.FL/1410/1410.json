Algorithms for broad- casting\nautomata model are in the same vain as those encountered in distributed\nalgorithms using a simple notion of waves, messages passed from automata to au-\ntomata throughout the topology, to construct computations. The waves generated\nby activating processes in a digital environment can be used for designing a\nvari- ety of wave algorithms. In this chapter we aim to study the geometrical\nshapes of informational waves on integer grid generated in broadcasting\nautomata model as well as their potential use for metric approximation in a\ndiscrete space. An explo- ration of the ability to vary the broadcasting radius\nof each node leads to results of categorisations of digital discs, their form,\ncomposition, encodings and gener- ation. Results pertaining to the nodal\npatterns generated by arbitrary transmission radii on the plane are explored\nwith a connection to broadcasting sequences and ap- proximation of discrete\nmetrics of which results are given for the approximation of astroids, a\npreviously unachievable concave metric, through a novel application of the\naggregation of waves via a number of explored functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 14:41:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Nickson", "Thomas", ""], ["Potapov", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0589", "submitter": "Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira", "authors": "Mateus de Oliveira Oliveira", "title": "An Algorithmic Metatheorem for Directed Treewidth", "comments": "41 pages, 6 figures, Accepted to Discrete Applied Mathematics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.FL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The notion of directed treewidth was introduced by Johnson, Robertson,\nSeymour and Thomas [Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series B, Vol 82, 2001] as\na first step towards an algorithmic metatheory for digraphs. They showed that\nsome NP-complete properties such as Hamiltonicity can be decided in polynomial\ntime on digraphs of constant directed treewidth. Nevertheless, despite more\nthan one decade of intensive research, the list of hard combinatorial problems\nthat are known to be solvable in polynomial time when restricted to digraphs of\nconstant directed treewidth has remained scarce. In this work we enrich this\nlist by providing for the first time an algorithmic metatheorem connecting the\nmonadic second order logic of graphs to directed treewidth. We show that most\nof the known positive algorithmic results for digraphs of constant directed\ntreewidth can be reformulated in terms of our metatheorem. Additionally, we\nshow how to use our metatheorem to provide polynomial time algorithms for two\nclasses of combinatorial problems that have not yet been studied in the context\nof directed width measures. More precisely, for each fixed $k,w \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$, we show how to count in polynomial time on digraphs of directed\ntreewidth $w$, the number of minimum spanning strong subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths, and the number of maximal subgraphs that are the\nunion of $k$ directed paths and satisfy a given minor closed property. To prove\nour metatheorem we devise two technical tools which we believe to be of\nindependent interest. First, we introduce the notion of tree-zig-zag number of\na digraph, a new directed width measure that is at most a constant times\ndirected treewidth. Second, we introduce the notion of $z$-saturated tree slice\nlanguage, a new formalism for the specification and manipulation of infinite\nsets of digraphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2014 15:27:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 07:16:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Mateus de Oliveira", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1042", "submitter": "Wojciech Czerwi\\'nski", "authors": "Wojciech Czerwi\\'nski, Wim Martens, Lorijn van Rooijen, Marc Zeitoun,\n  Georg Zetzsche", "title": "A Characterization for Decidable Separability by Piecewise Testable\n  Languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Discrete Mathematics & Theoretical Computer Science, Vol. 19 no.\n  4, FCT '15, special issue FCT'15 (December 11, 2017) dmtcs:4131", "doi": "10.23638/DMTCS-19-4-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The separability problem for word languages of a class $\\mathcal{C}$ by\nlanguages of a class $\\mathcal{S}$ asks, for two given languages $I$ and $E$\nfrom $\\mathcal{C}$, whether there exists a language $S$ from $\\mathcal{S}$ that\nincludes $I$ and excludes $E$, that is, $I \\subseteq S$ and $S\\cap E =\n\\emptyset$.

The proposed procedure terminates in a\nfinite number of steps whenever the membership values taken by $\\delta $,\n$\\sigma $ and $\\tau $ generate a finite subsemiring of the semiring reduct of\n$\\cal L$.
