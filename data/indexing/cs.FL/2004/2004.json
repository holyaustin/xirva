Current clinical\npractice is to insert needles under image guidance or haptic feedback, although\nthat may involve reinsertions and adjustments since the needle and its\ninteraction with the tissue during insertion cannot be completely controlled.\n(Automated) needle steering could in theory improve the accuracy with which a\ntarget is reached and thus reduce surgical traumata especially for minimally\ninvasive procedures, e.g., brachytherapy or biopsy. Yet, flexible needles and\nneedle-tissue interaction are both complex and expensive to model and can often\nbe computed approximatively only. In this paper we propose to employ timed\ngames to navigate flexible needles with a bevel tip to reach a fixed target in\ntissue. We use a simple non-holonomic model of needle-tissue interaction, which\nabstracts in particular from the various physical forces involved and appears\nto be simplistic compared to related models from medical robotics. Based on the\nmodel, we synthesize strategies from which we can derive sufficiently precise\nmotion plans to steer the needle in soft tissue. However, applying those\nstrategies in practice, one is faced with the problem of an unpredictable\nbehavior of the needle at the initial insertion point. Our proposal is to\nimplement a preprocessing step to initialize the model based on data from the\nreal system, once the needle is inserted. Taking into account the actual needle\ntip angle and position, we generate strategies to reach the desired target.

The investigation of information results indicated that exist a\ncritical distinction among the two strategies, demonstrating that youngsters\nspending time with Serious Game got little schedule in the movement running and\nfurthermore enhanced execution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 10:48:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["M", "Harini.", ""], ["T", "Harini.", ""], ["Samuel", "Roxanna", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14750", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Bob Coecke (University of Oxford), Matthew Leifer (Chapman University)", "title": "Proceedings 16th International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 318, 2020", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.318", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL cs.IT cs.PL math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This volume contains the proceedings of the 16th International Conference on\nQuantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2017), which was held June 10-14, 2019.
