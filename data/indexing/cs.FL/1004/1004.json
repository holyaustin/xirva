For general omega-regular specifications, the\nsolution rests on a new, polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal\nstrategies in MDPs with mean-payoff parity objectives.\n  Our algorithm generates optimal strategies consisting of two memoryless\nstrategies and a counter. This counter is in general not bounded. To obtain a\nfinite-state system, we show how to construct an \\epsilon-optimal strategy with\na bounded counter for any \\epsilon>0. We also show how to decide in polynomial\ntime if we can construct an optimal finite-state system (i.e., a system without\na counter) for a given specification.\n  We have implemented our approach in a tool that takes qualitative and\nquantitative specifications and automatically constructs a system that\nsatisfies the qualitative specification and optimizes the quantitative\nspecification, if such a system exists.
