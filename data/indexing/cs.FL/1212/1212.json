Moreover, a characterization of sofic tree\nshifts in terms of general Rabin automata is given.\n  We present an algorithm for establishing whether two unrestricted Rabin\nautomata accept the same sofic tree shift or not. This allows us to prove the\ndecidability of the surjectivity problem for cellular automata between sofic\ntree shifts. We also prove the decidability of the injectivity problem for\ncellular automata defined on a tree shift of finite type.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Dec 2012 18:53:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 14:14:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 22:29:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ceccherini-Silberstein", "Tullio", ""], ["Coornaert", "Michel", ""], ["Fiorenzi", "Francesca", ""], ["Sunic", "Zoran", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6183", "submitter": "Xiaojie Deng", "authors": "Xiaojie Deng, Yu Zhang, Yuxin Deng, and Farong Zhong", "title": "The Buffered \\pi-Calculus: A Model for Concurrent Languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Message-passing based concurrent languages are widely used in developing\nlarge distributed and coordination systems.

A cost function associates to each input a\nnon-negative integer value (or infinity), as opposed to languages which only\nassociate to each input the two values \"inside\" and \"outside\". This theory is a\ncontinuation of the works on distance automata and similar models. These models\nof automata have been successfully used for solving the star-height problem,\nthe finite power property, the finite substitution problem, the relative\ninclusion star-height problem and the boundedness problem for monadic-second\norder logic over words. Our notion of regularity can be -- as in the classical\ntheory of regular languages -- equivalently defined in terms of automata,\nexpressions, algebraic recognisability, and by a variant of the monadic\nsecond-order logic. These equivalences are strict extensions of the\ncorresponding classical results. The present paper introduces the cost monadic\nlogic, the quantitative extension to the notion of monadic second-order logic\nwe use, and show that some problems of existence of bounds are decidable for\nthis logic. This is achieved by introducing the corresponding algebraic\nformalism: stabilisation monoids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2012 18:13:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2013 09:14:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 16:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Colcombet", "Thomas", "", "Liafa/CNRS/Universit\u00e9 Denis Diderot"]]}]
