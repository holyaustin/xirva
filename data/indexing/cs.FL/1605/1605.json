In\nMapReduce, the reducer produces an output from a list of inputs. Due to the\nscheduling policy of the platform, the inputs may arrive at the reducers in\ndifferent order. The commutativity problem of reducers asks if the output of a\nreducer is independent of the order of its inputs. Although the problem is\nundecidable in general, the MapReduce programs in practice are usually used for\ndata analytics and thus require very simple control flow. By exploiting the\nsimplicity, we propose a programming language for reducers where the\ncommutativity problem is decidable. The main idea of the reducer language is to\nseparate the control and data flow of programs and disallow arithmetic\noperations in the control flow. The decision procedure for the commutativity\nproblem is obtained through a reduction to the equivalence problem of streaming\nnumerical transducers (SNTs), a novel automata model over infinite alphabets\nintroduced in this paper. The design of SNTs is inspired by streaming\ntransducers (Alur and Cerny, POPL 2011). Nevertheless, the two models are\nintrinsically different since the outputs of SNTs are integers while those of\nstreaming transducers are data words. The decidability of the equivalence of\nSNTs is achieved with an involved combinatorial analysis of the evolvement of\nthe values of the integer variables during the runs of SNTs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 May 2016 05:53:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2016 07:07:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 05:56:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yu-Fang", ""], ["Song", "Lei", ""], ["Wu", "Zhilin", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01530", "submitter": "Akim Demaille", "authors": "Akim Demaille", "title": "Derived-term Automata for Extended Weighted Rational Expressions", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an algorithm to build an automaton from a rational expression.\nThis approach introduces support for extended weighted expressions.

For binary operations we use\narguments with different alphabets when appropriate; this leads to higher tight\nupper bounds than those obtained with equal alphabets. We exhibit most complex\nprefix-convex languages that meet the complexity bounds for all the measures\nlisted above.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 May 2016 20:19:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 17:56:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 18:25:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Brzozowski", "Janusz", ""], ["Sinnamon", "Corwin", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.07061", "submitter": "Stefan Kiefer", "authors": "Dmitry Chistikov, Stefan Kiefer, Ines Maru\\v{s}i\\'c, Mahsa\n  Shirmohammadi, James Worrell", "title": "On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization", "comments": "Full version of an ICALP'16 paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.CC cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of decomposing a given\nnonnegative $n \\times m$ matrix $M$ into a product of a nonnegative $n \\times\nd$ matrix $W$ and a nonnegative $d \\times m$ matrix $H$. Restricted NMF\nrequires in addition that the column spaces of $M$ and $W$ coincide. Finding\nthe minimal inner dimension $d$ is known to be NP-hard, both for NMF and\nrestricted NMF. We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a question\nabout the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal\n1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz's question negatively, thus\nfalsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigate\nwhether a rational matrix $M$ always has a restricted NMF of minimal inner\ndimension whose factors $W$ and $H$ are also rational.
