In discrete event systems theory, two concurrent systems are\nsaid to be in conflict if they can get trapped in a situation where they are\nboth waiting or running endlessly, forever unable to complete their common\ntask. The conflict preorder is a process-algebraic pre-congruence that compares\ntwo processes based on their possible conflicts in combination with other\nprocesses. This paper improves on previous theoretical descriptions of the\nconflict preorder by introducing less conflicting pairs as a concrete\nstate-based characterisation. Based on this characterisation, an effective\nalgorithm is presented to determine whether two processes are related according\nto the conflict preorder.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2011 03:58:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ware", "Simon", ""], ["Malik", "Robi", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0232", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Jos\\'e Proen\\c{c}a (KUL), Dave Clarke (KUL), Erik de Vink (TUE),\n  Farhad Arbab (CWI)", "title": "Decoupled execution of synchronous coordination models via behavioural\n  automata", "comments": "In Proceedings FOCLASA 2011, arXiv:1107.5847", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 58, 2011, pp. 65-79", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.58.5", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.LO cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Synchronous coordination systems allow the exchange of data by logically\nindivisible actions involving all coordinated entities.
