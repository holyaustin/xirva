We prove that it is decidable whether a given k-automatic sequence is\noverlap-free (or squareefree, or cubefree, etc.) We prove that the\nlexicographically least sequence in the orbit closure of a k-automatic sequence\nis k-automatic, and use this last result to show that several related\nquantities, such as the critical exponent, irrationality measure, and\nrecurrence quotient for Sturmian words with slope alpha, have automatic\ncontinued fraction expansions if alpha does.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2008 13:13:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2008 18:37:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 Jan 2009 20:16:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Allouche", "Jean-Paul", ""], ["Rampersad", "Narad", ""], ["Shallit", "Jeffrey", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.1928", "submitter": "Jeffrey Shallit", "authors": "Janusz Brzozowski, Jeffrey Shallit, and Zhi Xu", "title": "Decision Problems For Convex Languages", "comments": "preliminary version.

In the\ncase that a regular language is not convex, we prove tight upper bounds on the\nlength of the shortest words demonstrating this fact, in terms of the number of\nstates of an accepting DFA. Similar results are proved for some subclasses of\nconvex languages: the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-closed languages,\nand the prefix-, suffix-, factor-, and subword-free languages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Aug 2008 01:50:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 17:15:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Brzozowski", "Janusz", ""], ["Shallit", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Xu", "Zhi", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2417", "submitter": "Jeffrey Shallit", "authors": "Jui-Yi Kao, Narad Rampersad, and Jeffrey Shallit", "title": "On NFAs Where All States are Final, Initial, or Both", "comments": "submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine questions involving nondeterministic finite automata where all\nstates are final, initial, or both initial and final.
