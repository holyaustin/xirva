The best known algorithm for 3-color parity games solves a game with n\nvertices in $ O(n^{2}\\sqrt{n}) $ time. We improve on this result by presenting\na new algorithm, based on simple attractor constructions, which only needs time\n$ O(n^2) $. As a result, we match the best known running times for solving\n(co)-B\\\"uchi games, showing that 3-color parity games are not harder to solve\nin general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 15:38:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 07:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Klein", "Felix", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5512", "submitter": "Tara Brough", "authors": "Tara Brough, Laura Ciobanu and Murray Elder", "title": "Permutations of context-free and indexed languages", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the cyclic closure of a language, and its generalisation to the\noperators $C^k$ introduced by Brandst\\\"adt.

The\nresults are applied to make several improvements in the area.\n  We improve the best general upper bound for reset thresholds of finite prefix\ncodes (Huffman codes): we show that an $n$-state synchronizing decoder has a\nreset word of length at most $O(n \\log^3 n)$. In addition to that, we prove\nthat the expected reset threshold of a uniformly random synchronizing binary\n$n$-state decoder is at most $O(n \\log n)$.
