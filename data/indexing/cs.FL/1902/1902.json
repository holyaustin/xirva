All such\nhierarchies are built through the same construction process: start from an\ninitial class of languages and build new levels using two generic operations.\nConcatenation hierarchies have gathered a lot of interest since the 70s, thanks\nto an alternate logical definition: each concatenation hierarchy is the\nquantification alternation hierarchy within a variant of first-order logic over\nwords.\n  Our goal is to understand such hierarchies. We look at two decision problems:\nmembership and separation. For a class of languages C, C-separation takes two\nregular languages as input and asks whether there exists a third one in C\nincluding the first one and disjoint from the second one. Settling whether\nseparation is decidable for the levels within a given concatenation hierarchy\nis among the most fundamental and challenging questions in formal language\ntheory. In all prominent cases, it is open, or answered positively for low\nlevels only. Recently, a breakthrough was made using a generic approach for a\nspecific kind of hierarchy: those with a finite basis. In this case, separation\nis always decidable for levels 1/2, 1 and 3/2.\n  Our main theorem is similar but independent: we consider hierarchies with\npossibly infinite bases, but that may only contain group languages. An example\nis the quantifier alternation hierarchy of first-order logic with modular\npredicates: its basis consists of languages counting the length of words modulo\nsome number. Using a generic approach, we show that for any such hierarchy, if\nseparation is decidable for the basis, then it is decidable for levels up to\n3/2.

We\nbegin by constructing PEGs with unexpected behaviour, and surprising new\nexamples of languages with PEGs, including the language of palindromes whose\nlength is a power of two, and a binary-counting language. We then propose a new\ncomputational model, the scaffolding automaton, and prove that it exactly\ncharacterises the computational power of parsing expression grammars (PEGs).\n  Using this characterisation we show that:\n  (*) PEGs have unexpected power and semantics. We present several PEGs with\nsurprising behaviour, and languages which, unexpectedly, have PEGs, including a\nPEG for the language of palindromes whose length is a power of two.\n  (*) PEGs are computationally `universal', in the following sense: take any\ncomputable function $f:\\{0,1\\}^\\ast\\to \\{0,1\\}^\\ast$; then there exists a\ncomputable function $g: \\{0,1\\}^\\ast \\to \\mathbb{N}$ such that $\\{ f(x)\n\\#^{g(x)} x \\mid x \\in \\{0,1\\}^\\ast \\}$ has a PEG.\n  (*) There can be no pumping lemma for PEGs. There is no total computable\nfunction $A$ with the following property: for every well-formed PEG $G$, there\nexists $n_0$ such that for every string $x \\in \\mathcal{L}(G)$ of size $|x| \\ge\nn_0$, the output $y = A(G, x)$ is in $\\mathcal{L}(G)$ and has $|y| > |x|$.\n  (*) PEGs are strongly non real-time for Turing machines. There exists a\nlanguage with a PEG, such that neither it nor its reverse can be recognised by\nany multi-tape online Turing machine which is allowed to do only $o(n/\\log n)$\nsteps after reading each input symbol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2019 21:25:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2020 12:43:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Loff", "Bruno", ""], ["Moreira", "Nelma", ""], ["Reis", "Rog\u00e9rio", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09407", "submitter": "Paul Bell", "authors": "Paul C.
