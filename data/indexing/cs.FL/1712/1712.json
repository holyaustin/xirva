This field has been\ntraditionally approached from a practical point of view, resulting in\nheterogeneous implementations with fundamentally different capabilities. The\nmain reason behind this is that defining formal semantics for a CER language is\nnot trivial: they usually combine first-order variables for joining and\nfiltering events with regular operators like sequencing and Kleene closure.\nMoreover, their semantics usually focus only on the detection of complex\nevents, leaving the concept of output mostly unattended.\n  In this paper, we propose to unify the semantics and output of complex event\nrecognition languages by using second order objects. Specifically, we introduce\na CER language called Second Order Complex Event Logic (SO-CEL for short), that\nuses second order variables for managing and outputting sequences of events.\nThis makes the definition of the main CER operators simple, allowing us to\ndevelop the first steps in understanding its expressive power. We start by\ncomparing SO-CEL with a version that uses first-order variables called FO-CEL,\nshowing that they are equivalent in expressive power when restricted to unary\npredicates but, surprisingly, incomparable in general. Nevertheless, we show\nthat if we restrict to sets of binary predicates, then SO-CEL is strictly more\nexpressive than FO-CEL. Then, we introduce a natural computational model called\nUnary Complex Event Automata (UCEA) that provides a better understanding of\nSO-CEL. We show that, under unary predicates, SO-CEL captures the subclass of\nUCEA that satisfy the so-called *-property. Finally, we identify the operations\nthat SO-CEL is lacking to capture UCEA and introduce a natural extension of the\nlanguage that captures the complete class of UCEA under unary predicates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 13:33:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Grez", "Alejandro", ""], ["Riveros", "Cristian", ""], ["Ugarte", "Martin", ""], ["Vansummeren", "Stijn", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.03759", "submitter": "Ale\\v{s} Bizjak", "authors": "Dietrich Kuske, Jiamou Liu, and Anastasia Moskvina", "title": "Infinite and Bi-infinite Words with Decidable Monadic Theories", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 14, Issue 3 (August\n  21, 2018) lmcs:4767", "doi": "10.23638/LMCS-14(3:9)2018", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study word structures of the form $(D,<,P)$ where $D$ is either\n$\\mathbb{N}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}$, $<$ is the natural linear ordering on $D$ and\n$P\\subseteq D$ is a predicate on $D$.

First, we show that\nit is undecidable to check whether the group generated by a given invertible\nautomaton has a positive relation, i.e. a relation p = 1 such that p only\ncontains positive generators. Besides its obvious relation to the freeness of\nthe group, the absence of positive relations has previously been studied and is\nconnected to the triviality of some stabilizers of the boundary.
