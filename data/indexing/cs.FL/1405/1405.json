Second, despite of the existing quadratic gap between Las Vegas\nrealtime probabilistic automata and one-way deterministic automata for language\nrecognition, we show that, by turning to promise problems, the tight gap\nbecomes exponential. Last, we show that the situation is different for one-way\nprobabilistic automata with two-sided bounded-error. We present a family of\nunary promise problems that is very easy for these machines; solvable with only\ntwo states, but the number of states in two-way alternating or any simpler\nautomata is not limited by a constant.
