Hromkovi\\v{c}, Acta\nInformatica 19 (1983) 377-384), and it has been shown that this new one-way\nQFAs (multi-letter QFAs) can accept with no error some regular languages\n$(a+b)^{*}b$ that are unacceptable by the previous one-way QFAs. In this paper,\nwe study the decidability of the equivalence of multi-letter QFAs, and the main\ntechnical contributions are as follows: (1) We show that any two automata, a\n$k_{1}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_1$ and a $k_{2}$-letter QFA ${\\cal A}_2$, over the\nsame input alphabet $\\Sigma$ are equivalent if and only if they are\n$(n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k)$-equivalent, where $m=|\\Sigma|$ is the cardinality of\n$\\Sigma$, $k=\\max(k_{1},k_{2})$, and $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$, with $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$\nbeing the numbers of states of ${\\cal A}_{1}$ and ${\\cal A}_{2}$, respectively.\nWhen $k=1$, we obtain the decidability of equivalence of measure-once QFAs in\nthe literature. It is worth mentioning that our technical method is essentially\ndifferent from that for the decidability of the case of single input alphabet\n(i.e., $m=1$). (2) However, if we determine the equivalence of multi-letter\nQFAs by checking all strings of length not more than $ n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+k$,\nthen the worst time complexity is exponential, i.e.,\n$O(n^6m^{n^2m^{k-1}-m^{k-1}+2k-1})$. Therefore, we design a polynomial-time\n$O(m^{2k-1}n^{8}+km^kn^{6})$ algorithm for determining the equivalence of any\ntwo multi-letter QFAs. Here, the time complexity is concerning the number of\nstates in the multi-letter QFAs, and $k$ is thought of as a constant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 00:53:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Jan 2009 03:06:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 19:47:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2009 13:42:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 19 Oct 2010 02:21:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 24 Oct 2010 10:05:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Qiu", "Daowen", ""], ["Zou", "Xiangfu", ""], ["Li", "Lvzhou", ""], ["Mateus", "Paulo", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2466", "submitter": "Jeffrey Shallit", "authors": "Yu-Hin Au, Aaron Robertson, Jeffrey Shallit", "title": "Van der Waerden's Theorem and Avoidability in Words", "comments": "Co-author added; new results", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pirillo and Varricchio, and independently, Halbeisen and Hungerbuhler\nconsidered the following problem, open since 1994: Does there exist an infinite\nword w over a finite subset of Z such that w contains no two consecutive blocks\nof the same length and sum?
