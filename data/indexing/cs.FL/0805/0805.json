The article considers\nalternating automata on data trees that can move downward and rightward, and\nhave one register for storing data. The main results are that nonemptiness over\nfinite data trees is decidable but not primitive recursive, and that\nnonemptiness of safety automata is decidable but not elementary. The proofs use\nnondeterministic tree automata with faulty counters. Allowing upward moves,\nleftward moves, or two registers, each causes undecidability. As corollaries,\ndecidability is obtained for two data-sensitive fragments of the XPath query\nlanguage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 May 2008 00:12:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2009 13:21:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Mar 2010 15:20:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 14:13:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Jurdzinski", "Marcin", ""], ["Lazic", "Ranko", ""]]}]
