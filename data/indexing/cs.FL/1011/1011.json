In this style, instead of waiting\nfor time-consuming operations to complete, the programmer makes a non-blocking\ncall to the operation and posts a callback task to a task buffer that is\nexecuted later when the time-consuming operation completes. A co-operative\nscheduler mediates the interaction by picking and executing callback tasks from\nthe task buffer to completion (and these callbacks can post further callbacks\nto be executed later). Writing correct asynchronous programs is hard because\nthe use of callbacks, while efficient, obscures program control flow.\n  We provide a formal model underlying asynchronous programs and study\nverification problems for this model. We show that the safety verification\nproblem for finite-data asynchronous programs is expspace-complete. We show\nthat liveness verification for finite-data asynchronous programs is decidable\nand polynomial-time equivalent to Petri Net reachability.

The\nreduction allows the use of algorithmic techniques on Petri Nets to the\nverification of asynchronous programs.\n  We also study several extensions to the basic models of asynchronous programs\nthat are inspired by additional capabilities provided by implementations of\nasynchronous libraries, and classify the decidability and undecidability of\nverification questions on these extensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Nov 2010 09:36:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 16:20:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2011 20:23:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ganty", "Pierre", ""], ["Majumdar", "Rupak", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1030", "submitter": "Dai Tri Man Le", "authors": "Dai Tri Man Le", "title": "On Three Alternative Characterizations of Combined Traces", "comments": "22 pages, preliminary version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The combined trace (i.e., comtrace) notion was introduced by Janicki and\nKoutny in 1995 as a generalization of the Mazurkiewicz trace notion.

As a consequence\nof our encodability results, we get that many calculi equipped with priority\nare not replacement free and hence are not encodable into mainstream calculi\nlike CCS and pi-calculus, that instead are strongly replacement free.
