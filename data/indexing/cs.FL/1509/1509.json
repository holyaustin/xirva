An important\ntype of repeated sequences common in the human genome are tandem repeats, where\nidentical copies appear next to each other. For example, in the sequence\n$AGTC\\underline{TGTG}C$, $TGTG$ is a tandem repeat, that may be generated from\n$AGTCTGC$ by a tandem duplication of length $2$.

In particular, based on a celebrated\nresult by Axel Thue from 1906, presenting a construction for ternary\nsquare-free sequences, we show that for alphabets of size 4 or larger, bounded\ntandem duplication systems, regardless of the seed and the bound on duplication\nlength, are not fully expressive, i.e. they cannot generate all strings even as\nsubstrings of other strings. Note that the alphabet of size 4 is of particular\ninterest as it pertains to the genomic alphabet. Building on this result, we\nalso show that these systems do not have full capacity.

The\nsmallest number of edges in a rectifier network computing $M$ is a classic\ncomplexity measure on matrices, which has been studied for more than half a\ncentury.\n  We explore two well-known techniques that have hitherto found little to no\napplications in this theory. Both of them build on a basic fact that depth-$2$\nrectifier networks are essentially weighted coverings of Boolean matrices with\nrectangles. We obtain new results by using fractional and greedy coverings\n(defined in the standard way).\n  First, we show that all fractional coverings of the so-called full triangular\nmatrix have cost at least $n\\log n$. This provides (a fortiori) a new proof of\nthe tight lower bound on its depth-$2$ complexity (the exact value has been\nknown since 1965, but previous proofs are based on different arguments).\nSecond, we show that the greedy heuristic is instrumental in tightening the\nupper bound on the depth-$2$ complexity of the Kneser-Sierpi\\'nski\n(disjointness) matrix. The previous upper bound is $O(n^{1.28})$, and we\nimprove it to $O(n^{1.17})$, while the best known lower bound is\n$\\Omega(n^{1.16})$. Third, using fractional coverings, we obtain a form of\ndirect product theorem that gives a lower bound on unbounded-depth complexity\nof Kronecker (tensor) products of matrices. In this case, the greedy heuristic\nshows (by an argument due to Lov\\'asz) that our result is only a logarithmic\nfactor away from the \"full\" direct product theorem.
