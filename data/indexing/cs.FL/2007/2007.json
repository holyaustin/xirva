In an effort to understand its dynamics, and since Generalised\nCollatz Maps are known to simulate Turing Machines [Conway, 1972], it seems\nnatural to ask what kinds of algorithmic behaviours it embeds. We define a\nquasi-cellular automaton that exactly simulates the Collatz process on the\nsquare grid: on input $x\\in\\mathbb{N}$, written horizontally in base 2,\nsuccessive rows give the Collatz sequence of $x$ in base 2. We show that\nvertical columns simultaneously iterate the map in base 3.
