Elements of this semigroup are\nclasses of equivalent words. A natural way to solve the word problem is to\nselect a unique \"canonical\" representative for each equivalence class. We prove\nthat overlap-free words and so-called almost overlap-free words (this notion is\nsome generalization of the notion of overlap-free words) can serve as canonical\nrepresentatives for corresponding equivalence classes. We show that such a word\nin a given class, if any, can be efficiently found. As a result, we construct a\nlinear-time algorithm that partially solves the word problem for the semigroup\nunder consideration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Feb 2011 19:45:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Plyushchenko", "A.

Here we use the conjunction of these two concepts as a powerful\ntool in the study of equivalence between fuzzy automata. We prove that a\nuniform fuzzy relation between fuzzy automata $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ is a\nforward bisimulation if and only if its kernel and co-kernel are forward\nbisimulation fuzzy equivalences on $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ and there is a special\nisomorphism between factor fuzzy automata with respect to these fuzzy\nequivalences. As a consequence we get that fuzzy automata $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$\nare UFB-equivalent, i.e., there is a uniform forward bisimulation between them,\nif and only if there is a special isomorphism between the factor fuzzy automata\nof $\\cal A$ and $\\cal B$ with respect to their greatest forward bisimulation\nfuzzy equivalences. This result reduces the problem of testing UFB-equivalence\nto the problem of testing isomorphism of fuzzy automata, which is closely\nrelated to the well-known graph isomorphism problem. We prove some similar\nresults for backward-forward bisimulations, and we point to fundamental\ndifferences. Because of the duality with the studied concepts, backward and\nforward-backward bisimulations are not considered separately. Finally, we give\na comprehensive overview of various concepts on deterministic,\nnondeterministic, fuzzy, and weighted automata, which are related to\nbisimulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 21:37:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 May 2011 20:11:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["\u0106iri\u0107", "Miroslav", ""], ["Ignjatovi\u0107", "Jelena", ""], ["Damljanovi\u0107", "Nada", ""], ["Ba\u0161i\u0107", "Milan", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5682", "submitter": "Artur Je\\.z", "authors": "Pawe{\\l} Gawrychowski, Artur Je\\.z, Andreas Maletti", "title": "On minimising automata with errors", "comments": "12 pages plus 19-page appendix, submitted to a conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of k-minimisation for a DFA M is the computation of a smallest\nDFA N (where the size |M| of a DFA M is the size of the domain of the\ntransition function) such that their recognized languages differ only on words\nof length less than k.
