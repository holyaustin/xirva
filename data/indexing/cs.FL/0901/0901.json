However, this theorem applies only to\nstrictly simple configurations, where bars intersect only at their common\nendpoints. We generalize the theorem to self-touching configurations, where\nbars can touch but not properly cross. At the heart of our proof is a new\ndefinition of self-touching configurations of planar linkages, based on an\nannotated configuration space and limits of nontouching configurations. We show\nthat this definition is equivalent to the previously proposed definition of\nself-touching configurations, which is based on a combinatorial description of\noverlapping features. Using our new definition, we prove the generalized\nCarpenter's Rule Theorem using a topological argument. We believe that our\ntopological methodology provides a powerful tool for manipulating many kinds of\nself-touching objects, such as 3D hinged assemblies of polygons and rigid\norigami. In particular, we show how to apply our methodology to extend to\nself-touching configurations universal reconfigurability results for open\nchains with slender polygonal adornments, and single-vertex rigid origami with\nconvex cones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Jan 2009 21:25:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Abbott", "Timothy G.", ""], ["Demaine", "Erik D.", ""], ["Gassend", "Blaise", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1397", "submitter": "Mathieu Guay-Paquet", "authors": "Mathieu Guay-Paquet, Jeffrey Shallit", "title": "Avoiding Squares and Overlaps Over the Natural Numbers", "comments": "16 pages, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider avoiding squares and overlaps over the natural numbers, using a\ngreedy algorithm that chooses the least possible integer at each step; the word\ngenerated is lexicographically least among all such infinite words.
