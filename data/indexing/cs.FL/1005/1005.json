Both extensions are natural in the sense that over\nfinite words, they coincide with classical rankers and over infinite words,\nthey both have the full expressive power of FO2. Moreover, the first extension\nof rankers admits a characterization of the intersection of Sigma2 and FO2\nwhile the other leads to a characterization of the intersection of Pi2 and FO2.\nBoth versions of rankers yield characterizations of the fragment Delta2.
