The behavior of a featured transition system hence\ndepends on a given set of features. There are algorithms for featured\ntransition systems which can check their properties for all sets of features at\nonce, for example for LTL or CTL properties.\n  Here we introduce a model of featured weighted automata which combines\nfeatured transition systems and (semiring-) weighted automata. We show that\nmethods and techniques from weighted automata extend to featured weighted\nautomata and devise algorithms to compute quantitative properties of featured\nweighted automata for all sets of features at once. We show applications to\nminimum reachability and to energy properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 07:40:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 06:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Fahrenberg", "Uli", ""], ["Legay", "Axel", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07922", "submitter": "Florin Manea", "authors": "Joel D.
