The mathematical analysis\nunderlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest\ndo not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach.\nIn an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low\nautocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and\nVingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated\nk-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of\noccurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the\nwaiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing\nTF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting\nautocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the\naccuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to\nappear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0\nmodel; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly\nin terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens\nand Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the\nresults to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability\nthat a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves\nlinearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic\nbehaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the\npromoter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 10:03:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Behrens", "S.", ""], ["Nicaud", "C.", ""], ["Nicodeme", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.1841", "submitter": "Timo Jolivet", "authors": "Timo Jolivet and Jarkko Kari", "title": "Consistency of multidimensional combinatorial substitutions", "comments": "13 pages, v2 includes corrections to match the published version", "journal-ref": "Theoretical Computer Science 454 (2012), 178-188, short version in\n  CSR 2012, conference proceedings LNCS 7353, 205-216", "doi": "10.1016/j.tcs.2012.03.050", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.FL math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multidimensional combinatorial substitutions are rules that replace symbols\nby finite patterns of symbols in $\\mathbb Z^d$.
