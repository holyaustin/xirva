A\nnotorious one is controller synthesis, which can be rephrased through the\ngame-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of the system in a\ngame against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification,\noptimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use\n(possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which\nsettings allow for simple strategies.\n  In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of\npreference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game\nobjectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the\nlast fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community\ntoward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or\ninfinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers\nof the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal\nstrategies still elude us.\n  In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference\nrelations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory,\ngeneralizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We\nalso prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical\ninterest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory\nstrategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player\ngames. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the\nliterature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory\n(e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives),\nand paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded\nenergy objectives).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2020 09:27:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2020 09:20:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2020 06:43:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 07:29:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Bouyer", "Patricia", ""], ["Roux", "St\u00e9phane Le", ""], ["Oualhadj", "Youssouf", ""], ["Randour", "Mickael", ""], ["Vandenhove", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04249", "submitter": "Salman Haider", "authors": "Salman Haider, Dr. Syed Asad Raza Kazmi", "title": "An extended quantum process algebra (eQPAlg) approach for distributed\n  quantum systems", "comments": "4 figures, 16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL quant-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we have expounded the communication procedure of quantum\nsystems by means of process algebra.

Some groups, however, require much fewer vertices. For instance,\n$S_n$ itself can be embedded in the $n$-clique $K_n$, a connected graph with n\nvertices. In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar\ngenerating a finite permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded\nby three structural parameters of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of\nvertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. More precisely, we show that\nany permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ that can be embedded into a connected\ngraph with $m$ vertices, treewidth k, and maximum degree $\\Delta$, can also be\ngenerated by a context-free grammar of size $2^{O(k\\Delta\\log\\Delta)}\\cdot\nm^{O(k)}$. By combining our upper bound with a connection between the extension\ncomplexity of a permutation group and the grammar complexity of a formal\nlanguage, we also get that these permutation groups can be represented by\npolytopes of extension complexity $2^{O(k \\Delta\\log \\Delta)}\\cdot m^{O(k)}$.\nThe above upper bounds can be used to provide trade-offs between the index of\npermutation groups, and the number of vertices, treewidth and maximum degree of\nconnected graphs embedding these groups. In particular, by combining our main\nresult with a celebrated $2^{\\Omega(n)}$ lower bound on the grammar complexity\nof the symmetric group $S_n$ we have that connected graphs of treewidth\n$o(n/\\log n)$ and maximum degree $o(n/\\log n)$ embedding subgroups of $S_n$ of\nindex $2^{cn}$ for some small constant $c$ must have $n^{\\omega(1)}$ vertices.\nThis lower bound can be improved to exponential on graphs of treewidth\n$n^{\\varepsilon}$ for $\\varepsilon<1$ and maximum degree $o(n/\\log n)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 22:31:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Jaffke", "Lars", ""], ["Oliveira", "Mateus de Oliveira", ""], ["Tiwary", "Hans Raj", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.05786", "submitter": "Gerco van Heerdt", "authors": "Gerco van Heerdt, Tobias Kapp\\'e, Jurriaan Rot, Matteo Sammartino,\n  Alexandra Silva", "title": "A Categorical Framework for Learning Generalised Tree Automata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Automata learning is a popular technique used to automatically construct an\nautomaton model from queries.
