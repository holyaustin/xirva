Udpda are a simple computation model that\naccept exactly the unary regular languages, but can be exponentially more\nsuccinct than finite-state automata. We complete the complexity landscape for\nudpda by showing that emptiness (and thus universality) is P-hard, equivalence\nand compressed membership problems are P-complete, and inclusion is\ncoNP-complete. Our upper bounds are based on a translation theorem between\nudpda and straight-line programs over the binary alphabet (SLPs). We show that\nthe characteristic sequence of any udpda can be represented as a pair of\nSLPs---one for the prefix, one for the lasso---that have size linear in the\nsize of the udpda and can be computed in polynomial time. Hence, decision\nproblems on udpda are reduced to decision problems on SLPs. Conversely, any SLP\ncan be converted in logarithmic space into a udpda, and this forms the basis\nfor our lower bound proofs. We show coNP-hardness of the ordered matching\nproblem for SLPs, from which we derive coNP-hardness for inclusion. In\naddition, we complete the complexity landscape for unary nondeterministic\npushdown automata by showing that the universality problem is $\\Pi_2 \\mathrm\nP$-hard, using a new class of integer expressions. Our techniques have\napplications beyond udpda. We show that our results imply $\\Pi_2 \\mathrm\nP$-completeness for a natural fragment of Presburger arithmetic and coNP lower\nbounds for compressed matching problems with one-character wildcards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 18:19:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chistikov", "Dmitry", ""], ["Majumdar", "Rupak", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0952", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Oded Maler (CNRS-VERIMAG)", "title": "Algorithmic Verification of Continuous and Hybrid Systems", "comments": "In Proceedings INFINITY 2013, arXiv:1402.6610", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 140, 2014, pp. 48-69", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.140.4", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SY cs.FL cs.LO cs.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a tutorial introduction to reachability computation, a class of\ncomputational techniques that exports verification technology toward continuous\nand hybrid systems.

The most natural\nchoice for such a distance is the one that measures the maximal difference that\ncan be observed comparing two SMMs with respect to their probability of\nsatisfying an arbitrary specification. We show that computing this metric is\nNP-hard. In addition, we show that any algorithm that approximates the distance\nwithin a certain absolute error, depending on the size of the SMMs, is NP-hard.\nNevertheless, we introduce an alternative distance, based on the Kantorovich\nmetric, that is an over-approximation of the former and we show that, under\nmild assumptions on the residence time distributions, it can be computed in\npolynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 16:40:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 15:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bacci", "Giorgio", ""], ["Bacci", "Giovanni", ""], ["Larsen", "Kim G.", ""], ["Mardare", "Radu", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6060", "submitter": "Alexey Sorokin", "authors": "Alexey Sorokin", "title": "Monoid automata for displacement context-free languages", "comments": "Revised version for ESSLLI Student Session 2013 selected papers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In 2007 Kambites presented an algebraic interpretation of\nChomsky-Sch\u007futzenberger theorem for context-free languages.
