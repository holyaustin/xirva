Also\nthe halting problem has three variants: does a given program halt on the empty\ninput, does a given program halt when given itself as its input, or does a\ngiven program halt on a given input. The failure rate of a tester for some size\nis the proportion of hard instances among all instances of that size.

Both models\nare based on concepts originating in the theory of formal languages, and they\nare able to capture the notions of causality and simultaneity of atomic actions\nwhich take place during the process of a system's operation. The aim of this\npaper is a transfer to the domain of comtraces and developing of some\nfundamental notions, which proved to be successful in the theory of traces. In\nparticular, we introduce and then apply the notion of indivisible steps, the\nlexicographical canonical form of comtraces, as well as the representation of a\ncomtrace utilising its linear projections to binary action subalphabets. We\nalso provide two algorithms related to the new notions. Using them, one can\nsolve, in an efficient way, the problem of step sequence equivalence in the\ncontext of comtraces. One may view our results as a first step towards the\ndevelopment of infinite combined traces, as well as recognisable languages of\ncombined traces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 19:00:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Aug 2013 08:02:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2013 18:46:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mikulski", "Lukasz", "", "Nicolaus Copernicus University"]]}, {"id": "1307.7443", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Shibashis Guha (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi), Shankara\n  Narayanan Krishna (Indian Institute of Technology Bombay), Chinmay Narayan\n  (Indian Institute of Technology Delhi), S.

Our method is also generic and can be used\nto decide several timed relations. We also present a game characterization for\nthese timed relations and show that the game hierarchy reflects the hierarchy\nof the timed relations. One can obtain an infinite game hierarchy and thus the\ngame characterization further indicates the possibility of defining new timed\nrelations which have not been studied yet. The game characterization also helps\nus to come up with a formula which encodes the separation between two states\nthat are not timed bisimilar. Such distinguishing formulae can also be\ngenerated for many relations other than timed bisimilarity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 02:10:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Guha", "Shibashis", "", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], ["Krishna", "Shankara Narayanan", "", "Indian Institute of Technology Bombay"], ["Narayan", "Chinmay", "", "Indian Institute of Technology Delhi"], ["Arun-Kumar", "S.", "", "Indian Institute of\n  Technology Delhi"]]}, {"id": "1307.7994", "submitter": "Thomas Kahl", "authors": "Thomas Kahl", "title": "The homology graph of a higher dimensional automaton", "comments": "The preliminaries section is taken from arXiv:1303.2003v1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AT cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Higher dimensional automata, i.e. labelled precubical sets, model concurrent\nsystems.
