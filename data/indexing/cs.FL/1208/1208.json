Many solutions to this problem\nhave been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and\nemploying a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper\nwe describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the\ninevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful\ninformation. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary\nsemiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives\nus information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not\ndiverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,\npolynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful\nin the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,\ninformation about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,\ndiverge is exactly what we want.\n  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging\nautomaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and\nwhich employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for\ndiverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging\npower series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by\nintroducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z\nx N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another\nKleene Theorem. We conclude by describing how bidiverging automata are applied\nto simulate biinfinite quantum systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2012 06:00:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 15:29:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Crosswhite", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0713", "submitter": "J\\\"urgen Koslowski", "authors": "Manfred Kufleitner (Institut f), Pascal Weil (LaBRI, Universit\\'e de\n  Bordeaux and CNRS)", "title": "On logical hierarchies within FO^2-definable languages", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0904.2894", "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 8, Issue 3 (August 14,\n  2012) lmcs:1212", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-8(3:11)2012", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the class of languages defined in the 2-variable fragment of the\nfirst-order logic of the linear order.

Already the\nmodelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal\nverification.\n  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring\non a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,\ncalled asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime\nverification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or\nvery complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.\nTherefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property\non the underlying system at runtime.\n  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as\nasynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the\nsame kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.\nA distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we\npropose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows\nthat if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of\ninfinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable\nunions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable.

The classification of\ncancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become\ncommon in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and\nnot as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here\naims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification\nof progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.),\nclassification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated\n(individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a\nphenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the\nbiochemistry of the underlying natural progression. Rather, it abstractly\nmodels transition timings between states as well as the effects of drugs and\nclinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the\nprogression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is\nultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller\nsynthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be\ngenerated automatically.

The\nexistence of such a hierarchy for m-state deterministic pushdown automata is\nleft open.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2012 15:38:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Masopust", "Tom\u00e1\u0161", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5129", "submitter": "Luc Segoufin", "authors": "Miko{\\l}aj Boja\\'nczyk (University of Warsaw), Luc Segoufin (INRIA),\n  Howard Straubing (Boston college)", "title": "Piecewise testable tree languages", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Logical Methods in Computer Science, Volume 8, Issue 3 (September\n  29, 2012) lmcs:1216", "doi": "10.2168/LMCS-8(3:26)2012", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a decidable characterization of tree languages that can\nbe defined by a boolean combination of Sigma_1 sentences.
