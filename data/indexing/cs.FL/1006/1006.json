The\nmonitorability of an omega-regular language, L, is thus a property that holds,\nif for any finite word u, observed so far, it is possible to add another finite\nword v, such that uv becomes a \"finite witness\" wrt. L; that is, for any\ninfinite word w, we have that uvw \\in L, or for any infinite word w, we have\nthat uvw \\not\\in L. This notion has been studied in the past by several\nauthors, and it is known that the class of monitorable languages is strictly\nmore expressive than, e.g., the commonly used class of so-called safety\nlanguages. But an exact categorisation of monitorable languages has, so far,\nbeen missing. Motivated by the use of linear-time temporal logic (LTL) in many\napproaches to runtime verification, this paper first determines the complexity\nof the monitorability problem when L is given by an LTL formula.
