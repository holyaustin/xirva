This semigroup is isomorphic to the transition semigroup of the\nminimal deterministic finite automaton accepting the language, that is, to the\nsemigroup generated by transformations induced by non-empty words on the set of\nstates of the automaton. In this paper we search for the largest syntactic\nsemigroup of a star-free language having $n$ left quotients; equivalently, we\nlook for the largest transition semigroup of an aperiodic finite automaton with\n$n$ states.\n  We introduce two new aperiodic transition semigroups. The first is generated\nby transformations that change only one state; we call such transformations and\nresulting semigroups unitary. In particular, we study complete unitary\nsemigroups which have a special structure, and we show that each maximal\nunitary semigroup is complete. For $n \\ge 4$ there exists a complete unitary\nsemigroup that is larger than any aperiodic semigroup known to date.\n  We then present even larger aperiodic semigroups, generated by\ntransformations that map a non-empty subset of states to a single state; we\ncall such transformations and semigroups semiconstant. In particular, we\nexamine semiconstant tree semigroups which have a structure based on full\nbinary trees. The semiconstant tree semigroups are at present the best\ncandidates for largest aperiodic semigroups.\n  We also prove that $2^n-1$ is an upper bound on the state complexity of\nreversal of star-free languages, and resolve an open problem about a special\ncase of state complexity of concatenation of star-free languages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 15:17:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2014 01:11:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Brzozowski", "Janusz", ""], ["Szyku\u0142a", "Marek", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0359", "submitter": "Andrew Winslow", "authors": "Benjamin Hescott, Caleb Malchik, Andrew Winslow", "title": "Tight Bounds for Active Self-Assembly Using an Insertion Primitive", "comments": "To appear in Algorithmica.

Utterance\nverification in this work implies the ability to determine when portions of a\nhypothesized word string correspond to incorrectly decoded vocabulary words or\nout-of-vocabulary words that may appear in an utterance. This capability is\nimplemented here as a likelihood ratio (LR). There are two UV techniques that\nare presented here. The first is voice verification along with the vocabulary\ntesting, at the same time the parameters for UV models are generated based on\nthe optimization criterion which is directly related to the LR measure. The\nsecond technique is a pitch recognition based on weighted finite-state\ntransducers. These transducers provide a common and natural representation for\nmajor components of speech recognition systems, including hidden Markov models\n(HMMs), context-dependency models, pronunciation dictionaries, statistical\ngrammars, and word or phone lattices. The finite state machine processes the\nacoustic parameters of UV models. The results of an experimental study\npresented in the paper shows that LR based parameter estimation results in a\nsignificant improvement in UV performance for this task. The study also found\nthat the use of the LR based weighted finite-state transducers along with the\nUV, can provide as much as an 11% improvement in UV performance when compared\nto existing UV procedures. Finally, it was also found that the performance of\nthe finite state machine was highly dependent on the use of the LR criterion in\ntraining acoustic models. Several observations are made in the paper concerning\nthe formation of confidence measures for UV and the interaction of these\ntechniques with statistical language models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 16:51:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Prasath", "M.
