Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they\nmake the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a\nwinning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an\nartefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates,\ni.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically\npreferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies.\nThese map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the\nplayer whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional\nstrategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for\nwhich a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still\nwon by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next\nmove. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of\nthe player's positions sparse.\n  Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest\nstrategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse\nstrategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some\nexhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In\nthis paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to\nobtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We\nconsider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT\n(satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear\nprogramming.

This stands in sharp contrast to the situation\nfor D0L words (purely morphic words), which are known to have at most quadratic\nsubword complexity, and for which the monadic theory is decidable.\n  The main result of our paper, leading to these answers, is that every\ncomputable word w over an alphabet Sigma can be embedded in a PD0L word u over\nan extended alphabet Gamma in the following two ways: (i) such that every\nfinite prefix of w is a subword of u, and (ii) such that w is obtained from u\nby erasing all letters from Gamma not in Sigma. The PD0L system generating such\na word u is constructed by encoding a Fractran program that computes the word\nw; Fractran is a programming language as powerful as Turing Machines.\n  As a consequence of (ii), if we allow the application of finite state\ntransducers to PD0L words, we obtain the set of all computable words. Thus the\nset of PD0L words is not closed under finite state transduction, whereas the\nset of D0L words is. It moreover follows that equality of PD0L words (given by\ntheir PD0L system) is undecidable.

This problem is solved thanks to an\napproximate determinization using a game approach. The algorithm performs an\nio-abstraction which preserves the tioco conformance relation and thus\nguarantees the soundness of generated test cases. A second problem is the\nselection of test cases from a TAIO specification. The selection here relies on\na precise description of timed behaviors to be tested which is carried out by\nexpressive test purposes modeled by a generalization of TAIOs. Finally, an\nalgorithm is described which generates test cases in the form of TAIOs equipped\nwith verdicts, using a symbolic co-reachability analysis guided by the test\npurpose. Properties of test cases are then analyzed with respect to the\nprecision of the approximate determinization: when determinization is exact,\nwhich is the case on known determinizable classes, in addition to soundness,\nproperties characterizing the adequacy of test cases verdicts are also\nguaranteed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jul 2012 13:33:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2012 13:27:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Oct 2012 19:55:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bertrand", "Nathalie", "", "INRIA Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique"], ["J\u00e9ron", "Thierry", "", "INRIA Rennes - Bretagne Atlantique"], ["Stainer", "Am\u00e9lie", "", "University of\n  Rennes 1"], ["Krichen", "Moez", "", "Institute of Computer Science and Multimedia, Sfax"]]}, {"id": "1207.6541", "submitter": "Vadim Zaytsev", "authors": "Vadim Zaytsev", "title": "Guided Grammar Convergence.
