Some\nstations have too many incoming bikes and get jammed without enough docks for\nupcoming bikes, while some other stations get empty quickly and lack enough\nbikes for people to check out.

However, most studies have focused on the\ncomplete information setting, wherein the manipulators know the votes of the\nnon-manipulators. While this assumption is reasonable for purposes of showing\nintractability, it is unrealistic for algorithmic considerations. In most\nreal-world scenarios, it is impractical for the manipulators to have accurate\nknowledge of all the other votes. In this paper, we investigate manipulation\nwith incomplete information. In our framework, the manipulators know a partial\norder for each voter that is consistent with the true preference of that voter.\nIn this setting, we formulate three natural computational notions of\nmanipulation, namely weak, opportunistic, and strong manipulation. We say that\nan extension of a partial order is if there exists a manipulative vote for that\nextension.\n  1. Weak Manipulation (WM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that makes\ntheir preferred candidate win in at least one extension of the partial votes of\nthe non-manipulators.\n  2. Opportunistic Manipulation (OM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way\nthat makes their preferred candidate win in every viable extension of the\npartial votes of the non-manipulators.\n  3. Strong Manipulation (SM): the manipulators seek to vote in a way that\nmakes their preferred candidate win in every extension of the partial votes of\nthe non-manipulators.\n  We consider several scenarios for which the traditional manipulation problems\nare easy (for instance, Borda with a single manipulator).

In this\npaper, we target privacy-sensitive users and provide them with fine-grained\ncontrol over tracking. Our working assumption is that some categories of web\npages (for example, related to health, religion, etc.) are more\nprivacy-sensitive to users than others (education, science, etc.).

As tracking is prevented by blocking network\nconnections of third-party domains, we avoid not only tracking but also\nthird-party ads. Since users will continue receiving ads on web pages belonging\nto non-sensitive categories, our approach essentially provides a trade-off\nbetween privacy and economy.
