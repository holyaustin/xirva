A central research theme is\nevaluation of the intensity of relations linking users and how they facilitate\ncommunication and the spread of information. These aspects of human\nrelationships have been studied extensively in the social sciences under the\nframework of the \"strength of weak ties\" theory proposed by Mark Granovetter.13\nSome research has considered whether that theory can be extended to online\nsocial networks like Facebook, suggesting interaction data can be used to\npredict the strength of ties. The approaches being used require handling\nuser-generated data that is often not publicly available due to privacy\nconcerns. Here, we propose an alternative definition of weak and strong ties\nthat requires knowledge of only the topology of the social network (such as who\nis a friend of whom on Facebook), relying on the fact that online social\nnetworks, or OSNs, tend to fragment into communities. We thus suggest\nclassifying as weak ties those edges linking individuals belonging to different\ncommunities and strong ties as those connecting users in the same community. We\ntested this definition on a large network representing part of the Facebook\nsocial graph and studied how weak and strong ties affect the\ninformation-diffusion process. Our findings suggest individuals in OSNs\nself-organize to create well-connected communities, while weak ties yield\ncohesion and optimize the coverage of information spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 17:56:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Nov 2014 12:49:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["De Meo", "Pasquale", ""], ["Ferrara", "Emilio", ""], ["Fiumara", "Giacomo", ""], ["Provetti", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1378", "submitter": "Ernesto Diaz-Aviles", "authors": "Ernesto Diaz-Aviles (1), Avar\\'e Stewart (1), Edward Velasco (2),\n  Kerstin Denecke (1), and Wolfgang Nejdl (1) ((1) L3S Research Center /\n  University of Hannover.
