The band played music\ntogether from 1965 to 1995 and is well known for concert performances\ncontaining extended improvisations and long and unique set lists. This article\npresents a comparative analysis between 1,590 of the Grateful Dead's concert\nset lists from 1972 to 1995 and 2,616,990 last.fm Grateful Dead listening\nevents from August 2005 to October 2007. While there is a strong correlation\nbetween how songs were played in concert and how they are listened to by\nlast.fm members, the outlying songs in this trend identify interesting aspects\nof the band and their fans 10 years after the band's dissolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2008 21:31:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Gintautas", "Vadas", ""], ["Pepe", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2743", "submitter": "Viviana Sica", "authors": "Bernardo Sorj", "title": "Information Societies and Digital Divides", "comments": "103 pages, ISBN 978-88-7699-127-1 (Printed edition), ISBN\n  978-88-7699-128-8 (Electronic edition), printed edition available at\n  http://www.amazon.com/ and http://stores.lulu.com/polimetrica", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The book argues ICT are part of the set of goods and services that determine\nquality of life, social inequality and the chances for economic development.\nTherefore understanding the digital divide demands a broader discussion of the\nplace of ICT within each society and in the international system. The author\nargues against the perspectives that either isolates ICT from other basic\nsocial goods (in particular education and employment) as well as those that\nargue that new technologies are luxury of a consumer society. Though the author\naccepts that new technologies are not a panacea for the problems of inequality,\naccess to them become a condition of full integration of social life. Using\nexamples mainly from Latin America, the work presents some general policy\nproposals on the fight against the digital divide which take in consideration\nother dimensions of social inequality and access to public goods.\n  Bernardo Sorj was born in Montevideo, Uruguay.

Examples of policies that are\nrelevant in the domain of the web address issues such as privacy of personal\ndata, accessibility for the disabled, user conduct, e-commerce, and\nintellectual property. Web site policies--and the overarching concept of web\nsite governance--are cross-cutting concerns that have to be addressed and\nimplemented at different levels (e.g., policy documents, legal statements,\nbusiness processes, contracts, auditing, and software systems). For web sites,\npolicies are also reflected in the legal statements that the web site posts,\nand in the behavior and features that the web site offers to its users. Both\npolicies and software tend to evolve independently, but at the same time they\nboth have to be kept in sync. This is a practical challenge for operators of\nweb sites that is poorly addressed right now and is, we believe, a promising\navenue for future research. In this paper, we discuss various challenges that\npolicy poses for web sites with an emphasis on privacy and data protection and\nidentify open issues for future research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 18:40:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kienle", "Holger M.", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Hausi A.", ""]]}]
