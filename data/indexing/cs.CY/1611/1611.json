Durability requires care and maintenance of individual\ncomponents and the links between them. Astronomy is an ideal domain in which to\nstudy knowledge infrastructures, due to its long history, transparency, and\naccumulation of observational data over a period of centuries. Research\nreported here draws upon a long-term study of scientific data practices to ask\nquestions about the durability and fragility of infrastructures for data in\nastronomy. Methods include interviews, ethnography, and document analysis. As\nastronomy has become a digital science, the community has invested in shared\ninstruments, data standards, digital archives, metadata and discovery services,\nand other relatively durable infrastructure components. Several features of\ndata practices in astronomy contribute to the fragility of that infrastructure.\nThese include different archiving practices between ground- and space-based\nmissions, between sky surveys and investigator-led projects, and between\nobservational and simulated data. Infrastructure components are tightly\ncoupled, based on international agreements. However, the durability of these\ninfrastructures relies on much invisible work - cataloging, metadata, and other\nlabor conducted by information professionals. Continual investments in care and\nmaintenance of the human and technical components of these infrastructures are\nnecessary for sustainability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:40:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Borgman", "Christine L.", ""], ["Darch", "Peter T.", ""], ["Sands", "Ashley E.", ""], ["Golshan", "Milena S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.00097", "submitter": "Gopal P.

Social media is now an indispensable mode of communication; online\ngaming is not only a genuine social activity but also a popular spectator\nsport. With support for anonymity and larger audiences, online interaction\nshrinks social and geographical barriers. Despite such benefits, social\ndisparities such as gender inequality persist in online social media. In\nparticular, online gaming communities have been criticized for persistent\ngender disparities and objectification. As gaming evolves into a social\nplatform, persistence of gender disparity is a pressing question. Yet, there\nare few large-scale, systematic studies of gender inequality and\nobjectification in social gaming platforms. Here we analyze more than one\nbillion chat messages from Twitch, a social game-streaming platform, to study\nhow the gender of streamers is associated with the nature of conversation.\nUsing a combination of computational text analysis methods, we show that\ngendered conversation and objectification is prevalent in chats. Female\nstreamers receive significantly more objectifying comments while male streamers\nreceive more game-related comments. This difference is more pronounced for\npopular streamers. There also exists a large number of users who post only on\nfemale or male streams. Employing a neural vector-space embedding (paragraph\nvector) method, we analyze gendered chat messages and create prediction models\nthat (i) identify the gender of streamers based on messages posted in the\nchannel and (ii) identify the gender a viewer prefers to watch based on their\nchat messages.

A problem with these\nmeasures is that they reflect actual usage at most indirectly. Indeed, analytic\ncompanies have suggested that retention rates, i.e., the number of days users\ncontinue to interact with an installed app are low. We conduct the first\nindependent and large-scale study of retention rates and usage behavior trends\nin the wild. We study their impact on a large-scale database of app-usage data\nfrom a community of 339,842 users and more than 213,667 apps. Our analysis\nshows that, on average, applications lose 70% of their users in the first week,\nwhile very popular applications (top 100) lose only 45%. It also reveals,\nhowever, that many applications have more complex usage behavior patterns due\nto seasonality, marketing, or other factors. To capture such effects, we\ndevelop a novel app-usage behavior trend measure which provides instantaneous\ninformation about the \"hotness\" of an application. We identify typical trends\nin app popularity and classify applications into archetypes. From these, we can\ndistinguish, for instance, trendsetters from copycat apps. In our results,\nroughly 40% of all apps never gain more than a handful of users. Less than 0.4%\nof the remaining 60% are constantly popular, 1% flop after an initial steep\nrise, and 7% continuously rise in popularity. We conclude by demonstrating that\nusage behavior trend information can be used to develop better mobile app\nrecommendations. With the proposed usage-based measures (retention and trend),\nwe are able to shift sovereignty in app recommendations back to where it really\nmatters: actual usage statistics, in contrast to download count and user\nratings which are prone to manipulation by people.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 11:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sigg", "Stephan", ""], ["Lagerspetz", "Eemil", ""], ["Peltonen", "Ella", ""], ["Nurmi", "Petteri", ""], ["Tarkoma", "Sasu", ""]]}]
