Predicting\nwhich newly-submitted items will become popular is critically important for\nboth hosts of social media content and its consumers. Accurate and timely\nprediction would enable hosts to maximize revenue through differential pricing\nfor access to content or ad placement. Prediction would also give consumers an\nimportant tool for filtering the ever-growing amount of content. Predicting\npopularity of content in social media, however, is challenging due to the\ncomplex interactions between content quality and how the social media site\nchooses to highlight content. Moreover, most social media sites also\nselectively present content that has been highly rated by similar users, whose\nsimilarity is indicated implicitly by their behavior or explicitly by links in\na social network. While these factors make it difficult to predict popularity\n\\emph{a priori}, we show that stochastic models of user behavior on these sites\nallows predicting popularity based on early user reactions to new content. By\nincorporating the various mechanisms through which web sites display content,\nsuch models improve on predictions based on simply extrapolating from the early\nvotes. Using data from one such site, the news aggregator Digg, we show how a\nstochastic model of user behavior distinguishes the effect of the increased\nvisibility due to the network from how interested users are in the content. We\nfind a wide range of interest, identifying stories primarily of interest to\nusers in the network (``niche interests'') from those of more general interest\nto the user community. This distinction is useful for predicting a story's\neventual popularity from users' early reactions to the story.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 19:01:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Hogg", "Tad", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1904", "submitter": "Ash Mohammad Abbas", "authors": "Ash Mohammad Abbas", "title": "Weighted Indices for Evaluating the Quality of Research with Multiple\n  Authorship", "comments": "12 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CY cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Devising an index to measure the quality of research is a challenging task.\nIn this paper, we propose a set of indices to evaluate the quality of research\nproduced by an author.

In\ncomparison to traditional learning, this type of learning relies on\nco-development, collective responsibility and co-operation. Learners are the\nprincipal actors of their learning. These trainings rest on rich and complex\norganizations, particularly for tutors, and it is difficult to apply innovative\neducational strategies.

The observed course concerns project management learning. Its\nobservation allows us (2) to highlight and to analyze the problems encountered\nby the actors (students, tutors, designers) and (3) to propose tools to solve\nor improve them.

We introduce a\nnormalized version of this metric and use it to study network structure,\nspecifically, to rank nodes and find community structure of the network.\nSpecifically, we extend the modularity-maximization method [Newman and Girvan,\n2004] for community detection to use this metric as the measure of node\nconnectivity. Normalized alpha-centrality is a powerful tool for network\nanalysis, since it contains a tunable parameter that sets the length scale of\ninteractions. By studying how rankings and discovered communities change when\nthis parameter is varied allows us to identify locally and globally important\nnodes and structures.
