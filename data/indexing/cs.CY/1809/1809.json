We\nconduct a survival analysis to identify likely dropouts. We then examine two\nclasses of features, social and behavioral, and apply a combination of modeling\nand feature-selection methods to identify the most relevant features to predict\nboth dropout and certification. We examine the utility of three different model\ntypes and we consider the impact of different definitions of dropout on the\npredictors. Finally, we assess the reliability of the models over time by\nevaluating whether or not models from week 1 can predict dropout in week 2, and\nso on. The outcomes of this study will help instructors identify students\nlikely to fail or dropout as soon as the first two weeks and provide them with\nmore support.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 20:39:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gitinabard", "Niki", ""], ["Khoshnevisan", "Farzaneh", ""], ["Lynch", "Collin F.", ""], ["Wang", "Elle Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.00103", "submitter": "Ian Lundberg", "authors": "Ian Lundberg, Arvind Narayanan, Karen Levy, Matthew J.

The approach is hence directly applicable to the analysis\nof multiple species collections, with labelling provided by crowd-sourced\ncollection. We evaluated the performance of the bird sound recognition system\non a realistic number of candidate classes, corresponding to real conditions.\nWe investigated the use of two canonical classification methods, chosen due to\ntheir widespread use and ease of interpretation, namely a k Nearest Neighbour\n(kNN) classifier with histogram-based features and a Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) with time-summarisation features. We further investigated the use of a\ncertainty measure, derived from the output probabilities of the classifiers, to\nenhance the interpretability and reliability of the class decisions. Our\nresults demonstrate that both identification methods achieved similar\nperformance, but we argue that the use of the kNN classifier offers somewhat\nmore flexibility.

The impact of Airbnb listings on\nlocal neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around\nthe world.

Instead, we follow a constructionist\napproach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and\ncollaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a\nCSCW research direction that is concerned with the role of digital technologies\nin the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of\nrepresentations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study,\nwe qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzk\\\"olln and\nCity West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing\ndescriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned\nplaces differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination\nmanagement organization (DMO).

In the neighborhood of Kreuzk\\\"olln, in\ncontrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food\nmarket as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to\nthe discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as\ntourist destinations.

First, every simple\nprediction function is strictly improvable: there exists a more complex\nprediction function that is both strictly more efficient and also strictly more\nequitable. Put another way, using a simple prediction function both reduces\nutility for disadvantaged groups and reduces overall welfare relative to other\noptions. Second, we show that simple prediction functions necessarily create\nincentives to use information about individuals' membership in a disadvantaged\ngroup --- incentives that weren't present before simplification, and that work\nagainst these individuals.

Our study shows that the validity of citation-based measures is being\ncompromised and their usefulness is lessening.

Citation-based metrics, such\ncitation number and h-index, are likewise affected by the flood of papers,\nself-citations, and lengthy reference lists. Measures such as a journal's\nimpact factor have also ceased to be good metrics due to the soaring numbers of\npapers that are published in top journals, particularly from the same pool of\nauthors.

The addressed sequence duration was in the range between 30 and 240\ntime-steps of indoor climate data, where the applied temporal discretization\nwas one minute. For that purpose, a deep neural network is trained to predict\nthe window states, where the input sequence duration is handled as an\nadditional hyperparameter. Eventually, the relationship between the prediction\naccuracy and the time-lag of the predicted window state in future is analyzed.\nThe results pointed out, that the optimal predictive performance was achieved\nfor the case where 60 time-steps of the indoor climate data were used as input.\nAdditionally, the results showed that very long sequences (120-240 time-steps)\ncould be addressed efficiently, given the right hyperprameters. Hence, the use\nof the memory over previous hours of high-resolution indoor climate data did\nnot improve the predictive performance, when compared to the case where 30/60\nminutes indoor sequences were used. The analysis of the prediction accuracy in\nthe form of F1 score for the different time-lag of future window states dropped\nfrom 0.51 to 0.27, when shifting the prediction target from 10 to 60 minutes in\nfuture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2018 11:31:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Markovic", "Romana", ""], ["Frisch", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["van Treeck", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10021", "submitter": "S.
