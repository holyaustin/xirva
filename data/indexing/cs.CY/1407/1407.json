Some people write their passwords down but these records can\neasily be lost or stolen. The option we explore is to find a way to cue\npasswords securely. The specific cueing technique we report on in this paper\nemploys images as cues. The idea is to elicit textual descriptions of the\nimages, which can then be used as passwords. We have defined a set of metrics\nfor the kind of image that could function effectively as a password cue. We\nidentified five candidate image types and ran an experiment to identify the\nimage class with the best performance in terms of the defined metrics.\n  The first experiment identified inkblot-type images as being superior. We\ntested this image, called a cueblot, in a real-life environment. We allowed\nusers to tailor their cueblot until they felt they could describe it, and they\nthen entered a description of the cueblot as their password. The cueblot was\ndisplayed at each subsequent authentication attempt to cue the password.\nUnfortunately, we found that users did not exploit the cueing potential of the\ncueblot, and while there were a few differences between textual descriptions of\ncueblots and non-cued passwords, they were not compelling. Hence our attempts\nto alleviate the difficulties people experience with passwords, by giving them\naccess to a tailored cue, did not have the desired effect. We have to conclude\nthat the password mechanism might well be unable to benefit from bolstering\nactivities such as this one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 11:37:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Aug 2014 09:34:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["McBryan", "Tony", ""], ["Renaud", "Karen", ""], ["Siebert", "J.

One way of helping\nthem could be by providing cues during the PIN entry process. The provision of\ncues that would only be helpful to the PIN owner is challenging because the cue\nshould only make sense to the legitimate user, and not to a random observer. In\nthis paper we report on an empirical study where we added colour to the PINpad\nto provide an implicit memory cue to PINpad users. We compared the impact of\ncolour PINpads as opposed to grey ones. As expected, the ability to recall a\nPIN deteriorated significantly over time irrespective of the type of PINpad\nused. However, there was ultimately no improvement in the ability to recall\nPINs when using colour PINpads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 11:50:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Renaud", "Karen", ""], ["Ramsay", "Judith", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8134", "submitter": "Rossano Schifanella", "authors": "Luca Maria Aiello, Martina Deplano, Rossano Schifanella, Giancarlo\n  Ruffo", "title": "People are Strange when you're a Stranger: Impact and Influence of Bots\n  on Social Networks", "comments": "10 pages, 9 figures, Proceedings of the 6th International AAAI\n  Conference on Weblogs and Social Media, Dublin, IR, 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bots are, for many Web and social media users, the source of many dangerous\nattacks or the carrier of unwanted messages, such as spam.

We contribute to shed light on this issue through an online social\nexperiment aimed to study to what extent a bot with no trust, no profile, and\nno aims to reproduce human behavior, can become popular and influential in a\nsocial media. Results show that a basic social probing activity can be used to\nacquire social relevance on the network and that the so-acquired popularity can\nbe effectively leveraged to drive users in their social connectivity choices.\nWe also register that our bot activity unveiled hidden social polarization\npatterns in the community and triggered an emotional response of individuals\nthat brings to light subtle privacy hazards perceived by the user base.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 17:29:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Aiello", "Luca Maria", ""], ["Deplano", "Martina", ""], ["Schifanella", "Rossano", ""], ["Ruffo", "Giancarlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8355", "submitter": "Waldir Moreira", "authors": "Waldir Moreira, Ronedo Ferreira, Douglas Cirqueira, Paulo Mendes and\n  Eduardo Cerqueira", "title": "SocialDTN: A DTN implementation for Digital and Social Inclusion", "comments": "3 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/2502880.2502892", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite of the importance of access to computers and to the Internet for the\ndevelopment of people and their inclusion in society, there are people that\nstill suffer with digital divide and social exclusion.\nDelay/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) can help the digital/social\ninclusion of these people as it allows opportunistic and asynchronous\ncommunication, which does not depend upon networking infrastructure.
