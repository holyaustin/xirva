Low levels of innovation, measured in terms\nof energy patent filings, were noted in the 1980s and 90s as an issue of\nconcern and were attributed to low investment in public and private research\nand development (R&D). Here we build a comprehensive global database of energy\npatents covering the period 1970-2009 which is unique in its temporal and\ngeographical scope. Analysis of the data reveals a recent, marked departure\nfrom historical trends. A sharp increase in rates of patenting has occurred\nover the last decade, particularly in renewable technologies, despite continued\nlow levels of R&D funding. To solve the puzzle of fast innovation despite\nmodest R&D increases we develop a model that explains the nonlinear response\nobserved in the empirical data of technological innovation to various types of\ninvestment. The model reveals a regular relationship between patents, R&D\nfunding, and growing markets across technologies, and accurately predicts\npatenting rates at different stages of technological maturity and market\ndevelopment. We show quantitatively how growing markets have formed a vital\ncomplement to public R&D in driving innovative activity; these two forms of\ninvestment have each leveraged the effect of the other in driving patenting\ntrends over long periods of time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 23:06:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bettencourt", "Luis M.
