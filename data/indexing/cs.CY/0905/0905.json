Here, we propose a model of\nindividual e-mail communication that is sufficiently rich to capture meaningful\nvariability across individuals, while remaining simple enough to be\ninterpretable. We show that the model, a cascading non-homogeneous Poisson\nprocess, can be formulated as a double-chain hidden Markov model, allowing us\nto use an efficient inference algorithm to estimate the model parameters from\nobserved data. We then apply this model to two e-mail data sets consisting of\n404 and 6,164 users, respectively, that were collected from two universities in\ndifferent countries and years. We find that the resulting best-estimate\nparameter distributions for both data sets are surprisingly similar, indicating\nthat at least some features of communication dynamics generalize beyond\nspecific contexts. We also find that variability of individual behavior over\ntime is significantly less than variability across the population, suggesting\nthat individuals can be classified into persistent \"types\". We conclude that\ncommunication patterns may prove useful as an additional class of attribute\ndata, complementing demographic and network data, for user classification and\noutlier detection--a point that we illustrate with an interpretable clustering\nof users based on their inferred model parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2009 15:37:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Malmgren", "R.

In a recent paper[1] we\nproposed a mathematical model that represents these structures as tripartite\nhypergraphs and defined basic topological quantities of interest. In this paper\nwe extend our model by defining additional quantities such as edge\ndistributions, vertex similarity and correlations as well as clustering. We\nthen empirically measure these quantities on two real life folksonomies, the\npopular online photo sharing site Flickr and the bookmarking site CiteULike. We\nfind that these systems share similar qualitative features with the majority of\ncomplex networks that have been previously studied.
