Consequently, they cannot rely solely\non themselves, but must cooperate by combining their advantages. To obtain the\nactual condition for this cooperation, a multi-layered network based on two\ndifferent types of data was investigated. The first type was transaction data\nfrom Japanese firms. The network created from the data included 961,363 firms\nand 7,808,760 links. The second type of data were from joint-patent\napplications in Japan. The joint-patent application network included 54,197\nnodes and 154,205 links. These two networks were merged into one network.\n  The first anaysis was based on input-output tables and three different tables\nwere compared. The correlation coefficients between tables revealed that\ntransactions were more strongly tied to joint-patent applications than the\ntotal amount of money. The total amount of money and transactions have few\nrelationships and these are probably connected to joint-patent applications in\ndifferent mechanisms. The second analysis was conducted based on the p* model.\nChoice, multiplicity, reciprocity, multi-reciprocity and transitivity\nconfigurations were evaluated. Multiplicity and reciprocity configurations were\nsignificant in all the analyzed industries. The results for multiplicity meant\nthat transactions and joint-patent application links were closely related.\nMulti-reciprocity and transitivity configurations were significant in some of\nthe analyzed industries. It was difficult to find any common characteristics in\nthe industries. Bayesian networks were used in the third analysis. The learned\nstructure revealed that if a transaction link between two firms is known, the\ncategories of firms' industries do not affect to the existence of a patent\nlink.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Sep 2010 07:32:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Inoue", "Hiroyasu", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4019", "submitter": "Andreas Kaltenbrunner", "authors": "Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon, Rafael E.
