First, we propose IE (Induced Edges), an\nefficient technique for estimating N from an independence sample of graph's\nnodes. IE exploits the edges induced on the sampled nodes. Second, we introduce\nSafetyMargin, a method that corrects estimators for dependence in RW samples.\nFinally, we combine these two stand-alone techniques to obtain a RW-based graph\nsize estimator. We evaluate our approach in simulations on a wide range of\nreal-life topologies, and on several samples of Facebook.

Using\ncurrent data protection legislation as point of departure we derive the\nfollowing eight privacy design strategies: minimise, hide, separate, aggregate,\ninform, control, enforce, and demonstrate. The strategies also provide a useful\nclassification of privacy design patterns and the underlying privacy enhancing\ntechnologies. We therefore believe that these privacy design strategies are not\nonly useful when designing privacy friendly systems, but also helpful when\nevaluating the privacy impact of existing IT systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2012 18:25:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 May 2013 06:35:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hoepman", "Jaap-Henk", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6800", "submitter": "Eric Buffenoir", "authors": "Eric Buffenoir and Isabelle Bourdon", "title": "Reconciling complex organizations and data management: the Panopticon\n  paradigm", "comments": "19 pages (including extended bibliography)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "L2C:12-186", "categories": "cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  These last years, main IT companies have build software solutions and change\nmanagement plans promoting data quality management within organizations\nconcerned by the enhancement of their business intelligence system.

As political discussion\nand activity increasingly moves online, the power of framing political\ndiscourses is shifting from mass media to social media. Continued examination\nof political interactions online is critical, and we extend this line of\nresearch by examining the activities of political users within the Wikipedia\ncommunity. First, we examined how users in Wikipedia choose to display (or not\nto display) their political affiliation. Next, we more closely examined the\npatterns of cross-party interaction and community participation among those\nusers proclaiming a political affiliation. In contrast to previous analyses of\nother social media, we did not find strong trends indicating a preference to\ninteract with members of the same political party within the Wikipedia\ncommunity. Our results indicate that users who proclaim their political\naffiliation within the community tend to proclaim their identity as a\n\"Wikipedian\" even more loudly. It seems that the shared identity of \"being\nWikipedian\" may be strong enough to triumph over other potentially divisive\nfacets of personal identity, such as political affiliation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 15:55:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 18:07:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 17:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Neff", "Jessica G.", ""], ["Laniado", "David", ""], ["Kappler", "Karolin", ""], ["Volkovich", "Yana", ""], ["Arag\u00f3n", "Pablo", ""], ["Kaltenbrunner", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.7047", "submitter": "Zhipeng Luo", "authors": "Daifeng Li, Zhipeng Luo, Golden Guo-zheng Sun, Jie Tang, Jingwei Zhang", "title": "User-level Weibo Recommendation incorporating Social Influence based on\n  Semi-Supervised Algorithm", "comments": "to be sumitted in JASIST", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Tencent Weibo, as one of the most popular micro-blogging services in China,\nhas attracted millions of users, producing 30-60 millions of weibo (similar as\ntweet in Twitter) daily.

In this paper, we propose a Factor Graph based\nweibo recommendation algorithm TSI-WR (Topic-Level Social Influence based Weibo\nRecommendation), which could help Tencent users to find most suitable\ninformation. The main innovation is that we consider both direct and indirect\nsocial influence from topic level based on social balance theory. The main\nadvantages of adopting this strategy are that it could first build a more\naccurate description of latent relationship between two users with weak\nconnections, which could help to solve the data sparsity problem; second\nprovide a more accurate recommendation for a certain user from a wider range.\nOther meaningful contextual information is also combined into our model, which\ninclude: Users profile, Users influence, Content of weibos, Topic information\nof weibos and etc. We also design a semi-supervised algorithm to further reduce\nthe influence of data sparisty.
