Although a number of\nstudies have examined supposed deviations from rationality by online users,\ntrue explanations for these behaviors may lie in factors not previously\naddressed in privacy concern constructs. In particular, privacy attitudes and\nbehavioral changes over time have not been examined within the context of an\nempirical study. This paper presents the results of an Agile, sprint-based\nlongitudinal study of Social Media users conducted over a two year period\nbetween April of 2009 and March of 2011. This study combined concepts drawn\nfrom Privacy Regulation Theory with the constructs of the Internet Users'\nInformation and Privacy Concern model to create a series of online surveys that\nexamined changes of Social Media privacy attitudes and self-reported behaviors\nover time. The main findings of this study are that, over a two year period\nbetween 2009 and 2011, respondents' privacy concerns and distrust of Social\nMedia Sites increased significantly, while their disclosure of personal\ninformation and willingness to connect with new online friends decreased\nsignificantly. Further qualitative interviews of selected respondents\nidentified these changes as emblematic of users developing ad-hoc risk\nmitigation strategies to address privacy threats.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 13:53:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Boyd", "Andrew W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5410", "submitter": "Alberto Pepe", "authors": "Alberto Pepe and Corinna di Gennaro", "title": "Political protest Italian-style: The dissonance between the blogosphere\n  and mainstream media in the promotion and coverage of Beppe Grillo's V-day", "comments": "30 pages; First Monday.

Launched by blogger Beppe Grillo, and\npromoted via a word of mouth mobilization on the Italian blogosphere, V-day\nbrought close to one million Italians in the streets on a single day, but was\nmostly ignored by mainstream media. This article is divided into two parts. In\nthe first part, we analyze the volume and content of online articles published\nby both bloggers and mainstream news sources from June 14 (the day V-day was\nannounced) until September 15, 2007 (one week after it took place) . We find\nthat the success of V-day can be attributed to the coverage of bloggers and\nsmall-scale local news outlets only, suggesting a strong grassroots component\nin the organization of the rally. We also find a dissonant thematic\nrelationship between content published by blogs and mainstream media: while the\nmajority of blogs analyzed promote V-day, major mainstream media sources\ncritique the methods of information production and dissemination employed by\nGrillo. Based on this finding, in the second part of the study, we explore the\nrole of Grillo in the organization of the rally from a network analysis\nperspective. We study the interlinking structure of the V-day blogosphere\nnetwork, to determine its structure, its levels of heterogeneity, and\nresilience. Our analysis contradicts the hypothesis that Grillo served as a\ntop-down, broadcast-like source of information. Rather, we find that\ninformation about V-day was transferred across heterogeneous nodes in a\nmoderately robust and resilient core network of blogs. We speculate that the\norganization of V-day represents the very first case, in Italian history, of a\npolitical demonstration developed and promoted primarily via the use of social\nmedia on the web.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2011 16:37:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pepe", "Alberto", ""], ["di Gennaro", "Corinna", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.6187", "submitter": "Li Chen", "authors": "Li Chen", "title": "Cook's Theory and the Twentieth Century Mathematics", "comments": "7 page 2 pictures.
