This gives rise to the need for scientific\ncommunities to adapt on shorter time scales than traditional university\ncurricula allow for, and therefore requires new modes of knowledge transfer.\nThe universal applicability of data science tools to a broad range of problems\nhas generated new opportunities to foster exchange of ideas and computational\nworkflows across disciplines. In recent years, hack weeks have emerged as an\neffective tool for fostering these exchanges by providing training in modern\ndata analysis workflows. While there are variations in hack week\nimplementation, all events consist of a common core of three components:\ntutorials in state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning and project work in a\ncollaborative environment. In this paper, we present the concept of a hack week\nin the larger context of scientific meetings and point out similarities and\ndifferences to traditional conferences. We motivate the need for such an event\nand present in detail its strengths and challenges. We find that hack weeks are\nsuccessful at cultivating collaboration and the exchange of knowledge.\nParticipants self-report that these events help them both in their day-to-day\nresearch as well as their careers. Based on our results, we conclude that hack\nweeks present an effective, easy-to-implement, fairly low-cost tool to\npositively impact data analysis literacy in academic disciplines, foster\ncollaboration and cultivate best practices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 18:07:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Huppenkothen", "Daniela", ""], ["Arendt", "Anthony", ""], ["Hogg", "David W.", ""], ["Ram", "Karthik", ""], ["VanderPlas", "Jake", ""], ["Rokem", "Ariel", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.00096", "submitter": "Ivan Pires", "authors": "Ivan Miguel Pires, Nuno M.

Second, the\npolarization in each country shows its own temporal dynamics in response to a\ndifferent set of factors. In Japan, structural factors such as the roles of the\nruling party and the opposition often dominate such dynamics, whereas the U.S.\nlegislature suffers from persistent ideological differences over particular\nissues between major political parties.

Coordination is useful across the\nspectrum of interpersonal communication -- from isolated individuals to\norganizational teams.

In this paper we focus on the looser interpersonal structures we\ncall active support networks (ASNs), and on technology that meets their needs.\nWe describe two needfinding investigations focused on social support, which\nexamined (a) four application areas for improving coordination in ASNs: (i)\nacademic coaching, (ii) vocational training, (iii) early learning intervention,\nand (iv) volunteer coordination; and (b) existing technology relevant to ASNs.\nWe find a thus-far unmet need for personal task management software that allows\nsmooth integration with an individual's active support network. Based on\nidentified needs, we then describe an open architecture for coordination that\nhas been developed into working software. The design includes a set of\ncapabilities we call \"social prompting,\" as well as templates for accomplishing\nmulti-task goals, and an engine that controls coordination in the network.

In this paper we train\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate poverty directly from high and\nmedium resolution satellite images. We use both Planet and Digital Globe\nimagery with spatial resolutions of 3-5 sq. m. and 50 sq. cm. respectively,\ncovering all 2 million sq. km. of Mexico.

Recurrent neural networks are a special class of\nneural networks that are particularly suitable to process time series data but,\nin their original formulation, cannot explicitly deal with missing data. In\nthis paper, we explore imputation strategies for handling missing values in\nclassifiers based on recurrent neural network (RNN) and apply a recently\nproposed recurrent architecture, the Gated Recurrent Unit with Decay,\nspecifically designed to handle missing data. We focus on the problem of\ndetecting surgical site infection in patients by analyzing time series of their\nblood sample measurements and we compare the results obtained with different\nRNN-based classifiers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Nov 2017 12:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Strauman", "Andreas Storvik", ""], ["Bianchi", "Filippo Maria", ""], ["Mikalsen", "Karl \u00d8yvind", ""], ["Kampffmeyer", "Michael", ""], ["Soguero-Ruiz", "Cristina", ""], ["Jenssen", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.06710", "submitter": "Ashkan Yousefpour", "authors": "Ashkan Yousefpour, Caleb Fung, Tam Nguyen, David Hong, Daniel Zhang", "title": "Instant Accident Reporting and Crowdsensed Road Condition Analytics for\n  Smart Cities", "comments": "8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to \"Communication Technology Changing\n  the World Competition\", Sponsored by IEEE Communication Society", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The following report contains information about a proposed technology by the\nauthors, which consists of a device that sits inside of a vehicle and\nconstantly monitors the car information.
