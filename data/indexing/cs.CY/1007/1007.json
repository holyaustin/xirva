Agencies and researchers who collect such\nsocial network data often have a compelling interest in allowing others to\nanalyze the data. In many cases the data describes relationships that are\nprivate and sharing the data in full can result in unacceptable disclosures.\nThus, preserving privacy without revealing sensitive information in the social\nnetwork is a serious concern. Recent developments for preserving privacy using\nanonymization techniques are focused on relational data only. Preserving\nprivacy in social networks against neighborhood attacks is an initiation which\nuses the definition of privacy called k-anonymity. k-anonymous social network\nstill may leak privacy under the cases of homogeneity and background knowledge\nattacks. To overcome, we find a place to use a new practical and efficient\ndefinition of privacy called ldiversity. In this paper, we take a step further\non preserving privacy in collaborative social network data with algorithms and\nanalyze the effect on the utility of the data for social network analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2010 04:57:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Prasad", "Ajay", ""], ["Panda", "G.

In the\ntransaction dynamics we take into account short range interactions as\ndiscussions between individuals and long range interactions to describe the\nattitude to the overall mood of society. The latter is handled by a uniformly\ndistributed parameter $\\alpha$, assigned randomly to each individual, as\nquenched personal bias. The network evolution dynamics is realized by rewiring\nthe societal network due to state variable changes as a result of transaction\ndynamics. The main consequence of this complex dynamics is that communities\nemerge in the social network for a range of values in the ratio between time\nscales. In this paper we focus our attention on the attitude parameter $\\alpha$\nand its influence on the conformation of opinion and the size of the resulting\ncommunities. We present numerical studies and extract interesting features of\nthe model that can be interpreted in terms of social behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 17:02:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 12:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["I\u00f1iguez", "Gerardo", ""], ["Barrio", "Rafael A.", ""], ["Kert\u00e9sz", "J\u00e1nos", ""], ["Kaski", "Kimmo K.", ""]]}]
