The proposed framework consists of the\nfollowing main components: a method to gather information about the members of\nthe social networks; methods to perform some semantic analysis of the Domain of\nInterest; a procedure to infer members' interests; and an interests evolution\ntheory to predict how the interests propagate in the network. As a result, one\nachieves an analytic tool to measure individual features, such as members'\nsusceptibilities and authorities. Although the approach applies to any type of\nsocial network, here it is has been tested against the computer science\nresearch community.\n  The DBLP (Digital Bibliography and Library Project) database has been elected\nas test-case since it provides the most comprehensive list of scientific\nproduction in this field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 17:06:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["D'Agostino", "Gregorio", ""], ["D'Antonio", "Fulvio", ""], ["De Nicola", "Antonio", ""], ["Tucci", "Salvatore", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02134", "submitter": "Lesandro Ponciano", "authors": "Lesandro Ponciano and Francisco Brasileiro", "title": "Finding Volunteers' Engagement Profiles in Human Computation for Citizen\n  Science Projects", "comments": "3 tables, and 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Human Computation vol. 1, no. 2, pp. 245-264 (2014)", "doi": "10.15346/hc.v1i2.12", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Human computation is a computing approach that draws upon human cognitive\nabilities to solve computational tasks for which there are so far no\nsatisfactory fully automated solutions even when using the most advanced\ncomputing technologies available. Human computation for citizen science\nprojects consists in designing systems that allow large crowds of volunteers to\ncontribute to scientific research by executing human computation tasks.\nExamples of successful projects are Galaxy Zoo and FoldIt. A key feature of\nthis kind of project is its capacity to engage volunteers. An important\nrequirement for the proposal and evaluation of new engagement strategies is\nhaving a clear understanding of the typical engagement of the volunteers;\nhowever, even though several projects of this kind have already been completed,\nlittle is known about this issue. In this paper, we investigate the engagement\npattern of the volunteers in their interactions in human computation for\ncitizen science projects, how they differ among themselves in terms of\nengagement, and how those volunteer engagement features should be taken into\naccount for establishing the engagement encouragement strategies that should be\nbrought into play in a given project. To this end, we define four quantitative\nengagement metrics to measure different aspects of volunteer engagement, and\nuse data mining algorithms to identify the different volunteer profiles in\nterms of the engagement metrics. Our study is based on data collected from two\nprojects: Galaxy Zoo and The Milky Way Project. The results show that the\nvolunteers in such projects can be grouped into five distinct engagement\nprofiles that we label as follows: hardworking, spasmodic, persistent, lasting,\nand moderate.

Such information changes hands or\nownership as a normal part of eCommerce transactions, or through strategic\ndecisions that often includes the sale of users' information to other firms.\nThe key commercial value of users' personal information derives from the\nability of firms to identify consumers and charge them personalized prices for\ngoods and services they have previously used or may wish to use in the future.\nA look at present-day practices reveals that consumers' profile data is now\nconsidered as one of the most valuable assets owned by online businesses. In\nthis thesis, we argue the following: if consumers' private data is such a\nvaluable asset, should they not be entitled to commercially benefit from their\nasset as well? The scope of this thesis is on developing architecture for\nprivacy payoff as a means of rewarding consumers for sharing their personal\ninformation with online businesses. The architecture is a multi-agent system in\nwhich several agents employ various requirements for personal information\nvaluation and interaction capabilities that most users cannot do on their own.\nThe agents in the system bear the responsibility of working on behalf of\nconsumers to categorize their personal data objects, report to consumers on\nonline businesses' trustworthiness and reputation, determine the value of their\ncompensation using risk-based financial models, and, finally, negotiate for a\npayoff value in return for the dissemination of users' information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 15:41:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Yassine", "Abdulsalam", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05039", "submitter": "Yun Xiong", "authors": "Yangyong Zhu and Yun Xiong", "title": "Defining Data Science", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Data science is gaining more and more and widespread attention, but no\nconsensus viewpoint on what data science is has emerged.
