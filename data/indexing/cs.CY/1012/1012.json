Computer based testing systems are\nincreasingly adopted by universities. However, the implementation and\nmaintenance of such a system and its underlying item bank is a challenge for an\ninexperienced tutor. Therefore, this paper discusses the advantages and\ndisadvantages of Computer Adaptive Test (CAT) systems compared to Computer\nBased Test systems. Furthermore, a few item selection strategies are compared\nin order to overcome the item exposure drawback of such systems. The paper also\npresents our CAT system along its development steps.

Without\nlarge-scale data mining, progress in these areas seems hard or impossible.\nTherefore, a suitable, distributed data mining infrastructure and research\ncenters should be built in Europe. It also appears appropriate to build a\nnetwork of Crisis Observatories. They can be imagined as laboratories devoted\nto the gathering and processing of enormous volumes of data on both natural\nsystems such as the Earth and its ecosystem, as well as on human\ntechno-socio-economic systems, so as to gain early warnings of impending\nevents. Reality mining provides the chance to adapt more quickly and more\naccurately to changing situations. Further opportunities arise by individually\ncustomized services, which however should be provided in a privacy-respecting\nway. This requires the development of novel ICT (such as a self- organizing\nWeb), but most likely new legal regulations and suitable institutions as well.\nAs long as such regulations are lacking on a world-wide scale, it is in the\npublic interest that scientists explore what can be done with the huge data\navailable. Big data do have the potential to change or even threaten democratic\nsocieties. The same applies to sudden and large-scale failures of ICT systems.\nTherefore, dealing with data must be done with a large degree of responsibility\nand care. Self-interests of individuals, companies or institutions have limits,\nwhere the public interest is affected, and public interest is not a sufficient\njustification to violate human rights of individuals. Privacy is a high good,\nas confidentiality is, and damaging it would have serious side effects for\nsociety.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 12:48:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Dec 2010 12:32:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Jan 2011 17:06:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 24 Feb 2011 16:03:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 09:03:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Helbing", "Dirk", ""], ["Balietti", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2832", "submitter": "Lin Zhong", "authors": "Ahmad Rahmati and Lin Zhong", "title": "A Longitudinal Study of Non-Voice Mobile Phone Usage by Teens from an\n  Underserved Urban Community", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report a user study of over four months on the non-voice usage of mobile\nphones by teens from an underserved urban community in the USA where a\ncommunity-wide, open-access Wi-Fi network exists.

A major issue is\nthe definition of new frameworks for the exploration of the dynamics at play in\nreal dynamic networks. Here, we focus on scientific communities by analyzing\nthe \"social part\" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at\nidentifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions\namong individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific\ncommunities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time\ncommunities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as\nrepresentations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists'\nworks is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social\nobjects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the\npatterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of\nthe arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics.\nAs a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a\nwork in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between\nco-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most\nproficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how\nthese patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a\nselection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of\nindividuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order\nto advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and\nscientists working on them. The dataset is analyzed a) at a global level, e.g.\nthe network evolution, b) at the meso-level, e.g. communities emergence, and c)\nat a micro-level, e.g. nodes' aggregation patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Dec 2010 16:47:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Quattrociocchi", "Walter", ""], ["Amblard", "Frederic", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.4945", "submitter": "Nina Kochetkova Aleksandrovna", "authors": "Kochetkova Nina Alexandrovna", "title": "Experience in applying remote technology in the secondary education\n  institutions in Russia, located in rural areas (From the experience of\n  Podolsky municipal district schools)", "comments": "Published in the proceedings of the XXI International Conference \"New\n  Computer Technology in Educating\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article examines the experience of distance education technologies in\nPodolsky municipal district, Moscow region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Dec 2010 11:43:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Alexandrovna", "Kochetkova Nina", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5561", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Alex Gerdes (Open Universiteit Nederland), Bastiaan Heeren (Open\n  Universiteit Nederland), Johan Jeuring (Utrecht University)", "title": "Properties of Exercise Strategies", "comments": "In Proceedings IWS 2010, arXiv:1012.5337", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 44, 2010, pp. 21-34", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.44.2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mathematical learning environments give domain-specific and immediate\nfeedback to students solving a mathematical exercise.

The development of a\nless than trivial piece of software, irrespective of whether it be FOSS or\nproprietary, is a complex cooperative effort requiring the participation of\nmany (often thousands of) individuals. A subset of the participants always play\nthe role of leading system and subsystem designers, determining architecture\nand functionality; the rest of the people work \"underneath\" them in a logical,\nfunctional sense.
