Previous studies mainly model passenger flow\nas time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting\nbased on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach\nessentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each\nindividual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can\nhelp predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure\ncannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we\npropose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the\ngenerative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong\nregularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow\nfrom previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal\nstructure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel\nbehavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize\nthe causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework\nis evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that\nthe returning flow -- a single covariate -- can substantially and consistently\nimprove various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting,\nmulti-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the\nproposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most\npassengers come and return within the same day.

The spread of floodwaters in urban\nnetworks is a complex spatial-temporal phenomenon. This study presents a\nmathematical contagion model to describe the spatial-temporal spread and\nrecession process of flood waters in urban road networks. The evolution of\nfloods within networks can be captured based on three macroscopic\ncharacteristics-flood propagation rate ($\\beta$), flood incubation rate\n($\\alpha$), and recovery rate ($\\mu$)-in a system of ordinary differential\nequations analogous to the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model.\nWe integrated the flood contagion model with the network percolation process in\nwhich the probability of flooding of a road segment depends on the degree to\nwhich the nearby road segments are flooded. The application of the proposed\nmodel was verified using high-resolution historical data of road flooding in\nHarris County during Hurricane Harvey in 2017. The results show that the model\ncan monitor and predict the fraction of flooded roads over time. Additionally,\nthe proposed model can achieve $90\\%$ precision and recall for the spatial\nspread of the flooded roads at the majority of tested time intervals.

Both parts are\nfully owned and maintained by the community, as is the integration of the\nresults in the existing Wikipedia editions. This architecture will make more\nencyclopedic content available to more people in their own language, and at the\nsame time allow more people to contribute knowledge and reach more people with\ntheir contributions, no matter what their respective language backgrounds.\nAdditionally, Wikilambda will unlock a new type of knowledge asset people can\nshare in through the Wikimedia projects, functions, which will vastly expand\nwhat people can do with knowledge from Wikimedia, and provide a new venue to\ncollaborate and to engage the creativity of contributors from all around the\nworld.

In these\nmetropolises, criminal activity is much higher and violent than in either small\ncities or rural areas.

Mainstream studies analyse crime records\nthrough historical panel data or analysis of historical patterns combined with\necological factor and exploratory mapping.

To that end, we integrate multiple open data sources with\nmobile phone traces and compare how the different factors correlate with crime\nin diverse cities, namely Boston, Bogot\\'a, Los Angeles and Chicago. We find\nthat the combined use of socio-economic conditions, mobility information and\nphysical characteristics of the neighbourhood effectively explain the emergence\nof crime, and improve the performance of the traditional approaches.

First, we conducted a\nkeyword-based application search in the popular app stores. We followed the\naffinity diagram approach and clustered the found applications into nine\ngroups. Second, we randomly selected four apps from each group (36 apps in\ntotal) and conducted a heuristic evaluation. Finally, we selected the highest\ndownloaded app from each group and conducted user studies with 30 participants.\n  Results: We found 61% usability problems are catastrophe or major in nature\nfrom heuristic inspection. The most (21%) violated heuristic is aesthetic and\nminimalist design. The user studies revealed low System Usability Scale (SUS)\nscores for those apps that had a high number of usability problems based on the\nheuristic evaluation.

Capturing richer and more comprehensive information about drug-drug\ninteractions (DDI) is one of the key tasks in public health and drug\ndevelopment. Recently, several knowledge graph embedding approaches have\nreceived increasing attention in the DDI domain due to their capability of\nprojecting drugs and interactions into a low-dimensional feature space for\npredicting links and classifying triplets. However, existing methods only apply\na uniformly random mode to construct negative samples. As a consequence, these\nsamples are often too simplistic to train an effective model. In this paper, we\npropose a new knowledge graph embedding framework by introducing adversarial\nautoencoders (AAE) based on Wasserstein distances and Gumbel-Softmax relaxation\nfor drug-drug interactions tasks. In our framework, the autoencoder is employed\nto generate high-quality negative samples and the hidden vector of the\nautoencoder is regarded as a plausible drug candidate. Afterwards, the\ndiscriminator learns the embeddings of drugs and interactions based on both\npositive and negative triplets. Meanwhile, in order to solve vanishing gradient\nproblems on the discrete representation--an inherent flaw in traditional\ngenerative models--we utilize the Gumbel-Softmax relaxation and the Wasserstein\ndistance to train the embedding model steadily.

While the quality of antibody testing, the availability of vaccines, and\nthe likelihood of even attaining COVID-19 immunity continue to be researched,\nwe address the issues involved in providing tamper-proof and privacy-preserving\ncertification for test results and vaccinations. Methods: We developed a\nprototype mobile phone app and requisite decentralized server architecture that\nfacilitates instant verification of tamper-proof test results. Personally\nidentifiable information is only stored at the user's discretion, and the app\nallows the end-user selectively to present only the specific test result with\nno other personal information revealed. The architecture, designed for\nscalability, relies upon (a) the 2019 World Wide Web Consortium standard called\n'Verifiable Credentials', (b) Tim Berners-Lee's decentralized personal data\nplatform 'Solid', and (c) a Consortium Ethereum-based blockchain. Results: Our\nmobile phone app and decentralized server architecture enable the mixture of\nverifiability and privacy in a manner derived from public/private key pairs and\ndigital signatures, generalized to avoid restrictive ownership of sensitive\ndigital keys and/or data. Benchmark performance tests show it to scale linearly\nin the worst case, as significant processing is done locally on each app. For\nthe test certificate Holder, Issuer (e.g. healthcare staff, pharmacy) and\nVerifier (e.g. employer), it is 'just another app' which takes only minutes to\nuse. Conclusions: The app and decentralized server architecture offer a\nprototype proof of concept that is readily scalable, applicable generically,\nand in effect 'waiting in the wings' for the biological issues, plus key\nethical issues raised in the discussion section, to be resolved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 22:42:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2020 19:36:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 May 2020 20:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2020 18:42:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenstadt", "Marc", ""], ["Ramachandran", "Manoharan", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Niaz", ""], ["Third", "Allan", ""], ["Domingue", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.07401", "submitter": "David Solans", "authors": "David Solans, Battista Biggio, Carlos Castillo", "title": "Poisoning Attacks on Algorithmic Fairness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.CY stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Research in adversarial machine learning has shown how the performance of\nmachine learning models can be seriously compromised by injecting even a small\nfraction of poisoning points into the training data.

Three different sense-giving strategies could be identified:\nretweeting of local in-house outlets; bound amplification of messages of\nindividual to the organisation associated journalists; and open message\namplification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Apr 2020 09:37:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Marx", "Julian", ""], ["Mirbabaie", "Milad", ""], ["Ehnis", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.08571", "submitter": "Milad Mirbabaie", "authors": "Stefan Stieglitz, Tobias Brockmann, Milad Mirbabaie", "title": "How context impacts on media choice", "comments": "Conference: Proceedings of the 25th Australasian Conference on\n  Information Systems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The relevance of mobile working is steadily increasing.

To shed light on this issue, we introduce an operational definition of\necho chambers and perform a massive comparative analysis on more than 1B pieces\nof contents produced by 1M users on four social media platforms: Facebook,\nTwitter, Reddit, and Gab.

Our method quantifies the\nexistence of echo-chambers along two main dimensions: homophily in the\ninteraction networks and bias in the information diffusion toward likely-minded\npeers. We find peculiar differences across social media. Indeed, while Facebook\nand Twitter present clear-cut echo chambers in all the observed dataset, Reddit\nand Gab do not. Finally, we test the role of the social media platform on news\nconsumption by comparing Reddit and Facebook.

We then show how studying activity during bursts can provide a\npersonalized, medium-term analysis for a key question in online mental health\ncommunities: What characteristics of user activity lead some users to find\nsupport and help, while others fall short? Using two independent outcome\nmetrics, moments of cognitive change and self-reported changes in mood during a\nburst of activity, we identify two actionable features that can improve\noutcomes for users: persistence within bursts, and giving complex emotional\nsupport to others.

The value of negative reviews from higher-level\nconsumers is thus unexpectedly highlighted because of less emotionalization and\nless biased narration, while the longer-lasting characteristic of these\nconsumers' negative responses also stresses the need for more attention from\nsellers. Our results shed light on implementing distinguished proactive\nstrategies in different buyer groups to help mitigate the negative impact due\nto negative reviews.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 12:54:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Menghan", ""], ["Zhao", "Jichang", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.13569", "submitter": "Martino Trevisan Dr", "authors": "Thomas Favale, Francesca Soro, Martino Trevisan, Idilio Drago, Marco\n  Mellia", "title": "Campus Traffic and e-Learning during COVID-19 Pandemic", "comments": "Please cite this article as: Thomas Favale, Francesca Soro, Martino\n  Trevisan, Idilio Drago, Marco Mellia, Campus Traffic and e-Learning during\n  COVID-19 Pandemic, Computer Networks (2020), DOI:\n  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107290", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comnet.2020.107290", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The COVID-19 pandemic led to the adoption of severe measures to counteract\nthe spread of the infection.

People\nare more likely to perceive opinions than to intend them, and linguistic cues\nthat signal how an utterance is intended can differ from those that signal how\nit will be perceived. Further, this misalignment between intentions and\nperceptions can be linked to the future health of a conversation: when a\ncomment whose author intended to share a fact is misperceived as sharing an\nopinion, the subsequent conversation is more likely to derail into uncivil\nbehavior than when the comment is perceived as intended.

Recently, the offline causes that\ncontribute to online hate speech have received increasing attention. A\nrecurring question is whether the occurrence of extreme events offline\nsystematically triggers bursts of hate speech online, indicated by peaks in the\nvolume of hateful social media posts. Formally, this question translates into\nmeasuring the association between a sparse event series and a time series. We\npropose a novel statistical methodology to measure, test and visualize the\nsystematic association between rare events and peaks in a time series. In\ncontrast to previous methods for causal inference or independence tests on time\nseries, our approach focuses only on the timing of events and peaks, and no\nother distributional characteristics. We follow the framework of event\ncoincidence analysis (ECA) that was originally developed to correlate point\nprocesses. We formulate a discrete-time variant of ECA and derive all required\ndistributions to enable analyses of peaks in time series, with a special focus\non serial dependencies and peaks over multiple thresholds. The analysis gives\nrise to a novel visualization of the association via quantile-trigger rate\nplots. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by analyzing whether Islamist\nterrorist attacks in Western Europe and North America systematically trigger\nbursts of hate speech and counter-hate speech on Twitter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 12:47:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:15:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Scharw\u00e4chter", "Erik", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Emmanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14748", "submitter": "Sepehr Ghader", "authors": "Sepehr Ghader, Jun Zhao, Minha Lee, Weiyi Zhou, Guangchen Zhao, Lei\n  Zhang", "title": "Observed mobility behavior data reveal social distancing inertia", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The research team has utilized an integrated dataset, consisting of\nanonymized location data, COVID-19 case data, and census population\ninformation, to study the impact of COVID-19 on human mobility.

The\ntrends showed that as soon as COVID-19 cases were observed, the statistics\nstarted improving, regardless of government actions. This suggests that a\nportion of population who could and were willing to practice social distancing\nvoluntarily and naturally reacted to the emergence of COVID-19 cases. However,\nafter about two weeks, the statistics saturated and stopped improving, despite\nthe continuous rise in COVID-19 cases. The study suggests that there is a\nnatural behavior inertia toward social distancing, which puts a limit on the\nextent of improvement in the social-distancing-related statistics. The national\ndata showed that the inertia phenomenon is universal, happening in all the U.S.\nstates and for all the studied statistics.
