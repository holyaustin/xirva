A structured representation of\nthe disease reporting events is extracted from the raw text, and the events are\nthen aggregated to produce signals, which are intended to represent early\nwarnings against potential public health threats.\n  To public health officials, these warnings represent an overwhelming list of\n\"one-size-fits-all\" information for risk assessment. To reduce this overload,\ntwo techniques are proposed. First, filtering signals according to the user's\npreferences (e.g., location, disease, symptoms, etc.) helps reduce the\nundesired noise. Second, re-ranking the filtered signals, according to an\nindividual's feedback and annotation, allows a user-specific, prioritized\nranking of the most relevant warnings.\n  We introduce an approach that takes into account this two-step process of: 1)\nfiltering and 2) re-ranking the results of reporting signals. For this,\nCollaborative Filtering and Personalization are common techniques used to\nsupport users in dealing with the large amount of information that they face.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jan 2011 05:19:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Stewar", "Avar\u00e9", ""], ["Lage", "Ricardo", ""], ["Diaz-Aviles", "Ernesto", ""], ["Dolog", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1606", "submitter": "Jasni Mohamad Zain", "authors": "Jasni Mohamad Zain, Mengkar Tey, Yingsoon Goh", "title": "Probing a Self-Developed Aesthetics Measurement Application (SDA) in\n  Measuring Aesthetics of Mandarin Learning Web Page Interfaces", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security,\n  Vol. 8 No. 1 pp. 31-40 January 2008, ISSN 1738-7906", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article describes the accurateness of our application namely\nSelf-Developed Aesthetics Measurement Application (SDA) in measuring the\naesthetics aspect by comparing the results of our application and users'\nperceptions in measuring the aesthetics of the web page interfaces. For this\nresearch, the positions of objects, images element and texts element are\ndefined as objects in a web page interface. Mandarin learning web pages are\nused in this research. These learning web pages comprised of main pages,\nlearning pages and exercise pages, on the first author's E-portfolio web site.\nThe objects of the web pages were manipulated in order to produce the desired\naesthetic values. The six aesthetics related elements used are balance,\nequilibrium, symmetry, sequence, rhythm, as well as order and complexity.\nResults from the research showed that the ranking of the aesthetics values of\nthe web page interfaces measured of the users were congruent with the expected\nperceptions of our designed Mandarin learning web page interfaces (reported\nalso in [18]). Thus, it implies that the subjectivity of aesthetics can be\nmeasured in an objective manner. For further understanding on our effort in\ndoing aesthetics measurement, we discussed in details the object modelling used\nas well as the process in developing this application. We also explained the\nsteps on how to run our application. Additionally, the strength and the\nweakness of our SDA application shared in this paper suggest that there is\nstill room for the improvement for aesthetics measurement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Jan 2011 16:47:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zain", "Jasni Mohamad", ""], ["Tey", "Mengkar", ""], ["Goh", "Yingsoon", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1608", "submitter": "Jasni Mohamad Zain", "authors": "Jasni Mohamad Zain, Mengkar Tey, Yingsoon Goh", "title": "Does Aesthetics of Web Page Interface Matters to Mandarin Learning?", "comments": "9 pages, 1 figure, 9 tables", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Network Security,\n  Vol. 7 No. 8 pp. 43-51 August 2007, ISSN 1738-7906", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Aesthetics of web page refers to how attractive a web page is in which it\ncatches the attention of the user to read through the information.

It was also found that aesthetically pleasing\nlayouts of web page would motivate students in Mandarin learning The Mandarin\nLearning web pages were manipulated according to the desired aesthetic\nmeasurements. GUI aesthetic measuring method was used for this purpose. The\nAesthetics-Measurement Application (AMA) accomplished with six aesthetic\nmeasures was developed and used. On top of it, questionnaires were distributed\nto the users to gather information on the students' perceptions on the\naesthetic aspects and learning aspects. Respondents for this study were\nstudents taking Mandarin course level I at UiTM Terengganu. A significant\ncorrelation of the aesthetic aspect was found with its relevance to Mandarin\nlearning. In summary, aesthetics should not be ignored or overlooked in\ndesigning effective learning interfaces for educational purposes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Jan 2011 16:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zain", "Jasni Mohamad", ""], ["Tey", "Mengkar", ""], ["Goh", "Yingsoon", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.2985", "submitter": "Ash Mohammad Abbas", "authors": "Ash Mohammad Abbas", "title": "Resequencing: A Method for Conforming to Conventions for Sharing Credits\n  Among Multiple Authors", "comments": "3 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CY cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Devising an appropriate scheme that assigns the weights to share credits\namong multiple authors of a paper is a challenging task.
