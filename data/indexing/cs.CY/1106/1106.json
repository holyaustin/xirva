Characterizing these activities\nand categorizing associated user generated content is a challenging task. We\npresent a information-theoretic approach to classification of user activity on\nTwitter. We focus on tweets that contain embedded URLs and study their\ncollective `retweeting' dynamics. We identify two features, time-interval and\nuser entropy, which we use to classify retweeting activity. We achieve good\nseparation of different activities using just these two features and are able\nto categorize content based on the collective user response it generates.\n  We have identified five distinct categories of retweeting activity on\nTwitter: automatic/robotic activity, newsworthy information dissemination,\nadvertising and promotion, campaigns, and parasitic advertisement. In the\ncourse of our investigations, we have shown how Twitter can be exploited for\npromotional and spam-like activities. The content-independent, entropy-based\nactivity classification method is computationally efficient, scalable and\nrobust to sampling and missing data. It has many applications, including\nautomatic spam-detection, trend identification, trust management,\nuser-modeling, social search and content classification on online social media.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2011 00:13:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Surachawala", "Tawan", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0706", "submitter": "Dusko Pavlovic", "authors": "Dusko Pavlovic and Catherine Meadows", "title": "Actor-network procedures: Modeling multi-factor authentication, device\n  pairing, social interactions", "comments": "32 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables; journal submission; extended\n  references, added discussion", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.LO cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As computation spreads from computers to networks of computers, and migrates\ninto cyberspace, it ceases to be globally programmable, but it remains\nprogrammable indirectly: network computations cannot be controlled, but they\ncan be steered by local constraints on network nodes. The tasks of\n\"programming\" global behaviors through local constraints belong to the area of\nsecurity. The \"program particles\" that assure that a system of local\ninteractions leads towards some desired global goals are called security\nprotocols. As computation spreads beyond cyberspace, into physical and social\nspaces, new security tasks and problems arise. As networks are extended by\nphysical sensors and controllers, including the humans, and interlaced with\nsocial networks, the engineering concepts and techniques of computer security\nblend with the social processes of security. These new connectors for\ncomputational and social software require a new \"discipline of programming\" of\nglobal behaviors through local constraints. Since the new discipline seems to\nbe emerging from a combination of established models of security protocols with\nolder methods of procedural programming, we use the name procedures for these\nnew connectors, that generalize protocols. In the present paper we propose\nactor-networks as a formal model of computation in heterogenous networks of\ncomputers, humans and their devices; and we introduce Procedure Derivation\nLogic (PDL) as a framework for reasoning about security in actor-networks. On\nthe way, we survey the guiding ideas of Protocol Derivation Logic (also PDL)\nthat evolved through our work in security in last 10 years. Both formalisms are\ngeared towards graphic reasoning and tool support. We illustrate their workings\nby analysing a popular form of two-factor authentication, and a multi-channel\ndevice pairing procedure, devised for this occasion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2011 16:34:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:20:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pavlovic", "Dusko", ""], ["Meadows", "Catherine", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.1500", "submitter": "Mathieu Loiseau", "authors": "Mathieu Loiseau (LIDILEM, LSE), Anthippi Potolia (PLIDAM), Katerina\n  Zourou (LIDILEM, LCMI)", "title": "Communaut\\'es Web 2.0 d'apprenants de langue avec parcours\n  d'apprentissage : r\\^oles, p\\'edagogie et rapports au contenu", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EIAH 2011, Mons : Belgique (2011)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Among the various types of online language learner collective types, we\nanalyze in this contribution Web 2.0 communities featuring an explicit\nprogression.

The software\nprovided an automated password and credit card-stealing mechanism starting in\nJanuary 1995. Though the practice of tricking users in order to steal passwords\nor information possibly goes back to the earliest days of computer networking,\nAOHell's phishing system was the first automated tool made publicly available\nfor this purpose. The program influenced the creation of many other automated\nphishing systems that were made over a number of years. These tools were\navailable to amateurs who used them to engage in a countless number of phishing\nattacks. By the later part of the decade, the activity moved from AOL to other\nnetworks and eventually grew to involve professional criminals on the internet.\nWhat began as a scheme by rebellious teenagers to steal passwords evolved into\none of the top computer security threats affecting people, corporations, and\ngovernments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 12:17:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Rekouche", "Koceilah", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5100", "submitter": "Lin Zhong", "authors": "Ahmad Rahmati, Clayton Shepard, Chad Tossell, Mian Dong, Zhen Wang,\n  Lin Zhong, and Philip Kortum", "title": "Tales of 34 iPhone Users: How they change and why they are different", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Technical Report TR-2011-0624, Rice University", "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present results from a longitudinal study of 34 iPh-one 3GS users, called\nLiveLab.
