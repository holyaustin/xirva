We analyze Taobao, a Chinese consumer marketplace that is the\nworld's largest e-commerce website. What sets Taobao apart from its competitors\nis its integrated instant messaging tool, which buyers can use to ask sellers\nabout products or ask other buyers for advice. In our study, we focus on how an\nindividual's commercial transactions are embedded in their social graphs. By\nstudying triads and the directed closure process, we quantify the presence of\ninformation passing and gain insights into when different types of links form\nin the network.\n  Using seller ratings and review information, we then quantify a price of\ntrust. How much will a consumer pay for transaction with a trusted seller? We\nconclude by modeling this consumer choice problem: if a buyer wishes to\npurchase a particular product, how does (s)he decide which store to purchase it\nfrom? By analyzing the performance of various feature sets in an information\nretrieval setting, we demonstrate how the social graph factors into\nunderstanding consumer behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2011 20:03:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Stephen", ""], ["Wang", "Mengqiu", ""], ["Leskovec", "Jure", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.3913", "submitter": "Moritz Hardt", "authors": "Cynthia Dwork, Moritz Hardt, Toniann Pitassi, Omer Reingold, Rich\n  Zemel", "title": "Fairness Through Awareness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study fairness in classification, where individuals are classified, e.g.,\nadmitted to a university, and the goal is to prevent discrimination against\nindividuals based on their membership in some group, while maintaining utility\nfor the classifier (the university). The main conceptual contribution of this\npaper is a framework for fair classification comprising (1) a (hypothetical)\ntask-specific metric for determining the degree to which individuals are\nsimilar with respect to the classification task at hand; (2) an algorithm for\nmaximizing utility subject to the fairness constraint, that similar individuals\nare treated similarly. We also present an adaptation of our approach to achieve\nthe complementary goal of \"fair affirmative action,\" which guarantees\nstatistical parity (i.e., the demographics of the set of individuals receiving\nany classification are the same as the demographics of the underlying\npopulation), while treating similar individuals as similarly as possible.\nFinally, we discuss the relationship of fairness to privacy: when fairness\nimplies privacy, and how tools developed in the context of differential privacy\nmay be applied to fairness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Apr 2011 01:45:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2011 04:55:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Dwork", "Cynthia", ""], ["Hardt", "Moritz", ""], ["Pitassi", "Toniann", ""], ["Reingold", "Omer", ""], ["Zemel", "Rich", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4966", "submitter": "Jean Vincent Fonou Dombeu", "authors": "Jean Vincent Fonou Dombeu and Magda Huisman", "title": "Combining Ontology Development Methodologies and Semantic Web Platforms\n  for E-government Domain Ontology Development", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Web & Semantic Technology (IJWesT), Vol.\n  2, No. 2, April 2011", "doi": "10.5121/ijwest.2011.2202", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the key challenges in electronic government (e-government) is the\ndevelopment of systems that can be easily integrated and interoperated to\nprovide seamless services delivery to citizens. In recent years, Semantic Web\ntechnologies based on ontology have emerged as promising solutions to the above\nengineering problems. However, current research practicing semantic development\nin e-government does not focus on the application of available methodologies\nand platforms for developing government domain ontologies. Furthermore, only a\nfew of these researches provide detailed guidelines for developing semantic\nontology models from a government service domain. This research presents a case\nstudy combining an ontology building methodology and two state-of-the-art\nSemantic Web platforms namely Protege and Java Jena ontology API for semantic\nontology development in e-government. Firstly, a framework adopted from the\nUschold and King ontology building methodology is employed to build a domain\nontology describing the semantic content of a government service domain.\nThereafter, UML is used to semi-formally represent the domain ontology.\nFinally, Protege and Jena API are employed to create the Web Ontology Language\n(OWL) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) representations of the domain\nontology respectively to enable its computer processing. The study aims at: (1)\nproviding e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world\nwith detailed guidelines for practicing semantic content development in their\ne-government projects and (2), strengthening the adoption of semantic\ntechnologies in e-government. The study would also be of interest to novice\nSemantic Web developers who might used it as a starting point for further\ninvestigations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2011 16:55:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Dombeu", "Jean Vincent Fonou", ""], ["Huisman", "Magda", ""]]}]
