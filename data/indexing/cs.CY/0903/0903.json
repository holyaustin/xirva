If an entire nation's worth\nof ISPs apply common policies to Internet traffic, the global implications\ncould be significant. For instance, how many countries rely on China or Great\nBritain (known traffic censors) to transit their traffic? These kinds of\nquestions are surprisingly difficult to answer, as they require combining\ninformation collected at the prefix, Autonomous System, and country level, and\ngrappling with incomplete knowledge about the AS-level topology and routing\npolicies. In this paper we develop the first framework for country-level\nrouting analysis, which allows us to answer questions about the influence of\neach country on the flow of international traffic. Our results show that some\ncountries known for their national policies, such as Iran and China, have\nrelatively little effect on interdomain routing, while three countries (the\nUnited States, Great Britain, and Germany) are central to international\nreachability, and their policies thus have huge potential impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2009 18:38:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Karlin", "Josh", "", "University of New Mexico"], ["Forrest", "Stephanie", "", "University\n  of New Mexico and the Santa Fe Institute"], ["Rexford", "Jennifer", "", "Princeton\n  University"]]}]
