The main objective of the course was to introduce practical\nparallel programming tools and techniques for shared and distributed memory\nconcurrent systems. A unique aspect of the course was that Java was used as the\nprinciple programming language. The course was divided into three sections. The\nfirst section covered parallel programming techniques for shared memory systems\nthat include multicore and Symmetric Multi-Processor (SMP) systems. In this\nsection, Java threads was taught as a viable programming API for such systems.\nThe second section was dedicated to parallel programming tools meant for\ndistributed memory systems including clusters and network of computers. We used\nMPJ Express-a Java MPI library-for conducting programming assignments and lab\nwork for this section. The third and the final section covered advanced topics\nincluding the MapReduce programming model using Hadoop and the General Purpose\nComputing on Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 14:14:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shafi", "Aamir", ""], ["Akhtar", "Aleem", ""], ["Javed", "Ansar", ""], ["Carpenter", "Bryan", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0519", "submitter": "Maryam Nazaridoust", "authors": "Farshid Sahba and Maryam Nazaridoust", "title": "Museum Automation with RFID", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By increase of culture and knowledge of the people, request for visiting\nmuseums has increased and made the management of these places more complex.\nValuable things in a museum or ancient place must be maintained well and also\nit need to managing visitors.

This characterizes\nABMs as random walks on regular graphs. The non-trivial automorphisms of those\ngraphs make visible the dynamical symmetries that an ABM gives rise to because\nsets of micro configurations can be interchanged without changing the\nprobability structure of the random walk. This allows for a systematic\nloss-less reduction of the state space of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2014 08:01:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Banisch", "Sven", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6744", "submitter": "Kristina Lerman", "authors": "Tad Hogg and Kristina Lerman", "title": "Disentangling the Effects of Social Signals", "comments": "to appear in Human Computation Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.IR cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Peer recommendation is a crowdsourcing task that leverages the opinions of\nmany to identify interesting content online, such as news, images, or videos.\nPeer recommendation applications often use social signals, e.g., the number of\nprior recommendations, to guide people to the more interesting content. How\npeople react to social signals, in combination with content quality and its\npresentation order, determines the outcomes of peer recommendation, i.e., item\npopularity. Using Amazon Mechanical Turk, we experimentally measure the effects\nof social signals in peer recommendation. Specifically, after controlling for\nvariation due to item content and its position, we find that social signals\naffect item popularity about half as much as position and content do. These\neffects are somewhat correlated, so social signals exacerbate the \"rich get\nricher\" phenomenon, which results in a wider variance of popularity. Further,\nsocial signals change individual preferences, creating a \"herding\" effect that\nbiases people's judgments about the content. Despite this, we find that social\nsignals improve the efficiency of peer recommendation by reducing the effort\ndevoted to evaluating content while maintaining recommendation quality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 17:16:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 17:32:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Hogg", "Tad", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6915", "submitter": "Viktoras Veitas Mr.", "authors": "Viktoras Veitas and David Weinbaum (Weaver)", "title": "A World of Views: A World of Interacting Post-human Intelligences", "comments": "Preprint of a book chapter, 36 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What would a human hundreds or thousands times more intelligent than the\nbrightest human ever born be like?

The projects expose the students to various disciplines in\nComputer Science (embedded systems, algorithm design, networking), Electrical\nEngineering (circuit design, wireless communications, hardware prototyping),\nand Applied Physics (thin-film battery design, solar cell fabrication). While a\nstudent project is usually focused on one discipline area, it requires\ninteraction with at least two other areas. Over 5 years, 180 semester-long\nprojects have been completed. The students were a diverse group of high school,\nundergraduate, and M.S. Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical\nEngineering students. Some of the approaches that were taken to facilitate\nstudent learning are real-world system development constraints, regular\ncross-group meetings, and extensive involvement of Ph.D. students in student\nmentorship and knowledge transfer. To assess the approaches, a survey was\nconducted among the participating students. The results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the approaches. For example, 70% of the students surveyed\nindicated that working on their research project improved their ability to\nfunction on multidisciplinary teams more than coursework, internships, or any\nother activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 16:41:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Margolies", "Robert", ""], ["Gorlatova", "Maria", ""], ["Sarik", "John", ""], ["Kinget", "Peter", ""], ["Kymissis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Zussman", "Gil", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.7074", "submitter": "Oscar Beijbom Mr", "authors": "Oscar Beijbom", "title": "Random Sampling in an Age of Automation: Minimizing Expenditures through\n  Balanced Collection and Annotation", "comments": "PDF contains 9 pages of manuscript followed by 7 pages of\n  Supplementary Information", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.LG stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Methods for automated collection and annotation are changing the\ncost-structures of sampling surveys for a wide range of applications.
