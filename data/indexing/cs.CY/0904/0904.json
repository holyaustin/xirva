These\nmodels describe aggregate measures of activity and how they arise from simple\nmodels of individual users. This approach provides a tractable method to\nunderstand user activity on the web site and how this activity depends on web\nsite design choices, especially the choice of what information about other\nusers' behaviors is shown to each user. We illustrate this modeling approach in\nthe context of user-created content on the news rating site Digg.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2009 20:32:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hogg", "Tad", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.0027", "submitter": "Marko A.

Methods - A cluster sample survey based on a\nself-administered questionnaire was carried out on data collected from 270\nfamilies of patients with Alzheimer's disease or related disorders, located in\nthe greater Paris area. Multiple Correspondence Analysis was used in addition\nto usual statistical tests to identify homogenous FCs clusters concerning the\nappreciation or rejection of the considered technologies. Results - Two\nopposite clusters were clearly defined: FCs in favor of a substantial use of\ntechnology, and those rather or totally hostile. Furthermore the distributions\nof almost all the answers of appreciations were U shaped. Significant relations\nwere demonstrated between IT appreciation and FC's family or gender statuses\n(e.g., female FCs appreciated more than male FCs a tracking device for quick\nrecovering of wandering patients: p=0.0025, N=195). Conclusions - The study\nprovides further evidence of the contrasted perception of technology in\ndementia care at home, and suggests the development of public debates based on\nrigorous assessment of practices and a strict ethical aim to protect against\nmisuse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 18:16:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rialle", "Vincent", "", "TIMC, DMIS"], ["Ollivet", "Catherine", "", "FA 93"], ["Guigui", "Carole", "", "TIMC"], ["Herv\u00e9", "Christian", "", "LEM"]]}, {"id": "0904.0489", "submitter": "Bernardo Huberman", "authors": "Fang Wu and Bernardo A.
