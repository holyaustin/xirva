SaferCross adopts a holistic approach by identifying and developing\nessential system components that are missing in existing systems and\nintegrating the system components into a \"fully-functioning\" mobile system for\npedestrian safety. Specifically, we create algorithms for improving the\naccuracy and energy efficiency of pedestrian positioning, effectiveness of\nphone activity detection, and real-time risk assessment.

Extensive\nexperiments are conducted in a department parking lot for both component-level\nand integrated testing. The results demonstrate that the energy efficiency and\npositioning accuracy of SaferCross are improved by 52% and 72% on average\ncompared with existing solutions with missing support for positioning accuracy\nand energy efficiency, and the phone-viewing event detection accuracy is over\n90%.

Noise pollution is one of the\ntopmost quality of life issues for urban residents in the U.S. with proven\neffects on health, education, the economy, and the environment. Yet, most\ncities lack the resources to continuously monitor noise and understand the\ncontribution of individual sources, the tools to analyze patterns of noise\npollution at city-scale, and the means to empower city agencies to take\neffective, data-driven action for noise mitigation. The SONYC project advances\nnovel technological and socio-technical solutions that help address these\nneeds.\n  SONYC includes a distributed network of both sensors and people for\nlarge-scale noise monitoring. The sensors use low-cost, low-power technology,\nand cutting-edge machine listening techniques, to produce calibrated acoustic\nmeasurements and recognize individual sound sources in real time. Citizen\nscience methods are used to help urban residents connect to city agencies and\neach other, understand their noise footprint, and facilitate reporting and\nself-regulation. Crucially, SONYC utilizes big data solutions to analyze,\nretrieve and visualize information from sensors and citizens, creating a\ncomprehensive acoustic model of the city that can be used to identify\nsignificant patterns of noise pollution. These data can be used to drive the\nstrategic application of noise code enforcement by city agencies to optimize\nthe reduction of noise pollution. The entire system, integrating cyber,\nphysical and social infrastructure, forms a closed loop of continuous sensing,\nanalysis and actuation on the environment.\n  SONYC provides a blueprint for the mitigation of noise pollution that can\npotentially be applied to other cities in the US and abroad.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2018 16:07:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2018 19:23:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bello", "Juan Pablo", ""], ["Silva", "Claudio", ""], ["Nov", "Oded", ""], ["DuBois", "R.

Capstone projects particularly profit from the inclusion of an\nindustrial partner to make the project relevant and help students acquire\nprofessional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is\naligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed.\nHowever, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can\ncreate friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all\ninvolved parties. Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the\ninvolvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a\nretrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a\nconstructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders. Key\nConcepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the\nteachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised\nof several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The\nguideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these\nactivities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an\naction plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical\nobjectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify\nissues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing\nfrom ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on\nreflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other\ngroups involved in the courses. Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively\nto a total of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto\nimplicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the\ninteraction...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 May 2018 08:04:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2018 07:13:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Stegh\u00f6fer", "Jan-Philipp", ""], ["Burden", "H\u00e5kan", ""], ["Hebig", "Regina", ""], ["Calikli", "Gul", ""], ["Feldt", "Robert", ""], ["Hammouda", "Imed", ""], ["Horkoff", "Jennifer", ""], ["Knauss", "Eric", ""], ["Liebel", "Grischa", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.01187", "submitter": "Tim Libert", "authors": "Timothy Libert", "title": "An Automated Approach to Auditing Disclosure of Third-Party Data\n  Collection in Website Privacy Policies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "WWW '18 Proceedings of the 2018 World Wide Web Conference", "doi": "10.1145/3178876.3186087", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A dominant regulatory model for web privacy is \"notice and choice\".

Second, as no single ranking\ncan achieve individual attention fairness, we propose a novel mechanism that\nachieves amortized fairness, where attention accumulated across a series of\nrankings is proportional to accumulated relevance.\n  We formulate the challenge of achieving amortized individual fairness subject\nto constraints on ranking quality as an online optimization problem and show\nthat it can be solved as an integer linear program. Our experimental evaluation\nreveals that unfair attention distribution in rankings can be substantial, and\ndemonstrates that our method can improve individual fairness while retaining\nhigh ranking quality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2018 13:58:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Biega", "Asia J.", ""], ["Gummadi", "Krishna P.", ""], ["Weikum", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.01971", "submitter": "Habib Karbasian", "authors": "Aqdas Malik, Aditya Johri, Rajat Handa, Habib Karbasian and Hemant\n  Purohit", "title": "#ILookLikeAnEngineer: Using Social Media Based Hashtag Activism\n  Campaigns as a Lens to Better Understand Engineering Diversity Issues", "comments": "17 pages, published in Collaborative Network for Engineering and\n  Computing Diversity Conference 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Each year, significant investment of time and resources is made to improve\ndiversity within engineering across a range of federal and state agencies,\nprivate/not-for-profit organizations, and foundations.

To address\nthis gender bias, a goal of the European project No One Left Behind (NOLB) was\nto integrate Pocket Code, an app developed by Catrobat, a free open source\nnon-profit project at the University of Technology in Graz/Austria, into\ndifferent school subjects, thus making coding more accessible and attractive to\nfemale pupils. During the period of this project (2015-2017), teachers were\nsupported to guide their pupils in the learning processes by constructing ideas\nand realizing them through game design. For this paper an analysis of submitted\nprograms according to their game design has been performed. In detail, the\nevaluation considered formal game elements, gaming structures, and used\ngraphics, as well as Pocket Code specific aspects. The programs analysis showed\ncommonly used design patterns by genders and suggests preferred game design\ncharacteristics of female teenagers.

To\nensure an optimal integration of the app in diverse subjects the different\nbackgrounds (technical and non-technical) of teachers must be considered as\nwell. First, teachers were supported to use Pocket Code in the different\nsubjects in school within the feasibility study of the project.

The concept of the\nNOLB GMTF is based on principles of the Universal Design for Learning (UDL)\nmodel. This framework provides a coherent approach to learning and teaching by\nintegrating leisure oriented gaming methods into multi-discipline curricula.\nOne output of this framework is the integration of game-based methods via game\ntemplates that refer to didactical scenarios that include a refined set of\ngenres, assets, rules, challenges, and strategies. These templates allows: 1)\nteachers to start with a well-structured program, and 2) pupils to add content\nand adjust the code to integrate their own ideas. During the project game\ngenres such as adventure, action, and quiz, as well as rewards or victory point\nmechanisms, have been embedded into different subjects, e.g., science,\nmathematics, and arts. The insights gained during the class hours were used to\ngenerate 13 game templates, which are integrated in Create@School (a new\nversion of the Pocket Code app which targets schools). To test the efficiency\nof these templates, user experience (UX) tests were conducted during classes to\ncompare games created by pupils who used templates and those who started to\ncreate a game from scratch.

At\nMcMaster University, we have developed both general computer literacy\nactivities and specific programming activities.

This allows children to start\nexperimenting with GraphicSVG as a language for describing shape, and pick up\nthe core Elm language as they grow in sophistication. Teachers see children\nmaking connections between computer graphics and mathematics within the first\nhour. Graphics are defined declaratively, and support aggregation and\ntransformation, i.e., Algebra. Variables are not needed initially, but are\nintroduced as a time-saving feature, which is immediately accepted. Since\nvariables are declarative, they match students' expectations. Advanced students\nare also exposed to State by making programs that react to user taps or clicks.\nThe syntax required to do so closely follows the theoretical concepts, making\nit easy for them to grasp.

Objective: The objective of our study was to examine\nchallenges involved in developing an app to extract behavioral markers of\nmental health from passive sensor data. Methods: Both technical challenges and\nacceptability of passive data collection for mental health research were\nassessed based on literature review and results obtained from a feasibility\nstudy. Socialise, a mobile phone app developed at the Black Dog Institute, was\nused to collect sensor data (Bluetooth, global positioning system, and battery\nstatus) and investigate views and experiences of a group of people with lived\nexperience of mental health challenges (N=32). Results: On average, sensor data\nwere obtained for 55% (Android) and 45% (iPhone OS) of scheduled scans. Battery\nlife was reduced from 21.3 hours to 18.8 hours when scanning every 5 minutes\nwith a reduction of 2.5 hours or 12%. Despite this relatively small reduction,\nmost participants reported that the app had a noticeable effect on their\nbattery life. In addition to battery life, the purpose of data collection,\ntrust in the organization that collects data, and perceived impact on privacy\nwere identified as main factors for acceptability. Conclusions: Based on the\nfindings of the feasibility study and literature review, we recommend a\ncommitment to open science and transparent reporting and stronger partnerships\nand communication with users.

Here, we investigate the role of faculty hiring\nnetworks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from doctoral to\nfaculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer science, and\nthe importance of where in the network an idea originates. We consider\ncomprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205\nPh.D.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and on\nthe timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five\npopular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and does\nfacilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a mechanism,\nwe then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models to simulate\nthe generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of where an idea\noriginates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We find that research\nfrom prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and completely than work of\nsimilar quality originating from less prestigious institutions. Our analyses\nestablish the theoretical trade-offs between university prestige and the\nquality of ideas necessary for efficient circulation. Our results establish\nfaculty hiring as an underlying mechanism that drives the persistent epistemic\nadvantage observed for elite institutions, and provide a theoretical lower\nbound for the impact of structural inequality in shaping the spread of ideas in\nscience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2018 03:36:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2018 19:18:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Morgan", "Allison C.", ""], ["Economou", "Dimitrios J.", ""], ["Way", "Samuel F.", ""], ["Clauset", "Aaron", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.10195", "submitter": "Juste Raimbault", "authors": "Juste Raimbault", "title": "Reconciling complexities: for a stronger integration of approaches to\n  complex socio-technical systems", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.MA physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Systems engineering has developed a mature knowledge on how to design,\nintegrate and manage complex industrial systems, whereas disciplines studying\ncomplex systems in nature or society also propose numerous tools for their\nunderstanding.

Our findings\nmove the first steps toward a model-based understanding of the long-term impact\nof popularity-based ranking algorithms, and could be used as an informative\ntool for the design of improved information filtering tools.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 15:06:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Nov 2018 04:53:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shilun", ""], ["Medo", "Mat\u00fa\u0161", ""], ["L\u00fc", "Linyuan", ""], ["Mariani", "Manuel Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12512", "submitter": "Emiliano De Cristofaro", "authors": "Savvas Zannettou, Tristan Caulfield, Jeremy Blackburn, Emiliano De\n  Cristofaro, Michael Sirivianos, Gianluca Stringhini, Guillermo Suarez-Tangil", "title": "On the Origins of Memes by Means of Fringe Web Communities", "comments": "A shorter version of this paper appears in the Proceedings of 18th\n  ACM Internet Measurement Conference (IMC 2018).

In this paper, we detect and measure the propagation of memes\nacross multiple Web communities, using a processing pipeline based on\nperceptual hashing and clustering techniques, and a dataset of 160M images from\n2.6B posts gathered from Twitter, Reddit, 4chan's Politically Incorrect board\n(/pol/), and Gab, over the course of 13 months. We group the images posted on\nfringe Web communities (/pol/, Gab, and The_Donald subreddit) into clusters,\nannotate them using meme metadata obtained from Know Your Meme, and also map\nimages from mainstream communities (Twitter and Reddit) to the clusters.\n  Our analysis provides an assessment of the popularity and diversity of memes\nin the context of each community, showing, e.g., that racist memes are\nextremely common in fringe Web communities. We also find a substantial number\nof politics-related memes on both mainstream and fringe Web communities,\nsupporting media reports that memes might be used to enhance or harm\npoliticians. Finally, we use Hawkes processes to model the interplay between\nWeb communities and quantify their reciprocal influence, finding that /pol/\nsubstantially influences the meme ecosystem with the number of memes it\nproduces, while \\td has a higher success rate in pushing them to other\ncommunities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 15:22:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2018 13:00:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2018 21:02:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Zannettou", "Savvas", ""], ["Caulfield", "Tristan", ""], ["Blackburn", "Jeremy", ""], ["De Cristofaro", "Emiliano", ""], ["Sirivianos", "Michael", ""], ["Stringhini", "Gianluca", ""], ["Suarez-Tangil", "Guillermo", ""]]}]
