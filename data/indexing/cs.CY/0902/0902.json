It is personalised and dynamic and allows\nto compute the indirect trust between two agents which are not neighbours based\non the direct trust between agents that are neighbours. In analogy to some\npersonalised versions of PageRank, this metric makes use of the concept of\nfeedback centrality and overcomes some of the limitations of other trust\nmetrics.In particular, it does not neglect cycles and other patterns\ncharacterising social networks, as some other algorithms do. In order to apply\nthe metric to recommender systems, we propose a way to make trust dynamic over\ntime. We show by means of analytical approximations and computer simulations\nthat the metric has the desired properties. Finally, we carry out an empirical\nvalidation on a dataset crawled from an Internet community and compare the\nperformance of a recommender system using our metric to one using collaborative\nfiltering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 16:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2009 17:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Walter", "Frank E.", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2183", "submitter": "Johan Bollen", "authors": "Johan Bollen, Herbert Van de Sompel, Aric Hagberg, Ryan Chute", "title": "A principal component analysis of 39 scientific impact measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Bollen J, Van de Sompel H, Hagberg A, Chute R, 2009 A Principal\n  Component Analysis of 39 Scientific Impact Measures.

However, scientific activity has moved online over\nthe past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a\nvariety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network\nanalysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate\nto each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific\nimpact. We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by\n39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on\nthe basis of both citation and usage log data. Our results indicate that the\nnotion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be\nadequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more\nsuitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not\npositioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus\nbe used with caution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2009 18:31:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2009 19:18:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bollen", "Johan", ""], ["Van de Sompel", "Herbert", ""], ["Hagberg", "Aric", ""], ["Chute", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2866", "submitter": "Alain Barrat", "authors": "Ciro Cattuto, Alain Barrat (CPT), Andrea Baldassarri, G.

An interesting\nexample of this fact is provided by the now very popular social annotation\nsystems, through which users annotate resources (such as web pages or digital\nphotographs) with text keywords dubbed tags. Understanding the rich emerging\nstructures resulting from the uncoordinated actions of users calls for an\ninterdisciplinary effort. In particular concepts borrowed from statistical\nphysics, such as random walks, and the complex networks framework, can\neffectively contribute to the mathematical modeling of social annotation\nsystems. Here we show that the process of social annotation can be seen as a\ncollective but uncoordinated exploration of an underlying semantic space,\npictured as a graph, through a series of random walks. This modeling framework\nreproduces several aspects, so far unexplained, of social annotation, among\nwhich the peculiar growth of the size of the vocabulary used by the community\nand its complex network structure that represents an externalization of\nsemantic structures grounded in cognition and typically hard to access.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 08:58:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2009 12:09:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", "", "CPT"], ["Barrat", "Alain", "", "CPT"], ["Baldassarri", "Andrea", "", "LPT"], ["Schehr", "G.", "", "LPT"], ["Loreto", "Vittorio", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.3104", "submitter": "Devansh Dikshit Mr.", "authors": "Devansh Dikshit, Y.

We propose a model in which the\ndecision of a buyer to buy the product is influenced by friends that own the\nproduct and the price at which the product is offered. The influence model we\nanalyze is quite general, naturally extending both the Linear Threshold model\nand the Independent Cascade model, while also incorporating price information.\nWe consider sales proceeding in a cascading manner through the network, i.e. a\nbuyer is offered the product via recommendations from its neighbors who own the\nproduct. In this setting, the seller influences events by offering a cashback\nto recommenders and by setting prices (via coupons or discounts) for each buyer\nin the social network.\n  Finding a seller strategy which maximizes the expected revenue in this\nsetting turns out to be NP-hard. However, we propose a seller strategy that\ngenerates revenue guaranteed to be within a constant factor of the optimal\nstrategy in a wide variety of models. The strategy is based on an\ninfluence-and-exploit idea, and it consists of finding the right trade-off at\neach time step between: generating revenue from the current user versus\noffering the product for free and using the influence generated from this sale\nlater in the process. We also show how local search can be used to improve the\nperformance of this technique in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Feb 2009 00:06:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Arthur", "David", ""], ["Motwani", "Rajeev", ""], ["Sharma", "Aneesh", ""], ["Xu", "Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.3548", "submitter": "Vinko Zlati\\'c", "authors": "Vinko Zlati\\'c, Hrvoje \\v{S}tefan\\v{c}i\\'c", "title": "Model of Wikipedia growth based on information exchange via reciprocal\n  arcs", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures, companion paper of our paper \"Influence of\n  reciprocal arcs on the degree distribution and degree correlations\"", "journal-ref": "EPL 93 (2011) 58005", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/93/58005", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how reciprocal arcs significantly influence the structural\norganization of Wikipedias, online encyclopedias.
