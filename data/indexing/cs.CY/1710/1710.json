The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily\nbetween 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader\npatterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research\nliterature.

Preliminary time\ntrend analysis conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) uncovered\ndisparities in county jail incarceration rates by geography. Contrary to\nassumptions that incarceration is an urban phenomenon, Vera discovered that\nduring the past few decades, pretrial jail rates have declined in many urban\nareas whereas rates have grown or remained flat in rural counties. In an effort\nto uncover the factors contributing to continued jail growth in rural areas,\nVera joined forces with Two Sigma's Data Clinic, a volunteer-based program that\nleverages employees' data science expertise.

The city of Atlanta is an example site of large-scale urban renewal\nthat aims to engage in development without displacement.

Our affective ratings showed\nsignificant correlations between pleasure and dominance (like Warriner et al.,\n2013) and with previous data collections (S\\\"oderholm et al., 2013; Eilola &\nHavelka, 2010; Warriner et al., 2013). Our affective ratings had significant\neffects on categorizations based on gender, gender-parental role and the time\nof the day and duration of giving ratings. Our results indicate accordance with\nsignificant affectivity differences of gender and age (Warriner et al., 2013)\nand motherhood (Rosebrock et al., 2015). Our proposed models aim to support\nhealth-related communication. Our results suggest gathering next the affective\nratings of patients of maternal care in a real clinical setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 01:30:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 07:08:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 05:27:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lahti", "Lauri", ""], ["Tenhunen", "Henni", ""], ["Heinonen", "Seppo", ""], ["Helkavaara", "Minna", ""], ["P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen-Alho", "Maritta", ""], ["Torkki", "Paulus", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.04252", "submitter": "Gabriele D'Angelo", "authors": "Gabriele D'Angelo, Stefano Ferretti, Vittorio Ghini", "title": "Distributed Hybrid Simulation of the Internet of Things and Smart\n  Territories", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1605.04876", "journal-ref": "Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience, Wiley, vol.\n  30, issue 9 (May 2018).

Here we lay out a program\nof research into monetary and economic dynamics and preliminary steps toward\nits execution. We use principles of response theory to derive implications for\npolicy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money\nsupply, is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some\ndegree of control, optimizing growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing\nmonetary injection between two dominant loop flows, the consumption and wages\nloop, and investment and returns loop. The balance arises from a composite of\ngovernment tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as\nmonetary policy. We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between\ntwo regimes--an oversupply to the consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply\nof the investment and returns loop. The imbalance is manifest in savings and\nborrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased\nuntil 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely\nunrelated to the financial crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis\nare part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now requires shifting the balance.\nOur analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government support\nfor the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption.

The network coding\ntechnique improves the throughput efficiency of multi-hop wireless networks by\ntaking advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless channels. However, there\nare some scenarios where the coding cannot be exploited due to the stochastic\nnature of the packet arrival process in the network. In these cases, the coding\nnode faces two critical choices: forwarding the packet towards the destination\nwithout coding, thereby sacrificing the advantage of network coding, or,\nwaiting for a while until a coding opportunity arises for the packets. Current\nresearch works have addressed this challenge for the case of a simple and\nrestricted scheme called reverse carpooling where it is assumed that two flows\nwith opposite directions arrive at the coding node. In this paper the issue is\nexplored in a general sense based on the COPE architecture requiring no\nassumption about flows in multi-hop wireless networks. In particular, we\naddress this sequential decision making problem by using the solid framework of\noptimal stopping theory, and derive the optimal stopping rule for the coding\nnode to choose the optimal action to take, i.e. to wait for more coding\nopportunity or to stop immediately (and send packet).

So\nmuch so that the current supply from third level institutes across the world\ndoes not meet the high demands of industry. One of the major issues is the low\nprogression rates from first to second year in third level Computer Science\ncourses with introductory programming courses proving to be a high contributing\nfactor. This is something that needs to be addressed. One such way to address\nthe issue is to get children involved and engaged with computing at young ages.\n  This paper describes a study undertaken that is the first step in a body of\nwork that aims to garner the interest of potential Computer Science students at\nan early age. The study involves a comparison of two short courses; one based\nin Java and one based in Snap. The goal is to determine whether either of these\nlanguages is a better first programming language for students than the other,\nor if both are viable. These languages were chosen to allow for a comparison\nbetween a Visual Programming Language and a Textual Programming Language.\n  Feedback in the form of a survey will be used to gather the opinions of the\nstudents. This will provide data on issues such as which language was easier to\nlearn and which language was preferred amongst others. Based on the outcomes of\nthis study, a full-scale curriculum will be developed in the coming year. The\noutcomes of this study will help to establish which is the best programming\nlanguage to suit the learning needs of students.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 23:14:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 13:01:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Noone", "Mark", ""], ["Mooney", "Aidan", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.11559", "submitter": "Faik Boray Tek", "authors": "F.

Research Questions: Are implicit\ntheories of intelligence and programming, and programming-efficacy related to\neach other and student success in programming?

For the past 100 years, innovation\nwithin the automotive sector has brought major technological advances leading\nto safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles. But for the most time since the\ninception of the moving assembly line for vehicle production by Henry Ford, the\nchanges have been incremental / evolutionary. Thanks to the new possibilities\ndue to the IT / wireless revolution, the automotive industry appears to be on\nthe cusp of revolutionary change with potential to dramatically reshape not\njust the competitive landscape but also the way we interact with vehicles, and\nindeed the future design of our roads and cities. Apart from connected personal\nmobility, vehicles are also envisioned to provide Value Added Services (VAS)\nsuch as autonomous driving via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and\nVehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), electric load balancing via Vehicle-to-Grid\n(V2G) solutions, communication solutions using Visible Light Communications\n(VLC) etc. The development and evaluation of vehicular VAS requires a modular\nand scalable multidisciplinary simulation platform. In this paper we propose a\nnovel simulation platform named Cyber-Automotive Simulation \\& Evaluation\nPlatform (CASEP). The purpose of CASEP is to evaluate and visualize the gains\nof various vehicular VAS with special emphasis on commercial vehicle VAS. The\nuse cases are evaluated with respect to the mission-specific performance\nindicators, thereby providing usable metrics for optimization. The\nvisualization platform is being developed using the UNITY 3D engine, thereby\nenabling intuitive interaction as in real physics-based games\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 15:14:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sattiraju", "Raja", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Pratip", ""], ["Schotten", "Hans D.", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaohai", ""], ["G\u00f6rges", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.11571", "submitter": "Kai Mindermann", "authors": "Kai Mindermann, Frederik Riedel, Asim Abdulkhaleq, Christoph Stach,\n  Stefan Wagner", "title": "Exploratory Study of the Privacy Extension for System Theoretic Process\n  Analysis (STPA-Priv) to elicit Privacy Risks in eHealth", "comments": "author's post-print", "journal-ref": "2017 IEEE 25th International Requirements Engineering Conference\n  Workshops (REW), 2017, 90-96", "doi": "10.1109/REW.2017.30", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context: System Theoretic Process Analysis for Privacy (STPA-Priv) is a novel\nprivacy risk elicitation method using a top down approach. It has not gotten\nvery much attention but may offer a convenient structured approach and\ngeneration of additional artifacts compared to other methods. Aim: The aim of\nthis exploratory study is to find out what benefits the privacy risk\nelicitation method STPA-Priv has and to explain how the method can be used.\nMethod: Therefore we apply STPA-Priv to a real world health scenario that\ninvolves a smart glucose measurement device used by children. Different kinds\nof data from the smart device including location data should be shared with the\nparents, physicians, and urban planners. This makes it a sociotechnical system\nthat offers adequate and complex privacy risks to be found. Results: We find\nout that STPA-Priv is a structured method for privacy analysis and finds\ncomplex privacy risks. The method is supported by a tool called XSTAMPP which\nmakes the analysis and its results more profound. Additionally, we learn that\nan iterative application of the steps might be necessary to find more privacy\nrisks when more information about the system is available later. Conclusions:\nSTPA-Priv helps to identify complex privacy risks that are derived from\nsociotechnical interactions in a system. It also outputs privacy constraints\nthat are to be enforced by the system to ensure privacy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 09:01:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mindermann", "Kai", ""], ["Riedel", "Frederik", ""], ["Abdulkhaleq", "Asim", ""], ["Stach", "Christoph", ""], ["Wagner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.11597", "submitter": "Anton Muehlemann", "authors": "Anton Muehlemann", "title": "Sentiment Protocol: A Decentralized Protocol Leveraging Crowd Sourced\n  Wisdom", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Ledger Journal, 2018", "doi": "10.5195/ledger.2018.113", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The wisdom of the crowd is a valuable asset in today's society.
