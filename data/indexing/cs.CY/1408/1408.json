The project team has a strong commitment to impact STEM education\nacross the entire K-20 community.\n  In this paper, we focus on the K-12 community and present a two-week Summer\nProgram for high school juniors and seniors that introduces them to the\nprinciples of CPS design and walks them through several of the design steps.

This paper investigates the impact of the introduction of\ntrending information on the homepage of the UK government petitions platform.\nUsing interrupted time series and a regression discontinuity design, we find\nthat the introduction of the trending feature had no statistically significant\neffect on the overall number of signatures per day, but that the distribution\nof signatures across petitions changes: the most popular petitions gain even\nmore signatures at the expense of those with less signatories. We find\nsignificant differences between petitions trending at different ranks, even\nafter controlling for each petition's individual growth prior to trending. The\nfindings suggest a non-negligible group of individuals visit the homepage of\nthe site looking for petitions to sign and therefore see the list of trending\npetitions, and a significant proportion of this group responds to the social\ninformation that it provides.
