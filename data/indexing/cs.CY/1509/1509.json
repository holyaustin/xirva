With the advent of the Automated\nFare Collection system (AFC), probing the travel patterns of commuters has\nbecome less invasive and more accessible. Consequently, numerous transport\nstudies related to human mobility have shown that these observed patterns allow\none to pair individuals with locations and/or activities at certain times of\nthe day. However, classifying commuters using their travel signatures is yet to\nbe thoroughly examined.\n  Here, we contribute to the literature by demonstrating a procedure to\ncharacterize passenger types (Adult, Child/Student, and Senior Citizen) based\non their three-month travel patterns taken from a smart fare card system. We\nfirst establish a method to construct distinct commuter matrices, which we\nrefer to as eigentravel matrices, that capture the characteristic travel\nroutines of individuals. From the eigentravel matrices, we build classification\nmodels that predict the type of passengers traveling. Among the models\nexplored, the gradient boosting method (GBM) gives the best prediction accuracy\nat 76%, which is 84% better than the minimum model accuracy (41%) required\nvis-\\`a-vis the proportional chance criterion.

With the awareness of which commuter types are\ntraveling, ads, service announcements, and surveys, among others, can be made\nmore targeted spatiotemporally.

This motivates an efficient algorithm with\nconstant time complexity on the long standing problem of best seed spreaders\nselection, with performance remarkably close to the true optimum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 12:51:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 14:42:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2018 13:49:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2018 00:23:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 05:15:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Yanqing", ""], ["Ji", "Shenggong", ""], ["Jin", "Yuliang", ""], ["Feng", "Ling", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

A growing evidence base indicates that high\nquality infrastructure can boost local cycling rates. Yet for infrastructure\nand other cycling measures to be effective, it is important to intervene in the\nright places, such as along 'desire lines' of high latent demand. This creates\nthe need for tools and methods to help answer the question 'where to build?'.\nFollowing a brief review of the policy and research context related to this\nquestion, this paper describes the design, features and potential applications\nof such a tool. The Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT) is an online, interactive\nplanning support system which was initially developed to explore and map\ncycling potential across England (see www.pct.bike). Based on\norigin-destination data, it models and visualises cycling levels at area,\ndesire line, route and route network levels, for current levels of cycling, and\nfor scenario-based 'cycling futures'. Four scenarios are presented, including\n'Go Dutch' and 'Ebikes', which explore what would happen if English people\ncycled as much as Dutch people and the potential impact of electric cycles on\ncycling uptake. The cost effectiveness of investment depends not only on the\nnumber of additional trips cycled, but on wider impacts such as health and\ncarbon benefits. The PCT reports these at area, desire line, and route level\nfor each scenario. The PCT is open source, facilitating the creation of\nadditional scenarios and its deployment in new contexts. We conclude that the\nPCT illustrates the potential of online tools to inform transport decisions and\nraises the wider issue of how models should be used in transport planning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 07:34:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2016 16:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 23:29:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lovelace", "Robin", ""], ["Goodman", "Anna", ""], ["Aldred", "Rachel", ""], ["Berkoff", "Nikolai", ""], ["Abbas", "Ali", ""], ["Woodcock", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.05024", "submitter": "Valery Vilisov", "authors": "Valery Vilisov", "title": "Modeling Concordances of Company's Investment Directions With Its Market\n  Attraction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.13140/RG.2.1.1707.8248", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cs.CY stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work models the interconnection of company's investment managers'\nrepresentations and the market attraction of its shares.

Rather than a pattern of\nsurprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's\nbehavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually\nhigh levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,\ndetected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual\nepochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's\nown self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts\nwith their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory\nthan the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal\nchanges are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery.

To\nenhance this growth, the research thesis recommends using the presented trends\nand patterns found in the short-term, to conduct successful eSport events.\nHowever, in the long-term an implementation of a Data-driven Decision Support\nSystem can be done, which will periodically gather data to know the best\npossible way to deliver eSport events to the eSport community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 16:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Olsen", "Anders Hval", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09055", "submitter": "Marc Barthelemy", "authors": "Julien Perret, Maurizio Gribaudi, Marc Barthelemy", "title": "Roads and cities of $18^{th}$ century France", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Scientific Data 2, Article number: 150048 (2015)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The evolution of infrastructure networks such as roads and streets are of\nutmost importance to understand the evolution of urban systems.

In this paper, we question whether legacy Quality of Services\n(QoS) metrics and enforcement techniques are sufficient as they are producer\ncentric. We argue that, similar to customer rating systems found in banking\nsystems and many sharing economy apps (e.g., Uber and Airbnb), Quality of\nConsumption (QoC) should be introduced to capture different metrics about\nservice consumers. We show how the combination of QoS and QoC, dubbed QoX, can\nbe used by consumers and providers to improve the security and management of\ntheir infrastructure. In addition, we demonstrate how sharing information among\nother consumers and providers increase the value of QoX. To address the main\nchallenge with sharing information, namely sybil attacks and mis-information,\nwe describe how we can leverage cloud providers as vouching authorities to\nensure the integrity of information. We present initial results in prototyping\nthe appropriate abstractions and interfaces in a cloud environment, focusing on\nthe design impact on both service providers and consumers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 08:30:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kablan", "Murad", ""], ["Jamjoom", "Hani", ""], ["Keller", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09138", "submitter": "Manish Kumar", "authors": "Manish Kumar, Shubham Kaul", "title": "Technical Report on Intruder Detection and Alert System", "comments": "Submitted to CII Innovation 2015, India and NI Engineering Impact\n  Awards 2015, India. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1508.03479", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work presents a smart trespasser detection and alert system which aims\nto increase the amount of security as well as the likelihood of positively\nidentifying or stopping trespassers and intruders as compared to other commonly\ndeployed home security system.
