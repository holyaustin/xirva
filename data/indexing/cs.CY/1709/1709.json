Emotion AI places itself as an algorithmic\nlens on our digital artifacts and real-time interactions, creating the illusion\nof a new, objective class of data: our emotional and mental states. Building\nupon a rich network of existing public photographs--as well as fresh feeds from\nsurveillance footage or smart phone cameras--these emotion algorithms require\nno additional infrastructure or improvements on image quality. In order to\nexamine the potential policy and legal remedies for emotion AI as an emerging\ntechnology, we first establish a framework of actors, collection motivations,\ntime scales, and space considerations that differentiates emotion AI from other\nalgorithmic lenses. Each of these elements influences available policy\nremedies, and should shape continuing discussions on the antecedent conditions\nthat make emotional AI acceptable or not in particular contexts. Based on our\nframework of unique elements, we examine potential available policy remedies to\nprevent or remediate harm. Specifically, our paper looks toward the regulatory\nrole of the Federal Trade Commission in the US, gaps in the EU's General Data\nProtection Regulation (GDPR) allowing for emotion data collection, and\nprecedent set by polygraph technologies in evidentiary and use restrictions set\nby law. We also examine the way social norms and adaptations could grow to also\nmodulate broader use.

Evidence of software\ndiscrimination has been found in modern software systems that recommend\ncriminal sentences, grant access to financial products, and determine who is\nallowed to participate in promotions. Our approach, Themis, generates efficient\ntest suites to measure discrimination. Given a schema describing valid system\ninputs, Themis generates discrimination tests automatically and does not\nrequire an oracle. We evaluate Themis on 20 software systems, 12 of which come\nfrom prior work with explicit focus on avoiding discrimination. We find that\n(1) Themis is effective at discovering software discrimination, (2)\nstate-of-the-art techniques for removing discrimination from algorithms fail in\nmany situations, at times discriminating against as much as 98% of an input\nsubdomain, (3) Themis optimizations are effective at producing efficient test\nsuites for measuring discrimination, and (4) Themis is more efficient on\nsystems that exhibit more discrimination. We thus demonstrate that fairness\ntesting is a critical aspect of the software development cycle in domains with\npossible discrimination and provide initial tools for measuring software\ndiscrimination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 02:45:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Galhotra", "Sainyam", ""], ["Brun", "Yuriy", ""], ["Meliou", "Alexandra", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03406", "submitter": "Jo\\~ao Pereira Sr.", "authors": "Jo\\~ao Filipe Figueiredo Pereira", "title": "Social Media Text Processing and Semantic Analysis for Smart Cities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the rise of Social Media, people obtain and share information almost\ninstantly on a 24/7 basis.

In addition, the administrator and the\ntutors have a number of tools such as : management seminars and trainees in a\nfriendly way, sending educational material as well as new announcements to the\ntrainees; the possibility of electronic recording of presence or absence of the\ntrainees in a seminar, and direct printing of a certificate of successful\nattendance of a seminar for each trainee. The application also offers features\nsuch as electronic organization, storage and presentation of educational\nmaterial, overcoming the limiting factors of space and time of classical\nteaching, thus creating a dynamic environment\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 09:31:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 10:17:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Skordas", "Ioannis A.", ""], ["Tsirekas", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Kolovos", "Nestoras", ""], ["Fragulis", "George F.", ""], ["Triantafyllou", "Athanasios G.", ""], ["Bouliou", "Maria G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.09413", "submitter": "Christine Michel", "authors": "Carine Tour\\'e (1,2), Christine Michel (1), Jean-Charles Marty (1)\n  ((1) SICAL, (2) SCP)", "title": "Adaptation des r{\\'e}seaux sociaux d'entreprise pour favoriser\n  l'apprentissage informel sur le lieu de travail", "comments": "in French.

Specifically, this paper performs a comparative\nanalysis on the understanding of users belonging to two categories -- general\nAI-Tweeters (AIT) and expert AI-Tweeters (EAIT) who share posts about AI on\nTwitter. Our analysis revealed that users from both the categories express\ndistinct emotions and interests towards AI. Users from both the categories\nregard AI as positive and are optimistic about the progress of AI but the\nexperts are more negative than the general AI-Tweeters. Expert AI-Tweeters\nshare relatively large percentage of tweets about their personal news compared\nto technical aspects of AI. However, the effects of automation on the future\nare of primary concern to AIT than to EAIT.
