Here, rather than investigating\nthe dynamics of this process itself, we study how the characteristics of the\naudience and follower links change as the audience of a user grows in size on\nthe road to user's popularity.\n  To begin with, we find that the early followers tend to be more elite users\nthan the late followers, i.e., they are more likely to have verified and expert\naccounts.

Importantly, one would expect a meme to\nspread in a social network amongst the people who are interested in the topic\nof that meme. Yet, the importance of topicality for information diffusion has\nbeen less explored in the literature.\n  Here, we study empirical data about two different types of memes (hashtags\nand URLs) spreading through the Twitter's online social network. For every\nmeme, we infer its topics and for every user, we infer her topical interests.\nTo analyze the impact of such topics on the propagation of memes, we introduce\na novel theoretical framework of information diffusion. Our analysis identifies\ntwo distinct mechanisms, namely topical and non-topical, of information\ndiffusion. The non-topical information diffusion resembles disease spreading as\nin simple contagion. In contrast, the topical information diffusion happens\nbetween users who are topically aligned with the information and has\ncharacteristics of complex contagion. Non-topical memes spread broadly among\nall users and end up being relatively popular. Topical memes spread narrowly\namong users who have interests topically aligned with them and are diffused\nmore readily after multiple exposures.

In these sites, users\ntypically choose their information sources, which in turn determine what\nspecific information they receive, how much information they receive and how\nquickly this information is shown to them. In this context, a natural question\nthat arises is how efficient are social media users at selecting their\ninformation sources.\n  In this work, we propose a computational framework to quantify users'\nefficiency at selecting information sources. Our framework is based on the\nassumption that the goal of users is to acquire a set of unique pieces of\ninformation. To quantify user's efficiency, we ask if the user could have\nacquired the same pieces of information from another set of sources more\nefficiently. We define three different notions of efficiency -- link, in-flow,\nand delay -- corresponding to the number of sources the user follows, the\namount of (redundant) information she acquires and the delay with which she\nreceives the information. Our definitions of efficiency are general and\napplicable to any social media system with an underlying information network,\nin which every user follows others to receive the information they produce.\n  In our experiments, we measure the efficiency of Twitter users at acquiring\ndifferent types of information. We find that Twitter users exhibit sub-optimal\nefficiency across the three notions of efficiency, although they tend to be\nmore efficient at acquiring non-popular than popular pieces of information. We\nthen show that this lack of efficiency is a consequence of the triadic closure\nmechanism by which users typically discover and follow other users in social\nmedia. Finally, we develop a heuristic algorithm that enables users to be\nsignificantly more efficient at acquiring the same unique pieces of\ninformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 20:00:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Babaei", "Mahmoudreza", ""], ["Grabowicz", "Przemyslaw A.", ""], ["Valera", "Isabel", ""], ["Gummadi", "Krishna P.", ""], ["Gomez-Rodriguez", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.04497", "submitter": "Hamed Haddadi", "authors": "Jaclyn Rich, Hamed Haddadi, Timothy M.

The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce websites has\nseen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user\npreferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper\naddresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently\ndeveloped opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons.\nFirst, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing\nalgorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based\nanswer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports\nof customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct\ninformation, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second,\ninternational customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for\nmultilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic\nquestionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in\nChina and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and\nEnglish, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet\ncomputers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine\nof the Mean, and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers\nexpress their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about\ngeneral feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product\ndetails.
