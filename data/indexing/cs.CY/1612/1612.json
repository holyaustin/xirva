Objective: To explore the\nuse of pilot case studies in the design of full-scale case studies, and to\nreport the main lessons learned from an industrial pilot study. Method: We\ndesigned and conducted an exploratory case study to identify new relevant\nresearch variables that influence the innovative behaviour of software\nengineers in the industrial setting and to refine the full-scale case study\ndesign for the next phase of our research.

Conclusions: When a\nresearch topic has not been fully discovered or understood, it is difficult to\ncreate a case study design that covers the relevant research variables and\ntheir potential relationships.

There are many factors that can make of group exercises a\nchallenging setting for older adults. A major one in the elderly population is\nthe difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical,\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a novel virtual gym that enables\nonline group-exercises in older adults with different levels of skills.\n  Methods. A total of 37 older adults (65-87 years old) followed a personalized\nexercise program based on the OTAGO program for fall prevention, for a period\nof eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a\ntablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to a Control group\n(individual training) or Social group (online group-exercising). Pre- and post-\nmeasurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social\nwellbeing outcomes. The study received ethical approval from the CREATE-NET\nEthics Committee on ICT Research Involving Human Beings (Application N.\n2014-001).\n  Results. There were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in\nterms of physical outcomes. Interestingly though, while in the Control group\nfitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case\nfor the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For\npsychological and social wellbeing outcomes there were improvements on both\ngroups, regardless of the application used.\n  Conclusion. Group exercising in a virtual gym can be effective in motivating\nand enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter\nindividuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together\ndespite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise\ncan reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context.

However, despite the widespread adoption\nof these features, there is little understanding of the consequences that\nsocial networking has on user retention, engagement, and online as well as\noffline behavior. Here, we study how social networks influence user behavior in\na physical activity tracking application. We analyze 791 million online and\noffline actions of 6 million users over the course of 5 years, and show that\nsocial networking leads to a significant increase in users' online as well as\noffline activities. Specifically, we establish a causal effect of how social\nnetworks influence user behavior. We show that the creation of new social\nconnections increases user online in-application activity by 30%, user\nretention by 17%, and user offline real-world physical activity by 7% (about\n400 steps per day). By exploiting a natural experiment we distinguish the\neffect of social influence of new social connections from the simultaneous\nincrease in user's motivation to use the app and take more steps. We show that\nsocial influence accounts for 55% of the observed changes in user behavior,\nwhile the remaining 45% can be explained by the user's increased motivation to\nuse the app. Further, we show that subsequent, individual edge formations in\nthe social network lead to significant increases in daily steps. These effects\ndiminish with each additional edge and vary based on edge attributes and user\ndemographics. Finally, we utilize these insights to develop a model that\naccurately predicts which users will be most influenced by the creation of new\nsocial network connections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 15:20:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Dec 2016 11:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Althoff", "Tim", ""], ["Jindal", "Pranav", ""], ["Leskovec", "Jure", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.03101", "submitter": "Maciej Korczynski", "authors": "Michel van Eeten, Qasim Lone, Giovane Moura, Hadi Asghari, Maciej\n  Korczy\\'nski", "title": "Evaluating the Impact of AbuseHUB on Botnet Mitigation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This documents presents the final report of a two-year project to evaluate\nthe impact of AbuseHUB, a Dutch clearinghouse for acquiring and processing\nabuse data on infected machines.
