One\nfrequently used definition states that ``communities, that have more and/or\nbetter-connected `internal edges' connecting members of the set than `cut\nedges' connecting the set to the rest of the world''[Leskovec et al. 20008].\nThis definition inspired the modularity-maximization class of community\ndetection algorithms, which look for regions of the network that have higher\nthan expected density of edges within them. We introduce an alternative\ndefinition which states that a community is composed of individuals who have\nmore influence on others within the community than on those outside of it. We\npresent a mathematical formulation of influence, define an influence-based\nmodularity metric, and show how to use it to partition the network into\ncommunities. We evaluated our approach on the standard data sets used in\nliterature, and found that it often outperforms the edge-based modularity\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2008 19:11:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.4722", "submitter": "Bernard Jacquemin", "authors": "Bernard Jacquemin (LIMSI), Aur\\'elien Lauf (LIMSI), C\\'eline Poudat\n  (LTCI), Martine Hurault-Plantet (LIMSI), Nicolas Auray (LTCI)", "title": "La fiabilit\\'e des informations sur le web", "comments": "8 pp", "journal-ref": "Dans Actes de la Conf\\'erence en Recherche d'Information et\n  Applications CORIA 2008 - Conf\\'erence en Recherche d'Information et\n  Applications 2008, Tr\\'egastel : France (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online IR tools have to take into account new phenomena linked to the\nappearance of blogs, wiki and other collaborative publications.
