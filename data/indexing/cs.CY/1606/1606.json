In Australia, there is an emerging\ntrend that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) begin to adopt this\ntechnology in the conventional working practices. However, there is a dearth of\nprior studies on examining the factors that influence the cloud computing\nadoption among Australian SMEs. To fill the empirical vacuum, this\nresearch-in-progress proposes an integrated framework for examining the\ndeterminants of cloud computing service adoption with the consideration of the\nunique characteristics of Australian SMEs, such as relatively low adoption of\ncloud computing services, less innovative, and limited knowledge about cloud\ncomputing and its benefits and hindrances. To this end, we are conducting\nconsecutive studies to investigate this research issue. An exploratory\ninterview study will be undertaken to identify and verify the unique\ncharacteristics of Australian SMEs toward the cloud computing adoption. This is\nfollowed by an organisational level survey that examines the effects of those\ndeterminants on cloud computing adoption. Finally, a decision model for cloud\ncomputing adoption among Australian SMEs will be developed by using a Multi\nCriteria Decision Approach (MCDA) through rating, prioritising, and ranking of\nvarious criteria and alternatives available to the decision makers.

In three experiments, we show\nthat it is remarkably easy to modify an ethical robot so that it behaves\ncompetitively, or even aggressively. The reason for this is that the specific\nAI, required to make an ethical robot, can always be exploited to make\nunethical robots. Hence, the development of ethical robots will not guarantee\nthe responsible deployment of AI. While advocating for ethical robots, we\nconclude that preventing the misuse of robots is beyond the scope of\nengineering, and requires instead governance frameworks underpinned by\nlegislation. Without this, the development of ethical robots will serve to\nincrease the risks of robotic malpractice instead of diminishing it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 14:47:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Vanderelst", "Dieter", ""], ["Winfield", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.02878", "submitter": "Mohammad Khalil", "authors": "Mohammad Khalil and Martin Ebner", "title": "What is Learning Analytics about?

Therefore, a value-based model of\nonline healthcare information search was extended adding detailed information\nquality measures. Our survey data collected from 143 college going students\nfrom more than 10 countries studying in South Korea demonstrated two novel\nresults. At first, unlike existing studies, strong support was found for\nperceived social value affecting the user satisfaction. As a second substantial\nfinding, the significance of social value could only be appreciated by using\ncomprehensive constructs of information quality than simpler measures.\nTherefore, this study shows for social and shared HIS, users consider access,\nrepresentation and context quality of healthcare information to be more\nimportant from social perspective than intrinsic (or content) quality.\nTherefore, developers and healthcare organizations interested in traction of\ntheir online healthcare information delivery systems (HIS), especially those\nusing internet and social media networks, should focus on enhancing information\nquality of their systems accordingly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 00:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hameed", "Tahir", ""], ["Swar", "Bobby", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03509", "submitter": "Kirsten Ellis", "authors": "Kirsten Ellis, Julie Fisher, Louisa Willoughby and Jan Carlo Barca", "title": "A design science exploration of a visual-spatial learning system with\n  feedback", "comments": "Research-in-progress ISBN# 978-0-646-95337-3 Presented at the\n  Australasian Conference on Information Systems 2015 (arXiv:1605.01032)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "ACIS/2015/201", "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Our paper is research in progress that is research investigating the use of\ngames technology to enhance the learning of a physical skill.

Among the main suggested causes from sociology are the\ntendency of similar individuals to connect (often itself referred as homophily)\nand the social influence among already connected individuals. An important\nquestion to researchers and in practice can be tackled, as we present here:\nunderstanding the exact mechanisms of interplay between these tendencies and\nthe underlying social network structure. Namely, in addition to the mentioned\nassortativity coefficient, there are several other static and temporal network\nproperties and substructures that can be linked to the tendencies of homophily\nand social influence in the social network and we herein investigate those.\nConcretely, we tackle a computer-mediated \\textit{communication network} (based\non Twitter mentions) and a particular type of assortative mixing that can be\ninferred from the semantic features of communication content that we term\n\\textit{semantic homophily}.

We will present a variety of background information in\nSection 2, and outline various issues related to progress over the last 5 years\nin Section 3. In Section 4 we will outline a number of opportunities for moving\nforward. Finally, we will summarize the main points in Section 5.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 18:06:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Christensen", "Henrik I", ""], ["Okamura", "Allison", ""], ["Mataric", "Maja", ""], ["Kumar", "Vijay", ""], ["Hager", "Greg", ""], ["Choset", "Howie", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09236", "submitter": "Gregory Hager", "authors": "Nady Boules, Khari Douglas, Stuart Feldman, Limor Fix, Gregory Hager,\n  Brent Hailpern, Martial Hebert, Dan Lopresti, Beth Mynatt, Chris Rossbach,\n  and Helen Wright", "title": "The Future of Computing Research: Industry-Academic Collaborations", "comments": "A Computing Community Consortium (CCC) white paper, 19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  IT-driven innovation is an enormous factor in the worldwide economic\nleadership of the United States. It is larger than finance, construction, or\ntransportation, and it employs nearly 6% of the US workforce. The top three\ncompanies, as measured by market capitalization, are IT companies - Apple,\nGoogle (now Alphabet), and Microsoft. Facebook, a relatively recent entry in\nthe top 10 list by market capitalization has surpassed Walmart, the nation's\nlargest retailer, and the largest employer in the world. The net income of just\nthe top three exceeds $80 billion - roughly 100 times the total budget of the\nNSF CISE directorate which funds 87% of computing research. In short, the\ndirect return on federal research investments in IT research has been\nenormously profitable to the nation.\n  The IT industry ecosystem is also evolving. The time from conception to\nmarket of successful products has been cut from years to months. Product life\ncycles are increasingly a year or less. This change has pressured companies to\nfocus industrial R&D on a pipeline or portfolio of technologies that bring\nimmediate, or almost immediate, value to the companies. To defeat the\ncompetition and stay ahead of the pack, a company must devote resources to\nrealizing gains that are shorter term, and must remain agile to respond quickly\nto market changes driven by new technologies, new startups, evolving user\nexperience expectations, and the continuous consumer demand for new and\nexciting products.\n  Amidst this landscape, the Computing Community Consortium convened a\nround-table of industry and academic participants to better understand the\nlandscape of industry-academic interaction, and to discuss possible actions\nthat might be taken to enhance those interactions. We close with some\nrecommendations for actions that could expand the lively conversation we\nexperienced at the round-table to a national scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 19:45:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boules", "Nady", ""], ["Douglas", "Khari", ""], ["Feldman", "Stuart", ""], ["Fix", "Limor", ""], ["Hager", "Gregory", ""], ["Hailpern", "Brent", ""], ["Hebert", "Martial", ""], ["Lopresti", "Dan", ""], ["Mynatt", "Beth", ""], ["Rossbach", "Chris", ""], ["Wright", "Helen", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.09581", "submitter": "Sahil Sharma", "authors": "Sahil Sharma, Vinod Sharma and Atul Sharma", "title": "Performance Based Evaluation of Various Machine Learning Classification\n  Techniques for Chronic Kidney Disease Diagnosis", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Modern Computer Science, Vol.4, Issue3,\n  June 2016, pp.11-16", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Areas where Artificial Intelligence (AI) & related fields are finding their\napplications are increasing day by day, moving from core areas of computer\nscience they are finding their applications in various other domains.In recent\ntimes Machine Learning i.e. a sub-domain of AI has been widely used in order to\nassist medical experts and doctors in the prediction, diagnosis and prognosis\nof various diseases and other medical disorders.
