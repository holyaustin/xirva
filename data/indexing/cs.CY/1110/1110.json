Are there any ways to make\nthese sites closer to life? This paper is devoted to open input technique, a\nway for websites of web 1.0 era to grow and evolve community. The idea of open\ninput, in general, means that anybody from the web can add information to any\nsection of the website even without registration on that website. People can\nadd news, billboard announcements, testimonials, questions, pictures, videos\netc - whatever site owner permitted. We have tested this idea in practice and\nhave positive results approving that open input is a vital approach for\ncollaboration on the web.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Oct 2011 04:50:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Vasev", "Pavel", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1349", "submitter": "Fergal Reid", "authors": "Derek Greene, Fergal Reid, Gavin Sheridan, Padraig Cunningham", "title": "Supporting the Curation of Twitter User Lists", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Twitter introduced lists in late 2009 as a means of curating tweets into\nmeaningful themes.

Identifying members to add to a list on an\nemerging topic is a delicate process. From a network analysis perspective there\nare a number of views on the Twitter network that can be explored, e.g.\nfollowers, retweets mentions etc. We present a process for integrating these\nviews in order to recommend authoritative commentators to include on a list.\nThis process is evaluated on manually curated lists about unrest in Bahrain and\nthe Iowa caucuses for the 2012 US election.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2011 18:47:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Greene", "Derek", ""], ["Reid", "Fergal", ""], ["Sheridan", "Gavin", ""], ["Cunningham", "Padraig", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2096", "submitter": "Philipp Herrmann", "authors": "Philipp N.

To address our research question, we use a unique and very rich dataset\ncontaining actual market transaction data for approximately 7,000 pay-per-bid\nauctions. Thus, unlike previous studies that are primarily laboratory\nexperiments, we investigate the effects of using IT on the proneness to a\ndecision bias in real market transactions. We identify and analyze irrational\ndecision scenarios of auction participants. We find that participants with a\nhigher monetary investment have an increased likelihood of violating the\nassumption of rationality, due to the sunk cost effect. Interestingly, after\ncontrolling for monetary investments, participants who delegate their decision\nmaking to IT and, consequently, have comparably lower behavioral investments\n(e.g., emotional attachment, effort, time) are less prone to the sunk cost\neffect. In particular, delegation to IT reduces the impact of overall\ninvestments on the sunk cost effect by approximately 50%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 16:23:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2012 15:34:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Herrmann", "Philipp N.", ""], ["Kundisch", "Dennis O.", ""], ["Rahman", "Mohammad S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2595", "submitter": "Ravindra Jain", "authors": "R.
