The economic\nbehaviour of customer and the nature of the organization are controlled by a\nprescribed form called Know Your Customer (KYC) in manual banking. Depositor\ncustomers in some sectors (business of Jewellery/Gold, Arms, Money exchanger\netc) are with high risk; whereas in some sectors (Transport Operators,\nAuto-delear, religious) are with medium risk; and in remaining sectors (Retail,\nCorporate, Service, Farmer etc) belongs to low risk. Presently, credit risk for\ncounterparty can be broadly categorized under quantitative and qualitative\nfactors. Although there are many existing systems on customer retention as well\nas customer attrition systems in bank, these rigorous methods suffers clear and\ndefined approach to disburse loan in business sector. In the paper, we have\nused records of business customers of a retail commercial bank in the city\nincluding rural and urban area of (Tangail city) Bangladesh to analyse the\nmajor transactional determinants of customers and predicting of a model for\nprospective sectors in retail bank. To achieve this, data mining approach is\nadopted for analysing the challenging issues, where pruned decision tree\nclassification technique has been used to develop the model and finally tested\nits performance with Weka result.

The analytical distinction between these dimensions of structure\nprovides us with richer models of scientific development. In this study, I\nassume that (i) social structures organize expectations into belief structures\nthat can be attributed to individuals and communities; (ii) expectations are\nspecified in scholarly literature; and (iii) intellectually the sciences\n(disciplines, specialties) tend to self-organize as systems of rationalized\nexpectations. Whereas social organizations remain localized, academic writings\ncan circulate, and expectations can be stabilized and globalized using\nsymbolically generalized codes of communication. The intellectual\nrestructuring, however, remains latent as a second-order dynamics that can be\naccessed by participants only reflexively. Yet, the emerging \"horizons of\nmeaning\" provide feedback to the historically developing organizations by\nconstraining the possible future states as boundary conditions. I propose to\nmodel these possible future states using incursive and hyper-incursive\nequations from the computation of anticipatory systems. Simulations of these\nequations enable us to visualize the couplings among the historical--i.e.,\nrecursive--progression of social structures along trajectories, the\nevolutionary--i.e., hyper-incursive--development of systems of expectations at\nthe regime level, and the incursive instantiations of expectations in actions,\norganizations, and texts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Apr 2015 06:40:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 18:12:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 13 Jun 2015 07:37:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.04826", "submitter": "Dmitry Prokudin", "authors": "Irina Mbogo, Dmitry Prokudin, Andrey Chugunov", "title": "Complex Integration of Digital Collections into Scientific Information\n  Space", "comments": "in Russian", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The article considers the solution of problems of accumulation and\nintegration of scientific electronic collections into information space of\nscientific researches.

We extract\nvisual features from the last three fully connected layers of both CaffeNet\n(pretrained with ImageNet) and our fine tuned version for the ChaLearn\nchallenge.
