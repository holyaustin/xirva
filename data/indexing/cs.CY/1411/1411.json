Here we describe a streaming framework for online detection and\nclustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering\nprocedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of\ninformation carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based\non multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets\nreflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm\ntakes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including\nnatural language, the social network, and the patterns of information\ndiffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically,\nstructurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on\na variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to\n\"forget\" old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation\nof our framework is carried out by using a dataset of Twitter trending topics.\nOver a one-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was\nable to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method\noutperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a\nstate-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the\nunderlying follower network. We finally show that our online learning framework\nis flexible, due to its independence of the adopted clustering algorithm, and\nbest suited to work in a streaming scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 20:41:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["JafariAsbagh", "Mohsen", ""], ["Ferrara", "Emilio", ""], ["Varol", "Onur", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.0654", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Gustavo Gonzalez-Granadillo (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom\n  SudParis, France), Christophe Ponchel (Cassidian CyberSecurity, France),\n  Gregory Blanc (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom SudParis, France),\n  Herv\\'e Debar (Institut Mines-T\\'el\\'ecom, T\\'el\\'ecom SudParis, France)", "title": "Combining Technical and Financial Impacts for Countermeasure Selection", "comments": "In Proceedings AIDP 2014, arXiv:1410.3226", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 165, 2014, pp. 1-14", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.165.1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Research in information security has generally focused on providing a\ncomprehensive interpretation of threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks, in\nparticular to evaluate their danger and prioritize responses accordingly.

Fire weather indices\nare a widely-adopted method for measuring fire danger and they play a\nsignificant role in issuing bushfire warnings and in anticipating demand for\nbushfire management resources. Existing systems that calculate fire weather\nindices are limited due to low spatial and temporal resolution. Localized\nwireless sensor networks, on the other hand, gather continuous sensor data\nmeasuring variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and\nwind speed at high resolutions. However, using wireless sensor networks to\nestimate fire weather indices is a challenge due to data quality issues, lack\nof standard data formats and lack of agreement on thresholds and methods for\ncalculating fire weather indices. Within the scope of this paper, we propose a\nstandardized approach to calculating Fire Weather Indices (a.k.a. fire danger\nratings) and overcome a number of the challenges by applying Semantic Web\nTechnologies to the processing of data streams from a wireless sensor network\ndeployed in the Springbrook region of South East Queensland. This paper\ndescribes the underlying ontologies, the semantic reasoning and the Semantic\nFire Weather Index (SFWI) system that we have developed to enable domain\nexperts to specify and adapt rules for calculating Fire Weather Indices.

Our work\nbenefits from combinations of sensors available on a device and identifies\nbehavioral patterns with a temporal granularity similar to human time\nperception. Employing a combination of sensors rather than focusing on only one\nsensor can handle uncertainty by neglecting sensor data that is not available\nand focusing instead on available data. Moreover, by experimenting on two real,\nlarge datasets, we demonstrate that using a sliding window significantly\nimproves the scalability of our algorithms, which can be used by applications\nfor small devices, such as smartphones and wearables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 03:33:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 04:29:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 14:57:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rawassizadeh", "Reza", ""], ["Momeni", "Elaheh", ""], ["Shetty", "Prajna", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.4956", "submitter": "Etienne Burdet", "authors": "Etienne Burdet, Morgane Colombert, Denis Morand, Youssef Diab", "title": "Integrated canopy, building energy and radiosity model for 3D urban\n  design", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an integrated, three dimensional, model of urban canopy, building\nenergy and radiosity, for early stage urban designs and test it on four urban\nmorphologies.

OBA operates by\nassociating tags or labels to users based on their online activity and then\nusing these labels to target them. This rise has been accompanied by privacy\nconcerns from researchers, regulators and the press. In this paper, we present\na novel methodology for measuring and understanding OBA in the online\nadvertising market. We rely on training artificial online personas representing\nbehavioural traits like 'cooking', 'movies', 'motor sports', etc. and build a\nmeasurement system that is automated, scalable and supports testing of multiple\nconfigurations. We observe that OBA is a frequent practice and notice that\ncategories valued more by advertisers are more intensely targeted. In addition,\nwe provide evidences showing that the advertising market targets sensitive\ntopics (e.g, religion or health) despite the existence of regulation that bans\nsuch practices. We also compare the volume of OBA advertising for our personas\nin two different geographical locations (US and Spain) and see little\ngeographic bias in terms of intensity of OBA targeting. Finally, we check for\ntargeting with do-not-track (DNT) enabled and discovered that DNT is not yet\nenforced in the web.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 16:31:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 10:52:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 08:29:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Carrascosa", "J.

With this demand-based principle, we design two incentive\nschemes, Incentive with Demand Fairness (IDF) and Iterative Tank Filling (ITF),\nfor maximizing fairness and social welfare, respectively. Our study shows that\nthe IDF scheme is max-min fair and can score close to 1 on the Jain's fairness\nindex, while the ITF scheme maximizes social welfare and achieves a unique Nash\nequilibrium which is also Pareto and globally optimal. We adopted a game\ntheoretic approach to derive the optimal service demands.
