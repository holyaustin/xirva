It allows group members to gain knowledge through\ncollaborations and interactions. Nowadays, most Internet cooperative learning\nsystems are designed to provide students mainly with a convenient online\nenvironment to study theoretical courses but rarely with an online environment\nto operate practical instruments. Hence, this paper designed a 3D online\ncooperative learning system for operating virtual instruments with\ncircuit-measuring function. By integrating with Virtual Reality, Remote Control\nParameter Transmission and embedded system techniques, this system gives\nlearners not only a cooperative learning environment via networking to jointly\noperate the 3D virtual instruments (for example, multi-meters, power supplies\nand oscilloscopes) but also the functions of instant messages and 3D puzzles to\ninteract with one another. Therefore, learners can effectively improve learning\ninterests and results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2010 10:24:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kao", "Fu-Chien", ""], ["Wang", "Siang-Ru", ""], ["Huang", "Ting-Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1985", "submitter": "Chaomei Chen", "authors": "Chaomei Chen, Fidelia Ibekwe-SanJuan, Jianhua Hou", "title": "The Structure and Dynamics of Co-Citation Clusters: A\n  Multiple-Perspective Co-Citation Analysis", "comments": "33 pages, 11 figures, 10 tables.
