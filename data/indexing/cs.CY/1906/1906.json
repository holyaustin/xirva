A common complaint is that utilizing\nsecure passwords is too difficult. One possible solution to this problem is to\nuse a password schema. Password schemas are deterministic functions which map\nchallenges (typically the website name) to responses (passwords). Previous work\nhas been done on developing and analyzing publishable schemas, but these\nanalyses have been information-theoretic, not complexity-theoretic; they\nconsider an adversary with infinite computing power.\n  We perform an analysis with respect to adversaries having currently\nachievable computing capabilities, assessing the realistic practical security\nof such schemas. We prove for several specific schemas that a computer is no\nworse off than an infinite adversary and that it can successfully extract all\ninformation from leaked challenges and their respective responses, known as\nchallenge-response pairs. We also show that any schema that hopes to be secure\nagainst adversaries with bounded computation should obscure information in a\nvery specific way, by introducing many possible constraints with each\nchallenge-response pair. These surprising results put the analyses of password\nschemas on a more solid and practical footing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2019 18:51:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rosenfeld", "Elan", ""], ["Vempala", "Santosh", ""], ["Blum", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.00128", "submitter": "Boli Fang", "authors": "Boli Fang, Miao Jiang, Jerry Shen", "title": "Achieving Fairness in Determining Medicaid Eligibility through Fairgroup\n  Construction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Effective complements to human judgment, artificial intelligence techniques\nhave started to aid human decisions in complicated social problems across the\nworld.

In this work, we focus on achieving sustainable transportation\nby incentivizing passengers to switch from private cars to public transport. We\naddress the following challenges. First, the passengers incur inconvenience\ncosts when changing their transit behaviors due to delay and discomfort, and\nthus need to be reimbursed. Second, the inconvenience cost, however, is unknown\nto the government when choosing the incentives. Furthermore, changing transit\nbehaviors raises privacy concerns from passengers. An adversary could infer\npersonal information, (e.g., daily routine, region of interest, and wealth), by\nobserving the decisions made by the government, which are known to the public.\nWe adopt the concept of differential privacy and propose privacy-preserving\nincentive designs under two settings, denoted as two-way communication and\none-way communication. Under two-way communication, passengers submit bids and\nthen the government determines the incentives, whereas in one-way communication\nthe government simply sets a price without acquiring information from the\npassengers. Under one-way communication, we focus on how the government should\ndesign the incentives without revealing passengers' inconvenience costs while\nstill preserving differential privacy.

Unlike prior work, it can efficiently learn distributions\nover large domains, controllably adjust the representation rates of protected\ngroups and achieve target fairness metrics such as statistical parity, yet\nremains close to the empirical distribution induced by the given dataset. Our\napproach leverages the principle of maximum entropy - amongst all distributions\nsatisfying a given set of constraints, we should choose the one closest in\nKL-divergence to a given prior. While maximum entropy distributions can\nsuccinctly encode distributions over large domains, they can be difficult to\ncompute. Our main contribution is an instantiation of this framework for our\nset of constraints and priors, which encode our bias mitigation goals, and that\nruns in time polynomial in the dimension of the data. Empirically, we observe\nthat samples from the learned distribution have desired representation rates\nand statistical rates, and when used for training a classifier incurs only a\nslight loss in accuracy while maintaining fairness properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2019 17:54:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 13:07:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Celis", "L.

Several approaches have been developed to get\nearly estimations of area and yield, the two components of crop production.

Regardless\nof the approach used, early estimators of cropland area, crop area or crop\nyield should have an accuracy providing lower production error than existing\nhistorical crop statistics. The objective of this study is to develop a\nmethodological framework to define the accuracy requirements for early\nestimators of cropland area, crop area and crop yield in Senegal. These\nrequirements are made according to (i) the inter-annual variability and the\ntrend of historical data, (ii) the calendar of official statistics data\ncollection, and (iii) the time at which early estimations of cropland area,\ncrop area and crop yield can theoretically be available.

This paper takes a closer look at the actual datasets put together by\nProPublica. In particular, the sub-datasets built to study the likelihood of\nrecidivism within two years of a defendant's original COMPAS survey screening\ndate. I take a new yet simple approach to visualize these data, by analyzing\nthe distribution of defendants across COMPAS screening dates. I find that\nProPublica made an important data processing error when it created these\ndatasets, failing to implement a two-year sample cutoff rule for recidivists in\nsuch datasets (whereas it implemented a two-year sample cutoff rule for\nnon-recidivists). When I implement a simple two-year COMPAS screen date cutoff\nrule for recidivists, I estimate that in the two-year general recidivism\ndataset ProPublica kept over 40% more recidivists than it should have. This\nfundamental problem in dataset construction affects some statistics more than\nothers. It obviously has a substantial impact on the recidivism rate;\nartificially inflating it. For the two-year general recidivism dataset created\nby ProPublica, the two-year recidivism rate is 45.1%, whereas, with the simple\nCOMPAS screen date cutoff correction I implement, it is 36.2%. Thus, the\ntwo-year recidivism rate in ProPublica's dataset is inflated by over 24%. This\nalso affects the positive and negative predictive values. On the other hand,\nthis data processing error has little impact on some of the other key\nstatistical measures, which are less susceptible to changes in the relative\nshare of recidivists, such as the false positive and false negative rates, and\nthe overall accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jun 2019 17:27:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Jun 2019 17:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 19:11:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Barenstein", "Matias", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.05352", "submitter": "Zhoutong Wang", "authors": "Qianhui Liang, Zhoutong Wang", "title": "Uncovering Dominant Social Class in Neighborhoods through Building\n  Footprints: A Case Study of Residential Zones in Massachusetts using Computer\n  Vision", "comments": "Publishing as conference proceeding of 16th International Conference\n  on Computers in Urban Planning and Urban Management", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In urban theory, urban form is related to social and economic status.

However, the early\npromises of ridesharing for alleviating congestion in cities may be undermined\nby a number of challenges, including the growing number of proposed services\nand the subsequent increasing number of vehicles, as a natural consequence of\ncompetition. In this work, we present optimization-based approaches to model\ncooperation and competition between multiple ridesharing companies, in a\nreal-time on-demand setting. A recent trend relies on solving the integrated\ncombination of Dial-A-Ride Problems (DARP), which compute the cost of assigning\nincoming requests to vehicle routes, plus Linear Assignment Problems (LAP),\nwhich assign vehicles to requests. While the DARPs, are solved at the level of\nthe vehicles of each company, we introduce cooperative and competitive\napproaches to solve the LAP. The cooperative model, which could make use of\nMobility as a Service platforms, is shown to solve the LAP to optimality\nfollowing closely results from the literature, and limiting the amount of\ninformation the companies are required to share. We investigate how a realistic\nmodel of competition deviates from this optimality and provide worst case\nbounds. We evaluate these models with respect to a centralized model on\none-week instances of the New York City taxi dataset. Model variants coping\nwith noise in the travel time estimations, bias in the assignment costs, and\npreferences in the competitive case are also presented and validated.

A multitude of model\ncurricula and recommendations have been presented and discussed in\ninternational fora in recent years, with varying levels of impact on education,\npolicy and practice. This paper address three key questions: i) what is taught\nand what should be taught for cybersecurity to general computer science\nstudents; ii) should cybersecurity be taught stand-alone or in an integrated\nmanner to general computer science students; and iii) can accreditation by\nnational professional, statutory and regulatory bodies enhance the provision of\ncybersecurity within a body's jurisdiction?\n  Evaluating how cybersecurity is taught in all aspects of computer science is\nclearly a task of considerable size, one that is beyond the scope of this\npaper. Instead a case study-based research approach -- primarily focusing on\nthe UK -- has been adopted to evaluate the evidence of the teaching of\ncybersecurity within general computer science to university-level students.\nThus, in the context of widespread international computer science/engineering\ncurriculum reform, what does this need to embed cybersecurity knowledge and\nskills mean more generally for institutions and educators, and how can we teach\nthis subject more effectively?

Consequently, as shown in our background\nresearch, administrative actions (community bans and quarantines) are often\ntaken in reaction to media pressure following offensive discourse within a\ncommunity spilling into the real world with serious consequences. In this\npaper, we investigate the feasibility of proactive moderation on Reddit --\ni.e., proactively identifying communities at risk of committing offenses that\npreviously resulted in bans for other communities. Proactive moderation\nstrategies show promise for two reasons: (1) they have potential to narrow down\nthe communities that administrators need to monitor for hateful content and (2)\nthey give administrators a scientific rationale to back their administrative\ndecisions and interventions. Our work shows that communities are constantly\nevolving in their user base and topics of discourse and that evolution into\nhateful or dangerous (i.e., considered bannable by Reddit administrators)\ncommunities can often be predicted months ahead of time. This makes proactive\nmoderation feasible. Further, we leverage explainable machine learning to help\nidentify the strongest predictors of evolution into dangerous communities.
