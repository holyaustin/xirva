The resulting data were analyzed using Pearson product\ncorrelation and Multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that Java\nProgramming self-efficacy has no significant relationship with each of the\ncomputing and programming background factors.

Therefore, the success\nof electronic commerce significantly depends on providing security and privacy\nfor its consumers sensitive personal data. Consumers lack of acceptance in\nelectronic commerce adoption today is not merely due to the concern on security\nand privacy of their personal data, but also lack of trust and reliability of\nWeb vendors. Consumers trust in online transactions is crucial for the\ncontinuous growth and development of electronic commerce. Since Business to\nConsumer (B2C) ecommerce requires the consumers to engage the technologies, the\nconsumers face a variety of security risks. This study addressed the role of\nsecurity, privacy and risk perceptions of consumers to shop online in order to\nestablish a consensus among them. The analyses provided descriptive frequencies\nfor the research variables and for each of the study s research constructs. In\naddition, the analyses were completed with factor analysis and Pearson\ncorrelation coefficients. The findings suggested that perceived privacy of\nonline transaction on trust is mediated by perceived security, and consumers\ntrust in online transaction is significantly related with the trustworthiness\nof Web vendors. Also, consumers trust is negatively associated with perceived\nrisks in online transactions. However, there is no significant impact from\nperceived security and perceived privacy to trust in online transactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Sep 2009 06:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Thaw", "Yi Yi", ""], ["Mahmood", "Ahmad Kamil", ""], ["Dominic", "P.
