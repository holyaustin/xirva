Methods: We have developed HopkinsPD, a novel smartphone-based\nmonitoring platform, which measures symptoms actively (i.e. data are collected\nwhen a suite of tests is initiated by the individual at specific times during\nthe day), and passively (i.e. data are collected continuously in the\nbackground). After data collection, we extract features to assess measures of\nfive key behaviors related to PD symptoms -- voice, balance, gait, dexterity,\nand reaction time. A random forest classifier is used to discriminate\nmeasurements taken after a dose of medication (treatment) versus before the\nmedication dose (baseline). Results: A worldwide study for remote PD monitoring\nwas established using HopkinsPD in July, 2014. This study used entirely remote,\nonline recruitment and installation, demonstrating highly cost-effective\nscalability. In six months, 226 individuals (121 PD and 105 controls)\ncontributed over 46,000 hours of passive monitoring data and approximately\n8,000 instances of structured tests of voice, balance, gait, reaction, and\ndexterity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to have\ncollected data at such a scale for remote PD monitoring. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate the initial ability to discriminate treatment from baseline with\n71.0(+-0.4)% accuracy, which suggests medication response can be monitored\nremotely via smartphone-based measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 20:49:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhan", "Andong", ""], ["Little", "Max A.", ""], ["Harris", "Denzil A.", ""], ["Abiola", "Solomon O.", ""], ["Dorsey", "E.

The results are novel in the domains of SE and psychology,\nand they fill an important lack that had been raised by both previous research\nand by practitioners. The implications of this PhD lie in setting out the basic\nbuilding blocks for researching and understanding the affect of software\ndevelopers, and how it is related to software development performance.

Finally, we apply this multi-layered human mobility\nnetwork to infer the structure of the global society through a community\ndetection approach and demonstrate that consideration of mobility from a\nmulti-layer perspective can reveal important global spatial patterns in a way\nmore consistent with other available relevant sources of international\nconnections, in comparison to the spatial structure inferred from each network\nlayer taken separately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 07:40:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Belyi", "Alexander", ""], ["Bojic", "Iva", ""], ["Sobolevsky", "Stanislav", ""], ["Sitko", "Izabela", ""], ["Hawelka", "Bartosz", ""], ["Rudikova", "Lada", ""], ["Kurbatski", "Alexander", ""], ["Ratti", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.05561", "submitter": "Han Yu", "authors": "Xinjia Yu", "title": "Emotional Interaction between Artificial Companion Agents and the\n  Elderly", "comments": "This is a book draft", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Artificial companion agents are defined as hardware or software entities\ndesigned to provide companionship to a person.

The situation of counterfeiting has even been exacerbating in wine\nindustry and global supply chain. There has been a number of\nanti-counterfeiting approaches which have been proposed and adopted utilizing\ndifferent authentication technologies, in response to growing threats of\ncounterfeiting to wine industry. The proposed NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting\nSystem (NAS) is developed for luxury-good industry such as wine industry,\naiming at upholding provenance and authenticity of wine products from\ncounterfeits via the product pedigree, transaction records and supply chain\nintegrity maintained along the supply chain. Consumers can therefore safeguard\ntheir stake by authenticating a specific wine product with their NFC-enabled\nsmartphones before purchasing at the retail points. NAS utilizes Near-field\nCommunication (NFC), which has emerged as a promising technology and\ncommunication protocol for developing innovative alternatives, to facilitate\nthe wine record processing of wine products and in turn combat wine and spirit\ncounterfeiting. The integrated NAS is consisted of a wide range of hardware and\nsoftware components, and the best combination of settings, parameters and\ndeployments will therefore be identified. Other possible implementation issues,\nsuch as tag selection, tag programming and encryption, setup of back-end\ndatabase servers and the design of NFC mobile application will also be\ndiscussed in this project. The critical design of NAS is vital not only to the\nkey of product anti-counterfeiting of wine industry, but also to the strong\nfoundation for other innovative supply chain solutions, such as the NFC-enabled\npurchasing system, developed on top of NAS with improved and integrated\nanti-counterfeiting functionalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jan 2016 11:51:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 18:45:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 00:49:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yiu", "Neo C.
