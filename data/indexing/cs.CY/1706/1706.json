We\nevaluated the framework with approximately 16,500 inpatient stays from a large\nmedical center. The plausibility of the clusters for bundled care was assessed\nthrough a survey of a panel of healthcare experts using an analysis of variance\n(ANOVA) under a 95% confidence interval.

Although MOBA is currently one of the\nmost played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less\nautonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these\ncharacteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance\ndynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid\nthat players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a\ndynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for MOBA games. The main idea is to\ncreate a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player\nperformance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is\ndone by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some\ngame features and switching the difficulty of the opponent's artificial\nintelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments\nwere performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting\ndynamically to the opponent's skills. In spite of that, the qualitative\nexperiments with users showed that the player's expertise has a greater\ninfluence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 23:45:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "Mirna Paula", ""], ["Silva", "Victor do Nascimento", ""], ["Chaimowicz", "Luiz", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.02832", "submitter": "Victor Silva", "authors": "Victor do Nascimento Silva and Luiz Chaimowicz", "title": "A Tutor Agent for MOBA Games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Digital games have become a key player in the entertainment industry,\nattracting millions of new players each year.

By representing real-world\ndynamic systems as complex networks, the emergence of new trends can be\nsymbolized by vertices that \"shine.\" That is, at a specific time interval in a\nnetwork's life, certain vertices become increasingly connected to other\nvertices. This process creates new high-degree vertices, i.e., network stars.\nThus, to study trends, we must look at how networks evolve over time and\ndetermine how the stars behave. In our research, we constructed the largest\npublicly available network evolution dataset to date, which contains 38,000\nreal-world networks and 2.5 million graphs. Then, we performed the first\nprecise wide-scale analysis of the evolution of networks with various scales.\nThree primary observations resulted: (a) links are most prevalent among\nvertices that join a network at a similar time; (b) the rate that new vertices\njoin a network is a central factor in molding a network's topology; and (c) the\nemergence of network stars (high-degree vertices) is correlated with\nfast-growing networks.

Such systems have been empirically shown to be susceptible to\nrunaway feedback loops, where police are repeatedly sent back to the same\nneighborhoods regardless of the true crime rate.\n  In response, we develop a mathematical model of predictive policing that\nproves why this feedback loop occurs, show empirically that this model exhibits\nsuch problems, and demonstrate how to change the inputs to a predictive\npolicing system (in a black-box manner) so the runaway feedback loop does not\noccur, allowing the true crime rate to be learned. Our results are\nquantitative: we can establish a link (in our model) between the degree to\nwhich runaway feedback causes problems and the disparity in crime rates between\nareas. Moreover, we can also demonstrate the way in which \\emph{reported}\nincidents of crime (those reported by residents) and \\emph{discovered}\nincidents of crime (i.e. those directly observed by police officers dispatched\nas a result of the predictive policing algorithm) interact: in brief, while\nreported incidents can attenuate the degree of runaway feedback, they cannot\nentirely remove it without the interventions we suggest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 16:50:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 00:06:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Dec 2017 04:49:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ensign", "Danielle", ""], ["Friedler", "Sorelle A.", ""], ["Neville", "Scott", ""], ["Scheidegger", "Carlos", ""], ["Venkatasubramanian", "Suresh", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09865", "submitter": "C.H.

We propose a\nnovel metric that captures the stability of random forests predictions, which\nwe argue is key for scenarios that require successive predictions. We motivate\nthe need for multi-criteria optimization by showing that in practical\napplications, simply choosing the parameters that lead to the lowest error can\nintroduce unnecessary costs and produce predictions that are not stable across\nindependent runs. To optimize this multi-criteria trade-off, we present a new\nframework that efficiently finds a principled balance between these three\nconsiderations using Bayesian optimisation. The pitfalls of optimising forest\nparameters purely for error reduction are demonstrated using two publicly\navailable real world datasets.
