These challenges are also\nimpacting the life cycle of the software system that implements the virtual\nenvironment. The goal of this paper is to identify and sketch important legal\nand policy challenges of virtual environments and how they affect stakeholders\n(i.e., operators, users, and lawmakers). Given the increasing significance of\nvirtual environments, we expect that tackling these challenges will become\nincreasingly important in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Aug 2008 10:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kienle", "Holger M.", ""], ["Lober", "Andreas", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Hausi A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.2431", "submitter": "Frederic Connes", "authors": "Frederic Connes", "title": "A Simple E-Voting Protocol", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an e-voting protocol that seems to allow citizens to verify that\ntheir vote has been accurately taken into account while preserving its secrecy,\nwithout requiring the use of a complex process.
