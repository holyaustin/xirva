Such a\npopulation is often the initial state of microsimulation or (agent)\nindividual-based models. To get a realistic distribution of households is often\nvery important, because this distribution has an impact on the demographic\nevolution.

An experiment is\nconducted in Wu-Ling Senior High School with 250 students taking part. The\nstatistical analysis of experimental results shows that, for relatively high\nabstraction concepts, such as iteration number, Design Sketch helps\nsignificantly. However, it is not so for low abstraction concepts such as\ncompare, swap, and iteration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2009 02:07:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Chih-Hao", ""], ["Jiu", "Yi-Wen", ""], ["Chen", "Jason Jen-Yen", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4188", "submitter": "Massimo Franceschet", "authors": "Massimo Franceschet", "title": "The skewness of computer science", "comments": "I applied the goodness-of-fit methodology proposed in: A.

The main flavors of computer science research\ninvolve the theoretical development of conceptual models for the different\naspects of computing and the more applicative building of software artifacts\nand assessment of their properties. In the computer science publication\nculture, conferences are an important vehicle to quickly move ideas, and\njournals often publish deeper versions of papers already presented at\nconferences. These peculiarities of the discipline make computer science an\noriginal research field within the sciences, and, therefore, the assessment of\nclassical bibliometric laws is particularly important for this field. In this\npaper, we study the skewness of the distribution of citations to papers\npublished in computer science publication venues (journals and conferences). We\nfind that the skewness in the distribution of mean citedness of different\nvenues combines with the asymmetry in citedness of articles in each venue,\nresulting in a highly asymmetric citation distribution with a power law tail.\nFurthermore, the skewness of conference publications is more pronounced than\nthe asymmetry of journal papers. Finally, the impact of journal papers, as\nmeasured with bibliometric indicators, largely dominates that of proceeding\npapers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2009 15:24:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Feb 2010 12:59:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Franceschet", "Massimo", ""]]}]
