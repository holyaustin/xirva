The leading assumption of this paper is that\ninformation which can be distilled from public debates on Twitter has\npredictive content for exchange rate movements. This assumption prompted a\nTwitter-based exchange rate model that harnesses regARIMA analyses for\nshort-term out-of-sample ex post forecasts of the daily closing prices of\nEUR/USD spot exchange rates. The analyses used Tweet counts collected from\nJanuary 1, 2012 - September 27, 2013. To identify concepts mentioned on Twitter\nwith a predictive potential the analysis followed a 2-step selection. Firstly,\na heuristic qualitative analysis assembled a long list of 594 concepts, e.g.,\nMerkel, Greece, Cyprus, crisis, chaos, growth, unemployment expected to covary\nwith the ups and downs of the EUR/USD exchange rate. Secondly, cross-validation\nusing window averaging with a fixed-sized rolling origin was deployed to select\nconcepts and corresponding univariate time series that had error scores below\nchance level as defined by the random walk model. With regard to a short list\nof 17 concepts (covariates), in particular SP (Standard & Poor's) and risk, the\nout-of-sample predictive accuracy of the Twitter-based regARIMA model was found\nto be repeatedly better than that obtained from both the random walk model and\na random noise covariate in 1-step ahead forecasts of the EUR/USD exchange\nrate. This advantage was evident on the level of forecast error metrics (MSFE,\nMAE) when a majority vote over different estimation windows was conducted.

To solve this problem, comes the proposal DLMS4TEF, which\nrequirements are divided into hardware and software, as hardware will need\nFast-Ethernet (LAN) technology to connect the departments of the Foundation via\nClient-Server network later, when an infrastructure is established for\ne-governments or e-management, it may be extended to the campus network. The\nsoftware is represented by installing windows server to implement the proposal\ndesign of DLMS4TEF, PHP script is used as web programming that supports the\nserver, where as the HTML and JavaScript are used to support the client side.\nThe dynamic DLMS4TEF will be based on relational database, which is created by\nusing MySQL, to support processing hundreds of queries per second, and the\nKurdish Unicode to support Kurdish fonts of GUI's, Moreover, for security\nDLMS4TEF allows each department in the Foundation to enter its own section and\nprevent accessing other sections by using HTAccessible program which allows the\nuser to access by using his IP address and his computer only. The important\nconclusions and advantages of applying DLMS4TEF are making backup to DLMS4TEF's\ndatabases using the option (zipped) which allows them to reach the size of (3%)\nof the original database size, sufficient security techniques, through\nachieving levels of security, hidden access to the administrator section, and\nfinally DLMS4TEF, when compared with the traditional methods and project of\nOman, shows the same efficiency of some, if not better, features of Oman.\nKeywords- E-management, Client-Server network, Fast-Ethernet, PHP, MySQL\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Feb 2014 19:29:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ismaeel", "Ayad Ghany", ""], ["Mikhail", "Dina Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.1919", "submitter": "Abubakar Bappah", "authors": "Abubakar Sadiq Bappah", "title": "Appraisal of Social Learning Potentials in Some Trending Mobile\n  Computing Applications", "comments": "5 pages, Published with International Journal of Computer Trends and\n  Technology (IJCTT)", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)\n  volume 4 Issue 7 July 2013 pp 2017 to 2021", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  New Mobile technologies have created a new social dimension where individuals\ncan develop increased levels of their social awareness by keeping in touch with\nold friends, making new friends, dispense new data or product, and getting\ninformation in many more aspects of everyday lives, making one to become more\nknowledgeable which is very beneficial especially for students. Social\nnetworks, in particular enable users to share and discuss common interests and\nprovide infrastructures for integrating various user experiences: synchronous\nand asynchronous communication, game-playing, sharing links and files. The\ntrend of using social networks and social media to deliver and exchange\nknowledge could bring a new era of social learning in which learners make use\nall four language skills of reading, writing, listening and speaking. Unlike a\ntraditional e-leaning paradigm with pre-defined curriculum and standard\ntextbooks, social knowledge could be aggregated on demand, just in time, and in\ncontext of engaging challenges from social networks, making learning more\nexciting, social and, game-like experience.

Thus, the leak of\n600GB worth of logs from 7 Blue Coat SG-9000 proxies, deployed in Syria to\nfilter Internet traffic at a country scale, represents a unique opportunity to\nprovide a detailed snapshot of a real-world censorship ecosystem. This paper\npresents the methodology and the results of a measurement analysis of the\nleaked Blue Coat logs, revealing a relatively stealthy, yet quite targeted,\ncensorship. We find that traffic is filtered in several ways: using IP\naddresses and domain names to block subnets or websites, and keywords or\ncategories to target specific content. We show that keyword-based censorship\nproduces some collateral damage as many requests are blocked even if they do\nnot relate to sensitive content. We also discover that Instant Messaging is\nheavily censored, while filtering of social media is limited to specific pages.\nFinally, we show that Syrian users try to evade censorship by using web/socks\nproxies, Tor, VPNs, and BitTorrent.

Moreover, the model enables the\nvirtual agent to display its social attitude through its non-verbal behaviour.\nThe proposed model has been developed in the context of job interview\nsimulation. The methodology used to develop such a model combined a theoretical\nand an empirical approach.

A number of websites offer friend-finding\nfeatures that help users bootstrap social networks on the website by copying\nlinks from an established network like Facebook or Twitter. This paper\nquantifies the extent to which such social bootstrapping is effective in\nenhancing a social experience of the website. First, we develop a stylised\nanalytical model that suggests that copying tends to produce a giant connected\ncomponent (i.e., a connected community) quickly and preserves properties such\nas reciprocity and clustering, up to a linear multiplicative factor. Second, we\nuse data from two websites, Pinterest and Last.fm, to empirically compare the\nsubgraph of links copied from Facebook to links created natively. We find that\nthe copied subgraph has a giant component, higher reciprocity and clustering,\nand confirm that the copied connections see higher social interactions.\nHowever, the need for copying diminishes as users become more active and\ninfluential. Such users tend to create links natively on the website, to users\nwho are more similar to them than their Facebook friends.
