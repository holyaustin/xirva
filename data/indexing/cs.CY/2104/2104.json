It aims to identify individuals who closely contacted an infected\nperson during the incubation period of the virus and notify them to quarantine.\nHowever, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and efficiency\nissues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient\nand privacy-preserving Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of\ndepending on a single authority to run the system, a group of health\nauthorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using\nBlockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of\nfailure and denial of service attacks, but also brings transparency because all\ntransactions can be validated by different parties. Although contact tracing is\nimportant, it is not enough to effectively control an infection. Thus, unlike\nmost of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system\nconsists of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public\nplaces access control, and safe-places recommendation. The access control\nsubsystem prevents infected people from visiting public places to prevent\nspreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones based\non the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones.\nOur analysis demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy\nof the users against identification, social graph disclosure, and tracking\nattacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks. Moreover, our\nextensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system\n(which is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation,\nand storage overheads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 03:09:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Alansar", "Seham A.", ""], ["Badr", "Mahmoud M.", ""], ["Mahmoud", "Mohamed", ""], ["Alasmary", "Waleed", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.02532", "submitter": "Tal Feldman", "authors": "Tal Feldman and Ashley Peake", "title": "End-To-End Bias Mitigation: Removing Gender Bias in Deep Learning", "comments": "9 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Machine Learning models have been deployed across many different aspects of\nsociety, often in situations that affect social welfare.

These tasks, however, often come with many challenges when using\nclassical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including class\nimbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To\naddress some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting\ncontrastive learning framework and proposes a novel contrastive regularized\nclinical classification model. The contrastive loss is found to substantially\naugment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the\nsimilar/dissimilar patterns (by its \"push-and-pull\" form), meanwhile mitigating\nthe highly skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces\n(as also echoed by recent findings). In particular, when naively exporting the\ncontrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in generating positive\nsamples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data.\nTo this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies\nspecifically tailored for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that\nexploits the feature space neighborhood structure to reinforce the feature\nlearning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates\npre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both\nsampling approaches are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class\nvariance in EHR data. Our overall framework yields highly competitive\nexperimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world COVID-19\nEHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health\nsystem.

Overall, this work reveals for the first time how voluntary\ncommitments, with sanctions either by peers or an institution, leads to\nsocially beneficial outcomes in all scenarios envisageable in a short-term race\ntowards domain supremacy through AI technology.

As a countermeasure, Twitter has\nrecently introduced \"Birdwatch,\" a community-driven approach to address\nmisinformation on Twitter. On Birdwatch, users can identify tweets they believe\nare misleading, write notes that provide context to the tweet and rate the\nquality of other users' notes. In this work, we empirically analyze how users\ninteract with this new feature. For this purpose, we collect all Birdwatch\nnotes and ratings since the introduction of the feature in early 2021. We then\nmap each Birdwatch note to the fact-checked tweet using Twitter's historical\nAPI. In addition, we use text mining methods to extract content characteristics\nfrom the text explanations in the Birdwatch notes (e.g., sentiment). Our\nempirical analysis yields the following main findings: (i) users more\nfrequently file Birdwatch notes for misleading than not misleading tweets.\nThese misleading tweets are primarily reported because of factual errors, lack\nof important context, or because they contain unverified claims. (ii) Birdwatch\nnotes are more helpful to other users if they link to trustworthy sources and\nif they embed a more positive sentiment. (iii) The helpfulness of Birdwatch\nnotes depends on the social influence of the author of the fact-checked tweet.\nFor influential users with many followers, Birdwatch notes yield a lower level\nof consensus among users and community-created fact checks are more likely to\nbe seen as being incorrect. Altogether, our findings can help social media\nplatforms to formulate guidelines for users on how to write more helpful fact\nchecks.

It is well known that humans spend 80% of\ntheir time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility is challenging due to\nthree main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost\nindoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent\nindoor mobility, and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in\nmobility. To deal with all these challenges, we propose WiFiMod, a\nTransformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility at\nmultiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input\nenterprise WiFi system logs to extract human mobility trajectories from\nsmartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted trajectory, we identify the\nmobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and micro, to design a\nmulti-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours\nto an entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding\ncaptures the mobility periodicity and correlations across various scales while\nTransformers capture long-term mobility dependencies boosting model prediction\nperformance. This approach significantly reduces the prediction space by first\npredicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro-mobility,\nconditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the\ntopological constraint of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that\nWiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at least 10% points higher than the\ncurrent state-of-art models.

Here, we review the literature on trust, human-robot\ninteraction, human-robot collaboration, and human interaction at large. Early\nmodels of trust suggest that trust entails a trade-off between benevolence and\ncompetence, while studies of human-to-human interaction emphasize the role of\nshared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We then\nintroduce a model of trust as an agent's best explanation for reliable sensory\nexchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the\ncognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of\nHRC, trust can be cast in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. In\nthis setting, interactive feedback becomes a necessary component of the\ntrustor's perception-action cycle. The resulting model has important\nimplications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration, as it\nallows the traditional determinants of human trust to be defined in terms of\nactive inference, information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model\nsuggests that boredom and surprise may be used as markers for under and\nover-reliance on the system.

Thus, many efforts have been taken for developing fair\nmachine learning models. Most of them require that sensitive attributes are\navailable during training to learn fair models. However, in many real-world\napplications, it is usually infeasible to obtain the sensitive attribute due to\nprivacy or legal issues, which challenges existing fair classifiers. Though the\nsensitive attribute of each data sample is unknown, we observe that there are\nusually some non-sensitive features in the training data that are highly\ncorrelated with sensitive attributes, which can be used to alleviate the bias.\nTherefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of exploring features that\nare highly correlated with sensitive attributes for learning fair and accurate\nclassifier without sensitive attributes. We theoretically show that by\nminimizing the correlation between these related features and model prediction,\nwe can learn a fair classifier. Based on this motivation, we propose a novel\nframework which simultaneously uses these related features for accurate\nprediction and regularizing the model to be fair. In addition, the model can\ndynamically adjust the importance weight of each related feature to balance the\ncontribution of the feature on model classification and fairness.

These are street network, building footprint,\nand morphological tessellation, a spatial unit derivative of Voronoi\ntessellation, obtained from building footprints. Hence, we derive homogeneous\nurban tissue types (or taxa) and, by determining overall morphological\nsimilarity between them, generate a hierarchical classification (phenetic\ntaxonomy) of urban form.
