However, to\ndate, a careful study of interactions between a regulator and HARE is lacking.\nIn this paper, we report on three user studies which give insights into how to\ndesign systems that allow people, acting as the regulatory authority, to\neffectively interact with HARE. As in the study of political systems in which\ngovernments regulate human societies, our studies analyze how interactions\nbetween HARE and regulators are impacted by regulatory power and individual\n(robot or agent) autonomy. Our results show that regulator power, decision\nsupport, and adaptive autonomy can each diminish the social welfare of HARE,\nand hint at how these seemingly desirable mechanisms can be designed so that\nthey become part of successful HARE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 15:28:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Wen", ""], ["Khemeiri", "Alanoud Al", ""], ["Almehrezi", "Abdulla", ""], ["Enezi", "Wael Al", ""], ["Rahwan", "Iyad", ""], ["Crandall", "Jacob W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02254", "submitter": "Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil", "authors": "Justine Zhang, Arthur Spirling, Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil", "title": "Asking Too Much?

[Methods] This paper reports on a systematic mapping\nstudy using high-quality journals and conferences from the software engineering\nfield as data sources. We scanned all papers published between 2010 and 2014\nand investigated all papers reporting student experiments in detail. [Results]\nFrom 2788 papers under investigation 175 report results from controlled\nexperiments. 109 (62.29%) of these controlled experiments have been conducted\nwith student participants. Most experiments used undergraduate student\nparticipants, recruited students on a voluntary basis, and set them tasks to\nmeasure their comprehension. However, many experiments lack information\nregarding the students' recruitment and other important factors. [Conclusions]\nIn conclusion, student participation in software engineering experiments can be\nseen as a common evaluation approach. In contrast, there seems to be little\nknowledge about the threats to validity in student experiments, as major\ndrivers such as the recruitment are not reported at all.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 19:57:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Daun", "Marian", ""], ["H\u00fcbscher", "Carolin", ""], ["Weyer", "Thorsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.04677", "submitter": "Nikolaus Correll", "authors": "Nikolaus Correll, Prabal Dutta, Richard Han and Kristofer Pister", "title": "New Directions: Wireless Robotic Materials", "comments": "To appear at SenSys 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe opportunities and challenges with wireless robotic materials.\nRobotic materials are multi-functional composites that tightly integrate\nsensing, actuation, computation and communication to create smart composites\nthat can sense their environment and change their physical properties in an\narbitrary programmable manner.

Each\nsensor node forwards information about relevant features towards the sink where\nthe data is processed. Nevertheless, energy conservation is a key issue in the\ndesign of such networks and once a sensor exhausts its resources, it will be\ndropped from the network. This will lead to broken links and data loss. It is\ntherefore important to keep the network running for as long as possible by\npreserving the energy held by the nodes. Indeed, saving the quality of service\n(QoS) of a wireless sensor network for a long period is very important in order\nto ensure accurate data. Then, the area diagnosing will be more accurate. From\nanother side, packet transmission is the phase that consumes the highest amount\nof energy comparing to other activities in the network. Therefore, we can see\nthat the network topology has an important impact on energy efficiency, and\nthus on data and diagnosis accuracies. In this paper, we study and compare four\nnetwork topologies: distributed, hierarchical, centralized, and decentralized\ntopology and show their impact on the resulting estimation of diagnostics.

However, engineering such\nnext-step hints manually or via an expert model becomes infeasible if the space\nof possible states is too large. Therefore, several approaches have emerged to\ninfer next-step hints automatically, relying on past students' data. In\nparticular, the Hint Factory (Barnes & Stamper, 2008) recommends edits that are\nmost likely to guide students from their current state towards a correct\nsolution, based on what successful students in the past have done in the same\nsituation. Still, the Hint Factory relies on student data being available for\nany state a student might visit while solving the task, which is not the case\nfor some learning tasks, such as open-ended programming tasks. In this\ncontribution we provide a mathematical framework for edit-based hint policies\nand, based on this theory, propose a novel hint policy to provide edit hints in\nvast and sparsely populated state spaces. In particular, we extend the Hint\nFactory by considering data of past students in all states which are similar to\nthe student's current state and creating hints approximating the weighted\naverage of all these reference states.

Owing to the great importance of environment and\nhuman psychology in driving human behavior, and the ubiquity of technology in\nmodern life, there is a need to leverage the insights and capabilities of both\nfields together for nudging people towards a behavior that is optimal in some\nsense (personal or social). In this regard, the field of persuasive technology,\nwhich proposes to infuse technology with appropriate design and incentives\nusing insights from psychology, behavioral economics, and human-computer\ninteraction holds a lot of promise. Whilst persuasive technology is already\nbeing developed and is at play in many commercial applications, it can have the\ngreat social impact in the field of Information and Communication Technology\nfor Development (ICTD) which uses Information and Communication Technology\n(ICT) for human developmental ends such as education and health. In this paper\nwe will explore what persuasive technology is and how it can be used for the\nends of human development.

Furthermore, many economic\nforecasts predict a rising shortage of domestic STEM-trained professions in the\nUS for years to come. One potential solution to this deficit is to decrease the\nrates at which students leave STEM-related fields in higher education, as\ncurrently over half of all students intending to graduate with a STEM degree\neventually attrite. However, little quantitative research at scale has looked\nat causes of STEM attrition, let alone the use of machine learning to examine\nhow well this phenomenon can be predicted. In this paper, we detail our efforts\nto model and predict dropout from STEM fields using one of the largest known\ndatasets used for research on students at a traditional campus setting. Our\nresults suggest that attrition from STEM fields can be accurately predicted\nwith data that is routinely collected at universities using only information on\nstudents' first academic year. We also propose a method to model student STEM\nintentions for each academic term to better understand the timing of STEM\nattrition events.
