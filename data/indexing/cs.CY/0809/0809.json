And when talks are re-scheduled on short notice in case that a\nspeech is dropped out, attaining guests definitely wonder why the presenter is\ntalking about something that does not match the previously announced talk. In\nthis respect, we believe that the organization of a workshop in the classical\nsense must be reconsidered.
