One of the main challenges that the\nNetwork of National Educational Portals faces consists in finding effective\nways of sharing information that can promote knowledge transfer between members\nof the network. We argue that a key factor that prevents information sharing is\nthe use of performance metrics by portal responsibles to evaluate the results\nof their decisions. These metrics are highly sensitive, context-dependent, and\nproduced through non-standardized methods, all of which reduce the willingness\nof knowledge sharing. We present a different approach: based on the Network of\nNational Educational Portals case, we propose creating a comprehensive\ninformation system aimed at providing reliable and timely information in a\nsystematic fashion.

We find that these processes are very clearly separated\nby an inflection point. Using large data sets from both Groupon and\nLivingSocial we show how the model is able to predict the success of group\ndeals as a function of time. We find that Groupon deals are easier to predict\naccurately earlier in the deal lifecycle than LivingSocial deals due to the\nfinal number of deal purchases saturating quicker. One possible explanation for\nthis is that the incentive to socially propagate a deal is based on an\nindividual threshold in LivingSocial, whereas in Groupon it is based on a\ncollective threshold, which is reached very early. Furthermore, the personal\nbenefit of propagating a deal is also greater in LivingSocial.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jul 2011 18:14:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2011 21:56:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2011 00:18:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 00:09:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2011 04:44:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ye", "Mao", ""], ["Wang", "Chunyan", ""], ["Aperjis", "Christina", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""], ["Sandholm", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4628", "submitter": "Suhailan Safei", "authors": "Suhailan Safei, Mat Atar Mat Amin, Ahmad Nazari Mohd Rose and Mohd\n  Nordin Abdul Rahman", "title": "Instant e-Teaching Framework Model for Live Online Teaching", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8,\n  Issue 2, March 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Instant e-Teaching is a new concept that supplements e-Teaching and\ne-Learning environment in providing a full and comprehensive modern education\nstyles.

Although\nusers produce all contents, at the same time participation is commonly on a\nvoluntary basis, and largely incentivized by achievement of project's goals.\nThis means that users have to coordinate their actions and goals, in order to\nkeep themselves from leaving. While this situation is easily explainable for\nsmall groups of highly committed, like-minded individuals, little is known\nabout large-scale, heterogeneous projects, such as Wikipedia.\n  In this contribution we present a model of peer production in a large online\ncommunity. The model features a dynamic population of bounded confidence users,\nand an endogenous process of user departure. Using global sensitivity analysis,\nwe identify the most important parameters affecting the lifespan of user\nparticipation. We find that the model presents two distinct regimes, and that\nthe shift between them is governed by the bounded confidence parameter. For low\nvalues of this parameter, users depart almost immediately. For high values,\nhowever, the model produces a bimodal distribution of user lifespan. These\nresults suggest that user participation to online communities could be\nexplained in terms of group consensus, and provide a novel connection between\nmodels of opinion dynamics and commons-based peer production.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 03:52:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ciampaglia", "Giovanni Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5654", "submitter": "Georg Groh", "authors": "Georg Groh and Michele Brocco and Andreas Kleemann", "title": "Interest-Based vs. Social Person-Recommenders in Social Networking\n  Platforms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Social network based approaches to person recommendations are compared to\ninterest based approaches with the help of an empirical study on a large German\nsocial networking platform.
