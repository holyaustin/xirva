Novel quantum induced effects have been\npredicted in random graphs---where edges represent entangled links---and\nquantum computer algorithms have been proposed to offer enhancement for several\nnetwork problems. Here we review the results at the cutting edge, pinpointing\nthe similarities and the differences found at the intersection of these two\nfields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 19:00:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2018 19:38:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 19:34:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2019 09:59:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Biamonte", "Jacob", ""], ["Faccin", "Mauro", ""], ["De Domenico", "Manlio", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.08478", "submitter": "Kim Kaivanto", "authors": "Kim Kaivanto and Daniel Prince", "title": "Risks and Transaction Costs of Distributed-Ledger Fintech: Boundary\n  Effects and Consequences", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fintech business models based on distributed ledgers -- and their\nsmart-contract variants in particular -- offer the prospect of democratizing\naccess to faster, anywhere-accessible, lower cost, reliable-and-secure\nhigh-quality financial services. In addition to holding great, economically\ntransformative promise, these business models pose new, little-studied risks\nand transaction costs. However, these risks and transaction costs are not\nevident during the demonstration and testing phases of development, when\nadopters and users are drawn from the community of developers themselves, as\nwell as from among non-programmer fintech evangelists. Hence, when the new\nrisks and transaction costs become manifest -- as the fintech business models\nare rolled out across the wider economy -- the consequences may also appear to\nbe new and surprising. The present study represents an effort to get ahead of\nthese developments by delineating risks and transaction costs inherent in\ndistributed-ledger- and smart-contracts-based fintech business models. The\nanalysis focuses on code risk and moral-hazard risk, as well as on\nmixed-economy risks and the unintended consequences of replicating\nbricks-and-mortar-generation contract forms within the ultra-low\ntransaction-cost environment of fintech.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 19:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kaivanto", "Kim", ""], ["Prince", "Daniel", ""]]}]
