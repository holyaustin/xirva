One main contribution of this work\nis the setting of a framework for identifying the requirements of subsidies\ndistribution information systems. In the proposed approach, seven domains were\nidentified to build a Mobile Subsidizing Business Model (MSBM). Based on MSBM,\ndetailed requirements were gathered in three stages, with each having its\nappropriate methodology. In this work, we focus on the layered architecture\nimplementation of the subsidizing mobile system to breakdown the complexities,\nwhich are due to variations of mobile technologies, different business rules,\nand multiple distribution scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 21:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["El-Shishtawy", "T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.0047", "submitter": "Zubair Nabi Zubair Nabi", "authors": "Zubair Nabi and Atif Alvi", "title": "Clome: The Practical Implications of a Cloud-based Smart Home", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A rich body of work in recent years has advocated the use of cloud\ntechnologies within a home environment, but nothing has materialized so far in\nterms of real-world implementations.

Papert,\ndispleased with this inefficient learning process, championed physics\nmicroworlds, where students could experience a variety of laws of motion, from\nAristotle to Newton and Einstein or even new laws invented by the students\nthemselves. While often mistakenly seen as a game, Second Life (SL), the online\n3-D virtual world hosted by Linden Lab, imposes essentially no rules on the\nresidents beyond reasonable restrictions on improper behavior and the physical\nrules that guarantee its similitude to the real world. As a consequence, SL\nqualifies itself as an environment for personal discovery and exploration as\nproposed by constructivist theories. The physical laws are implemented through\nthe well-known physics engine Havok, whose design aims to provide game-players\na consistent, realistic environment. The Havok User Guide (2008) explicitly\nencourages developers to use several tricks to cheat the simulator in order to\nmake games funnier or easier to play. As it is shown in this study, SL physics\nis unexpectedly neither the Newtonian idealized physics nor a real world\nphysics virtualization, intentionally diverging from reality in such a way that\nit could be called hyper-real. As a matter of fact, if some of its features\nmake objects behave more realistically than real ones, certain quantities like\nenergy have a totally different meaning in SL as compared to physics.

With this aim, we\napply methods of Markov chains and Google matrix, for the analysis of the\nhyperlink networks of 24 Wikipedia language editions, and rank all their\narticles by PageRank, 2DRank and CheiRank algorithms. Using automatic\nextraction of people names, we obtain the top 100 historical figures, for each\nedition and for each algorithm. We investigate their spatial, temporal, and\ngender distributions in dependence of their cultural origins. Our study\ndemonstrates not only the existence of skewness with local figures, mainly\nrecognized only in their own cultures, but also the existence of global\nhistorical figures appearing in a large number of editions. By determining the\nbirth time and place of these persons, we perform an analysis of the evolution\nof such figures through 35 centuries of human history for each language, thus\nrecovering interactions and entanglement of cultures over time. We also obtain\nthe distributions of historical figures over world countries, highlighting\ngeographical aspects of cross-cultural links. Considering historical figures\nwho appear in multiple editions as interactions between cultures, we construct\na network of cultures and identify the most influential cultures according to\nthis network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2014 10:19:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 15:10:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Eom", "Young-Ho", ""], ["Arag\u00f3n", "Pablo", ""], ["Laniado", "David", ""], ["Kaltenbrunner", "Andreas", ""], ["Vigna", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Shepelyansky", "Dima L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7393", "submitter": "Kalpit Desai", "authors": "Kalpit V Desai, Roopesh Ranjan", "title": "Insights from the Wikipedia Contest (IEEE Contest for Data Mining 2011)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY physics.soc-ph stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The Wikimedia Foundation has recently observed that newly joining editors on\nWikipedia are increasingly failing to integrate into the Wikipedia editors'\ncommunity, i.e. the community is becoming increasingly harder to penetrate. To\nsustain healthy growth of the community, the Wikimedia Foundation aims to\nquantitatively understand the factors that determine the editing behavior, and\nexplain why most new editors become inactive soon after joining. As a step\ntowards this broader goal, the Wikimedia foundation sponsored the ICDM (IEEE\nInternational Conference for Data Mining) contest for the year 2011.\n  The objective for the participants was to develop models to predict the\nnumber of edits that an editor will make in future five months based on the\nediting history of the editor. Here we describe the approach we followed for\ndeveloping predictive models towards this goal, the results that we obtained\nand the modeling insights that we gained from this exercise. In addition,\ntowards the broader goal of Wikimedia Foundation, we also summarize the factors\nthat emerged during our model building exercise as powerful predictors of\nfuture editing activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 11:55:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Desai", "Kalpit V", ""], ["Ranjan", "Roopesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7796", "submitter": "Ovidiu-Andrei Schipor", "authors": "Ovidiu Schipor", "title": "Improving Computer Assisted Speech Therapy Through Speech Based Emotion\n  Recognition", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Speech therapy consists in a wide range of services whose aim is to prevent,\ndiagnose and treat different types of speech impairments. One of the most\nimportant conditions for obtaining favourable and steady results is the\n\"immersing\" of the subject as long as possible into therapeutic context: at\nhome, at school/work, on the street. Since nowadays portable computers tend to\nbecome habitual accessories, it seems a good idea to create virtual versions of\nhuman SLTs and to integrate them into these devices. However one of the main\ndistinctions between a Speech and Language Therapist (SLT) and a Computer Based\nSpeech Therapy System (CBST) arise from the field of emotion intelligence. The\ninability of current CBSTs to detect emotional state of human subjects leads to\ninadequate behavioural responses. Furthermore, this \"unresponsive\" behaviour is\nperceived as a lack of empathy and, especially when subjects are children,\nleads to negative emotional state such as frustration. Thus in this article we\npropose an original emotions recognition framework - named PhonEM - to be\nintegrated in our previous developed CBST - Logomon. The originality consists\nin both emotions representation (a fuzzy model) and detection (using only\nsubjects' speech stream). These exceptional restrictions along with the fuzzy\nrepresentation of emotions lie at the origin of our approach and make our task\na difficult and, in the same time, an innovative one. As far as we know, this\nis the first attempt to combine these techniques in order to improve assisted\nspeech therapy and the obtained results encourage as to further develop our\nCBST.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 08:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Schipor", "Ovidiu", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7806", "submitter": "Ovidiu-Andrei Schipor", "authors": "Ovidiu Andrei Schipor, Felicia Giza Belciug, Stefan-Gheorghe Pentiuc,\n  Cristian Eduard Belciug, Marian Nestor", "title": "Software Package with Exercises for Therapy of Children with Dyslalia", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a consistent set of exercises for children with\ndyslalia (dyslalia is a speech disorder that affect pronunciation of one ore\nmany sounds).
