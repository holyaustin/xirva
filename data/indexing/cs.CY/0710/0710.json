Whilst this is worrying, it is perhaps a\nrelatively minor concern compared with the risks arising from the use of poorly\nconstructed and/or untested spreadsheets in medicine, a practice that is\nalready occurring. This article is intended as a warning that the use of poorly\nconstructed and/or untested spreadsheets in clinical medicine cannot be\ntolerated. It supports this warning by reporting on potentially serious\nweaknesses found while testing a limited number of publicly available clinical\nspreadsheets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2007 19:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Croll", "Grenville J.", ""], ["Butler", "Raymond J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.1772", "submitter": "Flore Barcellini", "authors": "Flore Barcellini (INRIA Rocquencourt), Fran\\c{c}oise D\\'etienne (INRIA\n  Rocquencourt), Jean-Marie Burkhardt (INRIA Rocquencourt, LEI)", "title": "Cross-Participants : fostering design-use mediation in an Open Source\n  Software community", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Dans European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics (2007) 57-64", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC cs.SE", "license": null, "abstract": "  Motivation - This research aims at investigating emerging roles and forms of\nparticipation fostering design-use mediation during the Open Source Software\ndesign process Research approach - We compare online interactions for a\nsuccessful \"pushed-by-users\" design process with unsuccessful previous\nproposals. The methodology developed, articulate structural analyses of the\ndiscussions (organization of discussions, participation) to actions to the code\nand documentation made by participants to the project. We focus on the\nuseroriented and the developer-oriented mailing-lists of the Python project.\nFindings/Design - We find that key-participants, the cross-participants, foster\nthe design process and act as boundary spanners between the users and the\ndevelopers' communities. Research limitations/Implications - These findings can\nbe reinforced developing software to automate the structural analysis of\ndiscussions and actions to the code and documentation. Further analyses,\nsupported by these tools, will be necessary to generalise our results.\nOriginality/Value - The analysis of participation among the three interaction\nspaces of OSS design (discussion, documentation and implementation) is the main\noriginality of this work compared to other OSS research that mainly analyse one\nor two spaces. Take away message - Beside the idealistic picture that users may\nintervene freely in the process, OSS design is boost and framed by some\nkey-participants and specific rules and there can be barriers to users'\nparticipation\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2007 14:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Barcellini", "Flore", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["D\u00e9tienne", "Fran\u00e7oise", "", "INRIA\n  Rocquencourt"], ["Burkhardt", "Jean-Marie", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt, LEI"]]}, {"id": "0710.2228", "submitter": "Matus Medo", "authors": "Yi-Cheng Zhang, Matus Medo, Jie Ren, Tao Zhou, Tao Li, and Fan Yang", "title": "Recommendation model based on opinion diffusion", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Europhysics Letters 80 (2007) 68003", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/80/68003", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.IR physics.data-an", "license": null, "abstract": "  Information overload in the modern society calls for highly efficient\nrecommendation algorithms.

Unlike pure social networking\nsites (e.g., LinkedIn and Facebook), which allow users to articulate their\nonline professional and personal relationships, social media sites are not, for\nthe most part, aimed at helping users create or foster online relationships.\nInstead, we claim that social media users create social networks to express\ntheir tastes and interests, and use them to filter the vast stream of new\nsubmissions to find interesting content. Social networks, in fact, facilitate\nnew ways of interacting with information: what we call social browsing.
