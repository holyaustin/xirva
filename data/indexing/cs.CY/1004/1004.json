The Virtual learning environment that is presented here uses\ntwo agents: Virtual Tutor Agent (VTA), and Virtual Classmate Agent (VCA).\nDuring the learning process and depending on events happening in the\nenvironment, learner's emotions are changed. In this situation, learning style\nshould be revised according to the personality traits as well as the learner's\ncurrent emotions. VTA selects suitable learning style for the learners based on\ntheir personality traits. To improve the learning process, the system uses VCA\nin some of the learning steps. VCA is an intelligent agent and has its own\npersonality. It is designed so that it can present an attractive and real\nlearning environment in interaction with the learner. To recognize the\nlearner's personality, this system uses MBTI test and to obtain emotion values\nuses OCC model. Finally, the results of system tested in real environments show\nthat considering the human features in interaction with the learner increases\nlearning quality and satisfies the learner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Apr 2010 02:34:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2010 07:22:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fatahi", "Somayeh", ""], ["Ghasem-Aghaee", "Nasser", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1793", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "S.K.
