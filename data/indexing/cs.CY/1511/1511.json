As social media data can be obtained in near\nreal-time and at low cost, it is often used for \"now-casting\" indices such as\nlevels of flu activity or unemployment. The term \"social sensing\" is often used\nin this context to describe the idea that users act as \"sensors\", publicly\nreporting their health status or job losses. Sensor activity during a time\nperiod is then typically aggregated in a \"one tweet, one vote\" fashion by\nsimply counting. At the same time, researchers readily admit that social media\nusers are not a perfect representation of the actual population. Additionally,\nusers differ in the amount of details of their personal lives that they reveal.\nIntuitively, it should be possible to improve now-casting by assigning\ndifferent weights to different user groups.\n  In this paper, we ask \"How does social sensing actually work?\" or, more\nprecisely, \"Whom should we sense--and whom not--for optimal results?\". We\ninvestigate how different sampling strategies affect the performance of\nnow-casting of two common offline indices: flu activity and unemployment rate.\nWe show that now-casting can be improved by 1) applying user filtering\ntechniques and 2) selecting users with complete profiles. We also find that,\nusing the right type of user groups, now-casting performance does not degrade,\neven when drastically reducing the size of the dataset. More fundamentally, we\ndescribe which type of users contribute most to the accuracy by asking if\n\"babblers are better\".

Several researchers provided a\ndefinition but aspects of each definition are still problematic and simply can\nnot be applied to contemporary technologies. The approach of this article is to\nsample technologies using grounded theory, and obtain a definition for a\n`virtual world' that is directly applicable to technology. The obtained\ndefinition is compared with related work and used to classify advanced\ntechnologies, such as: a pseudo-persistent video game, a MANet, virtual and\nmixed reality, and the Metaverse. The results of this article include: a break\ndown of which properties set apart the various technologies; a definition that\nis validated by comparing it with other definitions; an ontology showing the\nrelation of the different complimentary terms and acronyms; and, the usage of\npseudo-persistence to categories those technologies which only mimic\npersistence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 18:05:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 May 2016 07:51:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Nevelsteen", "Kim J.

The last decades of research on network\nsteganography led to more than hundred techniques for hiding data in network\ntransmissions. However, previous research has shown that most of these hiding\ntechniques are either based on the same idea or introduce limited novelty,\nenabling the application of existing countermeasures. In this paper, we provide\na link between the field of creativity and network steganographic research. We\npropose a framework and a metric to help evaluating the creativity bound to a\ngiven hiding technique. This way, we support two sides of the scientific peer\nreview process as both authors and reviewers can use our framework to analyze\nthe novelty and applicability of hiding techniques.
