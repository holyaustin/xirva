It is thus of interest to\nunderstand how attention to novel items propagates and eventually fades among\nlarge populations. We have analyzed the dynamics of collective attention among\none million users of an interactive website -- \\texttt{digg.com} -- devoted to\nthousands of novel news stories. The observations can be described by a\ndynamical model characterized by a single novelty factor. Our measurements\nindicate that novelty within groups decays with a stretched-exponential law,\nsuggesting the existence of a natural time scale over which attention fades.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2007 22:02:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Fang", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1675", "submitter": "Kristina Lerman", "authors": "Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina Lerman", "title": "Exploiting Social Annotation for Automatic Resource Discovery", "comments": "6 pages, submitted to AAAI07 workshop on Information Integration on\n  the Web", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.DL", "license": null, "abstract": "  Information integration applications, such as mediators or mashups, that\nrequire access to information resources currently rely on users manually\ndiscovering and integrating them in the application. Manual resource discovery\nis a slow process, requiring the user to sift through results obtained via\nkeyword-based search. Although search methods have advanced to include evidence\nfrom document contents, its metadata and the contents and link structure of the\nreferring pages, they still do not adequately cover information sources --\noften called ``the hidden Web''-- that dynamically generate documents in\nresponse to a query. The recently popular social bookmarking sites, which allow\nusers to annotate and share metadata about various information sources, provide\nrich evidence for resource discovery. In this paper, we describe a\nprobabilistic model of the user annotation process in a social bookmarking\nsystem del.icio.us. We then use the model to automatically find resources\nrelevant to a particular information domain. Our experimental results on data\nobtained from \\emph{del.icio.us} show this approach as a promising method for\nhelping automate the resource discovery task.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:24:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Plangprasopchok", "Anon", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1676", "submitter": "Kristina Lerman", "authors": "Kristina Lerman, Anon Plangprasopchok and Chio Wong", "title": "Personalizing Image Search Results on Flickr", "comments": "12 pages, submitted to AAAI07 workshop on Intelligent Information\n  Personalization", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.CY cs.DL cs.HC", "license": null, "abstract": "  The social media site Flickr allows users to upload their photos, annotate\nthem with tags, submit them to groups, and also to form social networks by\nadding other users as contacts. Flickr offers multiple ways of browsing or\nsearching it. One option is tag search, which returns all images tagged with a\nspecific keyword. If the keyword is ambiguous, e.g., ``beetle'' could mean an\ninsect or a car, tag search results will include many images that are not\nrelevant to the sense the user had in mind when executing the query. We claim\nthat users express their photography interests through the metadata they add in\nthe form of contacts and image annotations. We show how to exploit this\nmetadata to personalize search results for the user, thereby improving search\nperformance. First, we show that we can significantly improve search precision\nby filtering tag search results by user's contacts or a larger social network\nthat includes those contact's contacts. Secondly, we describe a probabilistic\nmodel that takes advantage of tag information to discover latent topics\ncontained in the search results. The users' interests can similarly be\ndescribed by the tags they used for annotating their images. The latent topics\nfound by the model are then used to personalize search results by finding\nimages on topics that are of interest to the user.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Apr 2007 23:31:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Plangprasopchok", "Anon", ""], ["Wong", "Chio", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3316", "submitter": "Ciro Cattuto", "authors": "Ciro Cattuto, Andrea Baldassarri, Vito D.
