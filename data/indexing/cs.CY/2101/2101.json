Using 20 months of Twitter data comprising over 1 million\ntweets linking to a petition, we perform analyses of networks constructed of\npetitions and supporters on Twitter, revealing implicit social dynamics\ntherein. We find that Twitter users do not exclusively share petitions on one\nissue nor do they share exclusively popular petitions. Among the over 240,000\nTwitter users, we find latent support groups, with the most central users\nprimarily being politically active \"average\" individuals.

Prior studies investigating the link between\ncrowdfunding and innovation do not compare traditional and crowdfunded products\nand so while claims that crowdfunding supports innovation are theoretically\nsound, they lack empirical backing. We address this gap using a unique dataset\nof board games, an industry with significant crowdfunding activity in recent\nyears.

Here, we examine the effects of\ndouble-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of\n5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning\nRepresentations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its\nreviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in\n2018.

Specifically, papers rejected in\nthe single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the\ndouble-blind format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies\npoorer quality papers.

In this paper, an online rating system using distributed ledger\ntechnologies has been presented as the proposed system to solve all the\nweaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely\ndecentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution.\nDistributed ledger technologies have different variants. Among distributed\nledger technologies, blockchain technology has been used in the proposed rating\nsystem because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online\nrating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain\nplatforms that have a public permission network. In this system, the raters\ncannot rate unless they submit a request to the system and be authorized to\ntake part in the online product rating process. The important feature of the\nEthereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to\nwrite the rating contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of\nAuthority consensus mechanisms, all rating transactions are approved by the\nsurveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction is sent\nto the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating\ntransaction. However, since this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be\nused in the rating system.

Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which\nlink social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines\nfor decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation\nwith crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support\ntheir forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for\nthe estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series\nforecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the\nemergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders\ncan be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when\nlimited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).\nOriginality.

A DPIA is a\nstructured risk analysis that identifies and evaluates possible consequences of\ndata processing relevant to fundamental rights and describes the measures\nenvisaged to address these risks or expresses the inability to do so.

The DPIA starts with an analysis of the processing\ncontext and some expected use cases. Then, the processing activities are\ndescribed by defining a realistic processing purpose. This is followed by the\nlegal assessment and threshold analysis. Finally, we analyse the weak points,\nthe risks and determine appropriate protective measures.

This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the\ndetails in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some\nsensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly\nprohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy\nis generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper\nlevels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too\ndetailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final\nprediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can\nreveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection\nstrategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jan 2021 20:40:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alt\u0131n", "Mahsun", ""], ["G\u00fcrsoy", "Furkan", ""], ["Xu", "Lina", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.07897", "submitter": "Vikram Sharma Mailthody", "authors": "Vikram Sharma Mailthody and James Wei and Nicholas Chen and Mohammad\n  Behnia and Ruihao Yao and Qihao Wang and Vedant Agrawal and Churan He and\n  Lijian Wang and Leihao Chen and Amit Agarwal and Edward Richter and Wen-Mei\n  Hwu and Christopher W.

However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and\nreport both the quality of software features and VRISE intensity\nquantitatively. The VRNQ was developed to assess the quality of VR software in\nterms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty\nparticipants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22\nnon-gamers) for the study. They participated in 3 different VR sessions until\nthey felt weary or discomfort and subsequently filled in the VRNQ. Our results\ndemonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as it has good\nconvergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR\nsessions should be between 55-70 minutes when the VR software meets or exceeds\nthe parsimonious cut-offs of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the\nVR system. Also. the gaming experience does not seem to affect how long VR\nsessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially\nmodulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not.\nFinally, deeper immersion, better quality of graphics and sound, and more\nhelpful in-game instructions and prompts were found to reduce VRISE intensity.\nThe VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality of VR\nsoftware features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and\nparsimonious cut-offs may appraise the suitability of VR software.

GES 1point5 is specifically designed to\nestimate the carbon footprint of research activities in France. It operates at\nthe scale of research labs, i.e. laboratoires, which are the social structures\naround which research is organized in France and the smallest decision making\nentities in the French research system. The application allows French research\nlabs to compute their own carbon footprint along a standardized, open protocol.\nThe data collected in a rapidly growing network of labs will be used as part of\nthe Labos 1point5 project to estimate France's research carbon footprint. At\nthe time of submitting this manuscript, 89 research labs had engaged with GES\n1point5 to estimate their greenhouse gas emissions.

Current research efforts\nfocus on using machine learning for detecting and eliminating cyberbullying.\nAlthough most of the studies have been conducted on English texts for the\ndetection of cyberbullying, there are few studies in Turkish. Limited methods\nand algorithms were also used in studies conducted on the Turkish language. In\naddition, the scope and performance of the algorithms used to classify the\ntexts containing cyberbullying is different, and this reveals the importance of\nusing an appropriate algorithm. The aim of this study is to compare the\nperformance of different machine learning algorithms in detecting Turkish\nmessages containing cyberbullying. In this study, nineteen different\nclassification algorithms were used to identify texts containing cyberbullying\nusing Turkish natural language processing techniques. Precision, recall,\naccuracy and F1 score values were used to evaluate the performance of\nclassifiers. It was determined that the Light Gradient Boosting Model (LGBM)\nalgorithm showed the best performance with 90.788% accuracy and 90.949% F1\nScore value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 18:28:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ates", "Emre Cihan", ""], ["Bostanci", "Erkan", ""], ["Guzel", "Mehmet Serdar", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12725", "submitter": "Juste Raimbault", "authors": "Juste Raimbault", "title": "Strong coupling between scales in a multi-scalar model of urban dynamics", "comments": "15 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.CY cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Urban evolution processes occur at different scales, with intricate\ninteractions between levels and relatively distinct type of processes. To what\nextent actual urban dynamics include an actual strong coupling between scales,\nin the sense of both top-down and bottom-up feedbacks, remains an open issue\nwith important practical implications for the sustainable management of\nterritories. We introduce in this paper a multi-scalar simulation model of\nurban growth, coupling a system of cities interaction model at the macroscopic\nscale with morphogenesis models for the evolution of urban form at the scale of\nmetropolitan areas. Strong coupling between scales is achieved through an\nupdate of model parameters at each scale depending on trajectories at the other\nscale. The model is applied and explored on synthetic systems of cities.\nSimulation results show a non-trivial effect of the strong coupling. As a\nconsequence, an optimal action on policy parameters such as containing urban\nsprawl is shifted. We also run a multi-objective optimization algorithm on the\nmodel, showing showing that compromise between scales are captured. Our\napproach opens new research directions towards more operational urban dynamics\nmodels including a strong feedback between scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 18:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Raimbault", "Juste", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12737", "submitter": "I.
