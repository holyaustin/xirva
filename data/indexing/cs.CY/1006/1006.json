While many different centrality measures exist, most of them\napply to static networks. Most networks, on the other hand, are dynamic in\nnature, evolving over time through the addition or deletion of nodes and edges.\nA popular approach to analyzing such networks represents them by a static\nnetwork that aggregates all edges observed over some time period. This\napproach, however, under or overestimates centrality of some nodes. We address\nthis problem by introducing a novel centrality metric for dynamic network\nanalysis. This metric exploits an intuition that in order for one node in a\ndynamic network to influence another over some period of time, there must exist\na path that connects the source and destination nodes through intermediaries at\ndifferent times. We demonstrate on an example network that the proposed metric\nleads to a very different ranking than analysis of an equivalent static\nnetwork. We use dynamic centrality to study a dynamic citations network and\ncontrast results to those reached by static network analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 23:52:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Kang", "Jeon Hyung", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0846", "submitter": "Ashley Smith", "authors": "Ahmed Elmorshidy", "title": "Holographic Projection Technology: The World is Changing", "comments": "Submitted to Journal of Telecommunications, see\n  http://sites.google.com/site/journaloftelecommunications/volume-2-issue-2-may-2010", "journal-ref": "Journal of Telecommunications,Volume 2, Issue 2, pp104-112, May\n  2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This research papers examines the new technology of Holographic Projections.\nIt highlights the importance and need of this technology and how it represents\nthe new wave in the future of technology and communications, the different\napplication of the technology, the fields of life it will dramatically affect\nincluding business, education, telecommunication and healthcare.

This can be achieved by\nbundling the resources in a known and prescribed fashion called Learning\nobjects. Learning Objects are composed of two aspects namely \"Learning\" and\n\"Object\". The Learning aspect of Learning objects refers to Education. Since\nEducation is a process so the primary aim of learning objects tends to be\nfacilitating acquisition, assessment and conversion of content into Learning\nobjects while fostering the assimilation of these Learning objects into\nlearning modules and instruction. The Object part of Learning objects relates\nto the Digital Electronic format of the resources i.e. to say that it deals\nwith the physical resource that forms the Learning objects. The objects in LOs\nare analogous to objects used in object-oriented modeling (OOM). The analogy\nhelps visualize how LOs will be packaged, processed and transported across the\ndigital library as well as utilized in course building. OOM concepts such as\nencapsulation, classification, polymorphism, inheritance and reuse can be\nborrowed to describe the operations on LOs in the digital library. Thus, the\naim of this paper is threefolds. Firstly, to discuss the background of this\nresearch and the concept of Learning Objects. Secondly, to provide a framework\nfor adaptive mechanism for the retrieval of Learning Objects and thirdly to\nhighlight the benefits that this new proposed framework shall bring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jun 2010 11:01:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Chawla", "Sonal", ""], ["Singla", "R.

Over several decades, social\nscientists have been interested in the idea that similarity breeds connection:\nprecisely known as \"homophily\". Homophily has been extensively studied in the\nsocial sciences and refers to the idea that users in a social system tend to\nbond more with ones who are similar to them than to ones who are dissimilar.\nThe key observation is that homophily structures the ego-networks of\nindividuals and impacts their communication behavior. It is therefore likely to\neffect the mechanisms in which information propagates among them. To this\neffect, we investigate the interplay between homophily along diverse user\nattributes and the information diffusion process on social media. In our\napproach, we first extract diffusion characteristics---corresponding to the\nbaseline social graph as well as graphs filtered on different user attributes\n(e.g. location, activity). Second, we propose a Dynamic Bayesian Network based\nframework to predict diffusion characteristics at a future time. Third, the\nimpact of attribute homophily is quantified by the ability of the predicted\ncharacteristics in explaining actual diffusion, and external variables,\nincluding trends in search and news. Experimental results on a large Twitter\ndataset demonstrate that choice of the homophilous attribute can impact the\nprediction of information diffusion, given a specific metric and a topic. In\nmost cases, attribute homophily is able to explain the actual diffusion and\nexternal trends by ~15-25% over cases when homophily is not considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 04:19:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["De Choudhury", "Munmun", ""], ["Sundaram", "Hari", ""], ["John", "Ajita", ""], ["Seligmann", "Doree Duncan", ""], ["Kelliher", "Aisling", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.2082", "submitter": "Harco Leslie Hendric Spits Warnars", "authors": "Chairil Anwar, H.L.H Spits Warnars", "title": "Sistem Informasi Akademik Online Sebagai Penunjang Sistem Perkuliahan", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": "Information System National Conference (KNSI) 2009, University of\n  Islam Indonesia, Yogyakarta, 17 Januari 2009", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The development of Internet technology give a chance for application in all\nkind of humans activity include education specially for higher education in\nuniversity in order to increase education quality.
