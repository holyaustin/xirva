Recently, concerns have been raised about\nwhether the process of exploration could be viewed as unfair, placing too much\nburden on certain individuals or groups. Motivated by these concerns, we\ninitiate the study of the externalities of exploration - the undesirable side\neffects that the presence of one party may impose on another - under the linear\ncontextual bandits model. We introduce the notion of a group externality,\nmeasuring the extent to which the presence of one population of users impacts\nthe rewards of another. We show that this impact can in some cases be negative,\nand that, in a certain sense, no algorithm can avoid it. We then study\nexternalities at the individual level, interpreting the act of exploration as\nan externality imposed on the current user of a system by future users. This\ndrives us to ask under what conditions inherent diversity in the data makes\nexplicit exploration unnecessary. We build on a recent line of work on the\nsmoothed analysis of the greedy algorithm that always chooses the action that\ncurrently looks optimal, improving on prior results to show that a greedy\napproach almost matches the best possible Bayesian regret rate of any other\nalgorithm on the same problem instance whenever the diversity conditions hold,\nand that this regret is at most $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/3})$. Returning to group-level\neffects, we show that under the same conditions, negative group externalities\nessentially vanish under the greedy algorithm.

In this context, we introduce a\ndata science workflow allowing for fine-grained analysis of academic\nperformance correlates that captures the subtle differences in students'\nsensitivities to these factors. Leveraging the Local Interpretable\nModel-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm from the toolbox of Explainable\nArtificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the proposed pipeline yields groups\nof students having similar academic attainment indicators, rather than similar\nfeatures (e.g. familial background) as typically practiced in prior studies. As\na proof-of-concept case study, a rich longitudinal dataset is selected to\nevaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach versus a standard\nregression model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jun 2018 11:19:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2018 04:39:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2020 11:25:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2020 11:30:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sargsyan", "Anahit", ""], ["Karapetyan", "Areg", ""], ["Woon", "Wei Lee", ""], ["Alshamsi", "Aamena", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.02711", "submitter": "Bogdan Kulynych", "authors": "Bogdan Kulynych, Rebekah Overdorf, Carmela Troncoso, Seda G\\\"urses", "title": "POTs: Protective Optimization Technologies", "comments": "Appears in Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency\n  (FAT* 2020).

Several\nrecent works have focused on fairness with respect to a specific metric,\nmodeled the corresponding fair classification problem as a constrained\noptimization problem, and developed tailored algorithms to solve them. Despite\nthis, there still remain important metrics for which we do not have fair\nclassifiers and many of the aforementioned algorithms do not come with\ntheoretical guarantees; perhaps because the resulting optimization problem is\nnon-convex. The main contribution of this paper is a new meta-algorithm for\nclassification that takes as input a large class of fairness constraints, with\nrespect to multiple non-disjoint sensitive attributes, and which comes with\nprovable guarantees. This is achieved by first developing a meta-algorithm for\na large family of classification problems with convex constraints, and then\nshowing that classification problems with general types of fairness constraints\ncan be reduced to those in this family. We present empirical results that show\nthat our algorithm can achieve near-perfect fairness with respect to various\nfairness metrics, and that the loss in accuracy due to the imposed fairness\nconstraints is often small.

Then, we analyze when the relative user value of BEVs is\nexpected to exceed ICEVs as the energy density and cost of batteries improve\nbecause of ongoing technological change. Our analysis demonstrates that the\nrelative value of BEVs is lower than that of ICEVs because BEVs have high\nbattery cost and high cost of time spent recharging despite high torque, high\nfuel efficiency, and low fuel cost. Moreover, we found the relative value\ndifferences between BEVs and ICEVs are found to be less in high performance\nlarge cars than in low performance compact cars because BEVs can achieve high\nacceleration performance more easily than ICEVs. In addition, this study\npredicts that in approximately 2050, high performance large BEVs could have\nhigher relative value than high performance large ICEVs because of\ntechnological improvements in batteries; however low performance compact BEVs\nare still very likely to have significantly lower user value than comparable\nICEVs until well beyond 2050.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 04:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Woo", "JongRoul", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.06967", "submitter": "Marco De Nadai", "authors": "Marco Mamei, Francesca Pancotto, Marco De Nadai, Bruno Lepri, Michele\n  Vescovi, Franco Zambonelli, Alex Pentland", "title": "Is social capital associated with synchronization in human\n  communication?

Finally, in light of discussions about increased\nspending on infrastructure development by the federal government, we explore\nhow our approach generalizes beyond Flint to other municipalities nationwide.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Jun 2018 13:04:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Aug 2018 17:10:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Abernethy", "Jacob", ""], ["Chojnacki", "Alex", ""], ["Farahi", "Arya", ""], ["Schwartz", "Eric", ""], ["Webb", "Jared", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.10744", "submitter": "Kamal Karkonasasi", "authors": "Kamal Karkonasasi, Cheah Yu-N, Seyed Aliakbar Mousavi", "title": "Intention to Use SMS Vaccination Reminder and Management System among\n  Health Centers in Malaysia: The Mediating Effect of Attitude", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this study is to find out influential factors of intention to\nuse the proposed system among health centers by considering the technology\nacceptance model as the underlying theory. The proposed model of this study is\ntested using data collected from self-directed questionnaires filled up by 70\nnurses in government hospitals and government clinics in Malaysia. A research\nmethod, which is based on the multi-analytical approach of Multiple Regression\nAnalysis and Artificial Neural Networks, helps to refine the results of this\nstudy. The compatibility of the proposed system only has a significant and\npositive effect on attitude to use the system among other factors. Moreover,\nhealth centers' intention to use the system is further influenced by their\nperceived usefulness than their attitude to use. The mediating effect of\nAttitude is also proved. However, there is not any statistically significant\ndifference in Intention scores accounting for the participants' demographic\ncharacteristics. The implication of this study is that by developing the\nsystem, which fits to the current procedures of health centers, we give them\npositive feelings.
