We find that the web is conservative in judging talent and\nthe overall fitness distribution is exponential, showing low variability. The\nsmall variance in talent, however, is enough to lead to experience\ndistributions with high variance: The preferential attachment mechanism\namplifies these small biases and leads to heavy-tailed power-law (PL) inbound\ndegree distributions over all pages, as well as over pages that are of the same\nage. The balancing act between experience and talent on the web allows newly\nintroduced pages with novel and interesting content to grow quickly and surpass\nolder pages. In this regard, it is much like what we observe in high-mobility\nand meritocratic societies: People with entitlement continue to have access to\nthe best resources, but there is just enough screening for fitness that allows\nfor talented winners to emerge and join the ranks of the leaders. Finally, we\nshow that the fitness estimates have potential practical applications in\nranking query results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2009 23:11:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kong", "Joseph S.", ""], ["Sarshar", "Nima", ""], ["Roychowdhury", "Vwani P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0498", "submitter": "Bruno Goncalves", "authors": "Bruno Goncalves and Jose J.

In particular, we show\nthat the diversity of sites visited by individual users is smaller and more\nbroadly distributed than predicted by the PageRank model; that link traffic is\nmore broadly distributed than predicted; and that the time between consecutive\nvisits to the same site by a user is less broadly distributed than predicted.\nTo account for these discrepancies, we introduce a more realistic navigation\nmodel in which agents maintain individual lists of bookmarks that are used as\nteleportation targets. The model can also account for branching, a traffic\nproperty caused by browser features such as tabs and the back button. The model\nreproduces aggregate traffic patterns such as site popularity, while also\ngenerating more accurate predictions of diversity, link traffic, and return\ntime distributions. This model for the first time allows us to capture the\nextreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements while explaining the\nmore narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Jan 2009 15:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Goncalves", "Bruno", ""], ["Meiss", "Mark R.", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jose J.", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3929", "submitter": "Marko A.
