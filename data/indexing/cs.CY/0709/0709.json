While these\nrelationships are typically intermittent, previous research has used network\nrepresentations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals.\nHowever, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus\ninhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution.\nWe have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology\nthus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this\ntemporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We\nshow that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free,\nleading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals.\nWhile previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in\nscale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free\nconnectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition,\nwe show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of\nnon-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for\nsustaining time-expiring information through a network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 13:14:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kostakos", "Vassilis", ""], ["O'Neill", "Eamonn", ""], ["Penn", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0896", "submitter": "Michael J.
