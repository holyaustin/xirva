We do so by determining the performance\nof three different strategies that can be utilized to maximize attention. The\nfirst one prioritizes novelty while the second emphasizes popularity. A third\nstrategy looks myopically into the future and prioritizes stories that are\nexpected to generate the most clicks within the next few minutes. We show that\nthe first two strategies should be selected on the basis of the rate of novelty\ndecay, while the third strategy performs sub-optimally in most cases. We also\ndemonstrate that the relative performance of the first two strategies as a\nfunction of the rate of novelty decay changes abruptly around a critical value,\nresembling a phase transition in the physical world. 1\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2008 19:46:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Fang", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.2317", "submitter": "Christophe Prieur", "authors": "Christophe Prieur (LIAFA), Dominique Cardon, Jean-Samuel Beuscart,\n  Nicolas Pissard, Pascal Pons (LIAFA)", "title": "The Stength of Weak cooperation: A Case Study on Flickr", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": null, "abstract": "  Web 2.0 works with the principle of weak cooperation, where a huge amount of\nindividual contributions build solid and structured sources of data.
