Their capacity for analysis and problem-solving has\nincreased substantially since then with hardware and software being able to\nmanage large amounts of data. The beginning of the 2000s brought better\ntechnologies for data visualisation and intuitive software products and\nnowadays they are being used to design and manipulate highly complex urban\nsystems. However, ontological and epistemological questions remain about the\nnature of urban environments. What do we know about cities - and what is a city\nexactly? What theoretical models can be applied to the study of cities? How do\nwe translate a city into data? What type of information really matters and what\ndo we want to communicate with them? What are the implications of computer\nmodelling for urban planning and design? This paper reviews how digital\ntechnologies have been used to shape our understanding of cities and how they\nimpact the design and planning of cities. The point of depart is a scrutiny of\nthe emergence of modern planning in the nineteenth century when cities became a\nscientific subject. A range of theories and concepts of the urban form and\nurban growth developed during the twentieth century will be presented and then\nlinked to the first investigations involving the use of the computer for\nmodelling and planning. The paper concludes with some discussions around the\ninteraction of computing and urban theories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 10:02:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2013 16:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Lanci", "Gloria", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0377", "submitter": "Nader Ale Ebrahim", "authors": "Arezoo Aghaei Chadegani and Hadi Salehi and Melor Md Yunus and Hadi\n  Farhadi and Masood Fooladi and Maryam Farhadi and Nader Ale Ebrahim", "title": "A Comparison between Two Main Academic Literature Collections: Web of\n  Science and Scopus Databases", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Asian Social Science vol. 9, no. 5, pp. 18-26, April 27, 2013", "doi": "10.5539/ass.v9n5p18", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Nowadays, the worlds scientific community has been publishing an enormous\nnumber of papers in different scientific fields.

We first analyze these data sets to understand mobility patterns,\nhome and work locations, and social ties between users. We then develop an\nefficient algorithm for matching users with similar mobility patterns,\nconsidering a range of constraints. The solution provides an upper bound to the\npotential reduction of cars in a city that can be achieved by ride-sharing. We\nuse our framework to understand the different constraints and city\ncharacteristics on this potential benefit. For example, our study shows that\ntraffic in the city of Madrid can be reduced by 59% if users are willing to\nshare a ride with people who live and work within 1 km; if they can only accept\na pick-up and drop-off delay up to 10 minutes, this potential benefit drops to\n24%; if drivers also pick up passengers along the way, this number increases to\n53%. If users are willing to ride only with people they know (\"friends\" in the\nCDR and OSN data sets), the potential of ride-sharing becomes negligible; if\nthey are willing to ride with friends of friends, the potential reduction is up\nto 31%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 May 2013 17:53:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 11:44:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2014 23:02:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Cici", "Blerim", ""], ["Markopoulou", "Athina", ""], ["Fr\u00edas-Mart\u00ednez", "Enrique", ""], ["Laoutaris", "Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.3978", "submitter": "Puneet Kumar Mr.", "authors": "Puneet Kumar, Dharminder Kumar", "title": "A Conceptual E-Governance Framework for Improving Child Immunization\n  Process in India", "comments": "Published with International Journal of Computer Applications (IJCA)", "journal-ref": "Puneet Kumar, Dharminder Kumar.

Secondly, it aims for extreme\nsecurity measures to analyze and evaluate human threats related assessment\nmethods for employee screening in certain high-risk situations using cognitive\nanalysis technology, in particular functional magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI). The significance of this research is also to counter human rights and\nethical dilemmas by presenting a set of ethical and professional guidelines.\nThe main objective of this work is to analyze related risks, identify\ncountermeasures and present recommendations to develop a security awareness\nculture that will allow cloud providers to utilize effectively the benefits of\nthis advanced techniques without sacrificing system security.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 16:59:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sahito", "Farhan Hyder", ""], ["Slany", "Wolfgang", ""]]}]
