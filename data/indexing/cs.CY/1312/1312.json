In this\npaper, we analyze in detail the temporal aspect of trends and trend-setters in\nSina Weibo, contrasting it with earlier observations in Twitter. We find that\nthere is a vast difference in the content shared in China when compared to a\nglobal social network such as Twitter. In China, the trends are created almost\nentirely due to the retweets of media content such as jokes, images and videos,\nunlike Twitter where it has been shown that the trends tend to have more to do\nwith current global events and news stories. We take a detailed look at the\nformation, persistence and decay of trends and examine the key topics that\ntrend in Sina Weibo. One of our key findings is that retweets are much more\ncommon in Sina Weibo and contribute a lot to creating trends. When we look\ncloser, we observe that most trends in Sina Weibo are due to the continuous\nretweets of a small percentage of fraudulent accounts. These fake accounts are\nset up to artificially inflate certain posts, causing them to shoot up into\nSina Weibo's trending list, which are in turn displayed as the most popular\ntopics to users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 22:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Louis Lei", ""], ["Asur", "Sitaram", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0801", "submitter": "Suranjan Ganguly", "authors": "Pramit Ghosh, Debotosh Bhattacherjee and Soma Datta", "title": "Adaptive Intelligent Controller for Household Cooling Systems", "comments": "6 pages, Conference", "journal-ref": "International Conference on Integrated Intelligent Computing-\n  ICIIC 2010 ISBN:978-0-7695-4152-5/10", "doi": "10.1109/ICIIC.2010.24", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a household cooling system controller which is adaptive\nand intelligent in nature.
