First, we argue that ethics-based auditing can improve the\nquality of decision making, increase user satisfaction, unlock growth\npotential, enable law-making, and relieve human suffering. Second, we highlight\ncurrent best practices to support the design and implementation of ethics-based\nauditing: To be feasible and effective, ethics-based auditing should take the\nform of a continuous and constructive process, approach ethical alignment from\na system perspective, and be aligned with public policies and incentives for\nethically desirable behaviour. Third, we identify and discuss the constraints\nassociated with ethics-based auditing. Only by understanding and accounting for\nthese constraints can ethics-based auditing facilitate ethical alignment of AI,\nwhile enabling society to reap the full economic and social benefits of\nautomation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 11:39:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mokander", "Jakob", ""], ["Floridi", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.00030", "submitter": "Sara Lafia", "authors": "Sara Lafia, Andrea Thomer, David Bleckley, Dharma Akmon, Libby\n  Hemphill", "title": "Leveraging Machine Learning to Detect Data Curation Activities", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures.

Finally, the\nrationality of the predicted behaviors by the DQN is further analyzed in\ncombination with group emotion, and the final combat behavior of the agent is\ndetermined. The method proposed in this paper is verified through several\ndifferent settings of experiments. The results prove that emotions have a vital\nimpact on the group combat, and positive emotional states are more conducive to\ncombat.

It is implicitly assumed that their\nenvironmental burden is negligible compared to the positive impacts they can\ngenerate. In this paper, we present a parametric framework based on hardware\nprofiles to evaluate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of IoT edge devices.\nWe exploit our framework in three ways. First, we apply it on four use cases to\nevaluate their respective production carbon footprint. Then, we show that the\nheterogeneity inherent to IoT edge devices must be considered as the production\ncarbon footprint between simple and complex devices can vary by a factor of\nmore than 150x. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint induced by\nthe worldwide production of IoT edge devices through a macroscopic analysis\nover a 10-year period. Results range from 22 to 562 MtCO2-eq/year in 2027\ndepending on the deployment scenarios.

We compared the results of our use cases with the few\nreports available from Google and Apple, which suggest that our estimates could\nbe revised upwards by a factor around 2x to compensate for the truncation\nerror.

We find that structural inequalities and\ncentrality patterns in real hiring networks are best reproduced by a mechanism\nof global placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a particular\ninstitution in proportion to the number of previously drawn hires anywhere. On\nthe other hand, network measures of biased visibility are better recapitulated\nby a mechanism of local placement power, in which a new hire is drawn from a\nparticular institution in proportion to the number of its previous hires\nalready present at the hiring institution. These contrasting results suggest\nthat the underlying structural mechanism reinforcing hierarchies in faculty\nhiring networks is a mixture of global and local preference for institutional\nprestige. Under these dynamics, we show that each institution's position in the\nhierarchy is remarkably stable, due to a dynamic competition that\noverwhelmingly favors more prestigious institutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 May 2021 21:02:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Eun", ""], ["Clauset", "Aaron", ""], ["Larremore", "Daniel B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.02980", "submitter": "Kenneth Holstein", "authors": "Hong Shen, Alicia DeVos, Motahhare Eslami, Kenneth Holstein", "title": "Everyday algorithm auditing: Understanding the power of everyday users\n  in surfacing harmful algorithmic behaviors", "comments": "The co-first and co-senior authors contributed equally to this work", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "27414781 27414781 27414781", "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  A growing body of literature has proposed formal approaches to audit\nalgorithmic systems for biased and harmful behaviors.

The present work experimentally explores five\nnovel research questions at the intersection of the \"Who,\" \"What,\" and \"How\" of\nfairness perceptions. Specifically, we present the results of a multi-factor\nconjoint analysis study that quantifies the effects of the specific context in\nwhich a question is asked, the framing of the given question, and who is\nanswering it. Our results broadly suggest that the \"Who\" and \"What,\" at least,\nmatter in ways that are 1) not easily explained by any one theoretical\nperspective, 2) have critical implications for how perceptions of fairness\nshould be measured and/or integrated into algorithmic decision-making systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 May 2021 15:31:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hannan", "Jacqueline", ""], ["Chen", "Huei-Yen Winnie", ""], ["Joseph", "Kenneth", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.04462", "submitter": "Kenneth Joseph", "authors": "Kenneth Joseph, Jonathan Howard Morgan", "title": "Friend or Foe: A Review and Synthesis of Computational Models of the\n  Identity Labeling Problem", "comments": "Accepted at Journal of Mathematical Sociology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/0022250X.2021.1923016", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the identity labeling problem - given an individual in a social\nsituation, can we predict what identity(ies) they will be labeled with by\nsomeone else?

Among all the proposed KT\nmethods, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and its variants are by far the most\neffective ones due to the high flexibility of the neural network. However, DKT\noften ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills,\nreasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to\nthe lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for\nadaptive learning. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we proposed\nLeveled Attentive KNowledge TrAcing (LANA), which firstly uses a novel\nstudent-related features extractor (SRFE) to distill students' unique inherent\nproperties from their respective interactive sequences. Secondly, the pivot\nmodule was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural\nnetwork on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the\nperformance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response\nTheory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by\ntheir ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign\ndifferent encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module\nreconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning\nspecialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on two real-world large-scale datasets demonstrated that\nour proposed LANA improves the AUC score by at least 1.00% (i.e. EdNet 1.46%\nand RAIEd2020 1.00%), substantially surpassing the other State-Of-The-Art KT\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2021 02:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Yuhao", ""], ["Li", "Xihua", ""], ["Cao", "Yunbo", ""], ["Zhao", "Xuemin", ""], ["Ye", "Qing", ""], ["Lv", "Jiancheng", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.06267", "submitter": "Joshua Ellul", "authors": "Joshua Ellul, Stephen McCarthy, Trevor Sammut, Juanita Brockdorff,\n  Matthew Scerri, Gordon J.

The connected lab complex called the\n\"Smart Lab Bubble\" concept we present here could be viewed or applied in\ndifferent perspectives to engineer the real need of the time for the\nsustainability of research in commercial agriculture. Further, it could be\nadopted in research in other life science areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2021 15:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Abeysiriwardana", "Prabath Chaminda", ""], ["Jayasinghe-Mudalige", "Udith K.", ""], ["Kodituwakku", "Saluka R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.07841", "submitter": "Bolu John Folayan Dr.", "authors": "Bolu John Folayan, Olumide Samuel Ogunjobi, Prosper Zannu, Taiwo\n  Ajibolu Balofin", "title": "Post-war Civil War Propaganda Techniques and Media Spins in Nigeria and\n  Journalism Practice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.24297/jssr.v17i.8993", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.MM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In public relations and political communication, a spin is a form of\npropaganda achieved through knowingly presenting a biased interpretation of an\nevent or issues.

This paper investigates and analyzes the\ndifferent propaganda techniques and spins in the narratives of the Nigerian\ncivil in the past five years through a content analysis of three national\nnewspapers: The Nigerian Tribune, Daily Trust and Sun Newspapers.

As the outbreak has\nspread globally, factors such as systemic racism, marginalisation, and\nstructural inequality have created path dependencies that have led to poor\nhealth outcomes. These social determinants of infectious disease and\nvulnerability to disaster have converged to affect already disadvantaged\ncommunities with higher levels of economic instability, disease exposure,\ninfection severity, and death. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are an\nimportant part of the health informatics toolkit used to fight contagious\ndisease. AI is well known, however, to be susceptible to algorithmic biases\nthat can entrench and augment existing inequality. Uncritically deploying AI in\nthe fight against covid-19 thus risks amplifying the pandemic's adverse effects\non vulnerable groups, exacerbating health inequity. In this paper, we claim\nthat AI systems can introduce or reflect bias and discrimination in three ways:\nin patterns of health discrimination that become entrenched in datasets, in\ndata representativeness, and in human choices made during the design,\ndevelopment, and deployment of these systems. We highlight how the use of AI\ntechnologies threaten to exacerbate the disparate effect of covid-19 on\nmarginalised, under-represented, and vulnerable groups, particularly black,\nAsian, and other minoritised ethnic people, older populations, and those of\nlower socioeconomic status. We conclude that, to mitigate the compounding\neffects of AI on inequalities associated with covid-19, decision makers,\ntechnology developers, and health officials must account for the potential\nbiases and inequities at all stages of the AI process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 17:23:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Leslie", "David", ""], ["Mazumder", "Anjali", ""], ["Peppin", "Aidan", ""], ["Wolters", "Maria", ""], ["Hagerty", "Alexa", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.07847", "submitter": "Beatrice Alex", "authors": "Beatrice Alex, Clare Llewellyn, Pawel Michal Orzechowski, Maria\n  Boutchkova", "title": "The Online Pivot: Lessons Learned from Teaching a Text and Data Mining\n  Course in Lockdown, Enhancing online Teaching with Pair Programming and\n  Digital Badges", "comments": "11 pages, 4 figures, to appear in the Proceedings of the Fifth\n  Workshop on Teaching NLP @ NAACL 2021", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we provide an account of how we ported a text and data mining\ncourse online in summer 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and how we\nimproved it in a second pilot run.

While the analysis\ncurrently focuses on only this form of bias, the visualizations already reveal\npatterns of bias when contrasting articles (overview) and in-text instances of\nbias (article view).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 May 2021 11:20:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Hamborg", "Felix", ""], ["Zhukova", "Anastasia", ""], ["Donnay", "Karsten", ""], ["Gipp", "Bela", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.09700", "submitter": "Christian Giang", "authors": "Christian Giang, Lucio Negrini", "title": "Educational Robotics in Online Distance Learning: An Experience from\n  Primary School", "comments": "7 pages, to be published in the proceedings of the 12th International\n  Conference on Robotics in Education (2021)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.RO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Temporary school closures caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have posed new\nchallenges for many teachers and students worldwide.

Following a data-driven quantitative\napproach, we analyze thousands of videos on YouTube, to shed light on: 1) the\nrisks of YouTube media consumption by young children; 2) the role of the\nrecommendation algorithm in the dissemination of misogynistic content, by\nfocusing on the Involuntary Celibates (Incels) community; and 3) user exposure\nto pseudoscientific content on various parts of the platform and how this\nexposure changes based on the user's watch history. Our analysis reveals that\nyoung children are likely to encounter disturbing content when they randomly\nbrowse the platform. By analyzing the Incel community on YouTube, we find that\nIncel activity is increasing over time and that platforms may play an active\nrole in steering users towards extreme content. Finally, when studying\npseudoscientific misinformation, we find that YouTube suggests more\npseudoscientific content regarding traditional pseudoscientific topics (e.g.,\nflat earth) than for emerging ones (like COVID-19) and that these\nrecommendations are more common on the search results page than on a user's\nhomepage or the video recommendations section.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 May 2021 15:10:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Papadamou", "Kostantinos", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.09908", "submitter": "Filip Biljecki", "authors": "Wangyang Chen, Abraham Noah Wu, Filip Biljecki", "title": "Classification of Urban Morphology with Deep Learning: Application on\n  Urban Vitality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CY cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is a prevailing trend to study urban morphology quantitatively thanks\nto the growing accessibility to various forms of spatial big data, increasing\ncomputing power, and use cases benefiting from such information.

Our analysis finds that the DAS-protected data are biased against\ncertain areas, depending on voter turnout and partisan and racial composition,\nand that these biases lead to large and unpredictable errors in the analysis of\npartisan and racial gerrymanders. Finally, we show that the DAS algorithm does\nnot universally protect respondent privacy. Based on the names and addresses of\nregistered voters, we are able to predict their race as accurately using the\nDAS-protected data as when using the 2010 Census data. Despite this, the\nDAS-protected data can still inaccurately estimate the number of\nmajority-minority districts.

Objective/Purpose: The main goal of this paper is\nto investigate a novel research question: is there any correlation between the\nimpact of a scientific conference and the venue where it took place? Approach:\nIn order to measure the impact of conferences we conducted a large scale\nanalysis on the bibliographic data extracted from 3,838 Computer Science\nconference series and over 2.5 million papers spanning more than 30 years of\nresearch. To quantify the \"touristicity\" of a venue we exploited some\nindicators such as the size of the Wikipedia page for the city hosting the\nvenue and other indexes from reports of the World Economic Forum.\nResults/Findings: We found out that the two aspects are related, and the\ncorrelation with conference impact is stronger when considering country-wide\ntouristic indicators, such as the Travel&Tourism Competitiveness Index.\nMore-over the almost linear correlation with the Tourist Service Infrastructure\nindex attests the specific importance of tourist/accommodation facilities in a\ngiven country.

As a necessity, there is a need to track users who came in contact\nwith users having travel history, asymptomatic and not yet symptomatic, but\nthey can be in the future. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a\nsolution for contact tracing based on assisted GPS and cloud computing\ntechnologies. An application is developed to collect each user's assisted GPS\ncoordinates once all the users install this application. This application\nperiodically sends assisted GPS data to the cloud. To determine which devices\nare within the permissible limit of 5m, we perform clustering over assisted GPS\ncoordinates and track the clusters for about t mins to allow the measure of\nspread. We assume that it takes around 3 or 5 mins to get the virus from an\ninfected object. For clustering, the proposed M way like tree data structure\nstores the assisted GPS coordinates in degree, minute, and second format. Thus,\nevery user is mapped to a leaf node of the tree. We split the \"seconds\" part of\nthe assisted GPS location into m equal parts, which amount to d meter in\nlatitude(longitude). Hence, two users who are within d meter range will map to\nthe same leaf node. Thus, by mapping assisted GPS locations every t mins, we\ncan find out how many users came in contact with a particular user for at least\nt mins.

Besides, the proposed solution offers potential hotspot detection and\nsafe-route recommendation as an additional feature, and proof of concept is\npresented through experiments on simulated data of 10M users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 May 2021 07:03:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Maurya", "Chandresh Kumar", ""], ["Jain", "Seemandhar", ""], ["Thakre", "Vishal", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.15064", "submitter": "William Blanzeisky", "authors": "William Blanzeisky, P\\'adraig Cunningham", "title": "Using Pareto Simulated Annealing to Address Algorithmic Bias in Machine\n  Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Algorithmic Bias can be due to bias in the training data or issues with the\nalgorithm itself.

This research study was conducted by high school students in the Bay\nArea to compare the intention and characteristics of hate crimes against Asian\nAmericans to hate crimes against African Americans. According to studies of\nboth victim-related and most offender-related variables, hate crimes against\nAsian Americans have been rapidly growing in the United States and vary from\nthose against African Americans. This leads to an investigation into the racial\ndisparity between Asian American offenders and those of other races. The nature\nand characteristics of hate crimes against Asian Americans are compared to\nthose of hate crimes against African Americans in our research. According to\nstudies of all victim-related factors, hate crimes against Asian Americans are\nsimilar to those against African Americans.
