In this paper, we propose a new electronic toll pricing system\nbased on group signatures, which provides a strong guarantee for the clients'\nanonymity within groups. Our system achieves a balance between privacy and the\ncommunication overhead imposed upon the users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2011 13:58:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Sep 2011 23:04:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xihui", ""], ["Lenzini", "Gabriele", ""], ["Mauw", "Sjouke", ""], ["Pang", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1152", "submitter": "Jenny Blight", "authors": "Oluwaranti Adeniran and Achimugu Philip", "title": "Development and Deployment of Fixed Wireless Access in South West\n  Nigeria: Performance and Evaluation", "comments": "Submitted to Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, see\n  http://sites.google.com/site/jcseuk/volume-7-issue-2-june-2011", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computer Science and Engineering, Volume 7, Issue 2,\n  p51-57, June 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) involves the use of wireless technology to\nreplace copper to connect subscribers to the telephone network. It is a variant\nof wireless broadband which provides an alternative in the so-called 'last\nmile' connectivity between the subscriber and the fixed telecommunications\nnetwork. FWA could either be narrowband or broadband and it is predominantly\ndeployed using the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology. In\nassessing the extent of development and deployment of FWA, the perspective of\nthe operators and users was elicited primarily through the use of\nquestionnaires. Issues like setup cost, tax, Government incentive, availability\nof infrastructure and manpower applied to the operators while on the users'\npart factors like quality of service, signal strength as well as call rate were\nconsidered. The South western zone of Nigeria is regarded as one of the most\nurbanized regions in the south of Sahara, this is not out of place considering\nthe fact that Lagos which is the nation's commercial nerve centre and a\nmega-city is located within this region. The scope of this research covered\nthis very lively part of the country. The relationship between the parameters\nor variables considered was established using an appropriate statistical\nmethod: The Regression analysis. In terms of users' preference, Global System\nof Mobile communication (GSM) was compared with FWA. Results were interpreted\nand suitable conclusions were drawn to wrap up a quite revealing work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2011 18:02:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Adeniran", "Oluwaranti", ""], ["Philip", "Achimugu", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4361", "submitter": "Alberto Pepe", "authors": "Alberto Pepe", "title": "The relationship between acquaintanceship and coauthorship in scientific\n  collaboration networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of the American Society for Information Science and\n  Technology 62(11): 2121--2132 (2011)", "doi": "10.1002/asi.21629", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article examines the relationship between acquaintanceship and\ncoauthorship patterns in a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional,\ngeographically distributed research center.
