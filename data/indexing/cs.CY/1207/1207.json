For\ndecades, key decision makers in the public and private sectors have considered\ncost-effectiveness in healthcare a top priority. Their actions have focused on\nputting a limit on fees, services, or care options. However, they have met with\nlimited success as costs have increased rapidly while the quality isn't\ncommensurate with the high costs. A new approach is needed. Here we provide\neight scientifically-based steps for improving the healthcare system. The core\nof the approach is promoting the best use of resources by matching the people\nand organization to the tasks they are good at, and providing the right\nincentive structure. Harnessing costs need not mean sacrificing quality.\nQuality service and low costs can be achieved by making sure the right people\nand the right organizations deliver services. As an example, the frequent use\nof emergency rooms for non-emergency care demonstrates the waste of resources\nof highly capable individuals and facilities resulting in high costs and\nineffective care. Neither free markets nor managed care guarantees the best use\nof resources. A different oversight system is needed to promote the right\nincentives. Unlike managed care, effective oversight must not interfere with\nthe performance of care. Otherwise, cost control only makes care more\ncumbersome. The eight steps we propose are designed to dramatically improve the\neffectiveness of the healthcare system, both for those who receive services and\nthose who provide them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 23:31:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer Bar-Yam with Shlomiya", ""], ["Bertrand", "Karla Z.", ""], ["Cohen", "Nancy", ""], ["Gard-Murray", "Alexander S.", ""], ["Harte", "Helen P.", ""], ["Leykum", "Luci", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0439", "submitter": "Richard Kinne", "authors": "Richard C.

To\ndescribe the rise, persistence, and resolution of such conflicts we devise an\nextended opinion dynamics model where agents with different opinions perform a\nsingle task to make a consensual product. As a function of the convergence\nparameter describing the influence of the product on the agents, the model\nshows spontaneous symmetry breaking of the final consensus opinion represented\nby the medium. In the case when agents are replaced with new ones at a certain\nrate, a transition from mainly consensus to a perpetual conflict occurs, which\nis in qualitative agreement with the scenarios observed in Wikipedia.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Jul 2012 11:04:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2012 12:41:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["T\u00f6r\u00f6k", "J\u00e1nos", ""], ["I\u00f1iguez", "Gerardo", ""], ["Yasseri", "Taha", ""], ["Miguel", "Maxi San", ""], ["Kaski", "Kimmo", ""], ["Kert\u00e9sz", "J\u00e1nos", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6164", "submitter": "Muhammad Anshari Mr", "authors": "Muhammad Anshari, Mohammad N.

However, the factors that make technology\nconstruct in a virtual R&D team are still ambiguous. The manager of virtual R&D\nteams for new product development does not know which type of technology should\nbe used. Approach: To address the gap and answer the question, the study\npresents a set of factors that make a technology construct. The proposed\nconstruct modified by finding of the field survey (N = 240). We empirically\nexamine the relationship between construct and its factors by employing the\nStructural Equation Modeling (SEM). A measurement model built base on the 19\npreliminary factors that extracted from literature review. The result shows 10\nfactors out of 19 factors maintaining to make technology construct. Results:\nThese 10 technology factors can be grouped into two constructs namely Web base\ncommunication and Web base data sharing. The findings can help new product\ndevelopment managers of enterprises to concentrate in the main factors for\nleading an effective virtual R&D team. In addition, it provides a guideline for\nsoftware developers as well. Conclusion: The second and third generation\ntechnologies are now more suitable for developing new products through virtual\nR&D teams.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 03:25:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ebrahim", "Ale", ""], ["Ahmed", "Nader", ""], ["Rashid", "Shamsuddin Abdul", ""], ["Hanim", "Salwa", ""], ["Taha", "Zahari", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6994", "submitter": "David Lancaster", "authors": "David Lancaster", "title": "Random Walks between Leaves of Random Networks", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica (2014) 511-522", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider random walks that start and are absorbed on the leaves of random\nnetworks and study the length of such walks.
