There has been substantial discussion about whether these\nalgorithms are unfair to groups of individuals. While noble, this pursuit is\ncomplex and ultimately stagnating because there is no clear definition of\nfairness and competing definitions are largely incompatible. We argue that the\nfocus on the question of fairness is misplaced, as these algorithms fail to\nmeet a more important and yet readily obtainable goal: transparency. As a\nresult, creators of secret algorithms can provide incomplete or misleading\ndescriptions about how their models work, and various other kinds of errors can\neasily go unnoticed. By partially reverse engineering the COMPAS algorithm -- a\nrecidivism-risk scoring algorithm used throughout the criminal justice system\n-- we show that it does not seem to depend linearly on the defendant's age,\ndespite statements to the contrary by the algorithm's creator. Furthermore, by\nsubtracting from COMPAS its (hypothesized) nonlinear age component, we show\nthat COMPAS does not necessarily depend on race, contradicting ProPublica's\nanalysis, which assumed linearity in age. In other words, faulty assumptions\nabout a proprietary algorithm lead to faulty conclusions that go unchecked\nwithout careful reverse engineering. Were the algorithm transparent in the\nfirst place, this would likely not have occurred. The most important result in\nthis work is that we find that there are many defendants with low risk score\nbut long criminal histories, suggesting that data inconsistencies occur\nfrequently in criminal justice databases. We argue that transparency satisfies\na different notion of procedural fairness by providing both the defendants and\nthe public with the opportunity to scrutinize the methodology and calculations\nbehind risk scores for recidivism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2018 04:14:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2019 04:30:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rudin", "Cynthia", ""], ["Wang", "Caroline", ""], ["Coker", "Beau", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.01267", "submitter": "Gillian Hadfield", "authors": "Dylan Hadfield-Menell, McKane Andrus, and Gillian K.

We show that silly\nrules render a normative system both more robust and more adaptable in response\nto shocks to perceived stability. They make normativity more legible for\nhumans, and can increase legibility for AI systems as well.

Maze generation is a fruitful\narea for comparative retrogame archaeology, because a number of early games on\ndifferent platforms featured mazes, and their variety of approaches can be\ncompared. The maze in Entombed is particularly interesting: it is shaped in\npart by the extensive real-time constraints of the Atari 2600 platform, and\nalso had to be generated efficiently and use next to no memory. We reverse\nengineered key areas of the game's code to uncover its unusual maze-generation\nalgorithm, which we have also built a reconstruction of, and analyzed the\nmysterious table that drives it. In addition, we discovered what appears to be\na 35-year-old bug in the code, as well as direct evidence of code-reuse\npractices amongst game developers.\n  What further makes this game's development interesting is that, in an era\nwhere video games were typically solo projects, a total of five people were\ninvolved in various ways with Entombed. We piece together some of the backstory\nof the game's development and intoxicant-fueled design using interviews to\ncomplement our technical work.\n  Finally, we contextualize this example in archaeology and lay the groundwork\nfor a broader interdisciplinary discussion about programming, one that includes\nboth computer scientists and archaeologists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 21:08:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aycock", "John", "", "University of Calgary, Canada"], ["Copplestone", "Tara", "", "University of York, United Kingdom"]]}, {"id": "1811.02213", "submitter": "Wieslaw Kopec", "authors": "Wies{\\l}aw Kope\\'c, Marcin Skibi\\'nski, Cezary Biele, Kinga Skorupska,\n  Dominika Tkaczyk, Anna Jaskulska, Katarzyna Abramczuk, Piotr Gago, Krzysztof\n  Marasek", "title": "Hybrid Approach to Automation, RPA and Machine Learning: a Method for\n  the Human-centered Design of Software Robots", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.CY cs.LG cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the more prominent trends within Industry 4.0 is the drive to employ\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA), especially as one of the elements of the Lean\napproach.

Characterizing the origins, types and\ncompetitive strength of different kinds of power may yield a scaffolding for\nunderstanding historical processes and mechanisms for winning or avoiding\nconflicts. Michael Mann distinguished four types of power: political, military,\neconomic, and ideological. We show this framework is justified by four\nmotivations of individuals to transfer decisions to leaders: Desire to be a\nmember of a collective, avoiding harm due to threat, gaining benefit due to\npayment, acquiring a value system. Constructing models of societies based upon\nthese types of power enables distinguishing social systems and describing their\ndynamics. Dynamics include (a) competition between power systems, (b)\ncompetition between powerful individuals, and (c) the dynamics of values within\na powerful individual. A historical trend is the progressive separation of\ntypes of power to distinct groups of individuals. In ancient empires all forms\nof power were concentrated in a single individual, e.g. Caesar during the Pax\nRomana period. In an idealized modern democratic state, the four types of power\nare concentrated in distinct sets of individuals. The progressive separation\nsuggests that in some contexts this confers a \"fitness\" advantage in an\nevolutionary process similar to the selection of biological organisms.

Campaigns revolving around\nmajor political events are enacted via mission-focused \"trolls.\" While trolls\nare involved in spreading disinformation on social media, there is little\nunderstanding of how they operate, what type of content they disseminate, how\ntheir strategies evolve over time, and how they influence the Web's information\necosystem. In this paper, we begin to address this gap by analyzing 10M posts\nby 5.5K Twitter and Reddit users identified as Russian and Iranian\nstate-sponsored trolls. We compare the behavior of each group of\nstate-sponsored trolls with a focus on how their strategies change over time,\nthe different campaigns they embark on, and differences between the trolls\noperated by Russia and Iran. Among other things, we find: 1) that Russian\ntrolls were pro-Trump while Iranian trolls were anti-Trump; 2) evidence that\ncampaigns undertaken by such actors are influenced by real-world events; and 3)\nthat the behavior of such actors is not consistent over time, hence automated\ndetection is not a straightforward task. Using the Hawkes Processes statistical\nmodel, we quantify the influence these accounts have on pushing URLs on four\nsocial platforms: Twitter, Reddit, 4chan's Politically Incorrect board (/pol/),\nand Gab. In general, Russian trolls were more influential and efficient in\npushing URLs to all the other platforms with the exception of /pol/ where\nIranians were more influential.

It would be convenient and preferable if the\npatients could receive the most efficient treatment plan and know the predicted\nwaiting time through a mobile application that updates in real-time.

HQR\ncalculates and predicts an efficient and convenient treatment plan recommended\nfor the patient.

Data scientists must recognize themselves as\npolitical actors engaged in normative constructions of society and, as befits\npolitical work, evaluate their work according to its downstream material\nimpacts on people's lives. I justify this notion in two parts: first, by\narticulating why data scientists must recognize themselves as political actors,\nand second, by describing how the field can evolve toward a deliberative and\nrigorous grounding in a politics of social justice. Part 1 responds to three\narguments that are commonly invoked by data scientists when they are challenged\nto take political positions regarding their work. In confronting these\narguments, I will demonstrate why attempting to remain apolitical is itself a\npolitical stance--a fundamentally conservative one--and why the field's current\nattempts to promote \"social good\" dangerously rely on vague and unarticulated\npolitical assumptions. Part 2 proposes a framework for what a\npolitically-engaged data science could look like and how to achieve it,\nrecognizing the challenge of reforming the field in this manner. I\nconceptualize the process of incorporating politics into data science in four\nstages: becoming interested in directly addressing social issues, recognizing\nthe politics underlying these issues, redirecting existing methods toward new\napplications, and, finally, developing new practices and methods that orient\ndata science around a mission of social justice.

A\nconsortium blockchain made of different AVs manufacturers is used to ensure the\nauthenticity and integrity of firmware updates. Instead of depending on\ncentralized third parties to distribute the new updates, we enable AVs, namely\ndistributors, to participate in the distribution process and we take advantage\nof their mobility to guarantee high availability and fast delivery of the\nupdates. To incentivize AVs to distribute the updates, a reward system is\nestablished that maintains a credit reputation for each distributor account in\nthe blockchain. A zero-knowledge proof protocol is used to exchange the update\nin return for a proof of distribution in a trust-less environment. Moreover, we\nuse attribute-based encryption (ABE) scheme to ensure that only authorized AVs\nwill be able to download and use a new update.

There are multiple\nstakeholders at various points. All these stakeholders need to collaborate with\neach other in multiple directions for its effective and efficient management.\nThe manufacturers need proper information and data about the product location,\nits processing history, raw materials, etc at each point so as to control the\nproduction process. Companies need to develop global and effective strategies\nto sustain in the competitive market. Logistics helps companies to implement\nthe effectiveness across the business supply chain from source to destination\nto achieve their strategic goals. Traceability has become one of the integrated\nparts of the supply chain logistics management that track and trace the\nproduct's information in upstream and downstream at each point. All the\nstakeholders in the supply chain have different objectives to implement the\ntraceability solution that depends on their role (e.g. manufacturers,\ndistributers or wholesalers have their own role). The information generated and\nneeded from all these actors are also different and are to be shared among all\nto run the supply chain smoothly. But the stakeholders don't want to share all\nthe information with other stake holders which is a major challenge to be\naddressed in current traceability solutions. The purpose of this research is to\nconduct thorough study of the literatures available on the traceability\nsolutions, finding the gaps and recommending our views to enhance the\ncollaborations among the stakeholders in every point of the business supply\nchain. The study will be helpful for further researchers to propose a\ntraceability meta-model to address the gaps.

One of the determinants of\nan individual's behavior is the various activities undertaken at various\ntimes-of-the-day and days-of-the-week. In many cases, such behavior will follow\ntemporal patterns. Currently, researchers use either equal or unequal\ninterval-based segmentation of time for mining mobile phone users' behavior.\nMost of them take into account static temporal coverage of 24-h-a-day and few\nof them take into account the number of incidences in time-series data.\nHowever, such segmentations do not necessarily map to the patterns of\nindividual user activity and subsequent behavior because of not taking into\naccount the diverse behaviors of individuals over time-of-the-week. Therefore,\nwe propose a behavior-oriented time segmentation (BOTS) technique that takes\ninto account not only the temporal coverage of the week but also the number of\nincidences of diverse behaviors dynamically for producing similar behavioral\ntime segments over the week utilizing time-series data. Experiments on the real\nmobile phone datasets show that our proposed segmentation technique better\ncaptures the user's dominant behavior at various times-of-the-day and\ndays-of-the-week enabling the generation of high confidence temporal rules in\norder to mine individual mobile phone users' behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2018 11:09:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Sarker", "Iqbal H.", ""], ["Colman", "Alan", ""], ["Kabir", "MA", ""], ["Han", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.09676", "submitter": "Gregory Heileman", "authors": "Gregory L.

The analyses show that the RFID badges have a\nsensitivity of 50% that can be enhanced to 65% when flickering signals with\ngaps of less than 75 seconds are interpolated. The specificity is relatively\nless affected by this interpolation process (before interpolation 97%, after\ninterpolation 94.7%) - resulting in an improved accuracy of the measurement.

As each player can remain in the game for years, this results in\nan exceptionally rich dataset that can be used to understand and predict player\nbehavior. In particular, this information may serve to identify the most\nvaluable players and foresee the amount of money they will spend in in-app\npurchases during their lifetime. This is crucial in free-to-play games, where\nup to 50% of the revenue is generated by just around 2% of the players, the\nso-called whales.\n  To address this challenge, we explore how deep neural networks can be used to\npredict customer lifetime value in video games, and compare their performance\nto parametric models such as Pareto/NBD. Our results suggest that convolutional\nneural network structures are the most efficient in predicting the economic\nvalue of individual players. They not only perform better in terms of accuracy,\nbut also scale to big data and significantly reduce computational time, as they\ncan work directly with raw sequential data and thus do not require any feature\nengineering process. This becomes important when datasets are very large, as is\noften the case with video game logs.\n  Moreover, convolutional neural networks are particularly well suited to\nidentify potential whales. Such an early identification is of paramount\nimportance for business purposes, as it would allow developers to implement\nin-game actions aimed at retaining big spenders and maximizing their lifetime,\nwhich would ultimately translate into increased revenue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2018 09:41:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Pei Pei", ""], ["Guitart", "Anna", ""], ["del R\u00edo", "Ana Fern\u00e1ndez", ""], ["Peri\u00e1\u00f1ez", "\u00c1frica", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12807", "submitter": "Cristina Turcu", "authors": "Cristina Turcu, Cornel Turcu, Vasile Gaitan", "title": "An Internet of Things Oriented Approach for Water Utility Monitoring and\n  Control", "comments": "European Computing Conference (ECC '12).
