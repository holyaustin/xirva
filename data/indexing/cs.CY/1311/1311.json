The aim of this study was to validate reliability,\nface, content and construct of the simulator. Materials and methods: The\nsimulator is composed of a) a laptop computer, b) a haptic device with a stylus\nthat mimics the ultrasound probe, c) a clinical case database including three\ndimensional (3D) ultrasound volumes and patient data and d) a learning\nenvironment with a set of progressive exercises including a randomized 12-core\nbiopsy procedure. Both visual (3D biopsy mapping) and numerical (score)\nfeedback are given to the user. The simulator evaluation was conducted in an\nacademic urology department on 7 experts and 14 novices who each performed a\nvirtual biopsy procedure and completed a face and content validity\nquestionnaire. Results: The overall realism of the biopsy procedure was rated\nat a median of 9/10 by non-experts (7.1-9.8). Experts rated the usefulness of\nthe simulator for the initial training of urologists at 8.2/10 (7.9-8.3), but\nreported the range of motion and force feedback as significantly less realistic\nthan novices (p=0.01 and 0.03 respectively).

We\ndefine a science of a Clinical Data Intelligence as a data analysis that\npermits the derivation of scientific, i.e., generalizable and reliable results.\nWe argue that a science of a Clinical Data Intelligence is sensible in the\ncontext of a Big Data analysis, i.e., with data from many patients and with\ncomplete patient information. We discuss that Clinical Data Intelligence\nrequires the joint efforts of knowledge engineering, information extraction\n(from textual and other unstructured data), and statistics and statistical\nmachine learning. We describe some of our main results as conjectures and\nrelate them to a recently funded research project involving two major German\nuniversity hospitals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Nov 2013 16:24:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Dec 2013 17:51:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 09:58:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tresp", "Volker", ""], ["Zillner", "Sonja", ""], ["Costa", "Maria J.", ""], ["Huang", "Yi", ""], ["Cavallaro", "Alexander", ""], ["Fasching", "Peter A.", ""], ["Reis", "Andre", ""], ["Sedlmayr", "Martin", ""], ["Ganslandt", "Thomas", ""], ["Budde", "Klemens", ""], ["Hinrichs", "Carl", ""], ["Schmidt", "Danilo", ""], ["Daumke", "Philipp", ""], ["Sonntag", "Daniel", ""], ["Wittenberg", "Thomas", ""], ["Oppelt", "Patricia G.", ""], ["Krompass", "Denis", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.4389", "submitter": "Sanat Kumar Bista", "authors": "C\\'ecile Paris, Nathalie Colineau, Surya Nepal, Sanat Bista and Gina\n  Beschorner", "title": "Ethical considerations in an online community: the balancing act", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Paris, C., Colineau, N., Nepal, S., Bista, S.

Within each community, customers are susceptible\nof attracting new ones, retaining old ones and/or accepting new products or\nservices through the leverage of mutual influences. The communities of users\nare smaller units, easier to grasp, and allow for example the computation of\nrole analysis -- based on the centrality of an actor within his community.\n  The problem of finding communities in static graphs has been widely studied.\nHowever, from the point of view of a telecom analyst, to be really useful, the\ndetected communities must evolve as the social graph of communications changes\nover time -- for example, in order to perform marketing actions on communities\nand track the results of those actions over time. Additionally the behaviors of\ncommunities of users over time can be used to predict future activity that\ninterests the telecom operators, such as subscriber churn or handset adoption.\nSimilary group evolution can provide insights for designing strategies, such as\nthe early warning of group churn.\n  Stability is a crucial issue: the analysis performed on a given community\nwill be lost, if the analyst cannot keep track of this community in the\nfollowing time steps. This is the particular use case that we tackle in this\npaper: tracking the evolution of communities in dynamic scenarios with focus on\nstability.\n  We propose two modifications to a widely used static community detection\nalgorithm.

Against this backdrop, we employ OSM road\nnetworks to identify parcel geometries and POI data to infer parcel\ncharacteristics. A vector-based CA model is adopted to select urban parcels.\nThe method is applied to the entire state of China and identifies 82,645 urban\nparcels in 297 cities.

For young videos we find that factors other than the\ntotal number of previous views, such as uploader characteristics and number of\nkeywords, become relatively more important.
