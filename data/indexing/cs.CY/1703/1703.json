Considering the more and more\nimportant role of the online social media in daily communications, we argue\nthat the footprint of massive individuals, like tweets in Weibo, can be the\ninspiring proxy to infer the personality and further understand its functions\nin shaping the online human behavior. In this study, a map from self-reports of\npersonalities to online profiles of 293 active users in Weibo is established to\ntrain a competent machine learning model, which then successfully identifies\nover 7,000 users as extroverts or introverts. Systematical comparisons from\nperspectives of tempo-spatial patterns, online activities, emotion expressions\nand attitudes to virtual honor surprisingly disclose that the extrovert indeed\nbehaves differently from the introvert in Weibo. Our findings provide solid\nevidence to justify the methodology of employing machine learning to\nobjectively study personalities of massive individuals and shed lights on\napplications of probing personalities and corresponding behaviors solely\nthrough online profiles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 09:00:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Zhenkun", ""], ["Xu", "Ke", ""], ["Zhao", "Jichang", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06660", "submitter": "Edward Cartwright", "authors": "Julio Hernandez-Castro, Edward Cartwright and Anna Stepanova", "title": "Economic Analysis of Ransomware", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present in this work an economic analysis of ransomware, with relevant\ndata from Cryptolocker, CryptoWall, TeslaCrypt and other major strands.

Sockpuppets tend to start fewer\ndiscussions, write shorter posts, use more personal pronouns such as \"I\", and\nhave more clustered ego-networks. Further, pairs of sockpuppets controlled by\nthe same individual are more likely to interact on the same discussion at the\nsame time than pairs of ordinary users. Our analysis suggests a taxonomy of\ndeceptive behavior in discussion communities. Pairs of sockpuppets can vary in\ntheir deceptiveness, i.e., whether they pretend to be different users, or their\nsupportiveness, i.e., if they support arguments of other sockpuppets controlled\nby the same user.
