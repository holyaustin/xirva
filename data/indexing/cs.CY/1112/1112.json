To understand better\nthe needs and expectations of each actor, we are especially interested in the\nspecific case of project management training. The results of a course\nobservation show that the lack of monitoring and expertise transfer tools\ninvolves important dysfunctions in the course organisation and therefore\ndissatisfaction for tutors and students (in particular about the acquisition of\nknowledge and expertise). So as to solve this problem, we propose a\npersonalised platform (according to the actor: project group, student or\ntutor), which gives information to monitor activities and supports the\nacquisition and transfer of expertise. This platform is based on Knowledge\nManagement (KM) and Web 2.0 concepts to support the dynamic building of\nknowledge. KM is used to define the learning process (based on the experiential\nlearning theory) and the way the individual knowledge building is monitored\n(based on metacognitive concepts). Web 2.0 is used to define the way the\nexperience is shared. We make the hypothesis that this approach improves the\nacquisition of complex skills (e.g. management, communication and\ncollaboration), which requires a behavioural evolution. We aim at making the\nstudents become able 'to learn to learn' and evolve according to contexts.

One unfortunate phenomenon, however, poisons the competition\nand the fun: cheating. The costs of cheating span from industry-supported\nexpenditures to detect and limit cheating, to victims' monetary losses due to\ncyber crime.\n  This paper studies cheaters in the Steam Community, an online social network\nbuilt on top of the world's dominant digital game delivery platform. We\ncollected information about more than 12 million gamers connected in a global\nsocial network, of which more than 700 thousand have their profiles flagged as\ncheaters. We also collected in-game interaction data of over 10 thousand\nplayers from a popular multiplayer gaming server. We show that cheaters are\nwell embedded in the social and interaction networks: their network position is\nlargely undistinguishable from that of fair players. We observe that the\ncheating behavior appears to spread through a social mechanism: the presence\nand the number of cheater friends of a fair player is correlated with the\nlikelihood of her becoming a cheater in the future. Also, we observe that there\nis a social penalty involved with being labeled as a cheater: cheaters are\nlikely to switch to more restrictive privacy settings once they are tagged and\nthey lose more friends than fair players. Finally, we observe that the number\nof cheaters is not correlated with the geographical, real-world population\ndensity, or with the local popularity of the Steam Community.\n  This analysis can ultimately inform the design of mechanisms to deal with\nanti-social behavior (e.g., spamming, automated collection of data) in generic\nonline social networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Dec 2011 03:12:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Blackburn", "Jeremy", ""], ["Simha", "Ramanuja", ""], ["Kourtellis", "Nicolas", ""], ["Zuo", "Xiang", ""], ["Long", "Clayton", ""], ["Ripeanu", "Matei", ""], ["Skvoretz", "John", ""], ["Iamnitchi", "Adriana", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.5605", "submitter": "M.
