Groups are created explicitly\nby members of the community, but also form organically as members interact. Due\nto their importance, they have been studied widely (e.g., community detection,\nevolution, activity, etc.). One of the key questions for understanding how such\ngroups evolve is whether there are different types of groups and how they\ndiffer. In Sociology, theories have been proposed to help explain how such\ngroups form. In particular, the common identity and common bond theory states\nthat people join groups based on identity (i.e., interest in the topics\ndiscussed) or bond attachment (i.e., social relationships). The theory has been\napplied qualitatively to small groups to classify them as either topical or\nsocial. We use the identity and bond theory to define a set of features to\nclassify groups into those two categories. Using a dataset from Flickr, we\nextract user-defined groups and automatically-detected groups, obtained from a\ncommunity detection algorithm. We discuss the process of manual labeling of\ngroups into social or topical and present results of predicting the group label\nbased on the defined features. We directly validate the predictions of the\ntheory showing that the metrics are able to forecast the group type with high\naccuracy.
