Creating a new course in network security requires investigation into\nmultiple subject areas within the field and from multiple sources. This task\ncan be daunting and overwhelming for teachers from smaller universities because\nof their requirement to teach multiple subjects, not just network security.\nAlong with the requirement of teachers to understand the material that they\nwish to teach, the factors of obsolescence and the ability to build material\noff of core topics need to be addressed. These three factors are difficult for\na smaller university teacher to address without a set of standards to analyze\nthese areas. A rubric addressing these topic areas of timelessness,\nassociability, and simplicity has been created to assist in the selection of\nmaterials based on the three criteria. The use of this rubric provides an\neffective means to choose material for a new course and help teachers to\npresent the material they determine most appropriate to teach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 14:46:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Marriotti", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.2212", "submitter": "Rumi Ghosh", "authors": "Rumi Ghosh, Kristina Lerman", "title": "Structure of Heterogeneous Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "2009 IEEE International Conference on Social Computing\n  (SocialCom-09)", "doi": "10.1109/CSE.2009.142", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Heterogeneous networks play a key role in the evolution of communities and\nthe decisions individuals make. These networks link different types of\nentities, for example, people and the events they attend. Network analysis\nalgorithms usually project such networks unto simple graphs composed of\nentities of a single type. In the process, they conflate relations between\nentities of different types and loose important structural information. We\ndevelop a mathematical framework that can be used to compactly represent and\nanalyze heterogeneous networks that combine multiple entity and link types. We\ngeneralize Bonacich centrality, which measures connectivity between nodes by\nthe number of paths between them, to heterogeneous networks and use this\nmeasure to study network structure. Specifically, we extend the popular\nmodularity-maximization method for community detection to use this centrality\nmetric. We also rank nodes based on their connectivity to other nodes. One\nadvantage of this centrality metric is that it has a tunable parameter we can\nuse to set the length scale of interactions. By studying how rankings change\nwith this parameter allows us to identify important nodes in the network. We\napply the proposed method to analyze the structure of several heterogeneous\nnetworks. We show that exploiting additional sources of evidence corresponding\nto links between, as well as among, different entity types yields new insights\ninto network structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2009 22:19:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.2549", "submitter": "Alberto Pepe", "authors": "Alberto Pepe, Matthew Mayernik, Christine L.
