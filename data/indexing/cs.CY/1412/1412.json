Indeed, E-learning systems have capacity to adapt\ncontent and learning process according to the learner profile.

The latter require continuous tracking of the\nactivities of the learner to identify gaps and strengths in order to tailor\ncontent to their specific needs or advise and accompany him during his\napprenticeship. However, the disadvantage of these systems is that they cause\nlearners' discouragement, for learners, alone with his screen loses its\nmotivation to improve. Adding social extension to learning, to avoid isolation\nof learners and boost support and interaction between members of the learning\ncommunity, was able to increase learner's motivation. However, the tools to\nfacilitate social interactions integrated to E-learning platforms can be used\nfor purposes other than learning.

For instance, YouTube\npresents to a user a list of top-n videos she would likely watch next based on\nher rating and viewing history. Current methods of CF evaluation have been\nfocused on assessing the quality of a predicted rating or the ranking\nperformance for top-n recommended items. However, restricting the recommender\nsystem evaluation to these two aspects is rather limiting and neglects other\ndimensions that could better characterize a well-perceived recommendation. In\nthis paper, instead of optimizing rating or top-n recommendation, we focus on\nthe task of predicting which items generate the highest user engagement. In\nparticular, we use Twitter as our testbed and cast the problem as a\nCollaborative Ranking task where the rich features extracted from the metadata\nof the tweets help to complement the transaction information limited to user\nids, item ids, ratings and timestamps. We learn a scoring function that\ndirectly optimizes the user engagement in terms of nDCG@10 on the predicted\nranking. Experiments conducted on an extended version of the MovieTweetings\ndataset, released as part of the RecSys Challenge 2014, show the effectiveness\nof our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2014 21:00:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Diaz-Aviles", "Ernesto", ""], ["Lam", "Hoang Thanh", ""], ["Pinelli", "Fabio", ""], ["Braghin", "Stefano", ""], ["Gkoufas", "Yiannis", ""], ["Berlingerio", "Michele", ""], ["Calabrese", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8339", "submitter": "Charith Perera", "authors": "Charith Perera, Rajiv Ranjan, Lizhe Wang, Samee U.

Some of these solutions may\nstore the data locally on the devices ('things'), and others may store in the\nCloud. The real value of collecting data comes through data processing and\naggregation in large-scale where new knowledge can be extracted. However, such\nprocedures can also lead to user privacy issues.

History has taught that over-regulation (too many rules) makes it\ndifficult to compete and under-regulation (too few rules) can lead to crisis.\nThis implies an optimal number of rules that avoids these two extremes. Rules\ncreate boundaries that define the latitude an individual has to perform their\nactivities. This paper creates a Toy Model of a work environment and examines\nit with respect to the latitude provided to a normal individual and the\nlatitude provided to an insider threat. Simulations with the Toy Model\nillustrate four regimes with respect to an insider threat: under-regulated,\npossibly optimal, tipping-point, and over-regulated. These regimes depend up\nthe number of rules (N) and the minimum latitude (Lmin) required by a normal\nindividual to carry out their activities. The Toy Model is then mapped onto the\nstandard 1D Percolation Model from theoretical physics and the same behavior is\nobserved. This allows the Toy Model to be generalized to a wide array of more\ncomplex models that have been well studied by the theoretical physics community\nand also show the same behavior. Finally, by estimating N and Lmin it should be\npossible to determine the regime of any particular environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:44:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kepner", "Jeremy", ""], ["Gadepally", "Vijay", ""], ["Michaleas", "Pete", ""]]}]
