It is used by financial institutions, phish site take down vendors,\ngovernment organizations, and online merchants. When a potential victim clicks\non a phishing link that has been taken down, he / she is redirected to the\nlanding page. In this paper, we present the comparative analysis on two\ndatasets that we obtained from APWG's landing page log files; one, from\nSeptember 7, 2008 - November 11, 2009, and other from January 1, 2014 - April\n30, 2014. We found that the landing page has been successful in training users\nagainst phishing. Forty six percent users clicked lesser number of phishing\nURLs from January 2014 to April 2014 which shows that training from the landing\npage helped users not to fall for phishing attacks. Our analysis shows that\nphishers have started to modify their techniques by creating more legitimate\nlooking URLs and buying large number of domains to increase their activity. We\nobserved that phishers are exploiting ICANN accredited registrars to launch\ntheir attacks even after strict surveillance. We saw that phishers are trying\nto exploit free subdomain registration services to carry out attacks. In this\npaper, we also compared the phishing e-mails used by phishers to lure victims\nin 2008 and 2014. We found that the phishing e-mails have changed considerably\nover time. Phishers have adopted new techniques like sending promotional\ne-mails and emotionally targeting users in clicking phishing URLs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Jun 2014 04:19:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Srishti", ""], ["Kumaraguru", "Ponnurangam", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.3692", "submitter": "Prateek Dewan", "authors": "Prateek Dewan and Anand Kashyap and Ponnurangam Kumaraguru", "title": "Analyzing Social and Stylometric Features to Identify Spear phishing\n  Emails", "comments": "Detection of spear phishing using social media features", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.LG cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spear phishing is a complex targeted attack in which, an attacker harvests\ninformation about the victim prior to the attack.

Online social media services can be one such source for gathering vital\ninformation about an individual. In this paper, we characterize and examine a\ntrue positive dataset of spear phishing, spam, and normal phishing emails from\nSymantec's enterprise email scanning service. We then present a model to detect\nspear phishing emails sent to employees of 14 international organizations, by\nusing social features extracted from LinkedIn.

We applied various machine learning algorithms to this\nlabeled data, and achieved an overall maximum accuracy of 97.76% in identifying\nspear phishing emails. We used a combination of social features from LinkedIn\nprofiles, and stylometric features extracted from email subjects, bodies, and\nattachments.

Such ventures\nhave been affecting traditional firms, and may represent a new organizational\nform. Despite the impact of such ventures, questions remain about their\noperating principles and performance. Here we define open collaboration (OC),\nthe underlying set of principles, and propose that it is a robust engine for\ninnovation and production. First, we review multiple OC ventures and identify\nfour defining principles. In all instances, participants create goods and\nservices of economic value, they exchange and reuse each other's work, they\nlabor purposefully with just loose coordination, and they permit anyone to\ncontribute and consume. These principles distinguish OC from other\norganizational forms, such as firms or cooperatives. Next, we turn to\nperformance. To understand the performance of OC, we develop a computational\nmodel, combining innovation theory with recent evidence on human cooperation.\nWe identify and investigate three elements that affect performance: the\ncooperativeness of participants, the diversity of their needs, and the degree\nto which the goods are rival (subtractable). Through computational experiments,\nwe find that OC performs well even in seemingly harsh environments: when\ncooperators are a minority, free riders are present, diversity is lacking, or\ngoods are rival. We conclude that OC is viable and likely to expand into new\ndomains.

Whilst our findings have implications for future citizen\nscience design, we also consider the wider implications for understanding\ncollective intelligence research in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jun 2014 20:02:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tinati", "Ramine", ""], ["Simperl", "Elena", ""], ["Luczak-Roesch", "Markus", ""], ["Van Kleek", "Max", ""], ["Shadbolt", "Nigel", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.7579", "submitter": "Walter Lasecki", "authors": "Ian Miller, and Gerald Cupchik", "title": "Meme creation and sharing processes: individuals shaping the masses", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "ci-2014/139", "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The propagation of online memes is initially influenced by meme creators and\nsecondarily by meme consumers, whose individual sharing decisions accumulate to\ndetermine total meme propagation. We characterize this as a sender/receiver\nsequence in which the first sender is also the creator. This sequence consists\nof two distinct processes, the creation process and the sharing process. We\ninvestigated these processes separately to determine their individual influence\non sharing outcomes. Our study observed participants creating memes in the lab.\nWe then tracked the sharing of those memes, derived a model of sharing\nbehavior, and implemented our sharing model in a contagion simulation.\n  Although we assume meme consumers typically have little or no information\nabout a meme's creator when making a decision about whether to share a meme\n(and vice versa), we nevertheless ask whether consumer re-sharing behavior can\nbe predicted based on features of the creator. Using human participants, web\nlog monitoring, and statistical model fitting, the resulting Creator Model of\nRe-sharing Behavior predicts 11.5% of the variance in the behavior of\nconsumers. Even when we know nothing about re-sharers of a meme, we can predict\nsomething about their behavior by observing the creation process.\n  To investigate the individual re-sharing decisions that, together, constitute\na meme's total consumer response, we built a statistical model from human\nobservation. Receivers make their decision to share as a function of the meme's\ncontent and their reaction to it, which we model as a consumer's decision to\nshare. The resulting Consumer Model of Sharing Decisions describes 37.5% of the\nvariance in this decision making process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:25:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Ian", ""], ["Cupchik", "Gerald", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.7588", "submitter": "Walter Lasecki", "authors": "Matthew Staffelbach, Peter Sempolinski, David Hachen, Ahsan Kareem,\n  Tracy Kijewski-Correa, Douglas Thain, Daniel Wei, and Greg Madey", "title": "Lessons Learned from an Experiment in Crowdsourcing Complex Citizen\n  Engineering Tasks with Amazon Mechanical Turk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "ci-2014/118", "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the feasibility of obtaining highly trustworthy results using\ncrowdsourcing on complex engineering tasks. Crowdsourcing is increasingly seen\nas a potentially powerful way of increasing the supply of labor for solving\nsociety's problems. While applications in domains such as citizen-science,\ncitizen-journalism or knowledge organization (e.g., Wikipedia) have seen many\nsuccessful applications, there have been fewer applications focused on solving\nengineering problems, especially those involving complex tasks. This may be in\npart because of concerns that low quality input into engineering analysis and\ndesign could result in failed structures leading to loss of life. We compared\nthe quality of work of the anonymous workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT),\nan online crowdsourcing service, with the quality of work of expert engineers\nin solving the complex engineering task of evaluating virtual wind tunnel data\ngraphs. On this representative complex engineering task, our results showed\nthat there was little difference between expert engineers and crowdworkers in\nthe quality of their work and explained reasons for these results.
