Yet, despite their great potential for\neducation, the use of MLGs by teachers, remains limited.

Therefore, researchers have\nrecently designed various types of MLG authoring tools. However, these\nauthoring tools are not always adapted to non-computer-scientists or\nnon-game-designers.

In more realistic\nscenarios, unconstrained policies do not lead to equality. In such cases, we\nshow that although imposing demographic parity may remedy it, there is a danger\nthat groups settle at a worse set of qualifications. As a silver lining, we\nalso identify when the constraint not only leads to equality, but also improves\nall groups. This gives quantifiable insight into both sides of the mismatch\nhypothesis.

It estimates the user's\nfloor and her 2D location on that floor. Hapi is calibration-free, only\nrequiring the building's floorplans and its WiFi APs' installation location for\ndeployment. Our analysis shows that while a user can hear APs from nearby\nfloors as well as her floor, she will typically only receive signals from\nspatially closer APs in distant floors, as compared to APs in her floor. This\nis due to signal attenuation by floors/ceilings along with the 3D distance\nbetween the APs and the user. Hapi leverages this observation to achieve\naccurate and robust location estimates. A deep-learning based method is\nproposed to identify the user's floor. Then, the identified floor along with\nthe user's visible APs from all floors are used to estimate her 2D location\nthrough a novel RSS-Rank Gaussian-based method. Additionally, we present a\nregression based method to predict Hapi's location estimates' quality and\nemploy it within a Kalman Filter to further refine the accuracy.

This objective sets a considerable challenge to\nambulance services worldwide, especially in metropolitan areas where the\ndensity of incident occurrence and traffic congestion are high. Using London as\na case study, in this paper we consider the advantages and limitations of\ndata-driven methods for ambulance routing and navigation. Our long-term aim is\nto enable considerable improvements to their operational efficiency through the\nautomated generation of more effective response strategies and tactics. A key\ningredient of our approach is to use a large historical dataset of incidents\nand ambulance location traces to model route selection and arrival times.\nWorking on the London road network graph modified to reflect the differences\nbetween emergency and civilian vehicle traffic, we develop a methodology for\nthe precise estimation of expected ambulance speed at the individual road\nsegment level. We demonstrate how a model that exploits this information\nachieves best predictive performance by implicitly capturing route-specific\npersistent patterns in changing traffic conditions. We then present a\npredictive method that achieves a high route similarity score while minimising\njourney duration error. This is achieved through the combination of a technique\nthat correctly predicts routes selected by the current navigation system of the\nLondon Ambulance Service and our best performing speed estimation model.

These farmers often lack access to either cold storage or market\nforecasts. In particular, by having access to cold storage, farmers can store\ntheir produce for longer and thus have more flexibility as to when they should\nsell their harvest by. Meanwhile, by having access to market forecasts, farmers\ncan more easily identify which markets to sell at and when. While affordable\ncold storage solutions have become more widely available, there has been less\nwork on produce price forecasting. A key challenge is that in many regions of\nIndia, predominantly in rural and remote areas, we have either very limited or\nno produce pricing data available from public online sources.\n  In this paper, we present a produce price forecasting system that pulls data\nfrom the Indian Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare's website\nAgmarknet, trains a model of prices using over a thousand markets, and displays\ninterpretable price forecasts in a web application viewable from a mobile\nphone. Due to the pricing data being extremely sparse, our method first imputes\nmissing entries using collaborative filtering to obtain a dense dataset. Using\nthis imputed dense dataset, we then train a decision-tree-based classifier to\npredict produce prices at different markets. In terms of interpretability, we\ndisplay the most relevant historical pricing data that drive each forecasted\nprice, where we take advantage of the fact that a wide family of\ndecision-tree-based ensemble learning methods are adaptive nearest neighbor\nmethods.

Using SentiSE, a customized and\nstate-of-the-art sentiment analysis tool for the software engineering domain,\nwe classify each communication as negative, positive, or neutral. We also\ncompute the frequencies of sentiment words, emoticons, and expletives used by\neach developer. Results: Our results suggest that the likelihood of using\nsentiment words, emoticons, and expletives during code reviews varies based on\nthe gender of a developer, as females are significantly less likely to express\nsentiments than males. Although female developers were more neutral to their\nmale colleagues than to another female, male developers from three out of the\nsix projects were not only writing more frequent negative comments but also\nwithholding positive encouragements from their female counterparts. Conclusion:\nOur results provide empirical evidence of another factor behind the negative\nwork place experiences encountered by the female developers that may be\ncontributing to the diminishing number of females in the SE industry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2018 18:20:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Paul", "Rajshakhar", ""], ["Bosu", "Amiangshu", ""], ["Sultana", "Kazi Zakia", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.05756", "submitter": "Maricor Soriano", "authors": "K.G.

Verified accounts are deemed worthy of platform-wide public\ninterest and are separately authenticated by the platform itself.

Hence, we attempt to characterize the network\nof verified users on Twitter and compare the results to similar analysis\nperformed for the entire Twitter network. We extracted the entire network of\nverified users on Twitter (as of July 2018) and obtained 231,246 user profiles\nand 79,213,811 connections.
