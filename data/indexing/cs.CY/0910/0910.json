Here we analyse large data sets about\nusers and Blogs which they write and comment, mapped onto a bipartite graph. In\nsuch enlarged Blog space we trace user activity over time, which results in\nrobust temporal patterns of user--Blog behavior and the emergence of\ncommunities. With the spectral methods applied to the projection on weighted\nuser network we detect clusters of users related to their common interests and\nhabits. Our results suggest that different mechanisms may play the role in the\ncase of very popular Blogs. Our analysis makes a suitable basis for theoretical\nmodeling of the evolution of cyber communities and for practical study of the\ndata, in particular for an efficient search of interesting Blog clusters and\nfurther retrieval of their contents by text analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2009 11:54:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mitrovi\u0107", "Marija", ""], ["Tadi\u0107", "Bosiljka", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4292", "submitter": "Vassilis Kostakos", "authors": "Vassilis Kostakos", "title": "An empirical study of spatial and transpatial social networks using\n  Bluetooth and Facebook", "comments": "17 pages,4 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "IEEE SocialCom, p. 587-594, 2010", "doi": "10.1109/SocialCom.2010.181", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study provides insights into the quantitative similarities, differences\nand relationships between users' spatial, face-to-face, urban social networks\nand their transpatial, online counterparts. We explore and map the social ties\nwithin a cohort of 2602 users, and how those ties are mediated via physical\nco-presence and online tools. Our analysis focused on isolating two distinct\nsegments of the social network: one mediated by physical co-presence, and the\nother mediated by Facebook. Our results suggest that as a whole the networks\nexhibit homogeneous characteristics, but individuals' involvement in those\nnetworks varies considerably. Furthermore this study provides a methodological\napproach for jointly analysing spatial & transpatial networks utilising\npervasive and ubiquitous technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2009 11:09:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kostakos", "Vassilis", ""]]}]
