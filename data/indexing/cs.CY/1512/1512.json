We\nanalyze these data extracted from emails and combine them with demographic\ninformation to characterize, model, and predict consumer behavior. Breaking\ndown purchasing by age and gender, we find that the amount of money spent on\nonline purchases grows sharply with age, peaking in late 30s. Men are more\nfrequent online purchasers and spend more money when compared to women. Linking\nonline shopping to income, we find that shoppers from more affluent areas\npurchase more expensive items and buy them more frequently, resulting in\nsignificantly more money spent on online purchases. We also look at dynamics of\npurchasing behavior and observe daily and weekly cycles in purchasing behavior,\nsimilarly to other online activities.\n  More specifically, we observe temporal patterns in purchasing behavior\nsuggesting shoppers have finite budgets: the more expensive an item, the longer\nthe shopper waits since the last purchase to buy it. We also observe that\nshoppers who email each other purchase more similar items than socially\nunconnected shoppers, and this effect is particularly evident among women.\nFinally, we build a model to predict when shoppers will make a purchase and how\nmuch will spend on it. We find that temporal features improve prediction\naccuracy over competitive baselines. A better understanding of consumer\nbehavior can help improve marketing efforts and make online shopping more\npleasant and efficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 20:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kooti", "Farshad", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""], ["Aiello", "Luca Maria", ""], ["Grbovic", "Mihajlo", ""], ["Djuric", "Nemanja", ""], ["Radosavljevic", "Vladan", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.05020", "submitter": "Cristian Jara Figueroa", "authors": "C.

However, risk is not the only possible\ncyber security metric. Other metrics such as resilience can exist and could be\npotentially very valuable to defenders of ICS systems. Often, metrics are\ndefined as measurable properties of a system that quantify the degree to which\nobjectives of the system are achieved. Metrics can provide cyber defenders of\nan ICS with critical insights regarding the system. Metrics are generally\nacquired by analyzing relevant attributes of that system. In terms of cyber\nsecurity metrics, ICSs tend to have unique features: in many cases, these\nsystems are older technologies that were designed for functionality rather than\nsecurity. They are also extremely diverse systems that have different\nrequirements and objectives. Therefore, metrics for ICSs must be tailored to a\ndiverse group of systems with many features and perform many different\nfunctions. In this chapter, we first outline the general theory of performance\nmetrics, and highlight examples from the cyber security domain and ICS in\nparticular. We then focus on a particular example of a class of metrics that is\ndifferent from the one we have considered in earlier chapters. Instead of risk,\nhere we consider metrics of resilience. Resilience is defined by the National\nAcademy of Sciences (2012) as the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb,\nrecover from, or more successfully adapt to actual or potential adverse events.\nThis chapter presents two approaches for the generation of metrics based on the\nconcept of resilience using a matrix-based approach and a network-based\napproach. Finally, a discussion of the benefits and drawbacks of different\nmethods is presented along with a process and tips intended to aid in devising\neffective metrics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Dec 2015 00:26:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Collier", "Zachary A.", ""], ["Panwar", "Mahesh", ""], ["Ganin", "Alexander A.", ""], ["Kott", "Alex", ""], ["Linkov", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08580", "submitter": "Hongjian Wang", "authors": "Hongjian Wang, Zhenhui Li, Yu-Hsuan Kuo, Dan Kifer", "title": "A Simple Baseline for Travel Time Estimation using Large-Scale Trip Data", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The increased availability of large-scale trajectory data around the world\nprovides rich information for the study of urban dynamics.

However, despite its\nutility, only 21% of students surveyed at a Lebanese university claim to have\never used the technology. To investigate whether a cultural influence is\naffecting intention to use RSS, the survey was extended to the British context\nto conduct a cross-cultural comparison. Using the Technology Adoption Model\n(TAM) as a research framework, 437 students responded to a questionnaire\ncontaining four constructs: intention to use (INT); attitude towards benefit\n(ATT); perceived usefulness (PU); and perceived ease of use (PEOU). Principle\ncomponents analysis (PCA) and structural equation modelling (SEM) were used to\nexplore the psychometric qualities of the scale. The results show that adoption\nwas significantly higher, but also modest, in the British context at 36%.\nConfigural and metric invariance were fully supported, while scalar and\nfactorial invariance were partially supported. Analysis reveals that, as a\npotential consequence of culture, there are significant differences between PU\nand PEOU across the two contexts studied, potentially as a consequence of\nculture. It is recommended that faculty demonstrate to students how RSS can be\nused effectively in order to increase awareness and emphasise usefulness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 17:17:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tarhini", "Ali", ""], ["Scott", "Michael James", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09176", "submitter": "Jie Xu", "authors": "Jie Xu, Tianwei Xing, Mihaela van der Schaar", "title": "Personalized Course Sequence Recommendations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2016.2595495", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given the variability in student learning it is becoming increasingly\nimportant to tailor courses as well as course sequences to student needs. This\npaper presents a systematic methodology for offering personalized course\nsequence recommendations to students. First, a forward-search\nbackward-induction algorithm is developed that can optimally select course\nsequences to decrease the time required for a student to graduate. The\nalgorithm accounts for prerequisite requirements (typically present in higher\nlevel education) and course availability. Second, using the tools of\nmulti-armed bandits, an algorithm is developed that can optimally recommend a\ncourse sequence that both reduces the time to graduate while also increasing\nthe overall GPA of the student. The algorithm dynamically learns how students\nwith different contextual backgrounds perform for given course sequences and\nthen recommends an optimal course sequence for new students. Using real-world\nstudent data from the UCLA Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department, we\nillustrate how the proposed algorithms outperform other methods that do not\ninclude student contextual information when making course sequence\nrecommendations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 22:57:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 01:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Jie", ""], ["Xing", "Tianwei", ""], ["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""]]}]
