Peer\nreview is one method to encourage this by providing students with the\nopportunity to evaluate other people's work and to receive feedback on their\nown projects. This allows for rich learning experience but it is not\nimmediately obvious how to create a programming project review that will\nimprove the students' conceptual understanding, require higher level thinking,\nand be engaging. The current literature does not typically address differences\nbetween review implementations or provide reasons for design decisions. This\nwork explored how two different types of reviews affected the students'\nlearning of concepts, high-level thinking, and engagement. There were\nindications that the type of review affected how well students addressed the\nconcept they were reviewing and the comments' length. This shows that the\nreview's type may affect student engagement and conceptual learning. There were\nalso differences in how they reviewed the concepts of Abstraction,\nDecomposition, and Encapsulation, suggesting that the concepts are being\nlearned in different ways. Both of these results have an impact on the use of\npeer review computer science but need further investigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2009 18:10:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Turner", "Scott", ""], ["Perez-Quinones", "Manuel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.3520", "submitter": "George Djorgovski", "authors": "S.
