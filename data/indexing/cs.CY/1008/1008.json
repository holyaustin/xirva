The Formaleuro (FEUR) as a dimension for monetary\nquantities is proposed as well as the Formalbitcoin (FBTC) which represents an\nitem ready for circulation in a model of informational money.\n  An attempt is made to understand the concept of money from scratch. In order\nto provide a definition of money the need is felt to make use of a tailored\ntheory of definition. To that end a theory of imaginative definitions is\npresented and its implications for definitions of money are sketched.\n  It is argued that a theory of money may be dependent on the role of its\nholder. A survey of some roles is given, with the so-called subordinate\nadministrative role (SAR) in a central position.\n  The concepts of virtual memory and virtual machine are taken as the point of\ndeparture for a definition of the notion of virtual money. It is argued that\nfrom the perspective of a component (division) of a large organization (ORG)\nits local financial system (LFS) provides a virtual money vm(LFS, ORG) which\nmay well fail to meet the most common general and acknowledged moneyness\ncriteria. Inverse moneyness preference is coined as phrase to assert the\ntendency of top-management of ORG to make its virtual money deviate from these\ncriteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 18:30:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 20:15:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "Jan A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1188", "submitter": "Andrei Zinovyev Dr.", "authors": "Andrei Zinovyev", "title": "Data visualization in political and social sciences", "comments": "To appear as a \"Data Visualization\" entry in SAGE \"International\n  Encyclopedia of Political Science\" by Badie, B., Berg-Schlosser, D., Morlino,\n  L.

As a consequence,\nthere exists a continuous trend for political science to gradually become a\nmore quantitative scientific field and to use quantitative information in the\nanalysis and reasoning. It is believed that any objective analysis in political\nscience must be multidimensional and combine various sources of quantitative\ninformation; however, human capabilities for perception of large massifs of\nnumerical information are limited. Hence, methods and approaches for\nvisualization of quantitative and qualitative data (and, especially\nmultivariate data) is an extremely important topic. Data visualization\napproaches can be classified into several groups, starting from creating\ninformative charts and diagrams (statistical graphics and infographics) and\nending with advanced statistical methods for visualizing multidimensional\ntables containing both quantitative and qualitative information. In this\narticle we provide a short review of existing methods of data visualization\nmethods with applications in political and social science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Aug 2010 13:29:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zinovyev", "Andrei", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1253", "submitter": "Wojciech Galuba", "authors": "Daniel M.

Workers were hired\nfrom an online labor market to perform an image-labeling task and, in some\ncases, to evaluate the work product of other workers. These evaluations had\nfinancial consequences for both the evaluating worker and the evaluated worker.\nThe experiments showed that on average, evaluating high-output work raised an\nevaluator's subsequent productivity, with larger effects for evaluators that\nare themselves highly productive. The content of the subject evaluations\nthemselves suggest one mechanism for peer effects: workers readily punished\nother workers whose work product exhibited low output/effort. However,\nnon-compliance with employer expectations did not, by itself, trigger\npunishment: workers would not punish non-complying workers so long as the\nevaluated worker still exhibited high effort. A worker's willingness to punish\nwas strongly correlated with their own productivity, yet this relationship was\nnot the result of innate differences---productivity-reducing manipulations also\nresulted in reduced punishment. Peer effects proved hard to stamp out: although\nmost workers complied with clearly communicated maximum expectations for\noutput, some workers still raised their production beyond the output ceiling\nafter evaluating highly productive yet non-complying work products.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Aug 2010 12:34:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Horton", "John J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.2556", "submitter": "Manuel Cebrian", "authors": "Coco Krumme, Manuel Cebrian, and Alex Pentland", "title": "Patterns of Individual Shopping Behavior", "comments": "4 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Krumme, C., Llorente, A., Cebrian, M., Pentland, A.(S.) & Moro, E.\n  The predictability of consumer visitation patterns.
