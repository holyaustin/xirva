We consider the development of\nmulti-scale public health strategies and simulate policies for community-level\nresponse aimed at early screening of communities rather than individuals, as\nwell as travel restrictions to prevent community cross-contamination. Our\nanalysis shows the policies to be effective even at a relatively low level of\ncompliance. In our simulations, 40% of individuals conforming to these policies\nis enough to stop the outbreak. Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are\nconsistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline\nafter mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective\nat reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40%\nlevel, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected\nareas. Our results suggest that the multi-scale approach can be used to further\nevolve public health strategy for defeating emerging epidemics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 15:47:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 15:49:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wong", "Vincent", ""], ["Cooney", "Daniel", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07096", "submitter": "Pietro Michelucci", "authors": "Pietro Michelucci, Lea Shanley, Janis Dickinson, Haym Hirsh", "title": "A U.S. Research Roadmap for Human Computation", "comments": "32 pages, 25 figures, Workshop report from the CRA-sponsored Human\n  Computation Roadmap Summit: P.
