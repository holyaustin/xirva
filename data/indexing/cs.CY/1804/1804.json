Improved understanding\nof innovation diffusion across locations and through social connections can\nprovide us with new insights into the spread of information, technological\nprogress and economic development. In this work, we analyze the spatial\nadoption dynamics of iWiW, an Online Social Network (OSN) in Hungary and\nuncover empirical features about the spatial adoption in social networks.\nDuring its entire life cycle from 2002 to 2012, iWiW reached up to 300 million\nfriendship ties of 3 million users. We find that the number of adopters as a\nfunction of town population follows a scaling law that reveals a strongly\nconcentrated early adoption in large towns and a less concentrated late\nadoption. We also discover a strengthening distance decay of spread over the\nlife-cycle indicating high fraction of distant diffusion in early stages but\nthe dominance of local diffusion in late stages. The spreading process is\nmodelled within the Bass diffusion framework that enables us to compare the\ndifferential equation version with an agent-based version of the model run on\nthe empirical network. Although both models can capture the macro trend of\nadoption, they have limited capacity to describe the observed trends of urban\nscaling and distance decay. We find, however that incorporating adoption\nthresholds, defined by the fraction of social connections that adopt a\ntechnology before the individual adopts, improves the network model fit to the\nurban scaling of early adopters. Controlling for the threshold distribution\nenables us to eliminate the bias induced by local network structure on\npredicting local adoption peaks.

In America forecasting\ntools are widely used by judiciary systems for making decisions about risk\noffenders based on criminal justice for risk offenders. By making use of such\ntools, the judiciary relies on ADM in order to make error free judgement on\noffenders. For this purpose, one of the quality measures for machine learning\ntechniques which is widly used, the $AUC$ (area under curve), is compared to\nand contrasted for results with the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value).\nKeeping in view the criticality of judgement along with a high dependency on\ntools offering ADM, it is necessary to evaluate risk tools that aid in decision\nmaking based on algorithms. In this methodology, such an evaluation is\nconducted by implementing a common machine learning approach called binary\nclassifier, as it determines the binary outcome of the underlying juristic\nquestion. This thesis showed that the $PPV_k$ (positive predictive value)\ntechnique models the decision of judges much better than the $AUC$. Therefore,\nthis research has investigated whether there exists a classifier for which the\n$PPV_k$ deviates from $AUC$ by a large proportion. It could be shown that the\ndeviation can rise up to 0.75. In order to test this deviation on an already in\nused Classifier, data from the fourth generation risk assement tool COMPAS was\nused. The result were were quite alarming as the two measures derivate from\neach other by 0.48. In this study, the risk assessment evaluation of the\nforecasting tools was successfully conducted, carefully reviewed and examined.\nAdditionally, it is also discussed whether such systems used for the purpose of\nmaking decisions should be socially accepted or not.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 18:27:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Krafft", "Tobias D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.01758", "submitter": "Venet Osmani", "authors": "Venet Osmani, Li Li, Matteo Danieletto, Benjamin Glicksberg, Joel\n  Dudley, Oscar Mayora", "title": "Processing of Electronic Health Records using Deep Learning: A review", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Availability of large amount of clinical data is opening up new research\navenues in a number of fields.

However, its accuracy is dependent on\nmany factors, not least the avoidance of judgement biases, such as the\nanchoring bias, arising from being influenced by initial information, even when\nit's misleading or irrelevant. This strong effect is widely documented.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to replicate this anchoring bias using professionals and,\nnovel in a software engineering context, explore de-biasing interventions\nthrough increasing knowledge and awareness of judgement biases. METHOD: We ran\ntwo series of experiments in company settings with a total of 410 software\ndevelopers. Some developers took part in a workshop to heighten their awareness\nof a range of cognitive biases, including anchoring. Later, the anchoring bias\nwas induced by presenting low or high productivity values, followed by the\nparticipants' estimates of their own project productivity. Our hypothesis was\nthat the workshop would lead to reduced bias, i.e., work as a de-biasing\nintervention. RESULTS: The anchors had a large effect (robust Cohen's $d=1.19$)\nin influencing estimates. This was substantially reduced in those participants\nwho attended the workshop (robust Cohen's $d=0.72$). The reduced bias related\nmainly to the high anchor. The de-biasing intervention also led to a threefold\nreduction in estimate variance. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of anchors upon\njudgement was substantial. Learning about judgement biases does appear capable\nof mitigating, although not removing, the anchoring bias. The positive effect\nof de-biasing through learning about biases suggests that it has value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Apr 2018 10:47:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Shepperd", "Martin", ""], ["Mair", "Carolyn", ""], ["J\u00f8rgensen", "Magne", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.03993", "submitter": "Takumi Ichimura", "authors": "Takumi Ichimura, Shin Kamada", "title": "A Generation Method of Filtering Rules of Twitter Via Smartphone Based\n  Participatory Sensing System for Tourist by Interactive GHSOM and C4.5", "comments": "6 pages, 7figures, Proc. of 2012 IEEE International Conference on\n  Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC 2012). arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1804.02620", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICSMC.2012.6377685", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile Phone based Participatory Sensing (MPPS) systems involve a community\nof users sending personal information and participating in autonomous sensing\nthrough their mobile phones.

To be effective, a policy has to\nconsider a broad range of elements, such as pollution emission, traffic flow,\nand human mobility. Due to the complexity and variability of these elements in\nthe urban area, to produce effective policies remains a very challenging task.\nWith the introduction of the smart city paradigm, a widely available amount of\ndata can be generated in the urban spaces. Such data can be a fundamental\nsource of knowledge to improve policies because they can reflect the\nsustainability issues underlying the city. In this context, we propose an\napproach to exploit urban positioning data based on stigmergy, a bio-inspired\nmechanism providing scalar and temporal aggregation of samples. By employing\nstigmergy, samples in proximity with each other are aggregated into a\nfunctional structure called trail. The trail summarizes relevant dynamics in\ndata and allows matching them, providing a measure of their similarity.\nMoreover, this mechanism can be specialized to unfold specific dynamics.\nSpecifically, we identify high-density urban areas (i.e hotspots), analyze\ntheir activity over time, and unfold anomalies. Moreover, by matching activity\npatterns, a continuous measure of the dissimilarity with respect to the typical\nactivity pattern is provided. This measure can be used by policy makers to\nevaluate the effect of policies and change them dynamically.

This paper argues\nthat data provenance methods show much promise as a technical means for\nincreasing the transparency of these interconnected systems. Specifically,\ngiven the concerns regarding ever-increasing levels of automated and\nalgorithmic decision-making, and so-called 'algorithmic systems' in general, we\npropose decision provenance as a concept showing much promise.

This paper introduces the concept of decision provenance, and takes an\ninterdisciplinary (tech-legal) exploration into its potential for assisting\naccountability in algorithmic systems. We argue that decision provenance can\nhelp facilitate oversight, audit, compliance, risk mitigation, and user\nempowerment, and we also indicate the implementation considerations and areas\nfor research necessary for realising its vision.

Here we\nexamine the emergence of complex governance regimes in 5,000 sovereign,\nresource-constrained, self-governing online communities, ranging in scale from\none to thousands of users. Each community begins with no community members and\nno governance infrastructure. As communities grow, they are subject to\nselection pressures that keep better managed servers better populated. We\nidentify predictors of community success and test the hypothesis that\ngovernance complexity can enhance community fitness. We find that what predicts\nsuccess depends on size: changes in complexity predict increased success with\nlarger population servers. Specifically, governance rules in a large successful\ncommunity are more numerous and broader in scope. They also tend to rely more\non rules that concentrate power in administrators, and on rules that manage bad\nbehavior and limited server resources. Overall, this work is consistent with\ntheories that formal integrated governance systems emerge to organize\ncollective responses to interdependent resource management problems, especially\nas factors such as population size exacerbate those problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 01:06:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 06:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Frey", "Seth", ""], ["Sumner", "Robert W", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10367", "submitter": "Araz Taeihagh", "authors": "Hazel Si Min Lim and Araz Taeihagh", "title": "Autonomous Vehicles for Smart and Sustainable Cities: An In-Depth\n  Exploration of Privacy and Cybersecurity Implications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Energies 11, no. 5: 1062 (2018)", "doi": "10.3390/en11051062", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Amidst rapid urban development, sustainable transportation solutions are\nrequired to meet the increasing demands for mobility whilst mitigating the\npotentially negative social, economic, and environmental impacts.

However, convincing US courts to adopt specific measures to\nquantify gerrymandering has been of limited success to date. Recently,\nStephanopoulos and McGhee introduced a new and precise measure of partisan\ngerrymandering via the so-called \"efficiency gap\" that computes the absolutes\ndifference of wasted votes between two political parties in a two-party system.\nQuite importantly from a legal point of view, this measure was found legally\nconvincing enough in a US appeals court in a case that claims that the\nlegislative map of the state of Wisconsin was gerrymandered; the case is now\npending in US Supreme Court. In this article, we show the following:\n  (a) We provide interesting mathematical and computational complexity\nproperties of the problem of minimizing the efficiency gap measure. To the best\nof our knowledge, these are the first non-trivial theoretical and algorithmic\nanalyses of this measure of gerrymandering.\n  (b) We provide a simple and fast algorithm that can \"un-gerrymander\" the\ndistrict maps for the states of Texas, Virginia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by\nbring their efficiency gaps to acceptable levels from the current unacceptable\nlevels. Our work thus shows that, notwithstanding the general worst case\napproximation hardness of the efficiency gap measure as shown by us,finding\ndistrict maps with acceptable levels of efficiency gaps is a computationally\ntractable problem from a practical point of view. Based on these empirical\nresults, we also provide some interesting insights into three practical issues\nrelated the efficiency gap measure.\n  We believe that, should the US Supreme Court uphold the decision of lower\ncourts, our research work and software will provide a crucial supporting hand\nto remove partisan gerrymandering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 16:12:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chatterjee", "Tanima", ""], ["DasGupta", "Bhaskar", ""], ["Palmieri", "Laura", ""], ["Al-Qurashi", "Zainab", ""], ["Sidiropoulos", "Anastasios", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10645", "submitter": "Kevin Liu", "authors": "Kevin Liu and Harsh Desai and Lalana Kagal and Murat Kantarcioglu", "title": "Enforceable Data Sharing Agreements Using Smart Contracts", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As more and more data is collected for various reasons, the sharing of such\ndata becomes paramount to increasing its value.
