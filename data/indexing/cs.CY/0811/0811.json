Using two content\nsharing portals, Youtube and Digg, we show that by modeling the accrual of\nviews and votes on content offered by these services we can predict the\nlong-term dynamics of individual submissions from initial data. In the case of\nDigg, measuring access to given stories during the first two hours allows us to\nforecast their popularity 30 days ahead with remarkable accuracy, while\ndownloads of Youtube videos need to be followed for 10 days to attain the same\nperformance. The differing time scales of the predictions are shown to be due\nto differences in how content is consumed on the two portals: Digg stories\nquickly become outdated, while Youtube videos are still found long after they\nare initially submitted to the portal. We show that predictions are more\naccurate for submissions for which attention decays quickly, whereas\npredictions for evergreen content will be prone to larger errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 05:38:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Szabo", "Gabor", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0709", "submitter": "Joost Broekens", "authors": "Joost Broekens", "title": "MMOGs as Social Experiments: the Case of Environmental Laws", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we argue that Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs), also\nknown as Large Games are an interesting research tool for policy\nexperimentation.

We use active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)\ndevices that assess contacts with one another by exchanging low-power radio\npackets. When individuals wear the beacons as a badge, a persistent radio\ncontact between the RFID devices can be used as a proxy for a social\ninteraction between individuals.
