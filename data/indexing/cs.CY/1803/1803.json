QED-Tutrix is an intelligent tutor for geometry\noffering an interface to help high school students in the resolution of\ndemonstration problems. It focuses on specific goals: 1) to allow the student\nto freely explore the problem and its figure, 2) to accept proofs elements in\nany order, 3) to handle a variety of proofs, which can be customized by the\nteacher, and 4) to be able to help the student at any step of the resolution of\nthe problem, if the need arises. The software is also independent from the\nintervention of the teacher. QED-Tutrix offers an interesting approach to\ngeometry education, but is currently crippled by the lengthiness of the process\nof implementing new problems, a task that must still be done manually.\nTherefore, one of the main focuses of the QED-Tutrix' research team is to ease\nthe implementation of new problems, by automating the tedious step of finding\nall possible proofs for a given problem. This automation must follow\nfundamental constraints in order to create problems compatible with QED-Tutrix:\n1) readability of the proofs, 2) accessibility at a high school level, and 3)\npossibility for the teacher to modify the parameters defining the\n\"acceptability\" of a proof. We present in this paper the result of our\npreliminary exploration of possible avenues for this task. Automated theorem\nproving in geometry is a widely studied subject, and various provers exist.\nHowever, our constraints are quite specific and some adaptation would be\nrequired to use an existing prover. We have therefore implemented a prototype\nof automated prover to suit our needs. The future goal is to compare\nperformances and usability in our specific use-case between the existing\nprovers and our implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Mar 2018 02:46:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Font", "Ludovic", "", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al"], ["Richard", "Philippe R.", "", "Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al"], ["Gagnon", "Michel", "", "\u00c9cole Polytechnique de\n  Montr\u00e9al"]]}, {"id": "1803.01470", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Alan Krempler, Walther Neuper", "title": "Prototyping \"Systems that Explain Themselves\" for Education", "comments": "In Proceedings ThEdu'17, arXiv:1803.00722", "journal-ref": "EPTCS 267, 2018, pp. 89-107", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.267.6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SE cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  \"Systems that Explain Themselves\" appears a provocative wording, in\nparticular in the context of mathematics education -- it is as provocative as\nthe idea of building educational software upon technology from computer theorem\nproving.

I carefully distinguish this\ninterpretation from the Moral Turing Test, which is not motivated by a\nprinciple of fair play, but instead depends on imitation of human moral\nbehavior. Finally, I consider how the framework of fair play can be used to\nsituate the debate over robot rights within the alignment literature.

Digital computers can indeed surprise us. Just like a piece of art,\nalgorithms can be designed in such a way as to lead us to question our\nunderstanding of the world, or our place within it. Some humans do lose the\ncapacity to be surprised in that way. It might be fear, or it might be the\ncomfort of ideological certainties. As lazy normative animals, we do need to be\nable to rely on authorities to simplify our reasoning: that is ok.

A fourth property characterises the way\nthe above abilities manifest themselves in computer systems. The 4 properties\nare then analyzed in 3 families of case studies, each consisting of 3 software\nsystems that embed different resilience methods. Our major conclusion is that\nreasoning in terms of resilience sub-properties may help revealing the\ncharacteristics and limitations of classic methods and tools meant to achieve\nsystem and organisational resilience.

This observation leads this chapter to argue that the field of\ne-democracy has generally failed to live up to its own reformist rhetoric. It\nargues that instead of reforming government processes through technology,\ne-democracy projects have tended to focus either on lowering the costs and\nincreasing the efficiency of existing political processes or on analysing the\ncivic participation that occurs outside of purpose-built e-democracy platforms.\nThe chapter suggests that this lack of attention to the Internet's potential\nfor systemic change in formal political institutions has little normative\nimpact on the democratization of society and may even re-enforce, rather than\nchallenge, the sociopolitical status quo. Further, it suggests that the current\napproach of e-democracy risks normalizing the Internet to the norms and\nexpectations of the offline world. To elucidate this argument, this chapter\noverviews both the general trend of e-democracy projects and criticisms of\nthose projects. Finally, the chapter proposes a more radical vision of\ne-democracy that, it suggests, would usher a larger potential for\ndemocratization. This more radical vision of e-democracy consists of\nrecognizing the attributes of the Internet that transcend the limits of the\nanalogue world and applying these to democracy. Such an approach would open the\npath for envisaging new political processes and systems, allowing the field of\ne-democracy to live up to its own rhetoric, and affording society the means to\naddress multiple of the centuries-old problems faced by democracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2018 09:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bastick", "Zach", "", "ESPOL"]]}, {"id": "1803.06464", "submitter": "Wen Shen", "authors": "Wen Shen, Rohan Achar and Cristina V.
