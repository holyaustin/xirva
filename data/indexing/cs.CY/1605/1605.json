The fog\ninterface is a low-power embedded system that acts as a smart interface between\nthe smartwatch and the cloud. It collects, stores, and processes the speech\ndata before sending speech features to secure cloud storage. We developed and\nvalidated a working prototype of FIT that enabled remote processing of clinical\nspeech data to get speech clinical features such as loudness, short-time\nenergy, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid. We used speech data from six\npatients with PD in their homes for validating FIT.
