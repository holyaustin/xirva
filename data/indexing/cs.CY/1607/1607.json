At the same time, they are\n(in many cases) unable to properly manage the access to this sensitive\ninformation due to the following issues: i) the rigidness of the access control\nmechanism implemented by the OSN, and ii) many users lack of technical\nknowledge about data privacy and access control. To tackle these limitations,\nin this paper, we propose a dynamic, transparent and privacy-driven access\ncontrol mechanism for textual messages published in OSNs. The notion of\nprivacy-driven is achieved by analyzing the semantics of the messages to be\npublished and, according to that, assessing the degree of sensitiveness of\ntheir contents. For this purpose, the proposed system relies on an automatic\nsemantic annotation mechanism that, by using knowledge bases and linguistic\ntools, is able to associate a meaning to the information to be published. By\nmeans of this annotation, our mechanism automatically detects the information\nthat is sensitive according to the privacy requirements of the publisher of\ndata, with regard to the type of reader that may access such data. Finally, our\naccess control mechanism automatically creates sanitized versions of the users'\npublications according to the type of reader that accesses them. As a result,\nour proposal, which can be integrated in already existing social networks,\nprovides an automatic, seamless and content-driven protection of user\npublications, which are coherent with her privacy requirements and the type of\nreaders that access them. Complementary to the system design, we also discuss\nthe feasibility of the system by illustrating it through a real example and\nevaluate its accuracy and effectiveness over standard approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 09:09:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Imran-Daud", "Malik", ""], ["S\u00e1nchez", "David", ""], ["Viejo", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00913", "submitter": "Iyad Rahwan", "authors": "Manuel Alfonseca, Manuel Cebrian, Antonio Fernandez Anta, Lorenzo\n  Coviello, Andres Abeliuk, Iyad Rahwan", "title": "Superintelligence cannot be contained: Lessons from Computability Theory", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) 70 (2021) 65-76", "doi": "10.1613/jair.1.12202", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far\nsurpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds.

The irrigation\nstrategies adopted by the agents are investigated using game theory. A set of\nfive irrigators, growing three crops: corn, sorghum and wheat, have been\nconsidered in this study. To allow groundwater flow, these agents are assumed\nto be located in adjoining farm lands.

In addition to becoming an influential part of modern dating culture, MDAs\nfacilitate a unique form of mediated communication: dyadic mobile text messages\nbetween pairs of users who are not already acquainted. Furthermore, mobile\ndating has paved the way for analysis of these digital interactions via massive\nsets of data generated by the instant matching and messaging functions of its\nmany platforms at an unprecedented scale. This paper looks at one of these sets\nof data: metadata of approximately two million conversations, containing 19\nmillion messages, exchanged between 400,000 heterosexual users on an MDA.\nThrough computational analysis methods, this study offers the very first large\nscale quantitative depiction of mobile dating as a whole. We report on\ndifferences in how heterosexual male and female users communicate with each\nother on MDAs, differences in behaviors of dyads of varying degrees of social\nseparation, and factors leading to \"success\"-operationalized by the exchange of\nphone numbers between a match. For instance, we report that men initiate 79% of\nconversations--and while about half of the initial messages are responded to,\nconversations initiated by men are more likely to be reciprocated. We also\nreport that the length of conversations, the waiting times, and the length of\nmessages have fat-tailed distributions. That said, the majority of reciprocated\nconversations lead to a phone number exchange within the first 20 messages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 12:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jennie", ""], ["Yasseri", "Taha", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.03575", "submitter": "Cuiyun Gao", "authors": "Cuiyun Gao, Hui Xu, Yichuan Man, Yangfan Zhou, Michael R.

In\nthe paper, we aim at understanding the ad costs from users perspective.

To verify whether\ndifferent ad integration schemes generate different ad costs, we first obtain\nthe commonly used ad schemes from 104 popular apps, and then design a framework\nnamed IntelliAd to automatically measure the ad costs of each scheme. To\ndemonstrate whether these costs indeed influence users reactions, we finally\nobserve the correlations between the measured ad costs and the user\nperceptions. We discover that the costs related to memory/CPU overhead and\nbattery consumption are more concerned by users, while the traffic usage is\nless concerned by users in spite of its obvious variations among different\nschemes in the experiments.

Pathological falls\nare usually a result of a compromised motor system, and/or cognition. Very\nlittle research has been conducted on predicting falls based on this premise.\n  Aims: To demonstrate that cognitive and motor tests can be used to create a\nrobust predictive tool for falls.\n  Methods: Three tests of attention and executive function (Stroop, Trail\nMaking, and Semantic Fluency), a measure of physical function (Walk-12), a\nseries of questions (concerning recent falls, surgery and physical function)\nand demographic information were collected from a cohort of 323 patients at a\ntertiary neurological center. The principal outcome was a fall during the\nin-patient stay (n = 54). Data-driven, predictive modelling was employed to\nidentify the statistical modelling strategies which are most accurate in\npredicting falls, and which yield the most parsimonious models of clinical\nrelevance.\n  Results: The Trail test was identified as the best predictor of falls.\nMoreover, addition of any others variables, to the results of the Trail test\ndid not improve the prediction (Wilcoxon signed-rank p < .001). The best\nstatistical strategy for predicting falls was the random forest (Wilcoxon\nsigned-rank p < .001), based solely on results of the Trail test.

Contemporary research accomplishments suggest\nsophisticated AI systems becoming widespread and responsible for managing many\naspects of the modern world, from preemptively planning users' travel schedules\nand logistics, to fully autonomous vehicles, to domestic robots assisting in\ndaily living. The extrapolation of these trends has been most forcefully\ndescribed in the context of a hypothetical \"intelligence explosion,\" in which\nthe capabilities of an intelligent software agent would rapidly increase due to\nthe presence of feedback loops unavailable to biological organisms. The\npossibility of superintelligent agents, or simply the widespread deployment of\nsophisticated, autonomous AI systems, highlights an important theoretical\nproblem: the need to separate the cognitive and rational capacities of an agent\nfrom the fundamental goal structure, or value system, which constrains and\nguides the agent's actions. The \"value alignment problem\" is to specify a goal\nstructure for autonomous agents compatible with human values.
