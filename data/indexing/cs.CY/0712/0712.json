Structured processes are used to\ndiscover errors in large financial spreadsheets underpinning major transactions\nof all types. Serious errors are routinely found and are fed back to model\ndevelopment teams generally under conditions of extreme time urgency. Corrected\nmodels form the essence of the completed transaction and firms undertaking\nmodel audit and review expose themselves to significant financial liability in\nthe event of any remaining significant error. It is noteworthy that in the\nUnited Kingdom, the management of spreadsheet error is almost unheard of\noutside of the City of London despite the commercial ubiquity of the\nspreadsheet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Dec 2007 20:40:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Croll", "Grenville J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3220", "submitter": "Viviana Sica", "authors": "Michael Gurstein", "title": "What is Community Informatics (and Why Does It Matter)?", "comments": "109 pages, ISBN 978-88-7699-097-7 (Printed edition), ISBN\n  978-88-7699-098-4 (Electronic edition), printed edition available at\n  http://www.amazon.com and on http://www.lulu.com", "journal-ref": "\"Publishing studies\" book series, edited by Giandomenico Sica,\n  ISSN 1973-6061 (Printed edition), ISSN 1973-6053 (Electronic edition)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": null, "abstract": "  Community Informatics (CI) is the application of information and\ncommunications technologies (ICTs) to enable community processes and the\nachievement of community objectives. CI goes beyond the \"Digital Divide\" to\nmaking ICT access usable and useful to excluded populations and communities for\nlocal economic development, social justice, and political empowerment. CI\napproaches ICTs from a \"community\" perspective and develops strategies and\ntechniques for managing their use by communities both virtual and physical\nincluding the variety of Community Networking applications. CI assumes that\nboth communities have characteristics, requirements, and opportunities that\nrequire different strategies for ICT intervention and development from\nindividual access and use. Also, CI addresses ICT use in Developing Countries\nas well as among the poor, the marginalized, the elderly, or those living in\nremote locations in Developed Countries. CI is of interest both to ICT\npractitioners and academic researchers and addresses the connections between\nthe policy and pragmatic issues arising from the tens of thousands of Community\nNetworks, Community Technology Centres, Telecentres, Community Communications\nCentres, and Telecottages globally along with the rapidly emerging field of\nelectronically based virtual \"communities\".\n  Michael Gurstein, Ph.D. is Executive Director of the Centre for Community\nInformatics Research, Development and Training (Vancouver BC), a Director of\nThe Information Society Institute, Cape Peninsula University of Technology,\nCape Town South Africa; and Research Professor in the School of Computer and\nInformation Systems at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2007 16:07:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gurstein", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3807", "submitter": "Jianguo Liu", "authors": "Jian-Guo Liu, Bing-Hong Wang, Qiang Guo", "title": "Improved Collaborative Filtering Algorithm via Information\n  Transformation", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Int.

By using the opinion spreading process, the similarity\nbetween any users can be obtained. The algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy\nthan the standard collaborative filtering (CF) using Pearson correlation.\nFurthermore, we introduce a free parameter $\\beta$ to regulate the\ncontributions of objects to user-user correlations. The numerical results\nindicate that decreasing the influence of popular objects can further improve\nthe algorithmic accuracy and personality. We argue that a better algorithm\nshould simultaneously require less computation and generate higher accuracy.\nAccordingly, we further propose an algorithm involving only the top-$N$ similar\nneighbors for each target user, which has both less computational complexity\nand higher algorithmic accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2007 14:25:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 16:31:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 15:30:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Jian-Guo", ""], ["Wang", "Bing-Hong", ""], ["Guo", "Qiang", ""]]}]
