At the same\ntime, the large size of datasets often makes the task of calculating all\nobserved trajectories very difficult and time-consuming. One solution could be\nto sample users. However, the fact of not having information about the mobile\nuser makes the sampling delicate. Some researchers select randomly a sample of\nusers from their dataset. Others try to optimize this method, for example,\ntaking into account only users with a certain number or frequency of locations\nrecorded. At the first glance, the second choice seems to be more efficient:\nhaving more individual traces makes the analysis more precise. However, the\nmost frequently used CDR data (Call Detail Records) have location generated\nonly at the moment of communication (call, SMS, data connection). Due to this\nfact, users mobility patterns cannot be precisely built upon their\ncommunication patterns. Hence, these data have evident short-comings both in\nterms of spatial and temporal scale.

Our study also found that people who score high on the openness\nfactor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less\nstrict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy\nattacks. In addition, our work detected no correlation between the participants\nestimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished,\nwhich suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of\nthe phishing risks and that realtime response to phishing is hard to predict in\nadvance by online users.\n  We believe that better understanding of the traits which contribute to online\nvulnerability can help develop methods for increasing users privacy and\nsecurity in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 15:23:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 04:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Halevi", "Tzipora", ""], ["Lewis", "Jim", ""], ["Memon", "Nasir", ""]]}]
