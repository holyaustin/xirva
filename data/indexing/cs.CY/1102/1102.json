Impact of this new technology is\ngetting clearer with time and results are tangible to the user community. In\nthis paper we have tried to focus some of its issues like paradigms,\ninfrastructure integration, and security, which is considered to be the most\nimportant issue in E-Commerce. At first we have elaborated the paradigms of\nE-Commerce (Business-to-Business and Business-to-Consumer). Then comes the\nnecessity of infrastructure integration with the legacy system. Security\nconcerns comes next.

From all the content that people create and share, only a few\ntopics manage to attract enough attention to rise to the top and become\ntemporal trends which are displayed to users. The question of what factors\ncause the formation and persistence of trends is an important one that has not\nbeen answered yet. In this paper, we conduct an intensive study of trending\ntopics on Twitter and provide a theoretical basis for the formation,\npersistence and decay of trends. We also demonstrate empirically how factors\nsuch as user activity and number of followers do not contribute strongly to\ntrend creation and its propagation. In fact, we find that the resonance of the\ncontent with the users of the social network plays a major role in causing\ntrends.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Feb 2011 20:02:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Asur", "Sitaram", ""], ["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""], ["Szabo", "Gabor", ""], ["Wang", "Chunyan", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2479", "submitter": "Andreas Baldi", "authors": "Rachit Mohan Garg, Yamini Sood, Balaji Kottana, Pallavi Totlani", "title": "A Framework Based Approach for the Development of Web Based Applications", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": "World of Computer Science and Information Technology Journal\n  (WCSIT),ISSN: 2221-0741,Vol. 1, No. 1, 1-4, Feb. 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The sole goal of E-Governance is to allow interaction of government with\ntheir citizens in a comfortable & transparent manner.
