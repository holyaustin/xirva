The architecture, representation and\nfunction of Knowware are discussed. The principles of knowware engineering and\nits three life cycle models: furnace model, crystallization model and spiral\nmodel are proposed and analyzed. Techniques of software/knowware co-engineering\nare introduced. A software component whose knowledge is replaced by knowware is\ncalled mixware. An object and component oriented development schema of mixware\nis introduced. In particular, the tower model and ladder model for mixware\ndevelopment are proposed and discussed. Finally, knowledge service and knowware\nbased Web service are introduced and compared with Web service. In summary,\nknowware, software and hardware should be considered as three equally important\nunderpinnings of IT industry.\n  Ruqian Lu is a professor of computer science of the Institute of Mathematics,\nAcademy of Mathematics and System Sciences.

HMRC encounters spreadsheets in tax-payers systems on a very\nregular basis as well as being a heavy user of spreadsheets internally. The\napproach to spreadsheet risk assessment and spreadsheet audit is by the use of\ntrained computer auditors and data handlers. This, by definition, limits the\nuse of our specialist spreadsheet audit tool to such trained staff. In order to\ntackle the growing use of spreadsheets, a new way of approaching the problem\nhas been piloted. The aim is to issue all staff who come across spreadsheets\nwith a simple to use analysis and risk assessment tool, based on the\ndepartmental software SpACE (Spreadsheet Audit & Compliance Examination).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 22:15:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Price", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4634", "submitter": "Grenville Croll", "authors": "Brandon Weber", "title": "Strategies for Addressing Spreadsheet Compliance Challenges", "comments": "16 pages including web links and references", "journal-ref": "Proc.
