Recent studies suggest that the\nanswer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike infectious\ndiseases (simple contagions), are affected by social reinforcement and\nhomophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered communities is enhanced,\nwhile diffusion across communities is hampered. A common hypothesis is that\nmemes and behaviors are complex contagions. We show that, while most memes\nindeed behave like complex contagions, a few viral memes spread across many\ncommunities, like diseases. We demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme\ncan be predicted by quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of\ncommunity concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral\nit is. We present a practical method to translate data about community\nstructure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread widely.\nThis connection may lead to significant advances in computational social\nscience, social media analytics, and marketing applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jun 2013 00:00:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 16:56:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Weng", "Lilian", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""], ["Ahn", "Yong-Yeol", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0195", "submitter": "Prateek Dewan", "authors": "Prateek Dewan, Niharika Sachdeva, Mayank Gupta, Ponnurangam Kumaraguru", "title": "ChaMAILeon: Exploring the Usability of a Privacy Preserving Email\n  Sharing System", "comments": "12 pages without references and appendices", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While passwords, by definition, are meant to be secret, recent trends have\nwitnessed an increasing number of people sharing their email passwords with\nfriends, colleagues, and significant others.

However, it causes different problems such as overuse of oil,\ntraffic jams causing earth pollution, health problems and an inefficient use of\npersonal time. One possible solution to these problems is carpooling, i.e.\nsharing a trip on a private car of a driver with one or more passengers.\nCarpooling would reduce the number of cars on streets hence providing worldwide\nenvironmental, economical and social benefits. The matching of drivers and\npassengers can be facilitated by information and communication technologies.\nTypically, a driver inserts on a web-site the availability of empty seats on\nhis/her car for a planned trip and potential passengers can search for trips\nand contact the drivers. This process is slow and can be appropriate for long\ntrips planned days in advance. We call this static carpooling and we note it is\nnot used frequently by people even if there are already many web-sites offering\nthis service and in fact the only real open challenge is widespread adoption.\nDynamic carpooling, on the other hand, takes advantage of the recent and\nincreasing adoption of Internet-connected geo-aware mobile devices for enabling\nimpromptu trip opportunities. Passengers request trips directly on the street\nand can find a suitable ride in just few minutes. Currently there are no\ndynamic carpooling systems widely used. Every attempt to create and organize\nsuch systems failed. This paper reviews the state of the art of dynamic\ncarpooling. It identifies the most important issues against the adoption of\ndynamic carpooling systems and the proposed solutions for such issues. It\nproposes a first input on solving the problem of mass-adopting dynamic\ncarpooling systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2013 11:32:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Graziotin", "Daniel", "", "Free University of Bozen-Bolzano"]]}, {"id": "1306.0478", "submitter": "Ahmed Saeed", "authors": "Mohamed Ibrahim, Ahmed Saeed, Moustafa Youssef, Khaled A.
