Such prediction provides a foundation for\nidentifying the best workers to route work to in order to maximize accuracy on\nthe new task. Our key insight is to model similarity of past tasks to the\ntarget task such that past task accuracies can be optimally integrated to\npredict target task accuracy. We describe two matrix factorization (MF)\napproaches from collaborative filtering which not only exploit such task\nsimilarity, but are known to be robust to sparse data. Experiments on synthetic\nand real-world datasets provide feasibility assessment and comparative\nevaluation of MF approaches vs. two baseline methods. Across a range of data\nscales and task similarity conditions, we evaluate: 1) prediction error over\nall workers; and 2) how well each method predicts the best workers to use for\neach task. Results show the benefit of task routing over random assignment, the\nstrength of probabilistic MF over baseline methods, and the robustness of\nmethods under different conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2013 14:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jung", "Hyun Joon", ""], ["Lease", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.5439", "submitter": "Anuj Sharma Dr", "authors": "Monica Prajapati, Anuj Sharma", "title": "Role OF Web 2.0 IN E-Governance", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign\n  error in equation 1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This research paper conducts a survey of the various government organizations\nthat are using Web 2.0 to enhance their functionality, interact with potential\naudience and to reach out to a huge customer base.

Urban land use types\ncan be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as\nreflectivity and texture) or social functions.

Although\nsignificant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for\nurban land use classification, most techniques focus on physical\ncharacteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used.\nOwing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which\ncan be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to\nindicate the social function of land use.

To verify\nthe application of this new data source to urban land use classification, we\nfirst construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize\nland use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly\nrelative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means\nclustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is\nvalidated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is\ndetermined with a detection rate of 58.03%.

Along with\ntraditional metrics of research quality, such as citation counts, online images\nof researchers and institutions increasingly matter in evaluating academic\nimpact, decisions about grant allocation, and promotion. We examined 400\nbiographical Wikipedia articles on academics from four scientific fields to\ntest if being featured in the world's largest online encyclopedia is correlated\nwith higher academic notability (assessed through citation counts). We found no\nstatistically significant correlation between Wikipedia articles metrics\n(length, number of edits, number of incoming links from other articles, etc.)\nand academic notability of the mentioned researchers. We also did not find any\nevidence that the scientists with better WP representation are necessarily more\nprominent in their fields. In addition, we inspected the Wikipedia coverage of\nnotable scientists sampled from Thomson Reuters list of \"highly cited\nresearchers\". In each of the examined fields, Wikipedia failed in covering\nnotable scholars properly. Both findings imply that Wikipedia might be\nproducing an inaccurate image of academics on the front end of science. By\nshedding light on how public perception of academic progress is formed, this\nstudy alerts that a subjective element might have been introduced into the\nhitherto structured system of academic evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 14:07:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 15:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Samoilenko", "Anna", ""], ["Yasseri", "Taha", ""]]}]
