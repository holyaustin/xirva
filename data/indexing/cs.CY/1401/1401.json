Hence, these studies face difficulties characterizing\nthe influence of factors such as transportation mode on mobility patterns. This\npaper attempts to complement this research by looking at a category-rich\nmobility data set. In order to shed light on the impact of categories, as a\ncase study, we use conventionally collected German mobility data. In contrast\nto `check-in'-based data, our results are not biased by Euclidean distance\napproximations. In our analysis, we show that aggregation can hide crucial\ndifferences between trip length distributions, when subdivided by categories.\nFor example, we see that on an urban scale (0 to ~15 km), walking, versus\ndriving, exhibits a highly different scaling exponent, thus universality class.\nMoreover, mode share and trip length are responsive to day-of-week and\ntime-of-day. For example, in Germany, although driving is relatively less\nfrequent on Sundays than on Wednesdays, trips seem to be longer. In addition,\nour work may shed new light on the debate between distance-based and\nintervening-opportunity mechanisms affecting mobility patterns, since mode may\nbe chosen both according to trip length and urban form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 19:13:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jan 2014 10:02:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wilkerson", "Galen", ""], ["Khalili", "Ramin", ""], ["Schmid", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0366", "submitter": "Vaisagh Viswanathan", "authors": "Vaisagh Viswanathan and Chong Eu Lee and Michael Harold Lees and Siew\n  Ann Cheong and Peter M.

We simulated three models: (1) the lattice\ngas model, (2) the social force model, and (3) the RVO2 model, and obtained the\ndistributions of six observables: (1) evacuation time, (2) zoned evacuation\ntime, (3) passage density, (4) total distance traveled, (5) inconvenience, and\n(6) flow rate. We then used the DISTATIS procedure to compute the compromise\nmatrix of statistical distances between the three models.

Most importantly, we find\nthat the zoned evacuation times of the three models to be very different from\neach other. Thus we propose to use this variable, if it can be measured, as the\nkey test between different models, and also between models and the real world.\nFinally, we compared the model flow rates against the flow rate of an emergency\nevacuation during the May 2008 Sichuan earthquake, and found the social force\nmodel agrees best with this real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 04:44:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 06:02:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Viswanathan", "Vaisagh", ""], ["Lee", "Chong Eu", ""], ["Lees", "Michael Harold", ""], ["Cheong", "Siew Ann", ""], ["Sloot", "Peter M.

Often mixed up\nwith other system attributes; traditionally used with different meanings in as\nmany different disciplines; sought or applied through diverse approaches in\nvarious application domains, resilience in fact is a multi-attribute property\nthat implies a number of constitutive abilities. To further complicate the\nmatter, resilience is not an absolute property but rather it is the result of\nthe match between a system, its current condition, and the environment it is\nset to operate in. In this paper we discuss this problem and provide a\ndefinition of resilience as a property measurable as a system-environment fit.\nThis brings to the foreground the dynamic nature of resilience as well as its\nhard dependence on the context. A major problem becomes then that, being a\ndynamic figure, resilience cannot be assessed in absolute terms. As a way to\npartially overcome this obstacle, in this paper we provide a number of\nindicators of the quality of resilience. Our focus here is that of collective\nsystems, namely those systems resulting from the union of multiple individual\nparts, sub-systems, or organs. Through several examples of such systems we\nobserve how our indicators provide insight, at least in the cases at hand, on\ndesign flaws potentially affecting the efficiency of the resilience strategies.\nA number of conjectures are finally put forward to associate our indicators\nwith factors affecting the quality of resilience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 10:07:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["De Florio", "Vincenzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.5871", "submitter": "Pramod Verma", "authors": "Pramod Verma", "title": "Serefind: A Social Networking Website for Classifieds", "comments": "A prototype is available at http://www.serefind.com.

At the\nsame time, the ever-changing landscape of the conflict leads to difficulties in\napplying analytical approaches taken by other studies of online political\nactivism. Therefore, in this paper, we use an approach that does not require\nstrong prior assumptions or the proposal of an advance hypothesis to analyze\nTwitter and YouTube activity of a range of protagonists to the conflict, in an\nattempt to reveal additional insights into the relationships between them. By\nmeans of a network representation that combines multiple data views, we uncover\ncommunities of accounts falling into four categories that broadly reflect the\nsituation on the ground in Syria. A detailed analysis of selected communities\nwithin the anti-regime categories is provided, focusing on their central\nactors, preferred online platforms, and activity surrounding \"real world\"\nevents. Our findings indicate that social media activity in Syria is\nconsiderably more convoluted than reported in many other studies of online\npolitical activism, suggesting that alternative analytical approaches can play\nan important role in this type of scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 15:10:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Apr 2014 13:38:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["O'Callaghan", "Derek", ""], ["Prucha", "Nico", ""], ["Greene", "Derek", ""], ["Conway", "Maura", ""], ["Carthy", "Joe", ""], ["Cunningham", "P\u00e1draig", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8030", "submitter": "Asif Haque", "authors": "Asif Haque", "title": "Transit Fare Arbitrage: Case Study of San Francisco Bay Area Rapid\n  Transit (BART) System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transit fare arbitrage is the scenario when two or more commuters agree to\nswap tickets during travel in such a way that total cost is lower than\notherwise.

Activities are\nclassified using 4 different passive learning methods, i.e., quadratic\nclassifier, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, support vector machine, and\nartificial neural networks. Dimensionality reduction is performed through both\nfeature extraction and subset selection. Besides passive learning, we also\napply active learning algorithms to reduce data labeling expense. Experiment\nresults show that the classification rate of passive learning reaches 84.4% and\nit is robust to common positions and poses of cellphone. The results of active\nlearning on real data demonstrate a reduction of labeling labor to achieve\ncomparable performance with passive learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 17:28:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rasekh", "Amin", ""], ["Chen", "Chien-An", ""], ["Lu", "Yan", ""]]}]
