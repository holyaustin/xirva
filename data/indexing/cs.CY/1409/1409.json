This interesting phenomenon in fact provides a decent window to\ndisclose essential factors that drive the massive diffusion underlying trends\nin online social media. Specifically, the in-depth comparison between\ndiffusions represented by different peaks suggests that more attention from the\ncrowd at early stage of the propagation produces large-scale coverage, while\nthe dominant participation of opinion leaders at the early stage just leads to\npopularity of small scope.

Many previous\nstudies on this topic employed social networks to boost search performance by\nincorporating either local network features (e.g. the common connections\nbetween the querying user and candidates in social networks), or global network\nfeatures (e.g. the PageRank), or both. However, the available social network\ninformation can be restricted because of the privacy settings of involved\nusers, which in turn would affect the performance of people search. Therefore,\nin this paper, we focus on the privacy issues in people search. We propose\nsimulating different privacy settings with a public social network due to the\nunavailability of privacy-concerned networks. Our study examines the influences\nof privacy concerns on the local and global network features, and their impacts\non the performance of people search. Our results show that: 1) the privacy\nconcerns of different people in the networks have different influences. People\nwith higher association (i.e. higher degree in a network) have much greater\nimpacts on the performance of people search; 2) local network features are more\nsensitive to the privacy concerns, especially when such concerns come from high\nassociation peoples in the network who are also related to the querying user.\nAs the first study on this topic, we hope to generate further discussions on\nthese issues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 05:52:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Shuguang", ""], ["He", "Daqing", ""], ["Yue", "Zhen", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.5595", "submitter": "E Canessa", "authors": "M.

Without strong technical effort, an OSN may be able to\nexploit the assortativity of human private features, this way constructing\nshadow profiles with information that users chose not to share. Furthermore,\nbecause many users share their phone and email contact lists, this allows an\nOSN to create full shadow profiles for people who do not even have an account\nfor this OSN.\n  We empirically test the feasibility of constructing shadow profiles of sexual\norientation for users and non-users, using data from more than 3 Million\naccounts of a single OSN.

No work has looked at what\nhappens after exposure, particularly how individuals react to such exposure,\nthough. Users might well be exposed to diverse articles but share only the\npartisan ones. To test this, we study partisan sharing on Facebook: the\ntendency for users to predominantly share like-minded news articles and avoid\nconflicting ones. We verified four main hypotheses. That is, whether partisan\nsharing: 1) exists at all; 2) changes across individuals (e.g., depending on\ntheir interest in politics); 3) changes over time (e.g., around elections); and\n4) changes depending on perceived importance of topics.

To test whether it has any consequence in the\nreal world, we built a web application for BBC viewers of a popular political\nprogram, resulting in a controlled experiment involving more than 70\nindividuals. Based on what they share and on survey data, we find that partisan\nsharing has negative consequences: distorted perception of reality.

We find that in general, when it comes to controversial\nissues, the use of negative affect and biased language is prevalent, while the\nuse of strong emotion is tempered. We also observe many differences across news\nsources. Using these findings, we show that we can indicate to what extent an\nissue is controversial, by comparing it with other issues in terms of how they\nare portrayed across different media.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 15:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mejova", "Yelena", ""], ["Zhang", "Amy X.", ""], ["Diakopoulos", "Nicholas", ""], ["Castillo", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8171", "submitter": "Mark Scanlon", "authors": "Mark Scanlon and Huijie Shen", "title": "An Analysis of BitTorrent Cross-Swarm Peer Participation and\n  Geolocational Distribution", "comments": "The First International Workshop on Hot Topics in Big Data and\n  Networking (HotData I)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file-sharing is becoming increasingly popular in recent\nyears.
