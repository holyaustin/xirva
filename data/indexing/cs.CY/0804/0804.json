They are beginning to understand the\nspreadsheet error literature, including what it tells them about the need for\ncomprehensive spreadsheet testing. However, controlling for fraud will require\na completely new set of capabilities, and a great deal of new research will be\nneeded to develop fraud control capabilities. This paper discusses the\nriskiness of spreadsheets, which can now be quantified to a considerable\ndegree. It then discusses how to use control frameworks to reduce the dangers\ncreated by spreadsheets. It focuses especially on testing, which appears to be\nthe most crucial element in spreadsheet controls.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Apr 2008 23:42:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Panko", "Raymond R.", ""], ["Ordway", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1928", "submitter": "Pietro Michiardi Dr.", "authors": "Chi-Anh La, Pietro Michiardi", "title": "Characterizing User Mobility in Second Life", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "rr08212", "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we present a measurement study of user mobility in Second Life.\nWe first discuss different techniques to collect user traces and then focus on\nresults obtained using a crawler that we built.
