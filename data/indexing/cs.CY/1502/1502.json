One of the major problems is to complement volatile\nrenewable energy sources by operationally flexible capacity reserves. In this\npaper a proposal is given to determine prices on electricity markets taking\ninto account the operational flexibility of power plants, such that the costs\nof long-term capacity reserves can be paid by short-term electricity spot\nmarkets. For this purpose, a measure of operational flexibility is introduced\nenabling to compute an inflexibility fee charging each individual power plant\non a wholesale electricity spot market. The total sum of inflexibility fees\naccumulated on the spot markets then can be used to finance a capacity market\nkeeping the necessary reserves to warrant grid reliability. Here each reserve\npower plant then gets a reliability payment depending on its operational\nflexibility. The proposal is applied to a small exemplary grid, illustrating\nits main idea and also revealing the caveat that too high fees paradoxically\ncould create incentives to employ highly flexible power plants on the spot\nmarket rather than to run them as backup capacity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2015 15:10:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kiyak", "Cem", ""], ["de Vries", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00134", "submitter": "Charith Perera", "authors": "Charith Perera, Chi Harold Liu, Srimal Jayawardena", "title": "The Emerging Internet of Things Marketplace From an Industrial\n  Perspective: A Survey", "comments": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TETC.2015.2390034", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Internet of Things (IoT) is a dynamic global information network\nconsisting of internet-connected objects, such as Radio-frequency\nidentification (RFIDs), sensors, actuators, as well as other instruments and\nsmart appliances that are becoming an integral component of the future\ninternet.

Due to this nature, crowdsourcers (or\ntask requesters) often face uncertainty about the workers' capabilities which,\nin turn, affects the quality and timeliness of the results obtained. Trust is a\nmechanism used by people to facilitate interactions in human societies where\nrisk and uncertain are common. The crucial challenge to building a robust\ncrowdsourcing system is how to make trust-aware task delegation decisions to\nefficiently utilize the capacities of workers (or trustee agents) to achieve\nhigh social welfare?\n  This book presents the research addressing this challenge. It goes beyond the\nexisting trust management research framework by removing a widespread\nassumption implicitly adopted by existing research: that a trustee agent can\nprocess an unlimited number of interaction requests per discrete time unit\nwithout compromising its performance as perceived by the task requesters (or\ntruster agents). Decision support in crowdsourcing is re-formalized as a\nmulti-agent trust game based on the principles of the Congestion Game, which is\nsolved by two trust-aware interaction decision-making approaches: 1) the Social\nWelfare Optimizing approach for Reputation-aware Decision-making (SWORD)\napproach, and 2) the Distributed Request Acceptance approach for Fair\nutilization of Trustee agents (DRAFT). SWORD is designed for centralized\nsystems, while DRAFT is designed for fully distributed systems. Theoretical\nanalyses have shown that the social welfare produced by these two approaches\ncan be made closer to optimal by adjusting only one key parameter. With these\ntwo approaches, the framework of research for crowdsourcing systems can be\nenriched to handle more realistic scenarios where workers have varied and\nlimited capabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 07:23:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 02:28:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Han", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02215", "submitter": "Jobin Wilson", "authors": "Jobin Wilson, Chitharanj Kachappilly, Rakesh Mohan, Prateek Kapadia,\n  Arun Soman, Santanu Chaudhury", "title": "Real World Applications of Machine Learning Techniques over Large Mobile\n  Subscriber Datasets", "comments": "SE4ML: Software Engineering for Machine Learning (NIPS 2014 Workshop)\n  https://sites.google.com/site/software4ml/accepted-papers", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CY cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Communication Service Providers (CSPs) are in a unique position to utilize\ntheir vast transactional data assets generated from interactions of subscribers\nwith network elements as well as with other subscribers.

Soon after its\nemergence, research of TA becomes an active field, as it can solve the over\nscaffolded problem in traditional pedagogical systems, and encourage students\nto take the responsibility of learning. Apart from the benefits, existing TA\ndesign also has limitations. One is the lack of enough proactive interactions\nwith students during the learning process, and the other is the lack of\nbelievability to arouse students empathy so as to offer students an immersive\nlearning experience. To solve these two problems, we propose a new type of TA,\nAffective Teachable Agent, and use a goal oriented approach to design and\nimplement the agent system allowing agents to proactively interact with\nstudents with affective expressions. The ATA model begins with the analysis of\npedagogical requirements and teaching goals, using Learning by Teaching theory\nto design interventions which can authentically promote the learning behaviors\nof students. Two crucial capabilities of ATA are highlighted Teachability, to\nlearn new knowledge and apply the knowledge to certain tasks, and\nAffectivability, to establish good relationship with students and encourage\nthem to teach well. Through executing a hierarchy of goals, the proposed TA can\ninteract with students by pursuing its own agenda. When a student teaches the\nagent, the agent is performed as a naive learning companion, and when an\neducator teaches the agent during the design and maintenance time, the agent\ncan perform as an authoring tool. To facilitate the involvement of educators\ninto the game design, we develop an authoring tool for proposed ATA system,\nwhich can encapsulate the technical details and provide educational experts a\nnatural way to convey domain knowledge to agent knowledge base.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 05:38:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Borjigin", "Ailiya", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02493", "submitter": "Jose M.

Contextual\nintegrity is a privacy theory that conceptualises the appropriateness of\ninformation sharing based on the contexts in which this information is to be\nshared. Computational models of Contextual Integrity assume the existence of\nwell-defined contexts, in which individuals enact pre-defined roles and\ninformation sharing is governed by an explicit set of norms. However, contexts\nin Online Social Networks are known to be implicit, unknown a priori and ever\nchanging; users relationships are constantly evolving; and the information\nsharing norms are implicit. This makes current Contextual Integrity models not\nsuitable for Online Social Networks.\n  In this paper, we propose the first computational model of Implicit\nContextual Integrity, presenting an information model and an Information\nAssistant Agent that uses the information model to learn implicit contexts,\nrelationships and the information sharing norms to help users avoid\ninappropriate information exchanges and undesired information disseminations.\nThrough an experimental evaluation, we validate the properties of Information\nAssistant Agents, which are shown to: infer the information sharing norms even\nif a small proportion of the users follow the norms and in presence of\nmalicious users; help reduce the exchange of inappropriate information and the\ndissemination of sensitive information with only a partial view of the system\nand the information received and sent by their users; and minimise the burden\nto the users in terms of raising unnecessary alerts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 14:25:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 09:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Criado", "Natalia", ""], ["Such", "Jose M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02796", "submitter": "Rajib Rana", "authors": "Rajib Rana, Margee Hume, John Reilly, Raja Jurdak, Jeffrey Soar", "title": "Opportunistic and Context-aware Affect Sensing on Smartphones: The\n  Concept, Challenges and Opportunities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Opportunistic affect sensing offers unprecedented potential for capturing\nspontaneous affect ubiquitously, obviating biases inherent in the laboratory\nsetting.

It is arguable that such\nsystems can be developed using non-customized hardware and open-source software\nthat can be obtained and run anywhere in the world. This project is one such\nargument. This proof of concept is sufficient to show that solar remote\nmonitoring is neither expensive nor particularly cumbersome to implement and\nthus warrants further investigation and development by the open source\ncommunity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 19:26:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wolfe", "Nikolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04049", "submitter": "Preethi Raghavan", "authors": "Preethi Raghavan, James L.

The model is thus a\nuseful tool for further multiple applications on empirical historical\nsituations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 10:34:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitt", "Clara", "", "GC"], ["Rey-Coyrehourcq", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "GC"], ["Reuillon", "Romain", "", "GC, ISC-PIF"], ["Pumain", "Denise", "", "GC"]]}, {"id": "1502.06904", "submitter": "Dmitry Namiot", "authors": "Manfred Sneps-Sneppe, Dmitry Namiot", "title": "Smart Socket for Activity Monitoring", "comments": "submitted to FRUCT-17 conference (http://fruct.org)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short paper we consider the problem of monitoring physical activity\nin the smart house.

The\npoint is that individuals and companies are more and more kept out of the loop\nwhen it comes to control private data.

As wind and solar technologies gradually begin to\nsupplant the use of fossil fuels as preferred means of energy production, new\nchallenges are emerging which are unique to the experience of decentralized\npower generation. One such challenge is the development of effective monitoring\ntechnologies to relay diagnostic information from remote energy systems to data\nanalysis centers. The ability to easily obtain, synthesize, and evaluate data\npertaining to the behavior of a potentially vast number of individual power\nsources is of critical importance to the maintainability of the next generation\nof intelligent grid infrastructure. However, the application space of remote\nmonitoring extends well beyond this. This paper details the development and\nimplementation of an open-source monitoring framework for remote solar energy\nsystems. The necessity for such a framework to be open is much better\nunderstood when considered through the lens of the theoretical potential for\nremote monitoring technologies in developing countries. The United States and\nother industrialized nations in the so-called 'first world' are likely to be\nslow to seriously adopt renewable energy on account of the massive investment\nand infrastructural changes required for its integration into the existing\nelectrical grid. In countries where grid infrastructure is generally inadequate\nor nonexistent, this barrier is far less of a concern, and renewable energy\ntechnologies are viewed more as an enabling tool for progress than as a\ndisruptive and expensive technological tangent. In this context as well, remote\nmonitoring has a role to play.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 19:19:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wolfe", "Nikolas", ""]]}]
