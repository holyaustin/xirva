These theories were validated through numerous\nstudies, which examined how individuals leverage their social networks for\ncompetitive advantage, such as a new job or higher compensation. It is not\nclear how these theories generalize to online networks, which differ from\nreal-world social networks in important respects, including asymmetry of social\nlinks. We address this problem by analyzing how users of the social news\naggregator Digg adopt stories recommended by friends, i.e., users they follow.\nWe measure the impact different factors, such as network position and activity\nrate; have on access to novel information, which in Digg's case means set of\ndistinct news stories. We show that a user can improve his information access\nby linking to active users, though this becomes less effective as the number of\nfriends, or their activity, grows due to structural network constraints. These\nconstraints arise because users in structurally diverse position within the\nfollower graph have topically diverse interests from their friends. Moreover,\nthough in most cases user's friends are exposed to almost all the information\navailable in the network, after they make their recommendations, the user sees\nonly a small fraction of the available information.

Nonetheless, little research has, thus far,\nfocused on how to enhance privacy and trustworthiness. In this paper, we report\non a series of semi-structured interviews involving 20 participants, and show\nthat users are significantly concerned with the veracity of online dating\nprofiles. To address some of these concerns, we present the user-centered\ndesign of an interface, called Certifeye, which aims to bootstrap trust in\nonline dating profiles using existing social network data. Certifeye verifies\nthat the information users report on their online dating profile (e.g., age,\nrelationship status, and/or photos) matches that displayed on their own\nFacebook profile. Finally, we present the results of a 161-user Mechanical Turk\nstudy assessing whether our veracity-enhancing interface successfully reduced\nconcerns in online dating users and find a statistically significant trust\nincrease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 04:36:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 00:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Norcie", "Gregory", ""], ["De Cristofaro", "Emiliano", ""], ["Bellotti", "Victoria", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.4451", "submitter": "Kristina Lerman", "authors": "Kristina Lerman, Prachi Jain, Rumi Ghosh, Jeon-Hyung Kang, Ponnurangam\n  Kumaraguru", "title": "Limited Attention and Centrality in Social Networks", "comments": "in Proceedings of International Conference on Social Intelligence and\n  Technology (SOCIETY2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How does one find important or influential people in an online social\nnetwork?

Here, we investigate the accuracy of multiple statistical\nfeatures, based either purely on temporal interaction patterns or on the\ncooperative nature of the interactions, for automatically extracting latent\nsocial ties. Using self-reported friendship and non-friendship labels derived\nfrom an anonymous online survey, we learn highly accurate predictors for\nrecovering hidden friendships within a massive online data set encompassing 18\nbillion interactions among 17 million individuals of the popular online game\nHalo: Reach. We find that the accuracy of many features improves as more data\naccumulates, and cooperative features are generally reliable. However,\nperiodicities in interaction time series are sufficient to correctly classify\n95% of ties, even for casual users.
