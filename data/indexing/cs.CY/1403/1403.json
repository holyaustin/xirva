With the rapid growth of the\nmultimedia web, large numbers of education articles video resources are\nincreasingly being created by several different organizations. It is crucial to\nexplore, share, reuse, and link these educational resources for better\ne-learning experiences. Most of the video resources are currently annotated in\nan isolated way, which means that they lack semantic connections. Thus,\nproviding the facilities for annotating these video resources is highly\ndemanded. These facilities create the semantic connections among video\nresources and allow their metadata to be understood globally. Adopting Linked\nData technology, this paper introduces a video annotation and browser platform\nwith two online tools: Notitia and Sansu-Wolke. Notitia enables users to\nsemantically annotate video resources using vocabularies defined in the Linked\nData cloud. Sansu-Wolke allows users to browse semantically linked educational\nvideo resources with enhanced web information from different online resources.\nIn the prototype development, the platform uses existing video resources for\neducation articles. The result of the initial development demonstrates the\nbenefits of applying Linked Data technology in the aspects of reusability,\nscalability, and extensibility\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2014 09:26:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nithya", "C.", ""], ["Saravanan", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0530", "submitter": "Saida Elyengui", "authors": "Saida Elyengui, Riadh Bouhouchi, Tahar Ezzedine", "title": "The Enhancement of Communication Technologies and Networks for Smart\n  Grid Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The current electrical grid is perhaps the greatest engineering achievement\nof the 20th century.

The need for specific representations and metric to\nseparately assess products and technologies is discussed.

With examples from an\ninterconnected network of data centers managed using Dynamic Voltage and\nFrequency Scaling (DVFS) technology and smart cooling systems, it is shown that\nthe unadjusted assessments could be highly uncertain, and even inconsistent, in\ncalculating the management component's significance on the ICT impacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2014 03:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 20:23:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 03:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Moghaddam", "Reza Farrahi", ""], ["Moghaddam", "Fereydoun Farrahi", ""], ["Dandres", "Thomas", ""], ["Lemieux", "Yves", ""], ["Samson", "R\u00e9jean", ""], ["Cheriet", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.2808", "submitter": "Hafez Fouad Dr", "authors": "Hafez Fouad", "title": "Web-based Database Management to support Telemedicine System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The transfer of the medical care services to the patient, rather than the\ntransport of the patient to the medical services providers is aim of the\nproject.

Across the sciences, researchers conduct studies\ncollecting data with an unprecedented resolution and scale.

Therefore it is necessary\nto evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of e-government systems. Since the\ndevelopment of e-government is a continuous process of improvement, it requires\ncontinuous evaluation of the overall e-government system as well as evaluation\nof its various dimensions such as determinants, characteristics and results.\nE-government development is often complex with multiple stakeholders, large\nuser bases and complex goals.

Our personality theories and categories\nare induced by implicational invariants that are ground instances of\nintuitionistic implication, which we postulate as axioms. In our mindset, the\nessence of personality, and thus mental health and illness, is its invariance.\nThe truth of these axioms is algorithmically extracted from histories of\npartially-ordered, symbolic data of observed behaviour. The personality-test\ndata and the personality theories are related by a Galois-connection in our\nframework. As data format, we adopt the format of the symbolic values generated\nby the Szondi-test, a personality test based on L.~Szondi's unifying,\ndepth-psychological theory of fate analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 17:27:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kramer", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6199", "submitter": "Lilian Weng", "authors": "Lilian Weng and Filippo Menczer and Yong-Yeol Ahn", "title": "Predicting Successful Memes using Network and Community Structure", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables.

Some reported classes are highly independent\nfrom the available data as their predictability remains stable regardless of\nredaction of supporting and contradictory evidence.

In this paper we investigate what affects the level of participation\nof users in the political discussion. Specifically, are users more likely to be\nactive when they are surrounded by like-minded individuals, or, alternatively,\nwhen their environment is heterogeneous, and so their messages might be carried\nto people with differing views. To answer this question, we analyzed the\nactivity of about 200K Twitter users who expressed explicit support for one of\nthe candidates of the 2012 US presidential election. We quantified the level of\npolitical activity (PA) of users by the fraction of political tweets in their\nposts, and analyzed the relationship between PA and measures of the users'\npolitical environment. These measures were designed to assess the\nlikemindedness, e.g., the fraction of users with similar political views, of\ntheir virtual and geographic environments. Our results showed that high PA is\nusually obtained by users in politically balanced virtual environment. This is\nin line with the disagreement theory of political science that states that a\nuser's PA is invigorated by the disagreement with their peers. Our results also\nshow that users surrounded by politically like-minded virtual peers tend to\nhave low PA. This observation contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory\nthat states that a person tends to be more politically active when surrounded\nby like-minded people. Finally, we observe that the likemindedness of the\ngeographical environment does not affect PA. We thus conclude that PA of users\nis independent of the likemindedness of their geographical environment and is\ncorrelated with likemindedness of their virtual environment. The exact form of\ncorrelation manifests the phenomenon of disagreement and, in a majority of\nsettings, contradicts the echo chamber amplification theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2014 16:08:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 14:03:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Dyagilev", "Kirill", ""], ["Yom-Tov", "Elad", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7242", "submitter": "Farshad Kooti", "authors": "Farshad Kooti, Nathan O.

Next, we\nexplore the behavioral origins of the paradoxes by using the shuffle test to\nremove correlations between node degrees and attributes. We find that paradoxes\nfor the mean persist in the shuffled network, but not for the median. We\ndemonstrate that strong paradoxes arise due to the assortativity of user\nattributes, including degree, and correlation between degree and attribute.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Mar 2014 23:01:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kooti", "Farshad", ""], ["Hodas", "Nathan O.", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7335", "submitter": "Duyu Tang", "authors": "Duyu Tang, Bing Qin, Ting Liu, Qiuhui Shi", "title": "Emotion Analysis Platform on Chinese Microblog", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.IR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  Weibo, as the largest social media service in China, has billions of messages\ngenerated every day.
