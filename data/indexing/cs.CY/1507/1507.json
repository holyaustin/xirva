This is a skill that seems to\nrequire extensive practice to obtain, suggesting a teaching strategy that\ninvolves the assignment of numerous exercises involving the formulation of some\nbit of knowledge, communicated using a natural language such as English, as a\nsentence in some logic. The number of such exercises needed to master this\nskill is far too large to allow typical artificial intelligence course teaching\nteams to provide prompt feedback on student efforts. Thus, an automated\nassessment system for such exercises is needed to ensure that students receive\nan adequate amount of practice, with the rapid delivery of feedback allowing\nstudents to identify errors in their understanding and correct them. This paper\ndescribes an automated grading system for knowledge representation exercises\nusing first-order logic. A resolution theorem prover, \\textit{Prover9}, is used\nto check if a student-submitted formula is logically equivalent to a solution\nprovided by the instructor. This system has been used by students enrolled in\nundergraduate artificial intelligence classes for several years. Use of this\nteaching tool resulted in a statistically significant improvement on\nfirst-order logic knowledge representation questions appearing on the course\nfinal examination. This article explains how this system works, provides an\nanalysis of changes in student learning outcomes, and explores potential\nenhancements of this system, including the possibility of providing rich\nformative feedback by replacing the resolution theorem prover with a\ntableaux-based method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:51:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kyrilov", "Angelo", ""], ["Noelle", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.03671", "submitter": "Josje Lodder", "authors": "Josje Lodder, Bastiaan Heeren and Johan Jeuring", "title": "A pilot study of the use of LogEx, lessons learned", "comments": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Tools for\n  Teaching Logic (TTL2015), Rennes, France, June 9-12, 2015.

In this paper, we present the ARG\nsystem, a virtual tool developed to help the teaching/learning process in\nargumentation theory, especially in the field of Law. ARG was developed based\non Araucaria by Reed and Rowe, Room 5 by Ronald P. Loui, as well on systems\nsuch as Argue!-System and ArguMed by Bart Verheij. ARG is a platform for online\ncollaboration and applies the theory of Stephen Toulmin to produce arguments\nthat are more concise, precise, minimally structured and more resistant to\ncriticism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 00:52:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "Nailton", ""], ["Terrematte", "Patrick", ""], ["Moura", "Jos\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.03683", "submitter": "John Slaney", "authors": "John Slaney", "title": "Logic considered fun", "comments": "Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Tools for\n  Teaching Logic (TTL2015), Rennes, France, June 9-12, 2015.

The understanding and\nidentification of fraudulent activity (i.e., fake views) in video ads for\nadvertisers, is complicated as they rely exclusively on the detection\nmechanisms deployed by video hosting portals. In this context, the development\nof independent tools able to monitor and audit the fidelity of these systems\nare missing today and needed by both industry and regulators.\n  In this paper we present a first set of tools to serve this purpose. Using\nour tools, we evaluate the performance of the audit systems of five major\nonline video portals. Our results reveal that YouTube's detection system\nsignificantly outperforms all the others. Despite this, a systematic evaluation\nindicates that it may still be susceptible to simple attacks. Furthermore, we\nfind that YouTube penalizes its videos' public and monetized view counters\ndifferently, the former being more aggressive. This means that views identified\nas fake and discounted from the public view counter are still monetized. We\nspeculate that even though YouTube's policy puts in lots of effort to\ncompensate users after an attack is discovered, this practice places the burden\nof the risk on the advertisers, who pay to get their ads displayed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 13:24:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:10:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Marciel", "Miriam", ""], ["Cuevas", "Ruben", ""], ["Banchs", "Albert", ""], ["Gonzalez", "Roberto", ""], ["Traverso", "Stefano", ""], ["Ahmed", "Mohamed", ""], ["Azcorra", "Arturo", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08956", "submitter": "Heba Aly", "authors": "Heba Aly, Anas Basalamah, Moustafa Youssef", "title": "Map++: A Crowd-sensing System for Automatic Map Semantics Identification", "comments": "Published in the Eleventh Annual IEEE International Conference on\n  Sensing, Communication, and Networking (IEEE SECON 2014)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/SAHCN.2014.6990394", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Digital maps have become a part of our daily life with a number of commercial\nand free map services.
