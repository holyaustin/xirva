Poverty data, for\nexample, is typically scarce, sparse in coverage, and labor-intensive to\nobtain. Remote sensing data such as high-resolution satellite imagery, on the\nother hand, is becoming increasingly available and inexpensive. Unfortunately,\nsuch data is highly unstructured and currently no techniques exist to\nautomatically extract useful insights to inform policy decisions and help\ndirect humanitarian efforts. We propose a novel machine learning approach to\nextract large-scale socioeconomic indicators from high-resolution satellite\nimagery. The main challenge is that training data is very scarce, making it\ndifficult to apply modern techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNN). We therefore propose a transfer learning approach where nighttime light\nintensities are used as a data-rich proxy. We train a fully convolutional CNN\nmodel to predict nighttime lights from daytime imagery, simultaneously learning\nfeatures that are useful for poverty prediction. The model learns filters\nidentifying different terrains and man-made structures, including roads,\nbuildings, and farmlands, without any supervision beyond nighttime lights. We\ndemonstrate that these learned features are highly informative for poverty\nmapping, even approaching the predictive performance of survey data collected\nin the field.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 03:04:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Feb 2016 23:21:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Michael", ""], ["Jean", "Neal", ""], ["Burke", "Marshall", ""], ["Lobell", "David", ""], ["Ermon", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.00165", "submitter": "Miguel Angel Rodriguez Marquez", "authors": "Daniel Schweizer, Michael Zehnder, Holger Wache, Hans-Friedrich\n  Witschel, Danilo Zanatta, Miguel Rodriguez", "title": "Using consumer behavior data to reduce energy consumption in smart homes", "comments": "To be presented at IEEE International Conference of Machine Learning\n  and Applications (ICMLA, Dec. 2015). arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1509.05722", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses how usage patterns and preferences of inhabitants can be\nlearned efficiently to allow smart homes to autonomously achieve energy\nsavings.

To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first time that we detected and analyzed the ghost cities\nin China at such fine scale. To understand the human dynamic in ghost cities,\nwe select one city and one tourism sites as cases to analyze the features of\nhuman dynamics. This study illustrates the capability of big data in sensing\nour cities objectively and comprehensively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 21:51:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 03:23:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chi", "Guanghua", ""], ["Liu", "Yu", ""], ["Wu", "Zhengwei", ""], ["Wu", "Haishan", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08583", "submitter": "Ashwini Tonge", "authors": "Ashwini Tonge and Cornelia Caragea", "title": "Privacy Prediction of Images Shared on Social Media Sites Using Deep\n  Features", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online image sharing in social media sites such as Facebook, Flickr, and\nInstagram can lead to unwanted disclosure and privacy violations, when privacy\nsettings are used inappropriately. With the exponential increase in the number\nof images that are shared online every day, the development of effective and\nefficient prediction methods for image privacy settings are highly needed. The\nperformance of models critically depends on the choice of the feature\nrepresentation. In this paper, we present an approach to image privacy\nprediction that uses deep features and deep image tags as feature\nrepresentations. Specifically, we explore deep features at various neural\nnetwork layers and use the top layer (probability) as an auto-annotation\nmechanism. The results of our experiments show that models trained on the\nproposed deep features and deep image tags substantially outperform baselines\nsuch as those based on SIFT and GIST as well as those that use \"bag of tags\" as\nfeatures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 07:23:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 01:05:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 19:27:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tonge", "Ashwini", ""], ["Caragea", "Cornelia", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09025", "submitter": "L.

Agents are\nnodes, connecting to another agent by building a directed edge (or accepting a\nconnection from another agent) has a cost, and reaching (or being reached by)\nother agents via short directed paths has a benefit; in effect, an agent wants\nto reach others quickly, but without the cost of directly connecting each and\nevery one. We prove that asynchronous edge dynamics always converge to a stable\nnetwork; in fact, for nontrivial ranges of parameters this convergence is fast.\nMoreover, the set of fixed points of the dynamics form a nontrivial class of\nnetworks. For the static game, we give classes of efficient networks for\nnontrivial parameter ranges and further study their stability.
