Besides the raw yearly deaths count that is worrisome per se, an alarming\npicture comes from the steep acceleration of such rate that increased by 21%\nfrom 2015 to 2016. While traditional public health surveillance suffers from\nits own biases and limitations, digital epidemiology offers a new lens to\nextract signals from Web and Social Media that might be complementary to\nofficial statistics. In this paper we present a computational approach to\nidentify a digital cohort that might provide an updated and complementary view\non the opioid crisis. We introduce an information retrieval algorithm suitable\nto identify relevant subspaces of discussion on social media, for mining data\nfrom users showing explicit interest in discussions about opioid consumption in\nReddit. Moreover, despite the pseudonymous nature of the user base, almost 1.5\nmillion users were geolocated at the US state level, resembling the census\npopulation distribution with a good agreement. A measure of prevalence of\ninterest in opiate consumption has been estimated at the state level, producing\na novel indicator with information that is not entirely encoded in the standard\nsurveillance. Finally, we further provide a domain specific vocabulary\ncontaining informal lexicon and street nomenclature extracted by user-generated\ncontent that can be used by researchers and practitioners to implement novel\ndigital public health surveillance methodologies for supporting policy makers\nin fighting the opioid epidemic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 15:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Balsamo", "Duilio", ""], ["Bajardi", "Paolo", ""], ["Panisson", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.00112", "submitter": "Irawan Nurhas", "authors": "Matthias Joiko, Florian Kohnen, Kevin Lapinski, Houda Moudrik, Irawan\n  Nurhas, Florian Paproth and Jan M.

The performance of most VANET\napplications relies on the availability of accurate and recent\nmobility-information, shared by neighboring vehicles. However, sharing false\nmobility information can disrupt any potential VANET application. Misbehavior\ndetection is an important security component. However, existing misbehavior\ndetection solutions lack considering the high dynamicity of vehicular context\nwhich leads to low detection accuracy and high false alarms. The use of\npredefined and static security thresholds are the main drawbacks of the\nexisting solutions. In this paper, a context-aware misbehavior detection scheme\n(CAMDS) is proposed using sequential analysis of temporal and spatial\nproperties of mobility information. A dynamic context reference is constructed\nonline and timely updated using statistical techniques. Firstly, the Kalman\nfilter algorithm is used to track the mobility information received from\nneighboring vehicles. Then, the innovation errors of the Kalman filter are\nutilized to construct a temporal consistency assessment model for each vehicle\nusing Box-plot. Then, the Hampel filter is used to construct a spatial\nconsistency assessment model that represents the context reference model.\nSimilarly, plausibility assessment reference models are built online and timely\nupdated using the Hampel filter and by utilizing the consistency assessment\nreference model of neighboring information. Finally, a message is classified as\nsuspicious if its consistency and plausibility scores deviate much from the\ncontext reference model. The proposed context-aware scheme achieved a 73%\nreduction in false Alarm rate while it achieves a 37% improvement in the\ndetection rate.

Our starting\npoint is the seminal work of Dwork et al. which introduced a notion of\nindividual fairness (IF): given a task-specific similarity metric, every pair\nof individuals who are similarly qualified according to the metric should\nreceive similar outcomes. We show that when individuals have diverse\npreferences over outcomes, requiring IF may unintentionally lead to\nless-preferred outcomes for the very individuals that IF aims to protect. A\nnatural alternative to IF is the classic notion of fair division, envy-freeness\n(EF): no individual should prefer another individual's outcome over their own.\nAlthough EF allows for solutions where all individuals receive a\nhighly-preferred outcome, EF may also be overly-restrictive. For instance, if\nmany individuals agree on the best outcome, then if any individual receives\nthis outcome, they all must receive it, regardless of each individual's\nunderlying qualifications for the outcome.\n  We introduce and study a new notion of preference-informed individual\nfairness (PIIF) that is a relaxation of both individual fairness and\nenvy-freeness. At a high-level, PIIF requires that outcomes satisfy IF-style\nconstraints, but allows for deviations provided they are in line with\nindividuals' preferences. We show that PIIF can permit outcomes that are more\nfavorable to individuals than any IF solution, while providing considerably\nmore flexibility to the decision-maker than EF. In addition, we show how to\nefficiently optimize any convex objective over the outcomes subject to PIIF for\na rich class of individual preferences. Finally, we demonstrate the broad\napplicability of the PIIF framework by extending our definitions and algorithms\nto the multiple-task targeted advertising setting introduced by Dwork and\nIlvento.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 06:29:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Sep 2019 18:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Michael P.", ""], ["Korolova", "Aleksandra", ""], ["Rothblum", "Guy N.", ""], ["Yona", "Gal", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.01994", "submitter": "Nabeel Abdur Rehman", "authors": "Nabeel Abdur Rehman, Umar Saif, Rumi Chunara", "title": "Deep Landscape Features for Improving Vector-borne Disease Prediction", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The global population at risk of mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue,\nyellow fever, chikungunya and Zika is expanding.

Traditional interviews or\nsurvey-based studies have been limited in that they had small sample sizes or\nlacked detailed descriptions of personal experiences. Yet many people are now\nsharing their DTC genetic testing experiences via online social media\nplatforms. In this paper, we focused on one particularly lively online\ndiscussion forum, \\textit{r/23andme} subreddit, where, as of before March 2018,\n5,857 users published 37,183 posts. We applied topic modeling to the posts and\nexamined the identified topics and temporal posting trends. We further applied\nregression analysis to learn the association between the attention that a\nsubmission received, in terms of votes and comments, and the posting content.\nOur findings indicate that bursts of the increase of such online discussion in\n2017 may correlate with the Food and Drug Administration's authorization for\nmarketing of 23andMe genetic test on health risks, as well as the hot sale of\n23andMe's products on Black Friday.

The effect is uncertainty as to which technical offerings\nadequately match expectations expressed in legal standards. The uncertainty is\nexacerbated by a litany of successful privacy attacks, demonstrating that\ntraditional statistical disclosure limitation techniques often fall short of\nthe sort of privacy envisioned by legal standards.\n  We define predicate singling out, a new type of privacy attack intended to\ncapture the concept of singling out appearing in the General Data Protection\nRegulation (GDPR).

A data release mechanism that precludes such\nattacks is secure against predicate singling out (PSO secure).\n  We argue that PSO security is a mathematical concept with legal consequences.\nAny data release mechanism that purports to \"render anonymous\" personal data\nunder the GDPR must be secure against singling out, and hence must be PSO\nsecure. We then analyze PSO security, showing that it fails to self-compose.\nNamely, a combination of $\\omega(\\log n)$ exact counts, each individually PSO\nsecure, enables an attacker to predicate single out. In fact, the composition\nof just two PSO-secure mechanisms can fail to provide PSO security.\n  Finally, we ask whether differential privacy and $k$-anonymity are PSO\nsecure.

Many have\nattributed the mere exposure effect as the source of influence in purchase\nintention and purchase decision; however, most of the studies of television\nadvertisement effects are not only outdated, but their sample size is\nquestionable and their environments do not reflect reality. With the advent of\nthe internet, social media and new information technologies, many recent\nstudies focus on the effects of online advertisement, meanwhile, the investment\nin television advertisement still has not declined. In response to this, we\napplied machine learning algorithms SVM and XGBoost, as well as Logistic\nRegression, to construct a number of prediction models based on at-home\nadvertisement exposure time and demographic data, examining the predictability\nof Actual Purchase and Purchase Intention behaviors of 3000 customers across 36\ndifferent products during the span of 3 months. If models based on exposure\ntime had unreliable predictability in contrast to models based on demographic\ndata, doubts would surface about the effectiveness of the hard investment in\ntelevision advertising. Based on our results, we found that models based on\nadvert exposure time were consistently low in their predictability in\ncomparison with models based on demographic data only, and with models based on\nboth demographic data and exposure time data. We also found that there was not\na statistically significant difference between these last two kinds of models.\nThis suggests that advert exposure time has little to no effect in the\nshort-term in increasing positive actual purchase behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2019 05:50:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 07:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Carre\u00f3n", "Elisa Claire Alem\u00e1n", ""], ["Nonaka", "Hirofumi", ""], ["Hentona", "Asahi", ""], ["Yamashiro", "Hirochika", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06910", "submitter": "Olivier Bonaventure", "authors": "Olivier Bonaventure, Quentin De Coninck, Fabien Duchene, Mathieu\n  Jadin, Francois Michel, Maxime Piraux, Chantal Poncin, Olivier Tilmans", "title": "Scaling Networking Education with Open Educational Resources", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To reflect the key role played in our society by the network technologies,\nthe networking courses have moved to Bachelor degrees where they are taught to\nlarge classes.

Although some tools provided closer\nvalues, still their data were different and inconsistent. Moreover, some tools\nwere missing essential nutritional fact data, such as sugar and fiber. We\nadditionally compared a sample of food items common among all tools with the\nSwiss Food Composition Database and checked for their consistency with the same\nitems in the database. The evaluation of the applications showed a gap in the\ndata consistency among applications and the FCD, and questions how reliable\nthey are for food logging and diet tracking. This study contributes to current\nresearch in health and wellbeing and can be referenced by researchers to\nprovide deeper insights into the data consistency. Future work should examine\nways to provide precise output that is common among all applications, so to\nguarantee the effect on weight loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Apr 2019 17:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Fadhil", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.08525", "submitter": "David Pastor-Escuredo", "authors": "Pedro J.

We address this question through the analysis of pseudonymised mobility\nand mobile application (app) usage data of 400,000 individuals in a European\ncountry for six months. Despite the enormous heterogeneity of apps usage, we\nfind that individuals exhibit a conserved capacity that limits the number of\napplications they regularly use.

In this respect, we identify two profiles of\nindividuals: app keepers and explorers, which differ in their stable (keepers)\nvs exploratory (explorers) behaviour regarding their use of mobile\napplications. Finally, we show that the capacity of applications predicts\nmobility capacity and vice-versa. By contrast, the behaviour of keepers and\nexplorers may considerably vary across the two domains.

The advent of autonomous drones has\ninitiated serious challenges, including how to maintain their safe operation\nduring their missions. The safe operation of UAVs remains an open and sensitive\nissue since any unexpected behavior of the drone or any hazard would lead to\npotential risks that might be very severe. The motivation behind this work is\nto propose a methodology for the safety assurance of drones over the Internet\n{(Internet of drones (IoD))}. Two approaches will be used in performing the\nsafety analysis: (1) a qualitative safety analysis approach, and (2) a\nquantitative safety analysis approach. The first approach uses the\ninternational safety standards, namely ISO 12100 and ISO 13849 to assess the\nsafety of drone's missions by focusing on qualitative assessment techniques.\nThe methodology starts with hazard identification, risk assessment, risk\nmitigation, and finally, draws the safety recommendations associated with a\ndrone delivery use case. The second approach presents a method for the\nquantitative safety assessment using Bayesian Networks (BN) for probabilistic\nmodeling. BN utilizes the information provided by the first approach to model\nthe safety risks related to UAVs' flights. An illustrative UAV crash scenario\nis presented as a case study, followed by scenario analysis, to demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed approach.

They can help increase steps taken, enhance sleeping\npattern, improve healthy diet, and promote overall health. Despite the growth\nin the adoption of such technology, their reallife use is still questionable.\nWhile some users derive longterm value from their trackers, others face\nbarriers to integrate it into their daily routine. Studies have analysed\ntechnical aspects of these barriers. In this study, we analyse the behavioural\nfactors of discouragement and wearable abandonment strictly tied to user habits\nand living circumstances. A data analysis was conducted in two different\nstudies, one with users posts about wearable sales and the other one was a\nsurvey analysis. The two studies were used to analyse the stages of wearable\nadoption, use and abandonment. Therefore, we mainly focused on users motives to\nget a wearable tracker and to post it for sale. We extracted insights about\nuser motives, highlighted technology condition and limitations, and timeframe\nbefore abandonment. The findings revealed certain user behavioural pattern\nthroughout the wearable use and abandonment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2019 11:04:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fadhil", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.13302", "submitter": "Minjeong Kim", "authors": "Minjeong Kim, Yujin Kwon, and Yongdae Kim", "title": "Is Stellar As Secure As You Think?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Stellar is one of the top ten cryptocurrencies in terms of market\ncapitalization. It adopts a variant of Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT), named\nfederated Byzantine agreement (FBA), which generalizes the traditional BFT\nalgorithm to make it more suitable for open-membership blockchains. To this\nend, FBA introduces a quorum slice concept, which consists of a set of nodes.\nIn FBA, a node can complete one consensus round when it receives specific\nmessages from nodes in a quorum slice appointed by the node. In this study, we\nanalyze FBA, whose security is highly dependent on the structure of quorum\nslices, and demonstrate that it is not superior to the traditional BFT\nalgorithm in terms of safety and liveness. Then, to analyze the security of the\nStellar consensus protocol (SCP), which is a construction for FBA, we\ninvestigate the current quorum slices in Stellar. We analyze the structure of\nquorum slices and measure the influence of each node quantitatively using two\nmetrics, PageRank (PR) and the newly proposed NodeRank (NR). The results show\nthat the Stellar system is significantly centralized. Thereafter, to determine\nhow the centralized structure can have a negative impact on the Stellar system,\nwe study the cascading failure caused by deleting only a few nodes (i.e.,\nvalidators) in Stellar. We show that all of the nodes in Stellar cannot run SCP\nif only two nodes fail. To make matters worse, these two nodes are run and\ncontrolled by a single organization, the Stellar foundation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 06:29:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Minjeong", ""], ["Kwon", "Yujin", ""], ["Kim", "Yongdae", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.13316", "submitter": "Teresa Scantamburlo", "authors": "Nello Cristianini and Teresa Scantamburlo", "title": "On Social Machines for Algorithmic Regulation", "comments": "Preprint.
