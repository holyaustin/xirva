Since learning is often a social endeavor, social dynamics in\ncollaborative learning may inevitably influence curiosity. There is a scarcity\nof research, however, focusing on how curiosity can be evoked in group learning\ncontexts. Inspired by a recently proposed theoretical framework that\narticulates an integrated socio-cognitive infrastructure of curiosity, in this\nwork, we use data-driven approaches to identify fine-grained social scaffolding\nof curiosity in child-child interaction, and propose how they can be used to\nelicit and maintain curiosity in technology-enhanced learning environments. For\nexample, we discovered sequential patterns of multimodal behaviors across group\nmembers and we describe those that maximize an individual's utility, or\nlikelihood, of demonstrating curiosity during open-ended problem-solving in\ngroup work. We also discovered, and describe here, behaviors that directly or\nin a mediated manner cause curiosity related conversational behaviors in the\ninteraction, with twice as many interpersonal causal influences compared to\nintrapersonal ones. We explain how these findings form a solid foundation for\ndeveloping curiosity-increasing learning technologies or even assisting a human\ncoach to induce curiosity among learners.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 15:18:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 21:30:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Tanmay", ""], ["Bai", "Zhen", ""], ["Cassell", "Justine", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.00294", "submitter": "Jichang Zhao", "authors": "Zhenkun Zhou, Ke Xu and Jichang Zhao", "title": "Tales of Emotion and Stock in China: Volatility, Causality and\n  Prediction", "comments": "This an extended version our conference paper titled \"Can online\n  emotions predict the stock market in China?\" in WISE 2016 [arXiv:1604.07529]", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How the online social media, like Twitter or its variant Weibo, interacts\nwith the stock market and whether it can be a convincing proxy to predict the\nstock market have been debated for years, especially for China.

For the accurate detection of trafficking advertisements, we designed\nand trained a deep multimodal model called the Human Trafficking Deep Network\n(HTDN).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 May 2017 03:48:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Tong", "Edmund", ""], ["Zadeh", "Amir", ""], ["Jones", "Cara", ""], ["Morency", "Louis-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.02749", "submitter": "Neda Shabani", "authors": "Neda Shabani", "title": "A study of cyber security in hospitality industry- threats and\n  countermeasures: case study in Reno, Nevada", "comments": "47 page", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this study is to analyze cyber security and security practices\nof electronic information and network system, network threats, and techniques\nto prevent the cyber attacks in hotels.

Most importantly however, women and men position themselves differently\nin the Dribbble community. Our investigation of users' position in the social\nnetwork shows that women have more clustered and gender homophilous following\nrelations, which leads them to have smaller and more closely knit social\nnetworks.

This learning process appears in settings in which each\nindividual in a group is trying to decide over time, in a distributed manner,\nwhich option to select among a shared set of options. Specifically, we consider\na stochastic dynamics in a group in which every individual selects an option in\nthe following two-step process: (1) select a random individual and observe the\noption that individual chose in the previous time step, and (2) adopt that\noption if its stochastic quality was good at that time step. Various\ninstantiations of such distributed learning appear in nature, and have also\nbeen studied in the social science literature. From the perspective of an\nindividual, an attractive feature of this learning process is that it is a\nsimple heuristic that requires extremely limited computational capacities. But\nwhat does it mean for the group -- could such a simple, distributed and\nessentially memoryless process lead the group as a whole to perform optimally?\nWe show that the answer to this question is yes -- this distributed learning is\nhighly effective at identifying the best option and is close to optimal for the\ngroup overall. Our analysis also gives quantitative bounds that show fast\nconvergence of these stochastic dynamics. Prior to our work the only\ntheoretical work related to such learning dynamics has been either in\ndeterministic special cases or in the asymptotic setting. Finally, we observe\nthat our infinite population dynamics is a stochastic variant of the classic\nmultiplicative weights update (MWU) method. Consequently, we arrive at the\nfollowing interesting converse: the learning dynamics on a finite population\nconsidered here can be viewed as a novel distributed and low-memory\nimplementation of the classic MWU method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 May 2017 15:15:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Celis", "L.

Trait formation\nis intimately connected to cultural dynamics, which has been the focus of a\nvariety of quantitative models. Recently, some studies have emphasized the\nimportance of connecting those models to snapshots of cultural dynamics that\nare empirically accessible. By analyzing data obtained from different sources,\nit has been suggested that culture has properties that are universally present,\nand that empirical cultural states differ systematically from randomized\ncounterparts. Hence, a question about the mechanism responsible for the\nobserved patterns naturally arises. This study proposes a stochastic structural\nmodel for generating cultural states that retain those robust, empirical\nproperties. One ingredient of the model, already used in previous work, assumes\nthat every individual's set of traits is partly dictated by one of several,\nuniversal \"rationalities\", informally postulated by several social science\ntheories. The second, new ingredient taken from the same theories assumes that,\napart from a dominant rationality, each individual also has a certain exposure\nto the other rationalities. It is shown that both ingredients are required for\nreproducing the empirical regularities. This key result suggests that the\neffects of cultural dynamics in the real world can be described as an interplay\nof multiple, mixing rationalities, and thus provides indirect evidence for the\nclass of social science theories postulating such mixing. The model should be\nseen as a static, effective description of culture, while a dynamical, more\nfundamental description is left for future research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 09:33:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 10:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["B\u0103beanu", "Alexandru-Ionu\u0163", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.06946", "submitter": "Anamika Chhabra", "authors": "Anamika Chhabra and S.

Unlike other papers that use a\nsingle data source, this article examines three sources of data to reflect\ndifferent tourism activities in cities: Panoramio (sightseeing), Foursquare\n(consumption), and Twitter (being connected). Tourist density in the three data\nsources is compared via maps, correlation analysis (OLS) and spatial\nself-correlation analysis (Global Moran's I statistic and LISA). Finally the\ndata are integrated using cluster analysis and combining the spatial clusters\nidentified in the LISA analysis in the different data sources. The results show\nthat the data from the three activities are partly spatially redundant and\npartly complementary, and allow the characterisation of multifunction tourist\nspaces (with several activities) and spaces specialising in one or various\nactivities (for example, sightseeing and consumption). The case study analysed\n(Madrid) reveals a significant presence of tourists in the city centre, and\nincreasing specialisation from the centre outwards towards the periphery.

To this end we introduce a quantitative, language-based\ntypology reflecting two key aspects of a community's identity: how distinctive,\nand how temporally dynamic it is. By mapping almost 300 Reddit communities into\nthe landscape induced by this typology, we reveal regularities in how patterns\nof user engagement vary with the characteristics of a community.\n  Our results suggest that the way new and existing users engage with a\ncommunity depends strongly and systematically on the nature of the collective\nidentity it fosters, in ways that are highly consequential to community\nmaintainers. For example, communities with distinctive and highly dynamic\nidentities are more likely to retain their users. However, such niche\ncommunities also exhibit much larger acculturation gaps between existing users\nand newcomers, which potentially hinder the integration of the latter.\n  More generally, our methodology reveals differences in how various social\nphenomena manifest across communities, and shows that structuring the\nmulti-community landscape can lead to a better understanding of the systematic\nnature of this diversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 May 2017 18:00:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Justine", ""], ["Hamilton", "William L.", ""], ["Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil", "Cristian", ""], ["Jurafsky", "Dan", ""], ["Leskovec", "Jure", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09713", "submitter": "You Chen", "authors": "You Chen, Mayur B.

DESIGN We applied a spectral co-clustering methodology to\nsimultaneously infer groups of patients and care coordination patterns, in the\nform of interaction networks of health care professionals, from electronic\nmedical record (EMR) utilization data. The care coordination pattern for each\npatient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and\nits relationship with hospital LOS was assessed via a negative binomial\nregression with a 95% confidence interval. SETTING AND PATIENTS This study\nfocuses on 5,588 adult patients hospitalized for trauma at the Vanderbilt\nUniversity Medical Center. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals\nfrom 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. MAIN OUTCOME\nMEASURES: Hospital LOS for trauma inpatients, as an indicator of care\ncoordination efficiency. RESULTS: Three general types of care coordination\npatterns were discovered, each of which was affiliated with a specific patient\ngroup. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS and was\nmanaged by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of\noperational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient\ngroups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operational\nareas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to\n22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the second and\nthird patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer\nthan the first patient group, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 May 2017 20:48:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "You", ""], ["Patel", "Mayur B.", ""], ["McNaughton", "Candace D.", ""], ["Malin", "Bradley A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.09855", "submitter": "Cristina Turcu", "authors": "Cristina Turcu.
