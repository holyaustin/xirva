However, only with the emergence of a digital era, it became\npossible to investigate this topic on a larger scale. Over time it became clear\nthat quality of life not only depends on one, but on three relatively different\nparameters: social, economic and well-being measures. In this study we focus\nonly on the first two, since the last one is often very subjective and\nconsequently hard to measure. Using a complete set of bank card transactions\nrecorded by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) during 2011 in Spain, we\nfirst create a feature space by defining various meaningful characteristics of\na particular area performance through activity of its businesses, residents and\nvisitors. We then evaluate those quantities by considering available official\nstatistics for Spanish provinces (e.g., housing prices, unemployment rate, life\nexpectancy) and investigate whether they can be predicted based on our feature\nspace. For the purpose of prediction, our study proposes a supervised machine\nlearning approach. Our finding is that there is a clear correlation between\nindividual spending behavior and official socioeconomic indexes denoting\nquality of life. Moreover, we believe that this modus operandi is useful to\nunderstand, predict and analyze the impact of human activity on the wellness of\nour society on scales for which there is no consistent official statistics\navailable (e.g., cities and towns, districts or smaller neighborhoods).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 21:38:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Jul 2015 21:32:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sobolevsky", "Stanislav", ""], ["Massaro", "Emanuele", ""], ["Bojic", "Iva", ""], ["Arias", "Juan Murillo", ""], ["Ratti", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.00128", "submitter": "Pedro Quaresma", "authors": "Pedro Quaresma and Vanda Santos and Milena Mari\\'c", "title": "A Web Environment for Geometry", "comments": "CICM 2015, Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics\n  (Work-in-Progress track), July 13-17, 2015, Washington DC, USA", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Web Geometry Laboratory, (WGL), is a blended-learning, collaborative and\nadaptive, Web environment for geometry.

It is clear that\nan important role in driving this dynamics is played by social influence, which\nis the essential ingredient of many quantitative models. Such models require\nthat all traits are fixed when specifying the \"initial cultural state\".\nTypically, this initial state is randomly generated, from a uniform\ndistribution over the set of possible combinations of traits. However, recent\nwork has shown that the outcome of social influence dynamics strongly depends\non the nature of the initial state. If the latter is sampled from empirical\ndata instead of being generated in a uniformly random way, a higher level of\ncultural diversity is found after long-term dynamics, for the same level of\npropensity towards collective behavior in the short-term. Moreover, if the\ninitial state is randomized by shuffling the empirical traits among people, the\nlevel of long-term cultural diversity is in-between those obtained for the\nempirical and uniformly random counterparts. The current study repeats the\nanalysis for multiple empirical data sets, showing that the results are\nremarkably similar, although the matrix of correlations between cultural\nvariables clearly differs across data sets. This points towards robust\nstructural properties inherent in empirical cultural states, possibly due to\nuniversal laws governing the dynamics of culture in the real world.

However, individuals often lack global\nknowledge of the behaviors of others and must estimate them from the\nobservations of their friends' behaviors. In some cases, the structure of the\nunderlying social network can dramatically skew an individual's local\nobservations, making a behavior appear far more common locally than it is\nglobally. We trace the origins of this phenomenon, which we call \"the majority\nillusion,\" to the friendship paradox in social networks. As a result of this\nparadox, a behavior that is globally rare may be systematically overrepresented\nin the local neighborhoods of many people, i.e., among their friends. Thus, the\n\"majority illusion\" may facilitate the spread of social contagions in networks\nand also explain why systematic biases in social perceptions, for example, of\nrisky behavior, arise.

Such maps are essential for understanding what characterizes\npoverty in a certain region, and how it differentiates from other regions, for\ntargeted responses for the demographic of the population that is most needy. An\ninteresting fact, that is empirically proved by our methodology, is that a\nlarge portion of all communication, and economic activity in Senegal is\nconcentrated in Dakar, leaving many other regions marginalized.\n  Second, we study how user behavioral statistics, gathered from\ncellular-communications, correlate with the poverty indicators.

Second, Oblivion\nprovides indexing systems with an automated and provable eligibility mechanism,\nasserting that the author of a request is indeed affected by an online\nresource. The automated ligibility proof ensures censorship-resistance so that\nonly legitimately affected individuals can request the removal of corresponding\nlinks from search results. We have conducted comprehensive evaluations, showing\nthat Oblivion is capable of handling 278 removal requests per second, and is\nhence suitable for large-scale deployment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:45:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Simeonovski", "Milivoj", ""], ["Bendun", "Fabian", ""], ["Asghar", "Muhammad Rizwan", ""], ["Backes", "Michael", ""], ["Marnau", "Ninja", ""], ["Druschel", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.06149", "submitter": "Jes\\'us Mu\\~noz Morcillo jmm", "authors": "Jes\\'us Mu\\~noz Morcillo, Klemens Czurda, and Caroline Y.\n  Robertson-von Trotha", "title": "Typologies of the Popular Science Web Video", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The creation of popular science web videos on the Internet has increased in\nrecent years. The diversity of formats, genres, and producers makes it\ndifficult to formulate a universal definition of science web videos since not\nevery producer considers him- or herself to be a science communicator in an\ninstitutional sense, and professionalism and success on video platforms no\nlonger depend exclusively on technical excellence or production costs.\nEntertainment, content quality, and authenticity have become the keys to\ncommunity building and success. The democratization of science video production\nallows a new variety of genres, styles, and forms. This article provides a\nfirst overview of the typologies and characteristics of popular science web\nvideos. To avoid a misleading identification of science web videos with\ninstitutionally produced videos, we steer clear of the term science\ncommunication video, since many of the actual producers are not even familiar\nwith the academic discussion on science communication, and since the subject\nmatter does not depend on political or educational strategies. A content\nanalysis of 200 videos from 100 online video channels was conducted. Several\nfactors such as narrative strategies, video editing techniques, and design\ntendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of\nmontage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to\nan increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of\ninstitutional or personal commitments: in general, it can be said that supposed\namateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. This\nstudy represents an important step in understanding the essence of current\npopular science web videos and provides an evidence-based definition as a\nhelpful cornerstone for further studies on science communication within this\nkind of new media.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 20:20:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Morcillo", "Jes\u00fas Mu\u00f1oz", ""], ["Czurda", "Klemens", ""], ["Trotha", "Caroline Y.

These factors impede the practices of not only\nprocessing data, but also analyzing and displaying it in an efficient manner to\nthe user. Many efforts have been completed in the data mining and visual\nanalytics community to create effective ways to further improve analysis and\nachieve the knowledge desired for better understanding.

After running proven analytics on the data, we intend to\nrepresent the information in a more realistic 3D setting, where analysts can\nachieve an enhanced situational awareness and rely on familiar perceptions to\ndraw in-depth conclusions on the dataset. In addition, developing a\nhuman-computer interface that responds to natural user actions and inputs\ncreates a more intuitive environment. Tasks can be performed to manipulate the\ndataset and allow users to dive deeper upon request, adhering to desired\ndemands and intentions. Due to the volume and popularity of social media, we\ndeveloped a 3D tool visualizing Twitter on MIT's campus for analysis.
