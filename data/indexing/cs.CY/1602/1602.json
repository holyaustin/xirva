HEALER's\nsequential plans (built using knowledge of social networks of homeless youth)\nchoose intervention participants strategically to maximize influence spread,\nwhile reasoning about uncertainties in the network. While previous work\npresents influence maximizing techniques to choose intervention participants,\nthey do not address three real-world issues: (i) they completely fail to scale\nup to real-world sizes; (ii) they do not handle deviations in execution of\nintervention plans; (iii) constructing real-world social networks is an\nexpensive process. HEALER handles these issues via four major contributions:\n(i) HEALER casts this influence maximization problem as a POMDP and solves it\nusing a novel planner which scales up to previously unsolvable real-world\nsizes; (ii) HEALER allows shelter officials to modify its recommendations, and\nupdates its future plans in a deviation-tolerant manner; (iii) HEALER\nconstructs social networks of homeless youth at low cost, using a Facebook\napplication. Finally, (iv) we show hardness results for the problem that HEALER\nsolves. HEALER will be deployed in the real world in early Spring 2016 and is\ncurrently undergoing testing at a homeless shelter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 21:59:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yadav", "Amulya", ""], ["Chan", "Hau", ""], ["Jiang", "Albert", ""], ["Xu", "Haifeng", ""], ["Rice", "Eric", ""], ["Tambe", "Milind", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.00193", "submitter": "Lin Chen", "authors": "Zhuqi Li, Lin Chen, Yichong Bai, Kaigui Bian, Pan Zhou", "title": "On Diffusion-restricted Social Network: A Measurement Study of WeChat\n  Moments", "comments": "Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Communications (IEEE ICC\n  2016)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICC.2016.7511394", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  WeChat is a mobile messaging application that has 549 million active users as\nof Q1 2015, and \"WeChat Moments\" (WM) serves its social-networking function\nthat allows users to post/share links of web pages.

A common way to balance this trade-off is spaced\nrepetition, which uses periodic review of content to improve long-term\nretention. Though spaced repetition is widely used in practice, e.g., in\nelectronic flashcard software, there is little formal understanding of the\ndesign of these systems. Our paper addresses this gap in three ways. First, we\nmine log data from spaced repetition software to establish the functional\ndependence of retention on reinforcement and delay. Second, we use this memory\nmodel to develop a stochastic model for spaced repetition systems. We propose a\nqueueing network model of the Leitner system for reviewing flashcards, along\nwith a heuristic approximation that admits a tractable optimization problem for\nreview scheduling.

At the same time, the security community lacks certain aviation domain\nknowledge, preventing aviation authorities from giving credence to their\nfindings.\n  In this paper, we aim to reconcile the view of the security community and the\nperspective of aviation professionals concerning the safety of air traffic\ncommunication technologies. To achieve this, we first provide a systematization\nof the applications of wireless technologies upon which civil aviation relies.\nBased on these applications, we comprehensively analyze vulnerabilities,\nattacks, and countermeasures. We categorize the existing research on\ncountermeasures into approaches that are applicable in the short term and\nresearch of secure new technologies deployable in the long term.\n  Since not all of the required aviation knowledge is codified in academic\npublications, we additionally examine existing aviation standards and survey\n242 international aviation experts. Besides their domain knowledge, we also\nanalyze the awareness of members of the aviation community concerning the\nsecurity of wireless systems and collect their expert opinions on the potential\nimpact of concrete attack scenarios using these technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2016 22:25:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 15:26:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 17:00:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Strohmeier", "Martin", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Matthias", ""], ["Pinheiro", "Rui", ""], ["Lenders", "Vincent", ""], ["Martinovic", "Ivan", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08979", "submitter": "R K Bisht", "authors": "Raj Kishor Bisht", "title": "A fuzzy based conceptual framework for career counselling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Advance Computational Intelligence: An international\n  Journal,(2015), Vol 2, No. 4, 27-35", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Career guidance for students, particularly in rural areas is a challenging\nissue in India. In the present era of digitalization, there is a need of an\nautomated system that can analyze a student for his/her capabilities, suggest a\ncareer and provide related information. Keeping in mind the requirement, the\npresent paper is an effort in this direction. In this paper, a fuzzy based\nconceptual framework has been suggested. It has two parts; in the first part a\nstudents will be analyzed for his/her capabilities and in the second part the\navailable courses, job aspects related to their capabilities will be suggested.\nTo analyze a student, marks in various subject in 10+2 standards and vocational\ninterest in different fields have been considered and fuzzy sets have been\nformed. On example basis, fuzzy inference rules have been framed for analyzing\nthe abilities in engineering, medical and hospitality fields only. In second\npart, concept of composition of relations has been used to suggest the related\ncourses and jobs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 09:14:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bisht", "Raj Kishor", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.09067", "submitter": "Michael Madaio", "authors": "Michael Madaio, Shang-Tse Chen, Oliver L.

However, AFRD's fire\ninspection practices relied on tradition and intuition, with no existing\ndata-driven process for prioritizing fire inspections or identifying new\nproperties requiring inspection. In collaboration with AFRD, we developed the\nFirebird framework to help municipal fire departments identify and prioritize\ncommercial property fire inspections, using machine learning, geocoding, and\ninformation visualization. Firebird computes fire risk scores for over 5,000\nbuildings in the city, with true positive rates of up to 71% in predicting\nfires. It has identified 6,096 new potential commercial properties to inspect,\nbased on AFRD's criteria for inspection. Furthermore, through an interactive\nmap, Firebird integrates and visualizes fire incidents, property information\nand risk scores to help AFRD make informed decisions about fire inspections.\nFirebird has already begun to make positive impact at both local and national\nlevels. It is improving AFRD's inspection processes and Atlanta residents'\nsafety, and was highlighted by National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) as a\nbest practice for using data to inform fire inspections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 17:48:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Madaio", "Michael", ""], ["Chen", "Shang-Tse", ""], ["Haimson", "Oliver L.", ""], ["Zhang", "Wenwen", ""], ["Cheng", "Xiang", ""], ["Hinds-Aldrich", "Matthew", ""], ["Chau", "Duen Horng", ""], ["Dilkina", "Bistra", ""]]}]
