Fairness is crucial in participatory decision\nmaking, since generating equitable outcomes is an important goal of these\nprocesses. We argue that the classic game theoretic notion of core captures\nfairness in the setting. To compute the core, we first develop a novel\ncharacterization of a public goods market equilibrium called the Lindahl\nequilibrium, which is always a core solution. We then provide the first (to our\nknowledge) polynomial time algorithm for computing such an equilibrium for a\nbroad set of utility functions; our algorithm also generalizes (in a\nnon-trivial way) the well-known concept of proportional fairness. We use our\ntheoretical insights to perform experiments on real participatory budgeting\nvoting data. We empirically show that the core can be efficiently computed for\nutility functions that naturally model our practical setting, and examine the\nrelation of the core with the familiar welfare objective.

General observation is that the motion artifacts\nchange the statistics of the acquired PPG signal. Consequently, estimation of\nHR from such a corrupted PPG signal is challenging. However, if an\naccelerometer is also used to acquire the acceleration signal simultaneously,\nit can provide helpful information that can be used to reduce the motion\nartifacts in the PPG signal. By dint of repetitive movements of the subjects\nhands while running, the accelerometer signal is found to be quasi-periodic.\nOver short-time intervals, it can be modeled by a finite harmonic sum (HSUM).\nUsing the harmonic sum (HSUM) model, we obtain an estimate of the instantaneous\nfundamental frequency of the accelerometer signal. Since the PPG signal is a\ncomposite of the heart rate information (that is also quasi-periodic) and the\nmotion artifact, we fit a joint harmonic sum (HSUM) model to the PPG signal.\nOne of the harmonic sums corresponds to the heart-beat component in PPG and the\nother models the motion artifact. However, the fundamental frequency of the\nmotion artifact has already been determined from the accelerometer signal.\nSubsequently, the HR is estimated from the joint HSUM model.

Famous cases of sensitive information leaks caused by\ninsiders, including the WikiLeaks release of diplomatic cables and the Edward\nSnowden incident, have greatly harmed the U.S. government's relationship with\nother governments and with its own citizens. Data Leak Prevention (DLP) is a\nsolution for detecting and preventing information leaks from within an\norganization's network. However, state-of-art DLP detection models are only\nable to detect very limited types of sensitive information, and research in the\nfield has been hindered due to the lack of available sensitive texts. Many\nresearchers have focused on document-based detection with artificially labeled\n\"confidential documents\" for which security labels are assigned to the entire\ndocument, when in reality only a portion of the document is sensitive. This\ntype of whole-document based security labeling increases the chances of\npreventing authorized users from accessing non-sensitive information within\nsensitive documents. In this paper, we introduce Automated Classification\nEnabled by Security Similarity (ACESS), a new and innovative detection model\nthat penetrates the complexity of big text security classification/detection.\nTo analyze the ACESS system, we constructed a novel dataset, containing\nformerly classified paragraphs from diplomatic cables made public by the\nWikiLeaks organization.

In\nthis paper, we propose a domain-specific model-driven design approach to\naddress these challenges for designing clinical guidance systems. Firstly, we\ntranslate the relevant medical knowledge described in generic literature and\ndifferent best practice guidelines into a set of executable and indirectly\nverifiable finite state machine models. We introduce an organ-centric paradigm\nto construct clinical models, and also develop a physician model to track\nphysician-system interactions and deviations. Secondly, for verification of the\ncompositional system model, we translate the model into timed automata, based\non which, we formalize a set of clinical and system safety requirements as\ncomputation tree logic(CTL) formulas and use the UPPAAL model checking tool to\nformally verify those requirements. In this way, the correctness of the model\ncan be mathematically proved. Finally, we can automatically generate the\nexecutable code from the verified model using the corresponding code generation\ntools for finite state machine.

This\npaper investigates the use of word embeddings to help identify gang members on\nTwitter. Building on our previous work, we generate word embeddings that\ntranslate what Twitter users post in their profile descriptions, tweets,\nprofile images, and linked YouTube content to a real vector format amenable for\nmachine learning classification. Our experimental results show that pre-trained\nword embeddings can boost the accuracy of supervised learning algorithms\ntrained over gang members social media posts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 03:21:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wijeratne", "Sanjaya", ""], ["Balasuriya", "Lakshika", ""], ["Doran", "Derek", ""], ["Sheth", "Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.08629", "submitter": "Karan Jani", "authors": "Karan Jani", "title": "The Promise and Prejudice of Big Data in Intelligence Community", "comments": "18 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Big data holds critical importance in the current generation of information\ntechnology, with applications ranging from financial, industrial, academic to\ndefense sectors.
