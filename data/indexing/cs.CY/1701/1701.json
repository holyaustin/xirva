Although location recommendation\nmethods have been studied and improved pervasively, the challenges w.r.t\nemploying various influences including temporal aspect still remain. Inspired\nby the fact that time includes numerous granular slots (e.g. minute, hour, day,\nweek and etc.), in this paper, we define a new problem to perform\nrecommendation through exploiting all diversified temporal factors. In\nparticular, we argue that most existing methods only focus on a limited number\nof time-related features and neglect others. Furthermore, considering a\nspecific granularity (e.g. time of a day) in recommendation cannot always apply\nto each user or each dataset. To address the challenges, we propose a\nprobabilistic generative model, named after Multi-aspect Time-related Influence\n(MATI) to promote POI recommendation. We also develop a novel optimization\nalgorithm based on Expectation Maximization (EM). Our MATI model firstly\ndetects a user's temporal multivariate orientation using her check-in log in\nLocation-based Social Networks(LBSNs). It then performs recommendation using\ntemporal correlations between the user and proposed locations.

We develop a statistical model that operationalizes a\nlarge body of work on sleep and performance and demonstrates that our estimates\nof circadian rhythms, homeostatic sleep drive, and sleep inertia align with\nexpectations from laboratory-based sleep studies.

Case studies that mine social data from\nusers of online services such as Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly\ncommon. This has led to calls for an open discussion into how researchers can\nbest use these vast resources to make innovative findings while still\nrespecting fundamental ethical principles. In this position paper we highlight\nsome key considerations for this topic and argue that the conditions of\ninformed consent are often not being met, and that using social media data that\nsome deem free to access and analyse may result in undesirable consequences,\nparticularly within the domain of health research and other sensitive topics.\nWe posit that successful exploitation of online personal data, particularly for\nhealth and other sensitive research, requires new and usable methods of\nobtaining consent from the user.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Norval", "Chris", ""], ["Henderson", "Tristan", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.07769", "submitter": "Nicholas Mattei", "authors": "Emanuelle Burton, Judy Goldsmith, Sven Koenig, Benjamin Kuipers,\n  Nicholas Mattei, and Toby Walsh", "title": "Ethical Considerations in Artificial Intelligence Courses", "comments": "29 pages including all case studies and links to video media on\n  YouTube", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The recent surge in interest in ethics in artificial intelligence may leave\nmany educators wondering how to address moral, ethical, and philosophical\nissues in their AI courses.

In some cases, black\ndefendants are substantially more likely than white defendants to be\nincorrectly classified as high risk. To mitigate such disparities, several\ntechniques recently have been proposed to achieve algorithmic fairness. Here we\nreformulate algorithmic fairness as constrained optimization: the objective is\nto maximize public safety while satisfying formal fairness constraints designed\nto reduce racial disparities. We show that for several past definitions of\nfairness, the optimal algorithms that result require detaining defendants above\nrace-specific risk thresholds. We further show that the optimal unconstrained\nalgorithm requires applying a single, uniform threshold to all defendants. The\nunconstrained algorithm thus maximizes public safety while also satisfying one\nimportant understanding of equality: that all individuals are held to the same\nstandard, irrespective of race. Because the optimal constrained and\nunconstrained algorithms generally differ, there is tension between improving\npublic safety and satisfying prevailing notions of algorithmic fairness. By\nexamining data from Broward County, Florida, we show that this trade-off can be\nlarge in practice.
