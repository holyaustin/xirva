Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro-blogging\ndata, revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when\nexpanding their social circles. While the network structure affects the spread\nof information among users, the network is in turn shaped by this communication\nactivity. This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely\nto follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie. We characterize users\nwith a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies,\nestimated by a Maximum-Likelihood approach. Triadic closure does have a strong\neffect on link formation, but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor\nin interpreting network evolution. However, individual strategies for following\nother users are highly heterogeneous. Link creation behaviors can be summarized\nby classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and\nbehavioral characteristics.

Relationship quality (RQ) is replacing service quality as a key\nsource of superior performance and competitive advantage. Accordingly, this\nstudy investigates the dimensions of relationship quality from e-Banking\nservices and explores the differences among customers of Jordanian and foreign\nbanks. Many of the foreign banks in Jordan are equipped with large financial\ncapital, having high banking and financial experiences and are offering many\nmodern hi-tech banking services. This situation makes Jordanian banks in front\nof unprecedented competition and so they have invested heavily to develop their\ne-banking services, in order to strengthening their relationships with existing\ncustomers, enhancing their trust, letting them satisfied, ensuring their\ncommitment and attracting of new ones. This paper aims to identify the key\ndimensions that shape the relationship quality among Jordanian and foreign\nbanks and their customers who are utilizing the e-Banking services. Based on an\nextensive review of relevant literature, we have formulated nine hypotheses and\nidentified three factors (satisfaction, trust, and commitment) that may affect\nthe competitiveness and success of Jordanian and foreign banks.
