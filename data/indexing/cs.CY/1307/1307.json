In land change science\n(LCS), local field-based observations are costly and time consuming, and\ngenerally obtained by researchers working at disparate local and regional\ncase-study sites chosen for different reasons. As a result, global synthesis\nefforts in LCS tend to be based on non-statistical inferences subject to\ngeographic biases stemming from data limitations and fragmentation. Thus, a\nfundamental challenge is the production of generalized knowledge that links\nevidence of the causes and consequences of local land change to global patterns\nand vice versa. The GLOBE system was designed to meet this challenge. GLOBE\naims to transform global change science by enabling new scientific workflows\nbased on statistically robust, globally relevant integration of local and\nregional observations using an online social-computational and geovisualization\nsystem. Consistent with the goals of Digital Earth, GLOBE has the capability to\nassess the global relevance of local case-study findings within the context of\nover 50 global biophysical, land-use, climate, and socio-economic datasets.

Mobile\nphones can also offer a communications channel for initiating and executing\non-line financial transactions. This channel may not only reduce the cost of\nfinancial transactions for provider and customer, but also allow new entrants\nto the financial sector, and new relationships to be formed for distributing\nservices. These changes hold the prospect of accelerating access to financial\nservices on the back of the mobile infrastructure. Mobile telephony offers\ntremendous promise to facilitate the flow of money among rural and poor\nfamilies at much lower transaction costs, bringing the bank to those currently\nunbanked. Realizing this promise will require close collaboration among all\nstakeholders. But most rural banks do not have mobile banking services for\ntheir customers. This made it difficult for the full potential and benefits of\nmobile money financial services to be realized. Most telecommunication service\nproviders run mobile money service solely for their subscribers without an\nintegrated approach of incorporating and integrating rural banking systems into\ntheir existing services this makes it difficult for a full fledge exploitation\nof the mobile financial market.

The flavor pairing hypothesis\nstates that culinary ingredients with common chemical flavor components combine\nwell to produce pleasant dishes. It has been recently shown that this design\nprinciple is a basis for modern Western cuisine and is reversed for Asian\ncuisine.\n  Such data-driven analysis compares the chemistry of ingredients to ingredient\nsets found in recipes. However, analytics-based generation of novel flavor\nprofiles can only be as good as the underlying chemical and recipe data.\nIncomplete, inaccurate, and irrelevant data may degrade flavor pairing\ninferences. Chemical data on flavor compounds is incomplete due to the nature\nof the experiments that must be conducted to obtain it. Recipe data may have\nissues due to text parsing errors, imprecision in textual descriptions of\ningredients, and the fact that the same ingredient may be known by different\nnames in different recipes. Moreover, the process of matching ingredients in\nchemical data and recipe data may be fraught with mistakes. Much of the\n`dirtiness' of the data cannot be cleansed even with manual curation.\n  In this work, we collect a new data set of recipes from Medieval Europe\nbefore the Columbian Exchange and investigate the flavor pairing hypothesis\nhistorically. To investigate the role of data incompleteness and error as part\nof this hypothesis testing, we use two separate chemical compound data sets\nwith different levels of cleanliness. Notably, the different data sets give\nconflicting conclusions about the flavor pairing hypothesis in Medieval Europe.\nAs a contribution towards social science, we obtain inferences about the\nevolution of culinary arts when many new ingredients are suddenly made\navailable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 13:59:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Varshney", "Kush R.", ""], ["Varshney", "Lav R.", ""], ["Wang", "Jun", ""], ["Myers", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.8043", "submitter": "Susmita Mandal", "authors": "Susmita Mandal", "title": "A Review on Secured Money Transaction with Fingerprint Technique in ATM\n  System", "comments": "04 pages, 04 figures, IJCSN Journal, Volume 2, Issue 4, August 2013", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Network , Volume 2,\n  Issue 4, August 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": "IJCSN-2013-2-4-05", "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the present day, the requirement of securing electronic cash flow system\nare increasing significantly.
