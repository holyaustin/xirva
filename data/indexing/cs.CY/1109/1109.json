With the digital era taking the\nspotlight, and the world rapidly reforming into a global village, it is now\nquintessential that a spirit of healthy competitiveness be inculcated in the\nbudding minds of this country. While trying to remodel and upgrade the\neducation system, a key issue is that of quality of education processes in the\ncountry. Needs and expectations of the society are changing very fast and the\nquality of higher education requires to be sustained at the desired level. The\nuse of internet for educational purposes has increased many folds among Indian\nyouths. Online video lectures and e-books are the emerging trends among\nlearners. The birth of high speed internet access and its availability on\nrecently evolved smart phones has opened several new avenues for learning. The\ngrowing popularity of these smart phones among the youth can potentially\nrevolutionize the way we learn. The introduction of 3G technology is already\nbeing pinned as the next big thing in the mobile internet revolution. This\npaper discusses the use of Smart Phones in Education Technology and its\napplication in Technical & Professional studies in India. We intend to put\nforward some challenges and advices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Sep 2011 15:33:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Manoj", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1488", "submitter": "Gerardo I\\~niguez Gonz\\'alez", "authors": "Gerardo I\\~niguez, Julia Tag\\\"ue\\~na-Mart\\'inez, Kimmo K.

This is not\nnecessarily the case, even though we are all (over-) exposed to information\nflow through various channels of media, i.e. newspapers, television, radio,\ninternet, and web. It is thought that this is mainly due to the conflicting\ninformation on the mass media and to the individual attitude (formed by\ncultural, educational and environmental factors), that is, one external factor\nand another personal factor. In this paper we will investigate the dynamical\ndevelopment of opinion in a small population of agents by means of a\ncomputational model of opinion formation in a co-evolving network of socially\nlinked agents. The personal and external factors are taken into account by\nassigning an individual attitude parameter to each agent, and by subjecting all\nto an external but homogeneous field to simulate the effect of the media. We\nthen adjust the field strength in the model by using actual data on scientific\nperception surveys carried out in two different populations, which allow us to\ncompare two different societies. We interpret the model findings with the aid\nof simple mean field calculations. Our results suggest that scientifically\nsound concepts are more difficult to acquire than concepts not validated by\nscience, since opposing individuals organize themselves in close communities\nthat prevent opinion consensus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 15:29:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 08:35:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["I\u00f1iguez", "Gerardo", ""], ["Tag\u00fce\u00f1a-Mart\u00ednez", "Julia", ""], ["Kaski", "Kimmo K.", ""], ["Barrio", "R.
