Users of these applications organize resources (Web pages, digital\nphotographs, academic papers) by associating with them freely chosen text\nlabels, or tags. Here we leverage the social aspects of collaborative tagging\nand introduce a notion of resource distance based on the collective tagging\nactivity of users. We collect data from a popular system and perform\nexperiments showing that our definition of distance can be used to build a\nweighted network of resources with a detectable community structure. We show\nthat this community structure clearly exposes the semantic relations among\nresources. The communities of resources that we observe are a genuinely\nemergent feature, resulting from the uncoordinated activity of a large number\nof users, and their detection paves the way for mapping emergent semantics in\nsocial tagging systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 11:40:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Baldassarri", "Andrea", ""], ["Servedio", "Vito D.

Scarcity of attention and the daily rythms of life\nand work makes people default to interacting with those few that matter and\nthat reciprocate their attention. A study of social interactions within Twitter\nreveals that the driver of usage is a sparse and hidden network of connections\nunderlying the declared set of friends and followers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2008 22:52:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Huberman", "Bernardo A.", ""], ["Romero", "Daniel M.", ""], ["Wu", "Fang", ""]]}]
