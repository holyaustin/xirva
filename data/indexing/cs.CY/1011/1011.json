These defacto identity authorities wield significant power\nover users, compelling them to comply with non-negotiable terms, before access\nto services is granted. In doing so, users expose themselves to privacy risks,\nmanipulation and exploitation via direct marketing. Against this backdrop, the\nemerging areas of Digital Ecosystems and user-centric identity emphasise\ndecentralised environments with independent self-determining entities that\ncontrol their own data and identity. We show that recent advances in\nuser-centric identity, federated identity and trust have prepared the ground\nfor decentralised identity provisioning. We show how social trust, rather than\nblind deference to authorities, can provide a basis for identity, where risks\ncan be weighed and compared rather than merely accepted. Fundamentally, we are\nconsidering the move from authority-centric centralised identity provisioning\nto user-centric distributed identity provisioning. Finally, we highlight the\npotential impacts of distributed identity provisioning in the Information\nSociety and give a brief roadmap for its general implementation and adoption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Oct 2010 18:56:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["McLaughlin", "Mark", ""], ["Briscoe", "Gerard", ""], ["Malone", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1960", "submitter": "Jaydip Sen", "authors": "Jaydip Sen", "title": "Ubiquitous Computing: Potentials and Challenges", "comments": "The biometric authentication and user privacy related sections in the\n  paper are being augmented with some case studies and experimental results\n  which are to be incorporated in a new chapter written by me.

In this work, we present an\nunsupervised probabilistic approach that extends affinity propagation to\ncombine the small ontological fragments into a collection of integrated,\nconsistent, and larger folksonomies. This is a challenging task because the\nmethod must aggregate similar structures while avoiding structural\ninconsistencies and handling noise. We validate the approach on a real-world\nsocial media dataset, comprised of shallow personal hierarchies specified by\nmany individual users, collected from the photosharing website Flickr. Our\nempirical results show that our proposed approach is able to construct deeper\nand denser structures, compared to an approach using only the standard affinity\npropagation algorithm.

We define a cascade generating\nfunction that captures the details of the microscopic dynamics of the cascades.\nWe show that this function can also be used to compute the macroscopic\nproperties of cascades, such as their size, spread, diameter, number of paths,\nand average path length. We present an algorithm to efficiently compute cascade\ngenerating function and demonstrate that while significantly compressing\ninformation within a cascade, it nevertheless allows us to accurately\nreconstruct its structure. We use this framework to study information dynamics\non the social network of Digg. Digg allows users to post and vote on stories,\nand easily see the stories that friends have voted on. As a story spreads on\nDigg through voting, it generates cascades. We extract cascades of more than\n3,500 Digg stories and calculate their macroscopic and microscopic properties.\nWe identify several trends in cascade dynamics: spreading via chaining,\nbranching and community. We discuss how these affect the spread of the story\nthrough the Digg social network. Our computational framework is general and\noffers a practical solution to quantitative analysis of the microscopic\nstructure of even very large cascades.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 01:54:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Nov 2010 20:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3768", "submitter": "Jacob Ratkiewicz", "authors": "Jacob Ratkiewicz and Michael Conover and Mark Meiss and Bruno\n  Gon\\c{c}alves and Snehal Patil and Alessandro Flammini and Filippo Menczer", "title": "Detecting and Tracking the Spread of Astroturf Memes in Microblog\n  Streams", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the 20th international conference companion on\n  World wide web, 249-252 (2011)", "doi": "10.1145/1963192.1963301", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online social media are complementing and in some cases replacing\nperson-to-person social interaction and redefining the diffusion of\ninformation.
