Thus, it does not need\nany extra signal processing modular to remove MA as in some other algorithms.\nFurthermore, seeking spectral peaks associated with heart rate is simplified.\nResults: Experimental results on 12 PPG datasets sampled at 25 Hz and recorded\nduring subjects' fast running showed that it had high performance.

In this paper, we design a\ncurrency schemes IDCS for imprecise digital commodity. IDCS completes a trade\nin three stages of handshake between a buyer and providers. We present an IDCS\nprototype implementation that assigns weights on the trustworthy of the\nproviders, and calculates a confidence level for the buyer to decide the\nquality of a imprecise commodity. In experiment, we characterize the\nperformance of IDCS prototype under varying impact factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2015 09:35:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Zimu", ""], ["Xu", "Zhiwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.09169", "submitter": "Pierre Crescenzo", "authors": "Isabelle Mirbel (INRIA Sophia Antipolis / Laboratoire I3S), Pierre\n  Crescenzo (I3S)", "title": "Improving Collaborations in Neuroscientist Community", "comments": "{\\'e}galement rapport de recherche I3S/RR--2009-05--FR", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Web Portals, IGI Global, 2011, 1 (3),\n  pp.33-49", "doi": "10.1109/WI-IAT.2009.351", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present our approach, called SATIS (Semantically AnnotaTed\nIntentions for Services), relying on intentional process modeling and semantic\nweb technologies and models, to assist collaboration among the members of a\nneurosciences community.
