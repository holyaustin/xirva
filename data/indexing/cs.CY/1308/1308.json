This paper tracks the growth curves of all 20,000\npetitions to the UK government over 18 months, analyzing the rate of growth and\noutreach mechanism. Previous research has suggested the importance of the first\nday to the ultimate success of a petition, but has not examined early growth\nwithin that day, made possible here through hourly resolution in the data. The\nanalysis shows that the vast majority of petitions do not achieve any measure\nof success; over 99 percent fail to get the 10,000 signatures required for an\nofficial response and only 0.1 percent attain the 100,000 required for a\nparliamentary debate. We analyze the data through a multiplicative process\nmodel framework to explain the heterogeneous growth of signatures at the\npopulation level. We define and measure an average outreach factor for\npetitions and show that it decays very fast (reducing to 0.1% after 10 hours).\nAfter 24 hours, a petition's fate is virtually set.

The popularity and promise of crowdsourcing\nmarkets has led to both empirical and theoretical research on the design of\nalgorithms to optimize various aspects of these markets, such as the pricing\nand assignment of tasks. Much of the existing theoretical work on crowdsourcing\nmarkets has focused on problems that fall into the broad category of online\ndecision making; task requesters or the crowdsourcing platform itself make\nrepeated decisions about prices to set, workers to filter out, problems to\nassign to specific workers, or other things. Often these decisions are complex,\nrequiring algorithms that learn about the distribution of available tasks or\nworkers over time and take into account the strategic (or sometimes irrational)\nbehavior of workers.\n  As human computation grows into its own field, the time is ripe to address\nthese challenges in a principled way. However, it appears very difficult to\ncapture all pertinent aspects of crowdsourcing markets in a single coherent\nmodel. In this paper, we reflect on the modeling issues that inhibit\ntheoretical research on online decision making for crowdsourcing, and identify\nsome steps forward. This paper grew out of the authors' own frustration with\nthese issues, and we hope it will encourage the community to attempt to\nunderstand, debate, and ultimately address them.\n  The authors welcome feedback for future revisions of this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 03:49:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Nov 2013 19:37:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 20:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Slivkins", "Aleksandrs", ""], ["Vaughan", "Jennifer Wortman", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.1846", "submitter": "Blesson Varghese", "authors": "Anthony Astoul, Christopher Filliter, Eric Mason, Andrew Rau-Chaplin,\n  Kunal Shridhar, Blesson Varghese, Naman Varshney", "title": "Developing and Testing the Automated Post-Event Earthquake Loss\n  Estimation and Visualisation (APE-ELEV) Technique", "comments": "Bulletin of Earthquake Engineering, 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY physics.geo-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An automated, real-time, multiple sensor data source relying and globally\napplicable earthquake loss model and visualiser is desirable for post-event\nearthquake analysis.

We find that the \"body mass\" ($PV$) and \"energy consumption\" ($UV$)\nof the studied forums exhibits the allometric growth property, i.e., $PV_t \\sim\nUV_t ^ \\theta$. This implies that within a forum, the network transporting\nattention flow between threads has a structure invariant of time, despite of\nthe continuously changing of the nodes (threads) and edges (clickstreams). The\nobserved time-invariant topology allows us to explain the dynamics of networks\nby the behavior of threads. In particular, we describe the clickstream\ndissipation on threads using the function $D_i \\sim T_i ^ \\gamma$, in which\n$T_i$ is the clickstreams to node $i$ and $D_i$ is the clickstream dissipated\nfrom $i$. It turns out that $\\gamma$, an indicator for dissipation efficiency,\nis negatively correlated with $\\theta$ and $1/\\gamma$ sets the lower boundary\nfor $\\theta$. Our findings have practical consequences. For example, $\\theta$\ncan be used as a measure of the \"stickiness\" of forums, because it quantifies\nthe stable ability of forums to convert $UV$ into $PV$, i.e., to remain users\n\"lock-in\" the forum. Meanwhile, the correlation between $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$\nprovides a convenient method to evaluate the `stickiness\" of forums.
