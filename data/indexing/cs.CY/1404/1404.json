We present a\ncomputational extension of the Bechdel test: A popular tool to assess if a\nmovie contains a male gender bias, by looking for two female characters who\ndiscuss about something besides a man. We provide the tools to quantify Bechdel\nscores for both genders, and we measure them in movie scripts and large\ndatasets of dialogues between users of MySpace and Twitter. Comparing movies\nand users of social media, we find that movies and Twitter conversations have a\nconsistent male bias, which does not appear when analyzing MySpace.\nFurthermore, the narrative of Twitter is closer to the movies that do not pass\nthe Bechdel test than to those that pass it.\n  We link the properties of movies and the users that share trailers of those\nmovies. Our analysis reveals some particularities of movies that pass the\nBechdel test: Their trailers are less popular, female users are more likely to\nshare them than male users, and users that share them tend to interact less\nwith male users. Based on our datasets, we define gender independence\nmeasurements to analyze the gender biases of a society, as manifested through\ndigital traces of online behavior. Using the profile information of Twitter\nusers, we find larger gender independence for urban users in comparison to\nrural ones. Additionally, the asymmetry between genders is larger for parents\nand lower for students. Gender asymmetry varies across US states, increasing\nwith higher average income and latitude. This points to the relation between\ngender inequality and social, economical, and cultural factors of a society,\nand how gender roles exist in both fictional narratives and public online\ndialogues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 08:40:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia", "David", ""], ["Weber", "Ingmar", ""], ["Garimella", "Venkata Rama Kiran", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0191", "submitter": "Alexander Petersen", "authors": "Alexander M.

While classical data sources, such\nas surveys or census, have a limited level of geographical resolution (e.g.,\ndistricts, municipalities, counties are typically used) or are restricted to\ngeneric workdays or weekends, the data coming from mobile devices can be\nprecisely located both in time and space.

The analysis is\nfocused on the urban areas of Barcelona and Madrid, for which data of the three\ntypes is available. We assess the correlation between the datasets on different\naspects: the spatial distribution of people concentration, the temporal\nevolution of people density and the mobility patterns of individuals. Our\nresults show that the three data sources are providing comparable information.\nEven though the representativeness of Twitter geolocated data is lower than\nthat of mobile phone and census data, the correlations between the population\ndensity profiles and mobility patterns detected by the three datasets are close\nto one in a grid with cells of 2x2 and 1x1 square kilometers.

Second, we identify particular individual\npreferences, such as the taste for a certain type of food or drink, e.g., pizza\nor sake, as well as temporal habits, such as the time and day of the week when\nan individual goes to a restaurant or a bar. Third, we show how to analyze this\ninformation to assess the cultural distance between two countries, cities or\neven areas of a city.

The analysis is based on\n336 runs of beer game simulation within a target group of 56 participants\ndivided into 14 subgroups (SG1-SG14).The purpose of the study is mainly to\ninvestigate the effect of mutual interactions on students learning process\nusing supply chain total cost and ordering fluctuations as critical measurement\ncriteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 20:43:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bariran", "S.

Instead, those traits\nhad other, non-homophily effects: Females mobilized other females faster than\nmales mobilized other males. Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and\nolder recruits mobilized slower.
