But are the\nsafety and liveliness of neighborhoods independent characteristics? Or are they\njust two sides of the same coin? In a world where people avoid unsafe looking\nplaces, neighborhoods that look unsafe will be less lively, and will fail to\nharness the natural surveillance of human activity. But in a world where the\npreference for safe looking neighborhoods is small, the connection between the\nperception of safety and liveliness will be either weak or nonexistent. In this\npaper we explore the connection between the levels of activity and the\nperception of safety of neighborhoods in two major Italian cities by combining\nmobile phone data (as a proxy for activity or liveliness) with scores of\nperceived safety estimated using a Convolutional Neural Network trained on a\ndataset of Google Street View images scored using a crowdsourced visual\nperception survey. We find that: (i) safer looking neighborhoods are more\nactive than what is expected from their population density, employee density,\nand distance to the city centre; and (ii) that the correlation between\nappearance of safety and activity is positive, strong, and significant, for\nfemales and people over 50, but negative for people under 30, suggesting that\nthe behavioral impact of perception depends on the demographic of the\npopulation. Finally, we use occlusion techniques to identify the urban features\nthat contribute to the appearance of safety, finding that greenery and street\nfacing windows contribute to a positive appearance of safety (in agreement with\nOscar Newman's defensible space theory). These results suggest that urban\nappearance modulates levels of human activity and, consequently, a\nneighborhood's rate of natural surveillance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 15:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["De Nadai", "Marco", ""], ["Vieriu", "Radu L.", ""], ["Zen", "Gloria", ""], ["Dragicevic", "Stefan", ""], ["Naik", "Nikhil", ""], ["Caraviello", "Michele", ""], ["Hidalgo", "Cesar A.", ""], ["Sebe", "Nicu", ""], ["Lepri", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00570", "submitter": "Uri Kartoun", "authors": "Uri Kartoun", "title": "A Methodology to Generate Virtual Patient Repositories", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electronic medical records (EMR) contain sensitive personal information.

Over history money\nhas become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the\nlike, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I\npropose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the\nmost general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that\nusing programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is\nagency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics\nas economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to\nimplement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously\ndescribe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational\ncryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are\nperformed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can\nexecute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has\nalready been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility\nfrom human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic\nadvantages over the current passive form of money. For example in\nmicroeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,\nensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of\ncontracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example\nthe control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to\nmoney. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external\nhuman agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic\nsystems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,\nthereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 15:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Ross D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.01212", "submitter": "Sebastian Baumbach", "authors": "Sebastian Baumbach, Frank Wittich, Florian Sachs, Sheraz Ahmed,\n  Andreas Dengel", "title": "A Novel Approach for Data-Driven Automatic Site Recommendation and\n  Selection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a novel, generic, and automatic method for data-driven\nsite selection.

Although medical best practice guidelines exist in\nhospital handbooks, they are often lengthy and difficult to apply clinically.\nThe challenges are exaggerated for doctors in rural areas and emergency medical\ntechnicians (EMT) during patient transport.\n  In this paper, we propose the concept of distributed executable medical best\npractice guidance systems to assist adherence to best practice from the time\nthat a patient first presents at a rural hospital, through diagnosis and\nambulance transfer to arrival and treatment at a regional tertiary hospital\ncenter. We codify complex medical knowledge in the form of simplified\ndistributed executable disease automata, from the thin automata at rural\nhospitals to the rich automata in the regional center hospitals. However, a\nmain challenge is how to efficiently and safely synchronize distributed best\npractice models as the communication among medical facilities, devices, and\nprofessionals generates a large number of messages. This complex problem of\npatient diagnosis and transport from rural to center facility is also fraught\nwith many uncertainties and changes resulting in a high degree of dynamism. To\naddress this situation, we propose a pathophysiological model-driven message\nexchange communication architecture that ensures the real-time and dynamic\nrequirements of synchronization among distributed emergency best-practice\nmodels are met in a reliable and safe manner. Taking the signs, symptoms, and\nprogress of stroke patients transported across a geographically distributed\nhealthcare network as the motivating use case, we implement our communication\nsystem and apply it to our developed best practice automata using laboratory\nsimulations.

The efficacy of Far-reaching\nInsights in bridging this gap is demonstrated by our results, as Far-reaching\nInsights prove to be, on average, twice as effective as the current model in\ndiscouraging users from installing over-privileged apps.
