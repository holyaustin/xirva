Representation\nlearning presents an attractive opportunity to model the dynamic evolution of\nusers and items, where each user/item can be embedded in a Euclidean space and\nits evolution can be modeled by an embedding trajectory in this space. However,\nexisting dynamic embedding methods generate embeddings only when users take\nactions and do not explicitly model the future trajectory of the user/item in\nthe embedding space. Here we propose JODIE, a coupled recurrent neural network\nmodel that learns the embedding trajectories of users and items. JODIE employs\ntwo recurrent neural networks to update the embedding of a user and an item at\nevery interaction. Crucially, JODIE also models the future embedding trajectory\nof a user/item. To this end, it introduces a novel projection operator that\nlearns to estimate the embedding of the user at any time in the future. These\nestimated embeddings are then used to predict future user-item interactions. To\nmake the method scalable, we develop a t-Batch algorithm that creates\ntime-consistent batches and leads to 9x faster training. We conduct six\nexperiments to validate JODIE on two prediction tasks---future interaction\nprediction and state change prediction---using four real-world datasets.

KQN outperforms all the existing KT models based on prediction\naccuracy. 2. The interaction between the knowledge state and skills can be\nvisualized for interpretation. 3. Based on probabilistic skill similarity, a\nskill domain can be analyzed with clustering using the distances between the\nskill vectors of KQN. 4.

This paper presents work on building\nintelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition.\nThese agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian\nAffect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are\nmotivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for\ntheir social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their\nsense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally\nshared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group\nmembers, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group\ncommitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a\ncombination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading\nthe two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the\nsituation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and\nadvances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in\nsocial-psychological theory. We introduce a revised BayesAct model that more\ndeeply integrates social-psychological theorising, and we demonstrate a\ncomponent of the model as being sufficient to account for cognitive biases\nabout fairness, dissonance and conformity.

To overcome this bias\ntowards data from acute care settings, there is a need for longitudinal\nmonitoring in patients with cardiovascular disorders.

The system has been deployed in global delivery\ncenters, and has received positive feedback from payroll compliance officers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2019 06:49:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Tamilselvam", "Srikanth G", ""], ["Gupta", "Ankush", ""], ["Agarwal", "Arvind", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.07333", "submitter": "Leah Findlater", "authors": "Leah Findlater, Steven Goodman, Yuhang Zhao, Shiri Azenkot, Margot\n  Hanley", "title": "Fairness Issues in AI Systems that Augment Sensory Abilities", "comments": "4 pages.

In this sense, ground transportation in\ndense urban environments has been facing challenges for many years (e.g.,\ncongestion and resilience). One import outcome of the effort made toward the\ncreation of new concepts for enhancing urban transportation is the Urban Air\nMobility (UAM) concept. UAM aims at enhancing city transportation services\nusing manned and unmanned vehicles. However, these operations bring many\nchallenges to be faced, e.g., the interaction between the controller agent and\nautonomous vehicles. Furthermore, trajectory planning is not a simple task due\nto several factors. Firstly, the trajectories must consider a reduced minimum\nseparation as eVTOL vehicle are expected to operate in complex urban\nenvironments. This leads the trajectory planning process to observe safety\nprimitives more restrictively once the airspace is expected to comport many\nvehicles that follow small minimum separation standards. Thereupon, the main\ngoal of the Trajectory-Based UAM Operations Simulator (TUS) is to simulate the\nTrajectory-Based UAM operations in urban environments considering the presence\nof both manned and unmanned eVTOL vehicles. For this, a Discrete Event\nSimulation (DES) approach is adopted, which considers an input (i.e., the eVTOL\nvehicles, their origin and destination, and their respective trajectories) and\nproduces an output (which describes if the trajectories are safe and the\nelapsed operation time). The main contribution of this simulation tool is to\nprovide a simulated environment for testing and measuring the effectiveness\n(e.g., flight duration) of trajectories planned for eVTOL vehicles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Aug 2019 03:27:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Neto", "Euclides C.

Based on the realization of the deficiencies of\nWeb2.0 and the loss of confidence in a central intermediaries based economy, a\nsocietal desire to overcome these deficiencies has emerged. In the beginning,\nthe crypto movement has been enthusiastic about the ability to encode all\nnecessities for a digital economy in algorithms and code. However, in the mean\ntime, insight has gained ground that on the one hand, designing the EoT is a\nquite complex endeavor and the resulting system might fail to achieve the\ntargeted ideals, even when no intermediaries are present. We emphasize this\nposition by arguing that the EoT in fact corresponds to a complex system\noperated in open contexts, for which a sophisticated design approach and a set\nof measures are inevitable, in order to be able to achieve a valid design and\noperation.

In this thesis, we\nanalyze the state of the art in knowledge-intensive and data-driven processes.\nWe present a scalable and extensible IoT-enabled process data analytics\npipeline to enable analysts ingest data from IoT devices, extract knowledge\nfrom this data and link them to process execution data. We focus on a\nmotivating scenario in policing, where a criminal investigator will be\naugmented by smart devices to collect data and to identify devices around the\ninvestigation location, to communicate with them to understand and analyze\nevidence. We design and implement a system (namely iCOP, IoT-enabled COP) to\nassist investigators collect large amounts of evidence and dig for the facts in\nan easy way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Aug 2019 23:45:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Schiliro", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.09485", "submitter": "Jong Seon Kim", "authors": "Jong Seon Kim, Jong Wook Kim, Yon Dohn Chung", "title": "Successive Point-of-Interest Recommendation with Local Differential\n  Privacy", "comments": "This paper has been accepted to IEEE Access", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3076809", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A point-of-interest (POI) recommendation system performs an important role in\nlocation-based services because it can help people to explore new locations and\npromote advertisers to launch advertisements at appropriate locations.
