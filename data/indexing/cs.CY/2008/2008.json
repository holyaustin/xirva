This paper considers the consequences of having higher\nrates of false positives for one racial group and higher rates of false\nnegatives for another racial group. The paper examines how different errors in\njustice settings can present problems for machine learning applications, the\nlimits of computation for resolving tradeoffs, and how solutions might have to\nbe crafted through courageous conversations with leadership, line workers,\nstakeholders, and impacted communities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2020 16:31:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Russell", "Jesse", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.02250", "submitter": "Ryan Gallagher", "authors": "Ryan J.

One of the most promising AI\napproaches to trace linguistic biases in large textual datasets involves word\nembeddings, which transform text into high-dimensional dense vectors and\ncapture semantic relations between words.

The data captured by the physical and human sensors (voice messages)\nare analyzed by data and text mining to create and improve agricultural\nknowledge. An agricultural knowledge management system using physical and human\nsensors encourages to share and transfer knowledge among farmers for the\npurpose of improving the efficiency and productivity of agriculture. We applied\none such agricultural knowledge management system (smart voice messaging\nsystem) to a greenhouse vegetable farm in Hokkaido. A qualitative analysis of\naccumulated voice messages and an interview with the farmer demonstrated the\neffectiveness of this system. The contributions of this study include a new and\npractical approach to an \"agricultural Internet of Everything (IoE)\" and\nevidence of its effectiveness as a result of our trial experiment at a real\nvegetable farm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Aug 2020 11:46:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Uchihira", "Naoshi", ""], ["Yoshida", "Masami", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.03775", "submitter": "Ralph Foorthuis", "authors": "Ralph Foorthuis", "title": "Tactics for Internal Compliance: A Literature Review", "comments": "47 pages (excl. references), 4 figures, 4 tables.

Using data from\nProsper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts\nlisting default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The dominance\nof the machine over the crowd is more pronounced for highly risky listings.

We propose a\ngeneral and effective \"debasing\" method that can be applied to any prediction\nfocused ML applications, and demonstrate its use in our context.

We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation\nmodel for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating\npolicies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is\nloaded with an 8M+ synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study.

Validation against transit\nstations shows an 8% difference from observed counts and median difference of\n29% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion\npricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much\nhigher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing\npolicy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan\ndifferently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan. The\nmultiagent simulation can show that 37.3% of the Manhattan segment would be\nnegatively impacted by the pricing compared to 39.9% of the non-Manhattan\nsegment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing\nrevenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion\npricing goes up from $9.18 to $14 both ways even as it increases for the\nCharging-related population segment.

Analysts detect partisan\ngerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble of\nsampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods must\nscale to large maps with many districts, incorporate realistic legal\nconstraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a selected target\ndistribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in at least one of\nthese three areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that\ndraws representative redistricting plans from a realistic target distribution\nof choice. Because it samples directly, the SMC algorithm can efficiently\nexplore the relevant space of redistricting plans better than the existing\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithms that yield dependent samples. Our algorithm\ncan simultaneously incorporate several constraints commonly imposed in\nreal-world redistricting problems, including equal population, compactness, and\npreservation of administrative boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the\nproposed algorithm by using a small map where all redistricting plans can be\nenumerated. We then apply the SMC algorithm to evaluate the partisan\nimplications of several maps submitted by relevant parties in a recent\nhigh-profile redistricting case in the state of Pennsylvania. We find that the\nproposed algorithm is roughly 40 times more efficient in sampling from the\ntarget distribution than a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm.

Based on the realization that\nhate speech is not a clear-cut category to begin with, appears to belong to a\ncontinuum of discriminatory discourse and is often realized through the use of\nindirect linguistic means, it is argued that annotation schemes for its\ndetection should refrain from directly including the label 'hate speech,' as\ndifferent annotators might have different thresholds as to what constitutes\nhate speech and what not. In view of this, we suggest a multi-layer annotation\nscheme, which is pilot-tested against a binary +/- hate speech classification\nand appears to yield higher inter-annotator agreement.

These findings have\ndirect implications for advertisers to launch more effective SEA campaigns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Aug 2020 23:15:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yanwu", ""], ["Zhao", "Kang", ""], ["Zeng", "Daniel", ""], ["Jansen", "Bernard Jim", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.06854", "submitter": "Koteswar Rao Jerripothula", "authors": "Akansha Gautam, Koteswar Rao Jerripothula", "title": "SGG: Spinbot, Grammarly and GloVe based Fake News Detection", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by IEEE International Conference on\n  Multimedia Big Data (BigMM), 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, news consumption using online news portals has increased\nexponentially due to several reasons, such as low cost and easy accessibility.\nHowever, such online platforms inadvertently also become the cause of spreading\nfalse information across the web.

We\nfirst conduct a case study, where we analyse which legal remedies a patient can\nmake use of, if they are injured by a surgical robot caused by a cyberattack in\nthe national legal system. We also explore whether cybersecurity and\ncyberattacks are considered by the upcoming Medical Device Regulation of the\nEU. We show that the selected national legal system is adequate. This is\nbecause of its flexibility and in a certain approach even to ignore the\ndistinction between safety and security to the benefit of the patient, and in\none situation to remove liability from the manufacturer by erasing its status\nas party. Otherwise, unless the operator or other parties have made the\ncyberattack more likely to occur, the manufacturer is liable. We find that the\nregulation does not directly consider security defects, requiring\ninterpretation and use of guidance to show it. Due to the risk cyberattacks\npose on medical equipment, we find this to not be adequate. We further find\nthat the regulators of medical devices, including surgical robots, will not\nnecessarily have adequate staff or rules of enforcement, as this has been left\nto the member states to solve.

To build\nconsensus on pluralistic values and make social choices that consider minority\nopinions, we propose aggregation methods that give weighting to the minority's\npositionality on cardinal cumulative voting. Based on quadratic and linear\nvoting, we formulated three weighted aggregation methods that differ in the\nratio of votes to cumulative points and the weighting of the minority to all\nmembers, and assuming that the distributions of votes follow normal\ndistributions, we calculated the frequency distributions of the aggregation\nresults.

This implies that Sen and Gotoh's idea of considering the social\nposition of unfortunate people on ordinal ranking in the welfare economics, was\nillustrated by weighting the minority's positionality on cardinal voting. In\naddition, it is possible to visualize the number and positionality of the\nminority from the analysis of the aggregation results. These results will be\nuseful to promote mutual understanding between the majority and minority by\ninteractively visualizing the contents of the proposed aggregation methods in\nthe consensus-building process.

We extracted mentions\nrelated to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders and medical procedures using the\nClinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES).

For instance, an ad could appear below the page fold, where a user never\nscrolls. Yet, an ad is essentially ineffective if it is not at least somewhat\nviewable. Ad viewability - which refers to the pixel percentage-in-view and the\nexposure duration of an online display ad - has recently garnered great\ninterest among digital advertisers and publishers. However, we know very little\nabout the impact of ad viewability on advertising effectiveness. We work to\nclose this gap by analyzing a large-scale observational data set with more than\n350,000 ad impressions similar to the data sets that are typically available to\ndigital advertisers and publishers. This analysis reveals that longer exposure\ndurations (>10 seconds) and 100% visible pixels do not appear to be optimal in\ngenerating view-throughs. The highest view-through rates seem to be generated\nwith relatively lower pixel/second-combinations of 50%/1, 50%/5, 75%/1, and\n75%/5. However, this analysis does not account for user behavior that may be\ncorrelated with or even drive ad viewability and may therefore result in\nendogeneity issues. Consequently, we manipulated ad viewability in a randomized\nonline experiment for a major European news website, finding the highest ad\nrecognition rates among relatively higher pixel/second-combinations of 75%/10,\n100%/5 and 100%/10. Everything below 75\\% or 5 seconds performs worse. Yet, we\nfind that it may be sufficient to have either a long exposure duration or high\npixel percentage-in-view to reach high advertising effectiveness.

Regulations are\nsupposed to ensure safety and fairness within a controlled competitive\nenvironment. By influencing both drivers and riders choices and behaviors,\nemerging e-hailing services (e.g., Uber and Lyft) have been reshaping the\nexisting competition in the last few years. This study investigates the\nexisting competition between the mainstream hailing services (i.e., Yellow and\nGreen Cabs) and e-hailing services (i.e., Uber) in New York City. Their\ncompetition is investigated in terms of market segmentation, emerging demands,\nand regulations. Data visualization techniques are employed to find existing\nand new patterns in travel behavior. For this study, we developed a multi-agent\nmodel and applied reinforcement learning techniques to imitate drivers\nbehaviors. The model is verified by the patterns recognized in our data\nvisualization results. The model is then used to evaluate multiple new\nregulations and competition scenarios. Results of our study illustrate that\ne-hailers dominate low-travel-density areas (e.g., residential areas), and that\ne-hailers quickly identify and respond to change in travel demand. This leads\nto diminishing market size for hailers. Furthermore, our results confirm the\nindirect impact of Green Cabs regulations on the existing competition. This\ninvestigation, along with our proposed scenarios, can aid policymakers and\nauthorities in designing policies that could effectively address demand while\nassuring a healthy competition for the hailing and e-haling sectors.\n  Keywords: taxi; Uber, policy; E-hailing; multi-agent simulation;\nreinforcement learning;\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 08:08:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Vasebi", "Saeed", ""], ["Hayeri", "Yeganeh M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.12615", "submitter": "Lance Eliot", "authors": "Lance Eliot", "title": "An Impact Model of AI on the Principles of Justice: Encompassing the\n  Autonomous Levels of AI Legal Reasoning", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:2008.10575, arXiv:2008.09507, arXiv:2008.07743", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Efforts furthering the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) will\nincreasingly encompass AI Legal Reasoning (AILR) as a crucial element in the\npractice of law.
