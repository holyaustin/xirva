After\nacquiring patients' consent, physicians enter medical histories, physiological\ndata and symptoms or disorders into the system; an integrated expert system can\nthen assist in diagnosis and statistical software provides a list of the most\npromising treatment options and medications, tailored to the patient.\nPhysicians later enter information about the outcomes of the chosen treatments,\ndata the system uses to optimize future treatment recommendations. Medical\nresearchers can analyze the aggregate data to compare various drugs or\ntreatments in defined patient populations on a large scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Oct 2008 02:01:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Boldt", "Axel", ""], ["Janich", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3093", "submitter": "Huawei Shen", "authors": "Huawei Shen, Xueqi Cheng, Kai Cai, Mao-Bin Hu", "title": "Detect overlapping and hierarchical community structure in networks", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 388 (2009) 1706-1712", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2008.12.021", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Clustering and community structure is crucial for many network systems and\nthe related dynamic processes.

Patients are prioritized for\nmedical care through a triage process. Manual systems allow for inconsistency\nand error. This paper proposes a novel system to automate accident and\nemergency centre triage and uses this triage score along with an artificial\nintelligence estimate of patient-doctor time to optimize the queue order. A\nfuzzy inference system is employed to triage patients and a similar system\nestimates the time but adapts continuously through fuzzy Q-learning. The\noptimal queue order is found using a novel procedure based on genetic\nalgorithms. These components are integrated in a simple graphical user\ninterface. Live tests could not be performed but simulations reveal that the\naverage waiting time can be reduced by 48 minutes and priority is given to\nurgent patients\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2008 20:27:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Golding", "Dan", ""], ["Wilson", "Linda", ""], ["Marwala", "Tshilidzi", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4187", "submitter": "Andreas Kaltenbrunner", "authors": "Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Rodrigo Meza, Jens Grivolla, Joan Codina,\n  Rafael Banchs", "title": "Bicycle cycles and mobility patterns - Exploring and characterizing data\n  from a community bicycle program", "comments": "10 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper provides an analysis of human mobility data in an urban area using\nthe amount of available bikes in the stations of the community bicycle program\nBicing in Barcelona.
