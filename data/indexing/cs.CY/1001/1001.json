The former will be used to\ncapture the state of the WS and to model back-end operations on it whereas the\nlatter will be used to model behavior, and in particular, front-end\ninteractions and communications. The modelling helps to clearly and precisely\nunderstand functional and security requirements and provide a basis for\nverifying that the system meets its intended requirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:51:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Haidar", "Ali N.", "", "University College London"], ["Coveney", "P.

The objective of this paper is to develop an\nagent-based model to simulate the spread of pandemic influenza (novel H1N1) in\nEgypt. The proposed multi-agent model is based on the modeling of individuals'\ninteractions in a space time context. The proposed model involves different\ntypes of parameters such as: social agent attributes, distribution of Egypt\npopulation, and patterns of agents' interactions. Analysis of modeling results\nleads to understanding the characteristics of the modeled pandemic,\ntransmission patterns, and the conditions under which an outbreak might occur.\nIn addition, the proposed model is used to measure the effectiveness of\ndifferent control strategies to intervene the pandemic spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 21:38:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Khalil", "Khaled M.", ""], ["Abdel-Aziz", "M.", ""], ["Nazmy", "Taymour T.", ""], ["Salem", "Abdel-Badeeh M.", ""]]}]
