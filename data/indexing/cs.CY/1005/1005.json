These\nprojects can address universal themes and develop well-being models that are\nvaluable across a diversity of societies and economies. It is a universal fact\nthat SMEs in all countries provide a substantial proportion of total\nemployment, and conduct much of a nation's innovative activity. Yet these\nsmaller companies struggle in global markets on a far from level playing field,\nwhere large companies have distinct advantages. To redress this imbalance the\nCommission saw it as a priority to improve the trading capability of the Small\nand Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), and perceived digital platforms as the\nmodern means to this end. They considered that the best operational model for a\nvibrant Web2.0-based Internet services industry would be by analogy to\nwell-performing biological ecosystems. Open Source Software is adopted in the\nDBE/OPAALS projects as the best support for sustainability of such complex\nelectronic webs, since it minimises interoperability problems, enables code\naccess for cheaper in-house modification or development of systems, and reduces\nboth capital and operating expenditure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 18:04:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Stanley", "Jo", ""], ["Briscoe", "Gerard", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.2704", "submitter": "Santo Fortunato Dr", "authors": "Jacob Ratkiewicz, Filippo Menczer, Santo Fortunato, Alessandro\n  Flammini, Alessandro Vespignani", "title": "Characterizing and modeling the dynamics of online popularity", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures.

The answer to\nthis question depends not only on the structure of the network, but also on\ndetails of the dynamic processes occurring on it. We classify these processes\nas conservative and non-conservative. A random walk on a network is an example\nof a conservative dynamic process, while information spread is\nnon-conservative. The influence models used to rank network nodes can be\nsimilarly classified, depending on the dynamic process they implicitly emulate.\nWe claim that in order to correctly rank network nodes, the influence model has\nto match the details of the dynamic process. We study a real-world network on\nthe social news aggregator Digg, which allows users to post and vote for news\nstories. We empirically define influence as the number of in-network votes a\nuser's post generates. This influence measure, and the resulting ranking,\narises entirely from the dynamics of voting on Digg, which represents\nnon-conservative information flow.\n  We then compare predictions of different influence models with this empirical\nestimate of influence. The results show that non-conservative models are better\nable to predict influential users on Digg. We find that normalized\nalpha-centrality metric turns out to be one of the best predictors of\ninfluence. We also present a simple algorithm for computing this metric and the\nassociated mathematical formulation and analytical proofs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 May 2010 17:17:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Rumi", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5060", "submitter": "Shvetha Soundararajan", "authors": "Shvetha Soundararajan, James D.

In our quest to develop better products,\ntherefore, it is imperative that we strive to learn and understand the\napplication of Agile methods, principles and techniques to the software\ndevelopment enterprise. Unfortunately, in many educational institutions courses\nand projects that emphasize Agile Software Development are minimal. At best,\nstudents have only limited exposure to the agile philosophy, principles and\npractices at the graduate and undergraduate levels of education. In an effort\nto address this concern, we offered a graduate-level course entitled \"Agile\nSoftware Engineering\" in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech in\nFall 2009. The primary objectives of the class were to introduce the values,\nprinciples and practices underlying the agile philosophy, and to do so in an\natmosphere that encourages debate and critical thinking. The course was\ndesigned around three central components: (1) teaching the essentials of how\none develops a product within an Agile framework, (2) having invited\npresentation by notable industry experts, and (3) having students present and\ndiscuss current research topics and issues.

These\nassumptions hold on military or search and rescue operations, where all hosts\nare from the same authority and their users have common goals. The application\nof mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) as open networks has emerged recently but\nproliferated exponentially. Energy is a valuable commodity in MANETs due to the\nlimited battery of the portable devices. Batteries typically cannot be replaced\nin MANETs, making their lifetime limited. Diverse users, with unlike goals,\nshare the resources of their devices and ensuring global connectivity comes\nvery low in their priority. This sort of communities can already be found in\nwired networks, namely on peer-to-peer networks. In this scenario, open MANETs\nwill likely resemble social environments. A group of persons can provide\nbenefits to each of its members as long as everyone provides his contribution.\nFor our particular case, each element of a MANET will be called to forward\nmessages and to participate on routing protocols. A selfish behavior threatens\nthe entire community and also this behavior is infectious as, other MDs may\nalso start to perform in the same way. In the extreme, this can take to the\ncomplete sabotage of the network. This paper investigates the prevalent\nmalicious attacks in MANET and analyzes recent selfish trends in MANET.
