Yet while much work has been done in this\narea, relatively little attention has been paid to studying perhaps the\nultimate lever of resource allocation: pricing. Most data centers today charge\nusers by \"bundling\" heterogeneous resources together in a fixed ratio and\nselling these bundles to their clients. But bundling masks the fact that\ndifferent users require different combinations of resources (e.g., CPUs,\nmemory, bandwidth) to process their jobs. The presence of multiple resources in\nfact allows an operator to offer many different types of pricing strategies,\nwhich may have different effects on its revenue. Moreover, to avoid user\ndissatisfaction, operators must consider the impact of their chosen prices on\nthe fairness of the jobs processed for different users. In this paper, we\ndevelop an analytical framework that accounts for the fairness and revenue\ntradeoffs that arise in a datacenter's multi-resource setting and the impact\nthat different pricing plans can have on this tradeoff. We characterize the\nimplications of different pricing plans on various fairness metrics and derive\nanalytical limits on the operator's fairness-revenue tradeoff. We then provide\nan algorithm to navigate this tradeoff and compare the tradeoff points for\ndifferent pricing strategies on a data trace taken from a Google cluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 21:57:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 17:22:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Joe-Wong", "Carlee", ""], ["Sen", "Soumya", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0365", "submitter": "Feng Tian", "authors": "Feng Tian, Wenjian Chai, Chuanyun Wang, Xiaoping Sun", "title": "Design and Implementation of Flight Visual Simulation System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The design requirement for flight visual simulation system is studied and the\noverall structure and development process are proposed in this paper.
