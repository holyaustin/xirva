The\ninitial operation of any digitally-engaged community depends on the existence\nof its own members, the beneficial values created and exchanged, and the\nrelationships interlinking both. However, the level of contribution and\ninvolvement might vary depending on the benefits being gratified from engaging\nin such communities.
