Most crowdsourcing platforms are uncontrolled and offer freedom to\ncustomers and freelancers to choose each other.

For skilled jobs (e.g., software\ndevelopment) with specific quality requirements, however, this does not ensure\nthat the maximum number of job requests is satisfied. In this work we determine\nthe capacity of freelance markets, in terms of maximum satisfied job requests,\nand propose centralized schemes that achieve capacity. To ensure decentralized\noperation and freedom of choice for customers and freelancers, we propose\nsimple schemes compatible with the operation of current crowdsourcing platforms\nthat approximately achieve capacity.

With\nthe continuing advancement of location and Web 2.0 technologies, location-based\nsocial media (LBSM) have been gaining widespread popularity in the past few\nyears. With an access to locations of users, profiles and the contents of the\nsocial media posts, the LBSM data provided a novel modality of data source for\nhuman mobility study. By exploiting the explicit location footprints and mining\nthe latent demographic information implied in the LBSM data, the purpose of\nthis paper is to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of human\nmobility with a particular focus on the impact of demography. We first collect\ngeo-tagged Twitter feeds posted in the conterminous United States area, and\norganize the collection of feeds using the concept of space-time trajectory\ncorresponding to each Twitter user. Commonly human mobility measures, including\ndetected home and activity centers, are derived for each user trajectory. We\nthen select a subset of Twitter users that have detected home locations in the\ncity of Chicago as a case study, and apply name analysis to the names provided\nin user profiles to learn the implicit demographic information of Twitter\nusers, including race/ethnicity, gender and age. Finally we explore the\nspatiotemporal distribution and mobility characteristics of Chicago Twitter\nusers, and investigate the demographic impact by comparing the differences\nacross three demographic dimensions (race/ethnicity, gender and age). We found\nthat, although the human mobility measures of different demographic groups\ngenerally follow the generic laws (e.g., power law distribution), the\ndemographic information, particular the race/ethnicity group, significantly\naffects the urban human mobility patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2015 04:16:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:24:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Feixiong", ""], ["Cao", "Guofeng", ""], ["Mulligan", "Kevin", ""], ["Li", "Xiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.00375", "submitter": "Hamed Haddadi", "authors": "Hamed Haddadi, Ferda Ofli, Yelena Mejova, Ingmar Weber, Jaideep\n  Srivastava", "title": "360 Quantified Self", "comments": "QCRI Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "QCRI-TR-2015-004", "categories": "cs.HC cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wearable devices with a wide range of sensors have contributed to the rise of\nthe Quantified Self movement, where individuals log everything ranging from the\nnumber of steps they have taken, to their heart rate, to their sleeping\npatterns.

It has a wide variety of applications in disease\ndiagnosis, neuroimaging, etc. Most research on subgraph mining focuses on the\ngraph representation alone. However, in many real-world applications, the side\ninformation is available along with the graph data. For example, for\nneurological disorder identification, in addition to the brain networks derived\nfrom neuroimaging data, hundreds of clinical, immunologic, serologic and\ncognitive measures may also be documented for each subject. These measures\ncompose multiple side views encoding a tremendous amount of supplemental\ninformation for diagnostic purposes, yet are often ignored. In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of discriminative subgraph selection using multiple side\nviews and propose a novel solution to find an optimal set of subgraph features\nfor graph classification by exploring a plurality of side views. We derive a\nfeature evaluation criterion, named gSide, to estimate the usefulness of\nsubgraph patterns based upon side views. Then we develop a branch-and-bound\nalgorithm, called gMSV, to efficiently search for optimal subgraph features by\nintegrating the subgraph mining process and the procedure of discriminative\nfeature selection. Empirical studies on graph classification tasks for\nneurological disorders using brain networks demonstrate that subgraph patterns\nselected by the multi-side-view guided subgraph selection approach can\neffectively boost graph classification performances and are relevant to disease\ndiagnosis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 07:51:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Bokai", ""], ["Kong", "Xiangnan", ""], ["Zhang", "Jingyuan", ""], ["Yu", "Philip S.", ""], ["Ragin", "Ann B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.04785", "submitter": "KuanTing Chen", "authors": "KuanTing Chen, Kezhen Chen, Peizhong Cong, Winston H.

We answer these questions using a mixed-methods approach, integrating\ntechniques from anthropology, network science and information retrieval such as\nthematic coding, temporal network analysis, and community and topic detection.\nDiabetes-related tweets fall within broad thematic groups: health information,\nnews, social interaction, and commercial. At the same time, humorous messages\nand references to popular culture appear consistently, more than any other type\nof tweet. We classify authors according to their temporal 'hub' and 'authority'\nscores. Whereas the hub landscape is diffuse and fluid over time, top\nauthorities are highly persistent across time and comprise bloggers, advocacy\ngroups and NGOs related to diabetes, as well as for-profit entities without\nspecific diabetes expertise. Top authorities fall into seven interest\ncommunities as derived from their Twitter follower network. Our findings have\nimplications for public health professionals and policy makers who seek to use\nsocial media as an engagement tool and to inform policy design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 11:51:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2015 17:42:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 21:19:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 18:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Beguerisse-D\u00edaz", "Mariano", ""], ["McLennan", "Amy K.", ""], ["Gardu\u00f1o-Hern\u00e1ndez", "Guillermo", ""], ["Barahona", "Mauricio", ""], ["Ulijaszek", "Stanley J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05817", "submitter": "Marco Guerini", "authors": "Marco Guerini, G\\\"ozde \\\"Ozbal, Carlo Strapparava", "title": "Echoes of Persuasion: The Effect of Euphony in Persuasive Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While the effect of various lexical, syntactic, semantic and stylistic\nfeatures have been addressed in persuasive language from a computational point\nof view, the persuasive effect of phonetics has received little attention.

We discover\nthat Uber, despite its lower standard pricing rates, effectively charges higher\nfares on average, especially during short in length, but frequent in\noccurrence, taxi journeys. Building on this insight, we develop a smartphone\napplication, OpenStreetCab, that offers a personalized consultation to mobile\nusers on which taxi provider is cheaper for their journey. Almost five months\nafter its launch, the app has attracted more than three thousand users in a\nsingle city. Their journey queries have provided additional insights on the\npotential savings similar technologies can have for urban commuters, with a\nhighlight being that on average, a user in New York saves 6 U.S. Dollars per\ntaxi journey if they pick the cheapest taxi provider. We run extensive\nexperiments to show how Uber's surge pricing is the driving factor of higher\njourney prices and therefore higher potential savings for our application's\nusers. Finally, motivated by the observation that Uber's surge pricing is\noccurring more frequently that intuitively expected, we formulate a prediction\ntask where the aim becomes to predict a geographic area's tendency to surge.\nUsing exogenous to Uber datasets we show how it is possible to estimate\ncustomer demand within an area, and by extension surge pricing, with high\naccuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 16:33:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Noulas", "Anastasios", ""], ["Salnikov", "Vsevolod", ""], ["Lambiotte", "Renaud", ""], ["Mascolo", "Cecilia", ""]]}]
