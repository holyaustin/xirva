The outcome of these machine-mediated human-human interactions will\ndepend on the design of the physical and control systems mediating the\ninteractions. If these outcomes can be predicted via simulation, they can be\nused as a tool for designing attack-resilient grids and control systems.\nHowever, accurate predictions require good models of not just the physical and\ncontrol systems, but also of the human decision making. In this manuscript, we\npresent an approach to develop such tools, i.e. models of the decisions of the\ncyber-physical intruder who is attacking the systems and the system operator\nwho is defending it, and demonstrate its usefulness for design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 06:27:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Backhaus", "Scott", ""], ["Bent", "Russell", ""], ["Bono", "James", ""], ["Lee", "Ritchie", ""], ["Tracey", "Brendan", ""], ["Wolpert", "David", ""], ["Xie", "Dongping", ""], ["Yildiz", "Yildiray", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.4045", "submitter": "Hossein Movafegh Ghadirli", "authors": "Hossein Movafegh Ghadirli, Maryam Rastgarpour", "title": "A Model for an Intelligent and Adaptive Tutor based on Web by Jackson's\n  Learning Styles Profiler and Expert Systems", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, Proceedings of the International MultiConference\n  of Engineers and Computer Scientists, Volume 1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Todays, Intelligent and web-based E-Learning is one of the important area in\nE-Learning.

Based on a dataset of 650 million weibos from August 2009 to January\n2012 crawled from APIs of SinaWeibo, we study the hot ones that have been\nreposted for at least 1000 times. We find that hot weibos can be roughly\nclassified into eight categories, i.e. Entertainment & Fashion, Hot Social\nEvents, Leisure & Mood, Life & Health, Seeking for Help, Sales Promotion,\nFengshui & Fortune and Deleted Weibos. In particular, Leisure & Mood and Hot\nSocial Events account for almost 65% of all the hot weibos.

On the other hand, there\nstill exist quite a lot of serious social problems, such as government\ncorruptions and environmental pollutions. It is also shown that users' posting\nand reposting behaviors are greatly affected by their identity factors (gender,\nverification status, and regional location). For instance, (1) Two thirds of\nthe hot weibos are created by male users. (2) Although verified users account\nfor only 0.1% in SinaWeibo, 46.5% of the hot weibos are contributed by them.\nVery interestingly, 39.2% are written by SPA users. A more or less pathetic\nfact is that only 14.4% of the hot weibos are created by grassroots (individual\nusers that are neither SPA nor verified). (3) Users from different areas of\nChina have distinct posting and reposting behaviors which usually reflect very\ntheir local cultures.

The internal auditors have to\nprocess a huge amount of data produced by diverse systems, which are in most\ncases in textual form, with little automated support. In this paper, we exploit\nthe advantages of information visualization and present a system that aims to\ndetect occupational fraud in systems which involve a pair of entities (e.g., an\nemployee and a client) and periodic activity. The main visualization is based\non a spiral system on which the events are drawn appropriately according to\ntheir time-stamp. Suspicious events are considered those which appear along the\nsame radius or on close radii of the spiral. Before producing the\nvisualization, the system ranks both involved entities according to the\nspecifications of the internal auditor and generates a video file of the\nactivity such that events with strong evidence of fraud appear first in the\nvideo. The system is also equipped with several different visualizations and\nmechanisms in order to meet the requirements of an internal fraud detection\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2013 07:57:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Argyriou", "Evmorfia N.", ""], ["Sotiraki", "Aikaterini A.", ""], ["Symvonis", "Antonios", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.6694", "submitter": "Anna Mavroudi", "authors": "Anna Mavroudi, Thanasis Hadzilacos", "title": "Technical report- Evaluation methodology in the REVIT project", "comments": "report on eLearning that describes the evaluation methodology\n  followed in the case of the REVIT project (Revitalizing Remote Schools for\n  LifeLong Distance elearning, http://revit.cti.gr, Lifelong Learning Programme\n  / Transversal Programme / Key Activity 3: ICT -European Commission, EACEA,\n  from January 2009 till December 2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this technical report is to present a methodological approach\nfor evaluating the REVIT (http://revit.cti.gr) educational venture as a whole\nand assessing the learning effectiveness of the resulting collaborative\ne-courses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2013 18:43:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mavroudi", "Anna", ""], ["Hadzilacos", "Thanasis", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7124", "submitter": "Arshiya Begum", "authors": "Arshiya Begum and Mohammed Tanveer Ali", "title": "Security threats in Prepaid Mobile", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Recent communications environment significantly expand the mobile\nenvironment.

In this paper, we introduce MAGIC, an organization\ndedicated to mentoring young females in STEM through remote methods. We conduct\na retrospective study of MAGIC's formative years and present our experience in\nremotely establishing 23 highly tailored mentor-mentee pairs. We provide\nseveral key findings on STEM remote mentoring, such as popular communication\ntools, frequently sought STEM skills among girls, and projects that could be\naccomplished through remote mentoring.
