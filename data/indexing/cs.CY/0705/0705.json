Beside others, eLearning goes with this trend as well.\nBut, while employing Internet service makes life more convenient, at the same\ntime, it raises risks with respect to the protection of the users' privacy.\nThis paper analyses the attitudes of eLearning users towards their privacy by,\ninitially, pointing out terminology and legal issues connected with privacy.\nFurther, the concept and implementation as well as a result analysis of a\nconducted study is presented, which explores the problem area from different\nperspectives. The paper will show that eLearning users indeed care for the\nprotection of their personal information when using eLearning services.\nHowever, their attitudes and behaviour slightly differ. In conclusion, we\nprovide first approaches of assisting possibilities for users how to resolve\nthe difference of requirements and their actual activities with respect to\nprivacy protection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2007 12:30:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Borcea-Pfitzmann", "Katrin", ""], ["Stange", "Anne-Katrin", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1013", "submitter": "Elizeu Santos-Neto", "authors": "Elizeu Santos-Neto, Matei Ripeanu and Adriana Iamnitchi", "title": "Tracking User Attention in Collaborative Tagging Communities", "comments": "8 pages.

These systems give users the opportunity to\nadd data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The\nresult is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent\nstudies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content\nand the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.\nThus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to\nimprove the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This\npaper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability\nin a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of\ntwo collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:\nCiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze\nthe tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define\nnew metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover\nthe structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover\nsuggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals\nwith unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.\nFinally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based\nstructure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as\ncommunities scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2007 23:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2007 19:38:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2007 19:44:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2007 05:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Santos-Neto", "Elizeu", ""], ["Ripeanu", "Matei", ""], ["Iamnitchi", "Adriana", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1761", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Tshilidzi Marwala and Monica Lagazio", "title": "Modeling and Controlling Interstate Conflict", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY", "license": null, "abstract": "  Bayesian neural networks were used to model the relationship between input\nparameters, Democracy, Allies, Contingency, Distance, Capability, Dependency\nand Major Power, and the output parameter which is either peace or conflict.\nThe automatic relevance determination was used to rank the importance of input\nvariables.

To a game developer maintaining an MMOG, recognizing,\nmonitoring, and ultimately controlling a virtual plague is important,\nregardless of how it was initiated. The prospect of using tools, methods and\ntheory from the field of epidemiology to do this seems natural and appealing.\nWe will address the feasibility of such a prospect, first by considering some\nbasic measures used in epidemiology, then by pointing out the differences\nbetween real world epidemics and virtual plagues.
