There are identified\npsychophysical basics of creating neural networks, mathematical foundations of\nneural computing and methods of neuroengineering (image recognition, in\nparticular). The role of Walter Pitts in combining the descriptive and\nquantitative theories of training is discussed. It is shown that to acquire\nneural simulation competences in the spreadsheet environment, one should master\nthe models based on the historical and genetic approach. It is indicated that\nthere are three groups of models, which are promising in terms of developing\ncorresponding methods - the continuous two-factor model of Rashevsky, the\ndiscrete model of McCulloch and Pitts, and the discrete-continuous models of\nHouseholder and Landahl.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2018 18:06:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2018 11:49:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Semerikov", "Serhiy O.", ""], ["Teplytskyi", "Illia O.", ""], ["Yechkalo", "Yuliia V.", ""], ["Kiv", "Arnold E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00035", "submitter": "Vuong M.

In the latter, crop management data analysis, based on machine\nlearning and data mining, focuses mainly on how to efficiently forecast and\nimprove crop yield. In recent years, raw and semi-processed agricultural data\nare usually collected using sensors, robots, satellites, weather stations, farm\nequipment, farmers and agribusinesses while the Internet of Things (IoT) should\ndeliver the promise of wirelessly connecting objects and devices in the\nagricultural ecosystem. Agricultural data typically captures information about\nfarming entities and operations. Every farming entity encapsulates an\nindividual farming concept, such as field, crop, seed, soil, temperature,\nhumidity, pest, and weed. Agricultural datasets are spatial, temporal, complex,\nheterogeneous, non-standardized, and very large. In particular, agricultural\ndata is considered as Big Data in terms of volume, variety, velocity and\nveracity. Designing and developing a data warehouse for precision agriculture\nis a key foundation for establishing a crop intelligence platform, which will\nenable resource efficient agronomy decision making and recommendations. Some of\nthe requirements for such an agricultural data warehouse are privacy, security,\nand real-time access among its stakeholders (e.g., farmers, farm equipment\nmanufacturers, agribusinesses, co-operative societies, customers and possibly\nGovernment agencies).

As their business activities expand rapidly, many service\ncompanies struggle to maintain customer's satisfaction due to sluggish service\nresponse caused by resource shortages. Anticipating resource shortages and\nproffering solutions before they happen is an effective way of reducing the\nadverse effect on operations.

Earlier\nmethods are typically designed to tackle only between-group unfairness, which\nmay be justified for legal or other reasons. However, we demonstrate that\nminimizing exclusively the between-group component may, in fact, increase the\nwithin-group, and hence the overall unfairness. We characterize and illustrate\nthe tradeoffs between our measures of (un)fairness and the prediction accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2018 17:05:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Speicher", "Till", "", "3 and 4"], ["Heidari", "Hoda", "", "3 and 4"], ["Grgic-Hlaca", "Nina", "", "3 and 4"], ["Gummadi", "Krishna P.", "", "3 and 4"], ["Singla", "Adish", "", "3 and 4"], ["Weller", "Adrian", "", "3 and 4"], ["Zafar", "Muhammad Bilal", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00795", "submitter": "Serhiy Semerikov", "authors": "Oksana Markova, Serhiy Semerikov and Maiia Popel", "title": "CoCalc as a Learning Tool for Neural Network Simulation in the Special\n  Course \"Foundations of Mathematic Informatics\"", "comments": "16 pages, 3 figures, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference\n  on ICT in Education, Research and Industrial Applications.

Moreover,\nthe multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich\ndata set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of\nservices.

Our goal is\nto find neighbors of an arbitrary agent or alternative in the latent space.\n  We first show that the Kendall-tau distance based kNN produces incorrect\nresults in our model. Next, we fix the problem by introducing a new algorithm\nwith features constructed from \"global information\" of the data matrix. Our\napproach is in sharp contrast to most existing feature engineering methods.\nFinally, we design another new algorithm identifying similar alternatives. The\nconstruction of alternative features can be done using \"local information,\"\nhighlighting the algorithmic difference between finding similar agents and\nsimilar alternatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 21:27:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Ao", ""], ["Wu", "Qiong", ""], ["Liu", "Zhenming", ""], ["Xia", "Lirong", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.03542", "submitter": "Hossein Sabzian", "authors": "Hossein Sabzian, Hossein Gharib, Seyyed Mostafa Seyyed Hashemi, Ali\n  Maleki", "title": "A strategic framework for identifying the critical factors of 4G\n  technology diffusion in I.R.

In this paper, we develop a novel attention-based\ndeep learning architecture, DeepDiff, that provides a unified and end-to-end\nsolution to model and to interpret how dependencies among histone modifications\ncontrol the differential patterns of gene regulation.

In fact, the past\nPresidential elections in the United States as well as those in Great Britain\n(Brexit) and in Colombia (peace agreement referendum) are proof that social\nmedia play an important part in modern politics. In fact, this digital\npolitical field is filled by political movements and political candidates\nlooking for popular support (number of followers), regular citizens' messages\ndiscussing social issues (trending topics flooding social media), or even\npolitical propaganda in favor or against politicians or political movements\n(advertisement). One of the issues with social media in this era is the\npresence of automatic accounts (bots) that artificially fill accounts with fake\nfollowers, create false trending topics, and share fake news or simply flood\nthe net with propaganda. All this artificial information may influence people\nand sometimes may even censor people's real opinions undermining their freedom\nof speech. In this paper, we propose a methodology to track elections and a set\nof tools used to collect and analyze election data. In particular, this paper\ndiscusses our experiences during the Presidential Elections in Ecuador held in\n2017. In fact, we show how all candidates prepared an online campaign in social\nmedia (Twitter) and how the political campaign altered a common follower rate\nsubscription. We discuss that the high presence of followers during the period\nbetween the first and second round of elections may be altered by automatic\naccounts. Finally, we use bot detection systems and gathered more than 30,000\npolitical motivated bots. In our data analysis, we show that these bots were\nmainly used for propaganda purposes in favor or against a particular candidate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2018 23:08:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Riofrio", "Daniel", ""], ["Ruiz", "Anacaren", ""], ["Sosebee", "Erin", ""], ["Raza", "Qasim", ""], ["Bashir", "Adnan", ""], ["Crandall", "Jed", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.06349", "submitter": "Jurek Leonhardt", "authors": "Jurek Leonhardt, Avishek Anand, Megha Khosla", "title": "User Fairness in Recommender Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3184558.3186949", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.IR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Recent works in recommendation systems have focused on diversity in\nrecommendations as an important aspect of recommendation quality.

As a third step, demographics\ninformation is extracted out of the valid users, namely gender, age, ethnicity\nand location information. Finally, the political polarity of the users with\nrespect to the analyzed event is predicted. In the scope of this work, our\nproposed pipeline is applied to two referendum scenarios (independence of\nCatalonia in Spain and autonomy of Lombardy in Italy) in order to assess the\nperformance of the approach with respect to the capability of collecting\ncorrect insights on the demographics of social media users and of predicting\nthe poll results based on the opinions shared by the users. Experiments show\nthat the method was effective in predicting the political trends for the\nCatalonia case, but not for the Lombardy case. Among the various motivations\nfor this, we noticed that in general Twitter was more representative of the\nusers opposing the referendum than the ones in favor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 07:40:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Napoli", "Roberto", ""], ["Ertugrul", "Ali Mert", ""], ["Bozzon", "Alessandro", ""], ["Brambilla", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.09766", "submitter": "Mariya Shyshkina", "authors": "Mariya Shyshkina", "title": "The General Model of the Cloud-based Learning and Research Environment\n  of Educational Personnel Training", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1807.08560", "journal-ref": "This is a preprint of a paper published in: Teaching and Learning\n  in a Digital World. - Proceedings of ICL2017. - Eds: M.E.Auer, D.Guralnick,\n  I.Simonics.

The question is whether the Second Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution gives a right to bear and own military-grade cyber\nweapons, and if so, under which conditions. The framers of the Bill of Rights,\nratified in 1791, did not limit the right to bear arms to defined weapons such\nas long rifles and pistols, but instead chose the broader word arms. The United\nStates Supreme Court, in the case District of Columbia v. Heller, upheld a\ndemarcation between dangerous and unusual weapons that are not permissible to\nown and weapons protected by the Second Amendment. Cyber weapons take the form\nof dual-use software, often shared and globally distributed that in most cases\ncan be weaponized for harmful purposes. In recent years, major corporations\nhave sought to hack back, and if the hack back is authorized, the question\nbecomes whether corporations have digital gun rights. Even if corporations are\nconsidered US persons, they do not automatically obtain digital gun rights\nbased on the Second Amendment. This article discusses the core constitutional\nchallenges for the United States government in prohibiting individual ownership\nof cyber weapons and the rationale for why corporations are in a weaker\nposition regarding ownership of cyber arms. The argument brought forward is\nthat individuals can claim Second Amendment protection of their right to own\nmilitary-grade software tools, but corporations must meet additional criteria\nto do so.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jul 2018 11:29:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2018 02:03:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kallberg", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11086", "submitter": "Sajedul Talukder", "authors": "Sajedul Talukder, Shalisha Witherspoon, Kanishk Srivastava, Ryan\n  Thompson", "title": "Mobile Technology in Healthcare Environment: Security Vulnerabilities\n  and Countermeasures", "comments": "Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile devices and technologies offer a tremendous amount of benefits to\nusers, although it is also understood that it introduces a set of challenges\nwhen it comes to security, compliance, and risks.
