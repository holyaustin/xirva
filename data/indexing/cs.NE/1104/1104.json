The number of possible paths\ngrows exponentially with the number of celestial bodies. Therefore, the design\nof an optimal multiple gravity assist (MGA) trajectory is a NP-hard mixed\ncombinatorial-continuous problem. Its automated solution would greatly improve\nthe design of future space missions, allowing the assessment of a large number\nof alternative mission options in a short time. This work proposes to formulate\nthe complete automated design of a multiple gravity assist trajectory as an\nautonomous planning and scheduling problem. The resulting scheduled plan will\nprovide the optimal planetary sequence and a good estimation of the set of\nassociated optimal trajectories. The trajectory model consists of a sequence of\ncelestial bodies connected by twodimensional transfer arcs containing one DSM.\nFor each transfer arc, the position of the planet and the spacecraft, at the\ntime of arrival, are matched by varying the pericentre of the preceding\nswing-by, or the magnitude of the launch excess velocity, for the first arc.\nFor each departure date, this model generates a full tree of possible transfers\nfrom the departure to the destination planet. Each leaf of the tree represents\na planetary encounter and a possible way to reach that planet. An algorithm\ninspired by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is devised to explore the space of\npossible plans. The ants explore the tree from departure to destination adding\none node at the time: every time an ant is at a node, a probability function is\nused to select a feasible direction.
