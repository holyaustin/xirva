The technique is applied for modelling the measured global solar\nirradiation and validated through numerical simulations. The proposed modelling\ntechnique shows improved results over the fuzzy logic and artificial neural\nnetwork (ANN) based approaches as attempted by contemporary researchers. The\nmethod proposed here results in nonlinear analytical expressions, unlike those\nwith neural networks which is essentially a black box modelling approach. This\nadditional flexibility is an advantage from the modelling perspective and helps\nto discern the important variables which affect the prediction. Due to the\nevolutionary nature of the algorithm, it is able to get out of local minima and\nconverge to a global optimum unlike the back-propagation (BP) algorithm used\nfor training neural networks. This results in a better percentage fit than the\nones obtained using neural networks by contemporary researchers. Also a\nhold-out cross validation is done on the obtained genetic programming (GP)\nresults which show that the results generalize well to new data and do not\nover-fit the training samples. The multi-gene GP results are compared with\nthose, obtained using its single-gene version and also the same with four\nclassical regression models in order to show the effectiveness of the adopted\napproach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 22:34:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Indranil", ""], ["Pandey", "Daya Shankar", ""], ["Das", "Saptarshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0778", "submitter": "Kieran Greer Dr", "authors": "Kieran Greer", "title": "Dynamic Move Chains -- a Forward Pruning Approach to Tree Search in\n  Computer Chess", "comments": "Published", "journal-ref": "Advances in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 2013, Article ID 357068,\n  9 pages, 2013.

The asymptotic\nresults suggest the following rules: $\\pi=\\sigma(1-p_C)(1-p_M)^\\ell$ should be\nslightly larger than $1$; $p_M$ should be of order $1/\\ell$; $m$ should be\nlarger than $\\ell\\ln\\ell$; the running time should be of exponential order in\n$m$. The first condition requires that $ \\ell p_M +p_C< \\ln\\sigma$. These\nconclusions must be taken with great care: they come from an asymptotic regime,\nand it is a formidable task to understand the relevance of this regime for a\nreal-world problem. At least, we hope that these conclusions provide\ninteresting guidelines for the practical implementation of the simple genetic\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Mar 2014 11:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Cerf", "Rapha\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.5488", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Collins Leke, Bhekisipho Twala, and T.

The optimization methods that are considered are genetic algorithm\n(GA), simulated annealing (SA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), random\nforest (RF) and negative selection (NS) and these methods are individually used\nin combination with auto-associative neural networks (AANN) for missing data\nestimation and the results obtained are compared. The methods suggested use the\noptimization algorithms to minimize an error function derived from training the\nauto-associative neural network during which the interrelationships between the\ninputs and the outputs are obtained and stored in the weights connecting the\ndifferent layers of the network. The error function is expressed as the square\nof the difference between the actual observations and predicted values from an\nauto-associative neural network. In the event of missing data, all the values\nof the actual observations are not known hence, the error function is\ndecomposed to depend on the known and unknown variable values. Multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) neural network is employed to train the neural networks using\nthe scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) method. Prediction accuracy is determined\nby mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute\nerror (MAE), and correlation coefficient (r) computations. Accuracy in\nclassification is obtained by plotting ROC curves and calculating the areas\nunder these. Analysis of results depicts that the approach using RF with AANN\nproduces the most accurate predictions and classifications while on the other\nend of the scale is the approach which entails using NS with AANN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Mar 2014 15:11:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Leke", "Collins", ""], ["Twala", "Bhekisipho", ""], ["Marwala", "T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6274", "submitter": "Kieran Greer Dr", "authors": "Kieran Greer", "title": "Arguments for Nested Patterns in Neural Ensembles", "comments": "Preprint", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the Science and Information Conference (SAI'14),\n  August 27-29, 2014, pp. 488 - 492", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a relatively simple way of allowing a brain model to\nself-organise its concept patterns through nested structures.

For the latter we show that\nusing crossover makes every ($\\mu$+$\\lambda$) Genetic Algorithm at least twice\nas fast as the fastest evolutionary algorithm using only standard bit mutation,\nup to small-order terms and for moderate $\\mu$ and $\\lambda$. Crossover is\nbeneficial because it effectively turns fitness-neutral mutations into\nimprovements by combining the right building blocks at a later stage. Compared\nto mutation-based evolutionary algorithms, this makes multi-bit mutations more\nuseful. Introducing crossover changes the optimal mutation rate on OneMax from\n$1/n$ to $(1+\\sqrt{5})/2 \\cdot 1/n \\approx 1.618/n$. This holds both for\nuniform crossover and $k$-point crossover.
