Only recently its study has started to draw interest from the EC\ncommunity, the first paper dealing with it having been published two years ago.\nIn this paper we will study the co-authorship network of EC at a microscopic\nlevel. Our objective is ascertaining which are the most relevant nodes (i.e.\nauthors) in it. For this purpose, we examine several metrics defined in the\ncomplex-network literature, and analyze them both in isolation and combined\nwithin a Pareto-dominance approach. The result of our analysis indicates that\nthere are some well-known researchers that appear systematically in top\nrankings. This also provides some hints on the social behavior of our\ncommunity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2007 10:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Merelo", "Juan J.", ""], ["Cotta", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.2686", "submitter": "Darko Roglic", "authors": "D.
