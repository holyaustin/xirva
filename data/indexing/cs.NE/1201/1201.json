Such models generally assume that\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons are able to interact easily, because their\naxons and dendrites are co-localized in the same small volume. However,\nquantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic\ntrees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co-localization assumption is\nnot valid. In this paper we describe a simple modification to the WTA circuit\ndesign that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled\nthrough synchronization, and so allows a single WTA to be distributed widely in\ncortical space, well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron,\nand even across different cortical areas. We prove by non-linear contraction\nanalysis, and demonstrate by simulation that distributed WTA sub-systems\ncombined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable. We show\nanalytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner\nselection. This circuit mechanism allows networks of independent WTAs to fully\nor partially compete with each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 14:16:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2012 10:22:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rutishauser", "Ueli", ""], ["Slotine", "Jean-Jacques", ""], ["Douglas", "Rodney J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.3117", "submitter": "Jose Alberto Garc\\'ia Guti\\'errez Sr.", "authors": "Jos\\'e A.
