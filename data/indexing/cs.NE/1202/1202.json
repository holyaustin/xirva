This work aims to investigate the effects of networks'\ntopological features on the dynamics of an evolutionary algorithm, considering\nin particular the ability to find a large number of optima on multi-modal\nproblems. We introduce a novel spatially-structured evolutionary algorithm and\nwe apply it on two combinatorial problems: ONEMAX and the multi-modal NMAX.\nConsidering three different network models we investigate the relationships\nbetween their features, algorithm's convergence and its ability to find\nmultiple optima (for the multi-modal problem). In order to perform a deeper\nanalysis we investigate the introduction of weighted graphs with time-varying\nweights. The results show that networks with a large Average Path Length lead\nto an higher number of optima and a consequent slow exploration dynamics (i.e.\nlow First Hitting Time). Furthermore, the introduction of weighted networks\nshows the possibility to tune algorithm's dynamics during its execution with\nthe parameter related with weights' change. This work gives a first answer\nabout the effects of various graph topologies on the diversity of evolutionary\nalgorithms and it describes a simple but powerful algorithmic framework which\nallows to investigate many aspects of ssEAs dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 12:24:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 08:03:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["De Felice", "Matteo", ""], ["Meloni", "Sandro", ""], ["Panzieri", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1643", "submitter": "Vinesh Rajpaul", "authors": "Vinesh Rajpaul", "title": "Genetic algorithms in astronomy and astrophysics", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures.

Regarding our first\ncontribution, our main source of inspiration will be the biologically plausible\nmodel of the retina called Virtual Retina. The main novelty of this coder is to\nshow that the time-dependent behavior of the retina cells could ensure, in an\nimplicit way, scalability and bit allocation. Regarding our second\ncontribution, we reconsider the inner layers of the retina. We emit a possible\ninterpretation for the non-determinism observed by neurophysiologists in their\noutput. For this sake, we model the retinal noise that occurs in these layers\nby a dither signal. The dithering process that we propose adds several\ninteresting features to our image coder. The dither noise whitens the\nreconstruction error and decorrelates it from the input stimuli. Furthermore,\nintegrating the dither noise in our coder allows a faster recognition of the\nfine details of the image during the decoding process. Our present paper goal\nis twofold. First, we aim at mimicking as closely as possible the retina for\nthe design of a novel image coder while keeping encouraging performances.\nSecond, we bring a new insight concerning the non-deterministic behavior of the\nretina.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Feb 2012 09:16:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Masmoudi", "Khaled", ""], ["Antonini", "Marc", ""], ["Kornprobst", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2523", "submitter": "Jose Alberto Garc\\'ia Guti\\'errez Sr.", "authors": "Jos\\'e A.

The methods catalogued\nin this area use the Darwinian principles of life evolution to produce\nalgorithms that returns high quality solutions to hard-to-solve optimization\nproblems. The main strength of EC is precisely that they provide good solutions\neven if the computational resources (e.g., running time) are limited. Astronomy\nand Astrophysics are two fields that often require optimizing problems of high\ncomplexity or analyzing a huge amount of data and the so-called complete\noptimization methods are inherently limited by the size of the problem/data.\nFor instance, reliable analysis of large amounts of data is central to modern\nastrophysics and astronomical sciences in general. EC techniques perform well\nwhere other optimization methods are inherently limited (as complete methods\napplied to NP-hard problems), and in the last ten years, numerous proposals\nhave come up that apply with greater or lesser success methodologies of\nevolutional computation to common engineering problems. Some of these problems,\nsuch as the estimation of non-lineal parameters, the development of automatic\nlearning techniques, the implementation of control systems, or the resolution\nof multi-objective optimization problems, have had (and have) a special\nrepercussion in the fields. For these reasons EC emerges as a feasible\nalternative for traditional methods.
