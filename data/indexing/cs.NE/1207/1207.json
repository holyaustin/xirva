In this paper, a genetic algorithm approach\nto generating contrapuntal melodies is explained, with a description of the\nvarious musical heuristics used and of how variable-length chromosome strings\nare used to avoid generating \"jerky\" rhythms and melodic phrases, as well as\nhow subjectivity is incorporated into the algorithm's fitness measures. Next,\nresults from empirical testing of the algorithm are presented, with a focus on\nhow a user's musical sophistication influences their experience. Lastly,\nfurther musical and compositional applications of the algorithm are discussed\nalong with planned future work on the algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 23:25:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jacobs", "Jeffrey Power", ""], ["Reggia", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5774", "submitter": "Lou Marvin Caraig", "authors": "Lou Marvin Caraig", "title": "A New Training Algorithm for Kanerva's Sparse Distributed Memory", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Sparse Distributed Memory proposed by Pentii Kanerva (SDM in short) was\nthought to be a model of human long term memory. The architecture of the SDM\npermits to store binary patterns and to retrieve them using partially matching\npatterns. However Kanerva's model is especially efficient only in handling\nrandom data. The purpose of this article is to introduce a new approach of\ntraining Kanerva's SDM that can handle efficiently non-random data, and to\nprovide it the capability to recognize inverted patterns. This approach uses a\nsignal model which is different from the one proposed for different purposes by\nHely, Willshaw and Hayes in [4].

These measures allow the evaluation of ULS systems and thus\ncan be used to guide their design. We evaluate the proposal with a ULS\ncomputing system provided with adaptation mechanisms. We show the evolution of\nthe system with stable and also changing workload, using different fitness\nfunctions. When the adaptive plan forces the system to converge to a predefined\nperformance level, the nodes may result in highly unstable configurations, that\ncorrespond to a high variance in time of the measured complexity. Conversely,\nif the adaptive plan is less \"aggressive\", the system may be more stable, but\nthe optimal performance may not be achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2012 21:25:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2013 14:52:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Amoretti", "Michele", ""], ["Gershenson", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6682", "submitter": "Brian Woolley", "authors": "Brian G.

Yet the pursuit of\nobjectives is ubiquitous in simulated evolution. A significant problem is that\nobjective approaches assume that intermediate stepping stones will increasingly\nresemble the final objective when in fact they often do not. The consequence is\nthat while solutions may exist, searching for such objectives may not discover\nthem. This paper highlights the importance of leveraging human insight during\nsearch as an alternative to articulating explicit objectives. In particular, a\nnew approach called novelty-assisted interactive evolutionary computation\n(NA-IEC) combines human intuition with novelty search for the first time to\nfacilitate the serendipitous discovery of agent behaviors. In this approach,\nthe human user directs evolution by selecting what is interesting from the\non-screen population of behaviors. However, unlike in typical IEC, the user can\nnow request that the next generation be filled with novel descendants. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that combining human insight with novelty\nsearch finds solutions significantly faster and at lower genomic complexities\nthan fully-automated processes, including pure novelty search, suggesting an\nimportant role for human users in the search for solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jul 2012 03:11:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Woolley", "Brian G.", ""], ["Stanley", "Kenneth O.", ""]]}]
