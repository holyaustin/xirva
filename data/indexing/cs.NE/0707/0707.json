In this work we\npropose a family of tunable fitness landscapes based on VLR of genotypes. The\nfitness landscapes we propose possess a tunable degree of both neutrality and\nepistasis; they are inspired, on the one hand by the Royal Road fitness\nlandscapes, and the other hand by the NK fitness landscapes. So these\nlandscapes offer a scale of continuity from Royal Road functions, with\nneutrality and no epistasis, to landscapes with a large amount of epistasis and\nno redundancy. To gain insight into these fitness landscapes, we first use\nstandard tools such as adaptive walks and correlation length. Second, we\nevaluate the performances of evolutionary algorithms on these landscapes for\nvarious values of the neutral and the epistatic parameters; the results allow\nus to correlate the performances with the expected degrees of neutrality and\nepistasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2007 06:57:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Platel", "Michael Defoin", "", "I3S"], ["Verel", "Sebastien", "", "I3S"], ["Clergue", "Manuel", "", "I3S"], ["Collard", "Philippe", "", "I3S"]]}, {"id": "0707.0641", "submitter": "Sebastien Verel", "authors": "S\\'ebastien Verel (I3S), Philippe Collard (I3S), Manuel Clergue (I3S)", "title": "Where are Bottlenecks in NK Fitness Landscapes?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Evolutionary Computation, 2003.

Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning\nalgorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it\nperforms remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite\nnumber of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random\nclassification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations\nclose to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This\nis to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve\nefficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse.\nFurthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden\nstates which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to\nthe standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for\nsynaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is\n`barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only\n(change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the\nsynapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible\nstates and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K\nvisible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily\nimplemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2007 16:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Baldassi", "Carlo", ""], ["Braunstein", "Alfredo", ""], ["Brunel", "Nicolas", ""], ["Zecchina", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3030", "submitter": "Matthias Brust R.", "authors": "Gregoire Danoy, Pascal Bouvry, Matthias R.
