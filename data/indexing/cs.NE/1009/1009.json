This paper proposes a new dimension\nin the way of categorization of web pages using artificial neural network (ANN)\nthrough extracting the features automatically. Here eight major categories of\nweb pages have been selected for categorization; these are business & economy,\neducation, government, entertainment, sports, news & media, job search, and\nscience. The whole process of the proposed system is done in three successive\nstages. In the first stage, the features are automatically extracted through\nanalyzing the source of the web pages. The second stage includes fixing the\ninput values of the neural network; all the values remain between 0 and 1. The\nvariations in those values affect the output. Finally the third stage\ndetermines the class of a certain web page out of eight predefined classes.\nThis stage is done using back propagation algorithm of artificial neural\nnetwork. The proposed concept will facilitate web mining, retrievals of\ninformation from the web and also the search engines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Sep 2010 07:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kamruzzaman", "S.

In this work, we introduce similar\nanalogies in the context of spiking neurons in a fixed time window, where\nexcitatory and inhibitory inputs drawn from a Poisson distribution play the\nrole of temperature. For single neurons with a \"bandgap\" between their inputs\nand the spike threshold, this temperature allows for stochastic spiking. By\nimposing a global inhibitory rhythm over the fixed time windows, we connect\nneurons into a network that exhibits synchronous, clock-like updating akin to\nneural networks. We implement a single-layer Boltzmann machine without learning\nto demonstrate our model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Sep 2010 07:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Merolla", "Paul", ""], ["Ursell", "Tristan", ""], ["Arthur", "John", ""]]}]
