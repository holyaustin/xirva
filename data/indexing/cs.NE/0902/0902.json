The model problem chosen to illustrate the\nproposed optimal design and optimal control methodologies is the one of\ngeometrically exact beam. First, we present a non-standard formulation of the\noptimal design and optimal control problems, relying on the method of Lagrange\nmultipliers in order to make the mechanics state variables independent from\neither design or control variables and thus provide the most general basis for\ndeveloping the best possible solution procedure. Two different solution\nprocedures are then explored, one based on the diffuse approximation of\nresponse function and gradient method and the other one based on genetic\nalgorithm.

The interest has been focused on\nmultimodal problems, where the difficulties of a premature convergence usually\noccurs. First the standard genetic algorithm (SGA) using binary encoding of\nreal values and its unsatisfactory behavior with multimodal problems is briefly\nreviewed together with some improvements of fighting premature convergence. Two\ntypes of real encoded methods based on differential operators are examined in\ndetail: the differential evolution (DE), a very modern and effective method\nfirstly published by R. Storn and K. Price, and the simplified real-coded\ndifferential genetic algorithm SADE proposed by the authors. In addition, an\nimprovement of the SADE method, called CERAF technology, enabling the\npopulation of solutions to escape from local extremes, is examined. All methods\nare tested on an identical set of objective functions and a systematic\ncomparison based on a reliable methodology is presented. It is confirmed that\nreal coded methods generally exhibit better behavior on real domains than the\nbinary algorithms, even when extended by several improvements. Furthermore, the\npositive influence of the differential operators due to their possibility of\nself-adaptation is demonstrated. From the reliability point of view, it seems\nthat the real encoded differential algorithm, improved by the technology\ndescribed in this paper, is a universal and reliable method capable of solving\nall proposed test problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 11:02:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hrstka", "O.", ""], ["Kucerova", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1647", "submitter": "Anna Kucerova", "authors": "O.
