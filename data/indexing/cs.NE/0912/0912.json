MANETs are highly vulnerable to attacks due to the open medium,\ndynamically changing network topology and lack of centralized monitoring point.\nIt is important to search new architecture and mechanisms to protect the\nwireless networks and mobile computing application. IDS analyze the network\nactivities by means of audit data and use patterns of well-known attacks or\nnormal profile to detect potential attacks. There are two methods to analyze:\nmisuse detection and anomaly detection. Misuse detection is not effective\nagainst unknown attacks and therefore, anomaly detection method is used. In\nthis approach, the audit data is collected from each mobile node after\nsimulating the attack and compared with the normal behavior of the system. If\nthere is any deviation from normal behavior then the event is considered as an\nattack. Some of the features of collected audit data may be redundant or\ncontribute little to the detection process. So it is essential to select the\nimportant features to increase the detection rate. This paper focuses on\nimplementing two feature selection methods namely, markov blanket discovery and\ngenetic algorithm. In genetic algorithm, bayesian network is constructed over\nthe collected features and fitness function is calculated. Based on the fitness\nvalue the features are selected. Markov blanket discovery also uses bayesian\nnetwork and the features are selected depending on the minimum description\nlength. During the evaluation phase, the performances of both approaches are\ncompared based on detection rate and false alarm rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2009 10:57:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2010 09:00:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nallusamy", "R.", ""], ["Jayarajan", "K.", ""], ["Duraiswamy", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3960", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "M.
