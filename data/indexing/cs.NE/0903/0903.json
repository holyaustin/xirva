This results in contention for resources and sub-optimal schedules.\nMeta-scheduling in grids aims to address this scheduling problem, which is NP\nhard due to its combinatorial nature. Thus, many heuristic-based solutions\nusing Genetic Algorithm (GA) have been proposed, apart from traditional\nalgorithms such as Greedy and FCFS.\n  We propose a Linear Programming/Integer Programming model (LP/IP) for\nscheduling these applications to multiple resources. We also propose a novel\nalgorithm LPGA (Linear programming driven Genetic Algorithm) which combines the\ncapabilities of LP and GA. The aim of this algorithm is to obtain the best\nmetaschedule for utility grids which minimize combined cost of all users in a\ncoordinated manner. Simulation results show that our proposed integrated\nalgorithm offers the best schedule having the minimum processing cost with\nnegligible time overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Mar 2009 04:53:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Garg", "Saurabh", ""], ["Konugurthi", "Pramod", ""], ["Buyya", "Rajkumar", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2516", "submitter": "Susan Khor", "authors": "Susan Khor", "title": "Effect of Degree Distribution on Evolutionary Search", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a method to generate hierarchically modular networks\nwith prescribed node degree list and proposes a metric to measure network\nmodularity based on the notion of edge distance.

Results from the\nexperiments (i) confirm a previous finding that modularity increases the\nperformance advantage of genetic algorithms over hill climbers, and (ii)\nsupport a new conjecture that test problems with modularized constraint\nnetworks having heavy-tailed right-skewed degree distributions are more easily\nsolved than test problems with modularized constraint networks having\nbell-shaped normal degree distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2009 00:18:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Khor", "Susan", ""]]}]
