In this\npaper we hone in on a more fundamental cause for skepticism--the extraordinary\nstrength of some of the assumptions that undergird the BBH. Specifically, we\nfocus on assumptions made about the distribution of fitness over the genome\nset, and argue that these assumptions are unacceptably strong. As most of these\nassumptions have been embraced by the designers of so-called \"competent\"\ngenetic algorithms, our critique is relevant to an appraisal of such algorithms\nas well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Oct 2008 00:38:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Burjorjee", "Keki", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3357", "submitter": "Keki Burjorjee", "authors": "Keki M.

In this paper we distinguish between a computational competency\nof the SGA--an efficient, but narrow computational ability--and a computational\nproficiency of the SGA--a computational ability that is both efficient and\nbroad. Till date, attempts to deduce a computational proficiency of the SGA\nhave been unsuccessful. It may, however, be possible to inductively infer a\ncomputational proficiency of the SGA from a set of related computational\ncompetencies that have been deduced. With this in mind we deduce two\ncomputational competencies of the SGA. These competencies, when considered\ntogether, point toward a remarkable computational proficiency of the SGA. This\nproficiency is pertinent to a general problem that is closely related to a\nwell-known statistical problem at the cutting edge of computational genetics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Oct 2008 01:08:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2009 21:48:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Burjorjee", "Keki M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3484", "submitter": "Sebastien Verel", "authors": "Gabriela Ochoa, Marco Tomassini (ISI), S\\'ebastien Verel (I3S),\n  Christian Darabos (ISI)", "title": "A Study of NK Landscapes' Basins and Local Optima Networks", "comments": "best paper nomination", "journal-ref": "Genetic And Evolutionary Computation Conference, Atlanta :\n  \\'Etats-Unis d'Am\\'erique (2008)", "doi": "10.1145/1389095.1389204", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a network characterization of combinatorial fitness landscapes by\nadapting the notion of inherent networks proposed for energy surfaces (Doye,\n2002).
