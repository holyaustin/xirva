However, the standard XCS has no\nmemory mechanism and can only learn optimal policy in Markov environments,\nwhere the optimal action is determined solely by the state of current sensory\ninput. In practice, most environments are partially observable environments on\nagent's sensation, which are also known as non-Markov environments. Within\nthese environments, XCS either fails, or only develops a suboptimal policy,\nsince it has no memory. In this work, we develop a new classifier system based\non XCS to tackle this problem. It adds an internal message list to XCS as the\nmemory list to record input sensation history, and extends a small number of\nclassifiers with memory conditions. The classifier's memory condition, as a\nfoothold to disambiguate non-Markov states, is used to sense a specified\nelement in the memory list. Besides, a detection method is employed to\nrecognize non-Markov states in environments, to avoid these states controlling\nover classifiers' memory conditions. Furthermore, four sets of different\ncomplex maze environments have been tested by the proposed method. Experimental\nresults show that our system is one of the best techniques to solve partially\nobservable environments, compared with some well-known classifier systems\nproposed for these environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2012 11:40:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zang", "Zhaoxiang", ""], ["Li", "Dehua", ""], ["Wang", "Junying", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.0660", "submitter": "Yukihiro Kamada", "authors": "Yukihiro Kamada and Kiyonori Miyasaki", "title": "Generation of Two-Layer Monotonic Functions", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of implementing a class of functions with particular conditions\nby using monotonic multilayer functions is considered.

The algorithm mimics the principles of bat sonar in finding\nits targets. The algorithm introduces three search approaches. The first search\napproach considers a single sonar unit (SSU) with a fixed beam length and a\nsingle starting point. In this approach, although the results converge toward\nthe optimum fitness, it is not guaranteed to find the global optimum solution\nespecially for complex problems; it is satisfied with finding 'acceptably good'\nsolutions to these problems. The second approach considers multisonar units\n(MSU) working in parallel in the same state space. Each unit has its own\nstarting point and tries to find the optimum solution. In this approach the\nprobability that the algorithm converges toward the optimum solution is\nsignificantly increased. It is found that this approach is suitable for complex\nfunctions and for problems of wide state space. In the third approach, a single\nsonar unit with a moment (SSM) is used in order to handle the problem of\nconvergence toward a local optimum rather than a global optimum. The momentum\nterm is added to the length of the transmitted beams. This will give the chance\nto find the best fitness in a wider range within the state space. In this paper\na comparison between the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) has been\nmade. It showed that both of the algorithms can catch approximately the optimum\nsolutions for all of the testbed functions except for the function that has a\nlocal minimum, in which the proposed algorithm's result is much better than\nthat of the GA algorithm.

However, due to the large\ninter-individual variation in the response to Warfarin therapy, it is difficult\nto identify which patients will reach the narrow therapeutic window for target\nINR, and which will be above or below the therapeutic window. The aim of this\nresearch was to develop a methodology using a neural networks classification\nalgorithm and data mining techniques to predict for a given loading dose and\npatient characteristics if the patient is more likely to achieve target INR or\nmore likely to be above or below therapeutic range.\n  Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 10-fold stratified cross validation\nalgorithms were used to determine an artificial neural network to classify\npatients' response to their initial Warfarin loading dose.
