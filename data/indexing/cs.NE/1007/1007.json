The chosen architecture uses a\nreinforcement learning-assisted genetic algorithm to evolve the epuck\nbehaviours, which are encoded as a genetic sequence. This sequence is then used\nby the Pioneers as part of an adaptive, idiotypic artificial immune system\n(AIS) control architecture. Testing in three different simulated worlds shows\nthat the Pioneer can use these behaviours to navigate and solve object-tracking\ntasks successfully, as long as its adaptive AIS mechanism is in place.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jun 2010 09:57:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Whitbrook", "Amanda", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Garibaldi", "Jonathan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0417", "submitter": "Krishna Lingashetty", "authors": "Krishna Chaithanya Lingashetty", "title": "Delta Learning Rule for the Active Sites Model", "comments": "12 Pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper reports the results on methods of comparing the memory retrieval\ncapacity of the Hebbian neural network which implements the B-Matrix approach,\nby using the Widrow-Hoff rule of learning.
