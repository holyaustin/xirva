One cardiac cycle in an ECG signal consists of the P-QRS-T\nwaves. This feature extraction scheme determines the amplitudes and intervals\nin the ECG signal for subsequent analysis. The amplitudes and intervals value\nof P-QRS-T segment determines the functioning of heart of every human.\nRecently, numerous research and techniques have been developed for analyzing\nthe ECG signal. The proposed schemes were mostly based on Fuzzy Logic Methods,\nArtificial Neural Networks (ANN), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Support Vector\nMachines (SVM), and other Signal Analysis techniques. All these techniques and\nalgorithms have their advantages and limitations. This proposed paper discusses\nvarious techniques and transformations proposed earlier in literature for\nextracting feature from an ECG signal. In addition this paper also provides a\ncomparative study of various methods proposed by researchers in extracting the\nfeature from ECG signal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 May 2010 09:54:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Karpagachelvi", "S.", ""], ["Arthanari", "M.", ""], ["Sivakumar", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0965", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Bikrampal Kaur, Himanshu Aggarwal", "title": "Artificial Neural Network based Diagnostic Model For Causes of Success\n  and Failures", "comments": "IEEE Publication format, International Journal of Computer Science\n  and Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 8 No. 1, April 2010, USA.

The\nfocus of the study is on the mobile -communication industry of India. The ANN\nbased approach is particularly important because conventional approaches (such\nas algorithmic) to the problem solving have their inherent disadvantages. The\nalgorithmic approach is well-suited to the problems that are well-understood\nand known solution(s). On the other hand the ANNs have learning by example and\nprocessing capabilities similar to that of a human brain. ANN has been followed\ndue to its inherent advantage over conversion algorithmic like approaches and\nhaving capabilities, training and human like intuitive decision making\ncapabilities. Therefore, this ANN based approach is likely to help researchers\nand organizations to reach a better solution to the problem of managing the\nhuman resource. The study is particularly important as many studies have been\ncarried in developed countries but there is a shortage of such studies in\ndeveloping nations like India. Here, a model has been derived using\nconnectionist-ANN approach and improved and verified via back-propagation\nalgorithm. This suggested ANN based model can be used for testing the success\nand failure human factors in any of the communication Industry. Results have\nbeen obtained on the basis of connectionist model, which has been further\nrefined by BPNN to an accuracy of 99.99%. Any company to predict failure due to\nHR factors can directly deploy this model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 May 2010 10:22:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kaur", "Bikrampal", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Himanshu", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1252", "submitter": "Grigory Litvinov", "authors": "G.

Two measures of creativity were used:\n(1) invention-to-imitation ratio, iLeader, which measures how often an agent\ninvents, and (2) rate of conceptual change, cLeader, which measures how\ncreative an invention is. High iLeader increased mean fitness of ideas, but\nonly when creativity of followers was low. High iLeader was associated with\ngreater diversity of ideas in the early stage of idea generation only. High\ncLeader increased mean fitness of ideas in the early stage of idea generation;\nin the later stage it decreased idea fitness. Reasons for these findings and\ntentative implications for creative leadership in human society are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 May 2010 12:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 00:44:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 21:00:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 19:56:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Leijnen", "Stefan", ""], ["Gabora", "Liane", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3390", "submitter": "Raphael Cerf", "authors": "Rapha\\\"el Cerf", "title": "Critical control of a genetic algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on speculations coming from statistical mechanics and the conjectured\nexistence of critical states, I propose a simple heuristic in order to control\nthe mutation probability and the population size of a genetic algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2010 09:29:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cerf", "Rapha\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.4285", "submitter": "Leonid Litinskii", "authors": "Yakov Karandashev, Boris Kryzhanovsky, and Leonid Litinskii", "title": "Local Minima of a Quadratic Binary Functional with Quasi-Hebbian\n  Connection Matrix", "comments": "10 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The local minima of a quadratic functional depending on binary variables are\ndiscussed.
