How to select the significant biomarkers from\nhundreds of protein markers is a key step in survival analysis. In this paper a\nnovel method is proposed to detect the prognostic biomarkers of survival in\ncolorectal cancer patients using wavelet analysis, genetic algorithm, and Bayes\nclassifier. One dimensional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is normally used\nto reduce the dimensionality of biomedical data. In this study one dimensional\ncontinuous wavelet transform (CWT) was proposed to extract the features of\ncolorectal cancer data. One dimensional CWT has no ability to reduce\ndimensionality of data, but captures the missing features of DWT, and is\ncomplementary part of DWT. Genetic algorithm was performed on extracted wavelet\ncoefficients to select the optimized features, using Bayes classifier to build\nits fitness function. The corresponding protein markers were located based on\nthe position of optimized features. Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression model\nwere used to evaluate the performance of selected biomarkers. Experiments were\nconducted on colorectal cancer dataset and several significant biomarkers were\ndetected. A new protein biomarker CD46 was found to significantly associate\nwith survival time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 15:53:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yihui", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Feyereisl", "Jan", ""], ["Durrant", "Lindy G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7476", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Feng Gu, Julie Greensmith, Uwe Aickelin", "title": "Theoretical formulation and analysis of the deterministic dendritic cell\n  algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Biosystems 111 (2), 127-135, 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As one of the emerging algorithms in the field of Artificial Immune Systems\n(AIS), the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA) has been successfully applied to a\nnumber of challenging real-world problems. However, one criticism is the lack\nof a formal definition, which could result in ambiguity for understanding the\nalgorithm. Moreover, previous investigations have mainly focused on its\nempirical aspects. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a formal definition of\nthe algorithm, as well as to perform runtime analyses to revealits theoretical\naspects. In this paper, we define the deterministic version of the DCA, named\nthe dDCA, using set theory and mathematical functions. Runtime analyses of the\nstandard algorithm and the one with additional segmentation are performed. Our\nanalysis suggests that the standard dDCA has a runtime complexity of O(n2) for\nthe worst-case scenario, where n is the number of input data instances. The\nintroduction of segmentation changes the algorithm's worst case runtime\ncomplexity to O(max(nN; nz)), for DC population size N with size of each\nsegment z. Finally, two runtime variables of the algorithm are formulated based\non the input data, to understand its runtime behaviour as guidelines for\nfurther development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 16:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Feng", ""], ["Greensmith", "Julie", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""]]}]
