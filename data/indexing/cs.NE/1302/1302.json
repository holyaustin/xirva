Unlike most candidate explanations,\nthis paper proposes that increasing evolvability can result without any\npressure to adapt. The insight is that if evolvability is heritable, then an\nunbiased drifting process across genotypes can still create a distribution of\nphenotypes biased towards evolvability, because evolvable organisms diffuse\nmore quickly through the space of possible phenotypes. Furthermore, because\nphenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may\non average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a\ngenotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these\ntwo mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to\nout-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series\nof simulated models. Thus rather than from pressure to adapt, evolvability may\ninevitably result from any drift through genotypic space combined with\nevolution's passive tendency to accumulate niches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 18:14:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lehman", "Joel", ""], ["Stanley", "Kenneth O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.1156", "submitter": "Amir Hesam Salavati", "authors": "Amir Hesam Salavati, K.

Sectoral pollution loads\n(ton/yr) into different media (i.e. air, water and land) in Lagos were\nestimated using Industrial Pollution Projected System (IPPS). These were\nfurther studied using Artificial neural Networks (ANNs), a data mining\ntechnique that has the ability of detecting and describing patterns in large\ndata sets with variables that are non- linearly related. Time Lagged Recurrent\nNetwork (TLRN) appeared as the best Neural Network model among all the neural\nnetworks considered which includes Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Network,\nGeneralized Feed Forward Neural Network (GFNN), Radial Basis Function (RBF)\nNetwork and Recurrent Network (RN). TLRN modelled the data-sets better than the\nothers in terms of the mean average error (MAE) (0.14), time (39 s) and linear\ncorrelation coefficient (0.84). The results showed that Artificial Neural\nNetworks (ANNs) technique (i.e., Time Lagged Recurrent Network) is also\napplicable and effective in environmental assessment study.

A recent\naddition to these techniques are the Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques\nwhich, in most cases, are nature or biologically inspired techniques. Different\nCI techniques found their way to many control engineering applications,\nincluding system identification, and the results obtained by many researchers\nwere encouraging. However, most control engineers and researchers used the\nbasic CI models as is or slightly modified them to match their needs.\nHenceforth, the merits of one model over the other was not clear, and full\npotential of these models was not exploited.\n  In this research, Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization\n(PSO) methods, which are different CI techniques, are modified to best suit the\nmultimodal problem of system identification. In the first case of GA, an\nextension to the basic algorithm, which is inspired from nature as well, was\ndeployed by introducing redundant genetic material. This extension, which come\nin handy in living organisms, did not result in significant performance\nimprovement to the basic algorithm. In the second case, the Clubs-based PSO\n(C-PSO) dynamic neighborhood structure was introduced to replace the basic\nstatic structure used in canonical PSO algorithms. This modification of the\nneighborhood structure resulted in significant performance of the algorithm\nregarding convergence speed, and equipped it with a tool to handle multimodal\nproblems.\n  To understand the suitability of different GA and PSO techniques in the\nproblem of system identification, they were used in an induction motor's\nparameter identification problem. The results enforced previous conclusions and\nshowed the superiority of PSO in general over the GA in such a multimodal\nproblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 06:32:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Elshamy", "Wesam", ""]]}]
