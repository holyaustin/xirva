Thus given an incomplete or corrupted version of a stored image, the\nnetwork is able to recall the corresponding original image. The storing of the\nobjects has been performed according to the Hopfield algorithm explained below.\nOnce the net has completely learnt this set of input patterns, a set of testing\npatterns containing degraded images will be given to the net. Then the Hopfield\nnet will tend to recall the closest matching pattern for the given degraded\nimage.

To prove this\nassessment, we have performed a number of experiments with cellular automata of\ncomplex behavior, which can be considered as universes in the mathematical\nmultiverse. The analogy between what happens in some automata (in particular\nConway's <<Game of Life>>) and the real world is very strong.

In this paper\nwe will check several different, and difficult, problems, and see what effects\nthe automatic load-balancing and asynchrony have on the speed of resolution of\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 08:55:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Merelo", "Juan-J.", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Arenas", "Maribel", ""], ["Mora", "Antonio M.", ""], ["Castillo", "Pedro", ""], ["Romero", "Gustavo", ""], ["Laredo", "JLJ", ""]]}]
