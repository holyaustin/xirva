In particular\nthere has been considerable interest in their use in tackling problems arising\nin the areas of scheduling and timetabling. However, the classical genetic\nalgorithm paradigm is not well equipped to handle constraints and successful\nimplementations usually require some sort of modification to enable the search\nto exploit problem specific knowledge in order to overcome this shortcoming.\nThis paper is concerned with the development of a family of genetic algorithms\nfor the solution of a nurse rostering problem at a major UK hospital. The\nhospital is made up of wards of up to 30 nurses. Each ward has its own group of\nnurses whose shifts have to be scheduled on a weekly basis. In addition to\nfulfilling the minimum demand for staff over three daily shifts, nurses' wishes\nand qualifications have to be taken into account. The schedules must also be\nseen to be fair, in that unpopular shifts have to be spread evenly amongst all\nnurses, and other restrictions, such as team nursing and special conditions for\nsenior staff, have to be satisfied. The basis of the family of genetic\nalgorithms is a classical genetic algorithm consisting of n-point crossover,\nsingle-bit mutation and a rank-based selection. The solution space consists of\nall schedules in which each nurse works the required number of shifts, but the\nremaining constraints, both hard and soft, are relaxed and penalised in the\nfitness function. The talk will start with a detailed description of the\nproblem and the initial implementation and will go on to highlight the\nshortcomings of such an approach, in terms of the key element of balancing\nfeasibility, i.e. covering the demand and work regulations, and quality, as\nmeasured by the nurses' preferences. A series of experiments involving\nparameter adaptation, niching, intelligent weights, delta coding, local hill\nclimbing, migration and special selection rules will then be outlined and it\nwill be shown how a series of these enhancements were able to eradicate these\ndifficulties. Results based on several months' real data will be used to\nmeasure the impact of each modification, and to show that the final algorithm\nis able to compete with a tabu search approach currently employed at the\nhospital.
