In this paper we shall introduce a novel approach to\ncompute risk functions by using a combination of a highly non-linear processing\nmodel in conjunction with a powerful information encoding procedure.\nSpecifically, the elements of information either static or dynamic that appear\nin a road intersection scene are encoded by using directed positional acyclic\nlabeled graphs. The risk assessment problem is then reformulated in terms of an\ninductive learning task carried out by a recursive neural network. Recursive\nneural networks are connectionist models capable of solving supervised and\nnon-supervised learning problems represented by directed ordered acyclic\ngraphs. The potential of this novel approach is demonstrated through well\npredefined scenarios. The major difference of our approach compared to others\nis expressed by the fact of learning the structure of the risk. Furthermore,\nthe combination of a rich information encoding procedure with a generalized\nmodel of dynamical recurrent networks permit us, as we shall demonstrate, a\nsophisticated processing of information that we believe as being a first step\nfor building future advanced intersection safety systems\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2007 11:53:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["De Lara", "Alejandro Chinea Manrique", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Parent", "Michel", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "0705.1214", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "title": "Control of Complex Systems Using Bayesian Networks and Genetic Algorithm", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NE", "license": null, "abstract": "  A method based on Bayesian neural networks and genetic algorithm is proposed\nto control the fermentation process.
