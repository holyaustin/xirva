The associated\nmathematical framework can be used to solve constrained optimization problems.\nThis is done by translating the problem into an iterated game, where each agent\ncontrols a different variable of the problem, so that the joint probability\ndistribution across the agents' moves gives an expected value of the objective\nfunction. The dynamics of the agents is designed to minimize a Lagrangian\nfunction of that joint distribution. Here we illustrate how the updating of the\nLagrange parameters in the Lagrangian is a form of automated annealing, which\nfocuses the joint distribution more and more tightly about the joint moves that\noptimize the objective function. We then investigate the use of\n``semicoordinate'' variable transformations. These separate the joint state of\nthe agents from the variables of the optimization problem, with the two\nconnected by an onto mapping. We present experiments illustrating the ability\nof such transformations to facilitate optimization. We focus on the special\nkind of transformation in which the statistically independent states of the\nagents induces a mixture distribution over the optimization variables. Computer\nexperiment illustrate this for $k$-sat constraint satisfaction problems and for\nunconstrained minimization of $NK$ functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 21:35:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Macready", "William", ""], ["Wolpert", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0980", "submitter": "Thimo Rohlf", "authors": "Thimo Rohlf and Stefan Bornholdt", "title": "Self-organized criticality and adaptation in discrete dynamical networks", "comments": "35 pages, 19 figures.

Here, we\nreview models of evolving dynamical networks that lead to self-organization of\nnetwork topology based on a local coupling between a dynamical order parameter\nand rewiring of network connectivity, with convergence towards criticality in\nthe limit of large network size $N$. In particular, two adaptive schemes are\ndiscussed and compared in the context of Boolean Networks and Threshold\nNetworks: 1) Active nodes loose links, frozen nodes aquire new links, 2) Nodes\nwith correlated activity connect, de-correlated nodes disconnect. These simple\nlocal adaptive rules lead to co-evolution of network topology and -dynamics.\nAdaptive networks are strikingly different from random networks: They evolve\ninhomogeneous topologies and broad plateaus of homeostatic regulation,\ndynamical activity exhibits $1/f$ noise and attractor periods obey a scale-free\ndistribution. The proposed co-evolutionary mechanism of topological\nself-organization is robust against noise and does not depend on the details of\ndynamical transition rules. Using finite-size scaling, it is shown that\nnetworks converge to a self-organized critical state in the thermodynamic\nlimit. Finally, we discuss open questions and directions for future research,\nand outline possible applications of these models to adaptive systems in\ndiverse areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Nov 2008 16:04:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Rohlf", "Thimo", ""], ["Bornholdt", "Stefan", ""]]}]
