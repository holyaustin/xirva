Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the Computer- Aided-\nDiagnosis tools which are used extensively by advances in computer hardware\ntechnology. The application of these techniques for disease diagnosis has made\ngreat progress and is widely used by physicians. An Electrocardiogram carries\nvital information about heart activity and physicians use this signal for\ncardiac disease diagnosis which was the great motivation towards our study.\nMethods: In this study we are using Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) as an\nautomatic technique for ECG signal analysis along with a Genetic Algorithm\n(GA). As every real signal recorded by the equipment can have different\nartifacts, we need to do some preprocessing steps before feeding it to the ANN.\nWavelet transform is used for extracting the morphological parameters and\nmedian filter for data reduction of the ECG signal. The subset of morphological\nparameters are chosen and optimized using GA. We had two approaches in our\ninvestigation, the first one uses the whole signal with 289 normalized and\nde-noised data points as input to the ANN. In the second approach after\napplying all the preprocessing steps the signal is reduced to 29 data points\nand also their important parameters extracted to form the ANN input with 35\ndata points. Results: The outcome of the two approaches for 8 types of\narrhythmia shows that the second approach is superior than the first one with\nan average accuracy of %99.42.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2012 11:29:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 07:59:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2012 08:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bazarghan", "M.", ""], ["Jaberi", "Y.", ""], ["Amandi", "R.", ""], ["Abedi", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0514", "submitter": "Roman Belavkin", "authors": "Roman V.

Much biological theory in this area\nis based on Ronald Fisher's work, who used Euclidean geometry to study the\nrelation between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring in\ninfinite phenotypic spaces. Here we reconsider this theory based on the\nalternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA sequences. First, we\nconsider the geometric case of fitness being isomorphic to distance from an\noptimum, and show how problems of optimal mutation rate control can be solved\nexactly or approximately depending on additional constraints of the problem.\nThen we consider the general case of fitness communicating only partial\ninformation about the distance. We define weak monotonicity of fitness\nlandscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are\ncontinuous and open at the optimum. This theoretical result motivates our\nhypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions in such landscapes will\nincrease when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling\nthe control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis\nexperimentally by analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control\nfunctions in 115 complete landscapes of binding scores between DNA sequences\nand transcription factors. Our findings support the hypothesis and find that\nthe increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less\nmonotonic (more rugged).

While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental\nto the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently\ncritical to evaluating a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these\nparameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new\nproblem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal\nexperience and intuition in ways that are hard to describe. Since the\nperformance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the\nalgorithm and the details of its tuning, it can be difficult to determine\nwhether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.\n  In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyper\nparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools to replace\nhand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach\nis to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g.\nclassification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from parameters\nthat govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even\nwhich processing steps are included. A hyper parameter optimization algorithm\ntransforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric.\nOur approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision\nproblems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task\n(PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single algorithm.\nMore broadly, we argue that the formalization of a meta-model supports more\nobjective, reproducible, and quantitative evaluation of computer vision\nalgorithms, and that it can serve as a valuable tool for guiding algorithm\ndevelopment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Sep 2012 20:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "J.", ""], ["Yamins", "D.", ""], ["Cox", "D.

In practice, the regularity assumption\nmay be violated. To avoid such a singularity, we propose a new projection\nmatrix, based on which a feasible point method for the continuous-time,\nequality-constrained optimization problem is developed. First, the equality\nconstraint is transformed into a continuous-time dynamical system with\nsolutions that always satisfy the equality constraint. Then, the singularity is\nexplained in detail and a new projection matrix is proposed to avoid\nsingularity. An update (or say a controller) is subsequently designed to\ndecrease the objective function along the solutions of the transformed system.\nThe invariance principle is applied to analyze the behavior of the solution. We\nalso propose a modified approach for addressing cases in which solutions do not\nsatisfy the equality constraint. Finally, the proposed optimization approaches\nare applied to two examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2012 10:26:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Jan 2014 04:31:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Quan", "Quan", ""], ["Cai", "Kai-Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5339", "submitter": "Hassan Ismkhan", "authors": "Hassan Ismkhan, Kamran Zamanifar", "title": "Developing Improved Greedy Crossover to Solve Symmetric Traveling\n  Salesman Problem", "comments": "International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Volume 9, Issue 4,\n  No 3, July 2012", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous optimization\nproblems.
