In this paper, we present, discuss and analyse a technique called\nEvolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation and apply it to two different personnel\nscheduling problems. Evolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation improves the\noriginal Squeaky Wheel Optimisation's effectiveness and execution speed by\nincorporating two extra steps (Selection and Mutation) for added evolution. In\nthe Evolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation, a cycle of\nAnalysis-Selection-Mutation-Prioritization-Construction continues until\nstopping conditions are reached. The aim of the Analysis step is to identify\nbelow average solution components by calculating a fitness value for all\ncomponents. The Selection step then chooses amongst these underperformers and\ndiscards some probabilistically based on fitness. The Mutation step further\ndiscards a few components at random. Solutions can become incomplete and thus\nrepairs may be required. The repairs are carried out by using the\nPrioritization to first produce priorities that determine an order by which the\nfollowing Construction step then schedules the remaining components. Therefore,\nimprovement in the Evolutionary Squeaky Wheel Optimisation is achieved by\nselective solution disruption mixed with interative improvement and\nconstructive repair.
