In this paper,\nwe present a new approach to find global optimal point with the low computation\nand few steps using subdividing labeling method (SLM) which can also be used in\nthe multi-dimensional and great search space. In this approach, in each step,\ncrossing points will be labeled and complete label polytope search space of\nselected polytope will be subdivided after being selected. SLM algorithm finds\nthe global point until h (subdivision function) turns into zero. SLM will be\nimplemented on five applications and compared with the latest techniques such\nas random search, random search-walk and simulated annealing method. The\nresults of the proposed method demonstrate that our new approach is faster and\nmore reliable and presents an optimal time complexity O (logn).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jul 2013 12:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Vali", "Masoumeh", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.5840", "submitter": "Masoumeh Vali", "authors": "Masoumeh Vali", "title": "Sub- Diving Labeling Method for Optimization Problem by Genetic\n  Algorithm", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1307.5667,\n  arXiv:1307.5679, arXiv:1307.5838", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In many global Optimization Problems, it is required to evaluate a global\npoint (min or max) in large space that calculation effort is very high.
