However, the design of its operators makes it unsuitable for\nmany real-life constrained combinatorial optimization problems which operate on\nbinary space. On the other hand, the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm\n(QEA) is very well suitable for handling such problems by applying several\nquantum computing techniques such as Q-bit representation and rotation gate\noperator, etc. This paper extends the concept of differential operators with\nadaptive parameter control to the quantum paradigm and proposes the adaptive\nquantum-inspired differential evolution algorithm (AQDE). The performance of\nAQDE is found to be significantly superior as compared to QEA and a discrete\nversion of DE on the standard 0-1 knapsack problem for all the considered test\ncases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Jan 2011 18:26:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hota", "Ashish Ranjan", ""], ["Pat", "Ankit", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0776", "submitter": "Benjamin Doerr", "authors": "Benjamin Doerr, Daniel Johannsen, Carola Winzen", "title": "Multiplicative Drift Analysis", "comments": "Contains results from our GECCO 2010 and CEC 2010 conference paper", "journal-ref": "Algorithmica, 2012, Volume 64, Issue 4, pp 673-697", "doi": "10.1007/s00453-012-9622-x", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we introduce multiplicative drift analysis as a suitable way to\nanalyze the runtime of randomized search heuristics such as evolutionary\nalgorithms.\n  We give a multiplicative version of the classical drift theorem.

Here, we first give a relatively simple proof for the fact that any\nlinear function is optimized in expected time $O(n \\log n)$, where $n$ is the\nlength of the bit string.

We also prove a corresponding lower bound\nof ${(1-o(1))e n\\ln(n)}$ which actually holds for all functions with a unique\nglobal optimum.\n  We further demonstrate how our drift theorem immediately gives natural proofs\n(with better constants) for the best known runtime bounds for the (1+1)\nEvolutionary Algorithm on combinatorial problems like finding minimum spanning\ntrees, shortest paths, or Euler tours.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jan 2011 17:44:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Doerr", "Benjamin", ""], ["Johannsen", "Daniel", ""], ["Winzen", "Carola", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4445", "submitter": "Santosh Singh", "authors": "Santosh Kumar Singh, Gajendra Singh, Vibhakar Pathak and Dr. Krishna\n  Chandra Roy", "title": "Spectrum Management for Cognitive Radio based on Genetics Algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spectrum scarceness is one of the major challenges that the present world is\nfacing.
