Using a computational model of\ncultural evolution in which neural network based agents evolve ideas for\nactions through invention and imitation, we tested the hypothesis that human\ncreativity began with onset of the capacity for recursive recall. We compared\nruns in which agents were limited to single-step actions to runs in which they\nused recursive recall to chain simple actions into complex ones. Chaining\nresulted in higher diversity, open-ended novelty, no ceiling on the mean\nfitness of actions, and greater ability to make use of learning. Using a\ncomputational model of portrait painting, we tested the hypothesis that the\nexplosion of creativity in the Middle/Upper Paleolithic was due to onset of\ncon-textual focus: the capacity to shift between associative and analytic\nthought. This resulted in faster convergence on portraits that resembled the\nsitter, employed painterly techniques, and were rated as preferable.
