In this paper we explain why a theory\nwhich can accurately explain the simple genetic algorithm's remarkable capacity\nfor adaptation has the potential to address both these limitations. We describe\nwhat we believe to be the impediments -- historic and analytic -- to the\ndiscovery of such a theory and highlight the negative role that the building\nblock hypothesis (BBH) has played. We argue based on experimental results that\na fundamental limitation which is widely believed to constrain the SGA's\nadaptive ability (and is strongly implied by the BBH) is in fact illusionary\nand does not exist. The SGA therefore turns out to be more powerful than it is\ncurrently thought to be. We give conditions under which it becomes feasible to\nnumerically approximate and study the multivariate marginals of the search\ndistribution of an infinite population SGA over multiple generations even when\nits genomes are long, and explain why this analysis is relevant to the riddle\nof the SGA's remarkable adaptive abilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Nov 2007 02:28:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Apr 2009 15:28:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Burjorjee", "Keki", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2478", "submitter": "Vasileios Barmpoutis", "authors": "Vasileios Barmpoutis, Gary F.

The rule\nmethodology and the neighborhood structure employ elements from the Cellular\nAutomata (CA) strategies. Each member of the GA population is assigned to a\ncell and crossover takes place only between adjacent cells, according to the\npredefined rule. Although combinations of CA and GA approaches have appeared\npreviously, here we rely on the inherent self-organizing features of CA, rather\nthan on parallelism. This conceptual shift directs us toward the evolution of\ncompact populations containing only a handful of members. We find that the\nresulting algorithm can search the design space more efficiently than\ntraditional GA strategies due to its ability to exploit mutations within this\ncompact self-organizing population. Consequently, premature convergence is\navoided and the final results often are more accurate. In order to reinforce\nthe superior mutation capability, a re-initialization strategy also is\nimplemented. Ten test functions and two benchmark structural engineering truss\ndesign problems are examined in order to demonstrate the performance of the\nmethod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2007 18:19:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Barmpoutis", "Vasileios", ""], ["Dargush", "Gary F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2897", "submitter": "Michael Tung M.", "authors": "J.

The overall approach learns by building a\nprobabilistic model, i.e. an estimation of the probability distribution of\nindividual nurse-rule pairs that are used to construct schedules. The local\nsearch processor (i.e. the ant-miner) reinforces nurse-rule pairs that receive\nhigher rewards. A challenging real world nurse rostering problem is used as the\ntest problem. Computational results show that the proposed approach outperforms\nmost existing approaches.
