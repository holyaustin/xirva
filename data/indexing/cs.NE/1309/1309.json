We subjected digital organisms with each tested architecture to\nseven different computational environments designed to present a range of\nevolutionary challenges. Our goal was to engineer a general purpose\narchitecture that would be effective under a broad range of evolutionary\nconditions. We evaluated six different types of architectural features for the\nvirtual CPUs: (1) genetic flexibility: we allowed digital organisms to more\nprecisely modify the function of genetic instructions, (2) memory: we provided\nan increased number of registers in the virtual CPUs, (3) decoupled sensors and\nactuators: we separated input and output operations to enable greater control\nover data flow. We also tested a variety of methods to regulate expression: (4)\nexplicit labels that allow programs to dynamically refer to specific genome\npositions, (5) position-relative search instructions, and (6) multiple new flow\ncontrol instructions, including conditionals and jumps. Each of these features\nalso adds complication to the instruction set and risks slowing evolution due\nto epistatic interactions. Two features (multiple argument specification and\nseparated I/O) demonstrated substantial improvements int the majority of test\nenvironments. Some of the remaining tested modifications were detrimental,\nthought most exhibit no systematic effects on evolutionary potential,\nhighlighting the robustness of digital evolution. Combined, these observations\nenhance our understanding of how instruction architecture impacts evolutionary\npotential, enabling the creation of architectures that support more rapid\nevolution of complex solutions to a broad range of challenges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 15:17:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Oct 2013 17:41:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bryson", "David M.", ""], ["Ofria", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0790", "submitter": "Philip Graff", "authors": "Philip Graff, Farhan Feroz, Michael P.

This efficient and robust machine learning tool is\nable to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including\nautoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning\napplications, such as regression, classification, density estimation,\nclustering and dimensionality reduction. SkyNet uses a `pre-training' method to\nobtain a set of network parameters that has empirically been shown to be close\nto a good solution, followed by further optimisation using a regularised\nvariant of Newton's method, where the level of regularisation is determined and\nadjusted automatically; the latter uses second-order derivative information to\nimprove convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian\nmatrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector\nproducts. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated\nnetworks that are difficult to optimise using standard backpropagation\ntechniques. SkyNet employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent\noverfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of\nnetwork outputs. The utility and flexibility of SkyNet are demonstrated by\napplication to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing\non the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification\nof gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images.

The objective is to\nminimize the total tardiness by determining the allocation and sequence of jobs\non identical parallel machines. In this problem, the processing time of each\njob is a step function dependent upon its starting time. An individual extended\ntime is penalized when the starting time of a job is later than a specific\ndeterioration date. The possibility of deterioration of a job makes the\nparallel machine scheduling problem more challenging than ordinary ones. A\nmixed integer programming model for the optimal solution is derived.

In order to generate a good initial swarm, a modified heuristic\nnamed the MBHG is incorporated into the initialization of population.

The starting point in our\nstudy was the observation that words should accompany the input vectors\nincluded in the training set, thus extending the ANN input space. This had as\nconsequence the necessity to take into consideration a modified sigmoid\nactivation function for neurons in the first hidden layer (in agreement with a\nspecific MLP apartment structure), and also a modified version of the\nBackpropagation algorithm, which allows using of unspecified (null) desired\noutput components. Following the belief that basic concepts should be tested on\nsimple examples, the previous mentioned mechanism was applied on both the XOR\nproblem and a didactic color case study. In this context, we noticed the\ninteresting fact that the ANN was capable to categorize all desired input\nvectors in the absence of their corresponding words, even though the training\nset included only word accompanied inputs, in both positive and negative\nexamples. Further analysis along applying this approach to more complex\nscenarios is currently in progress, as we consider the proposed language-driven\nalgorithm might contribute to a better understanding of learning in humans,\nopening as well the possibility to create a specific category of artificial\nneural networks, with abstraction capabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 01:12:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 07:19:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 23:08:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Grossu", "I.
