A neural model, whose structure is mainly based on\nsome physical equations describing the engine behaviour, is built for the\nrotation speed and the exhaust gas opacity. The model is composed of three\ninterconnected neural submodels, each of them constituting a nonlinear\nmulti-input single-output error model. The structural identification and the\nparameter estimation from data gathered on a real engine are described. The\nneural direct model is then used to determine a neural controller of the\nengine, in a specialized training scheme minimising a multivariable criterion.\nSimulations show the effect of the pollution constraint weighting on a\ntrajectory tracking of the engine speed. Neural networks, which are flexible\nand parsimonious nonlinear black-box models, with universal approximation\ncapabilities, can accurately describe or control complex nonlinear systems,\nwith little a priori theoretical knowledge. The presented work extends optimal\nneuro-control to the multivariable case and shows the flexibility of neural\noptimisers. Considering the preliminary results, it appears that neural\nnetworks can be used as embedded models for engine control, to satisfy the more\nand more restricting pollutant emission legislation. Particularly, they are\nable to model nonlinear dynamics and outperform during transients the control\nschemes based on static mappings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2009 05:58:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ouladsine", "Mustapha", "", "LSIS"], ["Bloch", "G\u00e9rard", "", "CRAN"], ["Dovifaaz", "Xavier", "", "CRAN"]]}, {"id": "0907.4426", "submitter": "Christopher Frenz", "authors": "Christopher M.
