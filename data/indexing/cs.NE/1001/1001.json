As an example, we will show that\nproposed probabilistic interpretation is suitable for modeling of on-line\nlearning algorithms for PSA, which are preferably realized by a parallel\nhardware based on very simple computational units. Proposed concept (model) can\nbe used in the context of improving algorithm convergence speed, learning\nfactor choice, or input signal scale robustness.
