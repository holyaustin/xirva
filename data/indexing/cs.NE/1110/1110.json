Robust\nregression methods allow one to filter out the outliers when building a model.\nBy replacing the traditional least squares criterion with the least trimmed\nsquares criterion, in which half of data is treated as potential outliers, one\ncan fit accurate regression models to strongly contaminated data.\nHigh-breakdown methods have become very well established in linear regression,\nbut have started being applied for non-linear regression only recently. In this\nwork, we examine the problem of fitting artificial neural networks to\ncontaminated data using least trimmed squares criterion. We introduce a\npenalized least trimmed squares criterion which prevents unnecessary removal of\nvalid data. Training of ANNs leads to a challenging non-smooth global\noptimization problem. We compare the efficiency of several derivative-free\noptimization methods in solving it, and show that our approach identifies the\noutliers correctly when ANNs are used for nonlinear regression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2011 10:56:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Beliakov", "Gleb", ""], ["Kelarev", "Andrei", ""], ["Yearwood", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0214", "submitter": "Ridwan Al Iqbal", "authors": "Ridwan Al Iqbal", "title": "Eclectic Extraction of Propositional Rules from Neural Networks", "comments": "ICCIT 2011, Dhaka, Bangladesh", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Artificial Neural Network is among the most popular algorithm for supervised\nlearning.
