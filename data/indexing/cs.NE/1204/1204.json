More particularly, in space applications, a common type of\nrobots has been of widespread use in the recent years. It is called planetary\nrover which is a robot vehicle that moves across the surface of a planet and\nconducts detailed geological studies pertaining to the properties of the\nlanding cosmic environment. However, rovers are always impeded by obstacles\nalong the traveling path which can destabilize the rover's body and prevent it\nfrom reaching its goal destination. This paper proposes an ANN model that\nallows rover systems to carry out autonomous path-planning to successfully\nnavigate through challenging planetary terrains and follow their goal location\nwhile avoiding dangerous obstacles. The proposed ANN is a multilayer network\nmade out of three layers: an input, a hidden, and an output layer. The network\nis trained in offline mode using back-propagation supervised learning\nalgorithm. A software-simulated rover was experimented and it revealed that it\nwas able to follow the safest trajectory despite existing obstacles. As future\nwork, the proposed ANN is to be parallelized so as to speed-up the execution\ntime of the training process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 09:24:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bassil", "Youssef", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0262", "submitter": "Greg Fish", "authors": "Greg Fish", "title": "Managing contextual artificial neural networks with a service-based\n  mediator", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Today, a wide variety of probabilistic and expert AI systems used to analyze\nreal world inputs such as unstructured text, sounds, images, and statistical\ndata.

Hydrodynamic properties, interpolation methods and other\nbuilding blocks are described in abstract, modular, re-usable and combinable\nforms, which lets us generate versatile solvers from little set of Paraiso\nsource codes.\n  We demonstrate Paraiso by implementing a compressive hydrodynamics solver. A\nsingle source code less than 500 lines can be used to generate solvers of\narbitrary dimensions, for both multicore CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate both\nmanual annotation based tuning and evolutionary computing based automated\ntuning of the program.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Apr 2012 05:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 May 2012 00:11:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Muranushi", "Takayuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6181", "submitter": "Valmir Barbosa", "authors": "Valmir C.

When the graph's nodes stand for\nthe possible solutions to certain problems of combinatorial optimization,\nchoosing its edges appropriately has been shown to lead to conduciveness\nproperties that provide useful insight into the performance of algorithms to\nsolve those problems. Here we study the conduciveness of CA-rule graphs, that\nis, graphs whose node set is the set of all CA rules given a cell's number of\npossible states and neighborhood size. We consider several different edge sets\ninterconnecting these nodes, both deterministic and random ones, and derive\nanalytical expressions for the resulting graph's conduciveness toward rules\nhaving a fixed number of non-quiescent entries. We demonstrate that one of the\nrandom edge sets, characterized by allowing nodes to be sparsely interconnected\nacross any Hamming distance between the corresponding rules, has the potential\nof providing reasonable conduciveness toward the desired rules. We conjecture\nthat this may lie at the bottom of the best strategies known to date for\ndiscovering complex rules to solve specific problems, all of an evolutionary\nnature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 12:10:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Barbosa", "Valmir C.", ""]]}]
