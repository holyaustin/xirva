So, this\nwork is concerned with the creation, investigation, and optimisation of Digital\nEcosystems, exploiting the self-organising properties of biological ecosystems.\nFirst, we created the Digital Ecosystem, a novel optimisation technique\ninspired by biological ecosystems, where the optimisation works at two levels:\na first optimisation, migration of agents which are distributed in a\ndecentralised peer-to-peer network, operating continuously in time; this\nprocess feeds a second optimisation based on evolutionary computing that\noperates locally on single peers and is aimed at finding solutions to satisfy\nlocally relevant constraints. We then investigated its self-organising aspects,\nstarting with an extension to the definition of Physical Complexity to include\nevolving agent populations. Next, we established stability of evolving agent\npopulations over time, by extending the Chli-DeWilde definition of agent\nstability to include evolutionary dynamics. Further, we evaluated the diversity\nof the software agents within evolving agent populations. To conclude, we\nconsidered alternative augmentations to optimise and accelerate our Digital\nEcosystem, by studying the accelerating effect of a clustering catalyst on the\nevolutionary dynamics. We also studied the optimising effect of targeted\nmigration on the ecological dynamics, through the indirect and emergent\noptimisation of the agent migration patterns. Overall, we have advanced the\nunderstanding of creating Digital Ecosystems, the self-organisation that occurs\nwithin them, and the optimisation of their Ecosystem-Oriented Architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 15:07:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 16:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Briscoe", "Gerard", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4995", "submitter": "Marko Jankovic", "authors": "Marko V.
