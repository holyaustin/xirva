Instead of using statistic metrics that are biased towards specific\ntrees we use a more flexible, global metric of tree quality that try to\noptimize accuracy and size.

We show that both unipartite and directed networks can be\nrepresented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely\nconsistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure\non which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the\nbipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA),\nwhich is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection.\nThe high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we\nmake. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a\nlocus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci\nmutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the\ncurrent population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment\ntechnique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from\nthe random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation\nrule which by incorporating related operation can guarantee the convergence of\nthe MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process.\nExperimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms\nof modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Nov 2010 09:05:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Nov 2010 08:34:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 4 Jun 2011 02:46:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["WeiHua", "Zhan", ""], ["Zhongzhi", "Zhang", ""], ["Jihong", "Guan", ""], ["Shuigeng", "Zhou", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3466", "submitter": "Carola Winzen", "authors": "Benjamin Doerr, Daniel Johannsen, Carola Winzen", "title": "Non-Existence of Linear Universal Drift Functions", "comments": "19 pages; This work contains parts of the GECCO 2010 and CEC 2010\n  papers of the same authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Drift analysis has become a powerful tool to prove bounds on the runtime of\nrandomized search heuristics.
