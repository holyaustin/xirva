Crossover (also called\nrecombination), originated from simulating the chromosome exchange phenomena in\nzoogamy reproduction, is widely employed in EAs to generate offspring\nsolutions, of which the effectiveness has been examined empirically in\napplications. However, due to the irregularity of crossover operators and the\ncomplicated interactions to mutation, crossover operators are hard to analyze\nand thus have few theoretical results. Therefore, analyzing crossover not only\nhelps in understanding EAs, but also helps in developing novel techniques for\nanalyzing sophisticated metaheuristic algorithms.\n  In this paper, we derive the General Markov Chain Switching Theorem (GMCST)\nto facilitate theoretical studies of crossover-enabled EAs. The theorem allows\nus to analyze the running time of a sophisticated EA from an easy-to-analyze\nEA. Using this tool, we analyze EAs with several crossover operators on the\nLeadingOnes and OneMax problems, which are noticeably two well studied problems\nfor mutation-only EAs but with few results for crossover-enabled EAs. We first\nderive the bounds of running time of the (2+2)-EA with crossover operators;\nthen we study the running time gap between the mutation-only (2:2)-EA and the\n(2:2)-EA with crossover operators; finally, we develop strategies that apply\ncrossover operators only when necessary, which improve from the mutation-only\nas well as the crossover-all-the-time (2:2)-EA. The theoretical results are\nverified by experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2011 16:38:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 07:58:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Yang", ""], ["Qian", "Chao", ""], ["Zhou", "Zhi-Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1353", "submitter": "Gerald Paul", "authors": "Gerald Paul", "title": "An efficient implementation of the simulated annealing heuristic for the\n  quadratic assignment problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The quadratic assignment problem (QAP) is one of the most difficult\ncombinatorial optimization problems.

So far, the studies or applications of multivariate probabilistic\nmodel based continuous EDAs are still restricted to rather low dimensional\nproblems (smaller than 100D). Traditional EDAs have difficulties in solving\nhigher dimensional problems because of the curse of dimensionality and their\nrapidly increasing computational cost. However, scaling up continuous EDAs for\nhigher dimensional optimization is still necessary, which is supported by the\ndistinctive feature of EDAs: Because a probabilistic model is explicitly\nestimated, from the learnt model one can discover useful properties or features\nof the problem. Besides obtaining a good solution, understanding of the problem\nstructure can be of great benefit, especially for black box optimization. We\npropose a novel EDA framework with Model Complexity Control (EDA-MCC) to scale\nup EDAs. By using Weakly dependent variable Identification (WI) and Subspace\nModeling (SM), EDA-MCC shows significantly better performance than traditional\nEDAs on high dimensional problems. Moreover, the computational cost and the\nrequirement of large population sizes can be reduced in EDA-MCC. In addition to\nbeing able to find a good solution, EDA-MCC can also produce a useful problem\nstructure characterization.
