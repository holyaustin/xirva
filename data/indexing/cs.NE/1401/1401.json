Recently, the multiple-input several\nmultiple-outputs (MISMO) modeling strategy has been proposed as a promising\nalternative for multi-step-ahead time series prediction, exhibiting advantages\ncompared with the two currently dominating strategies, the iterated and the\ndirect strategies. Built on the established MISMO strategy, this study proposes\na particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based MISMO modeling strategy, which is\ncapable of determining the number of sub-models in a self-adaptive mode, with\nvarying prediction horizons. Rather than deriving crisp divides with equal-size\ns prediction horizons from the established MISMO, the proposed PSO-MISMO\nstrategy, implemented with neural networks, employs a heuristic to create\nflexible divides with varying sizes of prediction horizons and to generate\ncorresponding sub-models, providing considerable flexibility in model\nconstruction, which has been validated with simulated and real datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 07:09:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bao", "Yukun", ""], ["Xiong", "Tao", ""], ["Hu", "Zhongyi", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0523", "submitter": "Khalid Jebari hassani", "authors": "Khalid Jebari, Mohammed Madiafi, Abdelaziz El Moujahid", "title": "Solving Poisson Equation by Genetic Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Applications Volume 83, No 5,\n  December 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with a method for solving Poisson Equation (PE) based on\ngenetic algorithms and grammatical evolution.

Genetic algorithms framework for\ncryptanalysis problem is addressed. A novel extension to the differential\ncryptanalysis using genetic algorithm is proposed and a fitness measure based\non the differential characteristics of the cipher being attacked is also\nproposed. The complexity of the proposed attack is shown to be less than\nquarter of normal differential cryptanalysis of the same cipher by applying the\nproposed attack to both the basic Substitution Permutation Network and the\nFeistel Network. The basic models of modern block ciphers are attacked instead\nof actual cipher to prove that the attack is applicable to other ciphers\nvulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. A new attack for block cipher based\non the ability of neural networks to perform an approximation of mapping is\nproposed. A complete problem formulation is explained and implementation of the\nattack on some hypothetical Feistel cipher not vulnerable to differential or\nlinear attacks is presented. A new block cipher based on the neural networks is\nproposed. A complete cipher structure is given and a key scheduling is also\nshown. The main properties of neural network being able to perform mapping\nbetween large dimension domains in a very fast and a very small memory compared\nto S-Boxes is used as a base for the cipher.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 14:00:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bahaa-Eldin", "Ayman M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3607", "submitter": "Larry Bull", "authors": "Larry Bull", "title": "A Brief History of Learning Classifier Systems: From CS-1 to XCS", "comments": "37 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modern Learning Classifier Systems can be characterized by their use of rule\naccuracy as the utility metric for the search algorithm(s) discovering useful\nrules.

VLSI layouts with fewer crossings are more easily\nrealizable and consequently cheaper.

Given the list of cities and distances between\nthem, the problem is to find the shortest tour possible which visits all the\ncities in list exactly once and ends in the city where it starts. Despite the\nTraveling Salesman Problem is NP-Hard, a lot of methods and solutions are\nproposed to the problem. One of them is Genetic Algorithm (GA). GA is a simple\nbut an efficient heuristic method that can be used to solve Traveling Salesman\nProblem. In this paper, we will show a parallel genetic algorithm\nimplementation on MapReduce framework in order to solve Traveling Salesman\nProblem. MapReduce is a framework used to support distributed computation on\nclusters of computers. We used free licensed Hadoop implementation as MapReduce\nframework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 06:59:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Er", "Harun Rasit", ""], ["Erdogan", "Nadia", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6333", "submitter": "Yang Yu", "authors": "Yang Yu and Hong Qian", "title": "The Sampling-and-Learning Framework: A Statistical View of Evolutionary\n  Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), a large class of general purpose optimization\nalgorithms inspired from the natural phenomena, are widely used in various\nindustrial optimizations and often show excellent performance. This paper\npresents an attempt towards revealing their general power from a statistical\nview of EAs. By summarizing a large range of EAs into the sampling-and-learning\nframework, we show that the framework directly admits a general analysis on the\nprobable-absolute-approximate (PAA) query complexity. We particularly focus on\nthe framework with the learning subroutine being restricted as a binary\nclassification, which results in the sampling-and-classification (SAC)\nalgorithms. With the help of the learning theory, we obtain a general upper\nbound on the PAA query complexity of SAC algorithms. We further compare SAC\nalgorithms with the uniform search in different situations. Under the\nerror-target independence condition, we show that SAC algorithms can achieve\npolynomial speedup to the uniform search, but not super-polynomial speedup.\nUnder the one-side-error condition, we show that super-polynomial speedup can\nbe achieved. This work only touches the surface of the framework. Its power\nunder other conditions is still open.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 13:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Apr 2014 14:29:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Yang", ""], ["Qian", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7406", "submitter": "Jeffrey Tsang", "authors": "Jeffrey Tsang", "title": "The parametrized probabilistic finite-state transducer probe game player\n  fingerprint model", "comments": "17 pages, 35 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games\n  2(3):208-224, 2010", "doi": "10.1109/TCIAIG.2010.2062512", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fingerprinting operators generate functional signatures of game players and\nare useful for their automated analysis independent of representation or\nencoding.
