In natural systems, insects, birds, fish and\nother large mammals function in larger units to increase the overall fitness of\nthe individuals. Their behavior is coordinated through local interactions to\nenhance mate selection, predator detection, migratory route identification and\nso forth [Andersson and Wallander 2003; Buhl et al. 2006; Nagy et al. 2010;\nPartridge 1982; Sumpter et al. 2008]. In artificial systems, swarms of\nautonomous agents can augment human activities such as search and rescue, and\nenvironmental monitoring by covering large areas with multiple nodes [Alami et\nal. 2007; Caruso et al. 2008; Ogren et al. 2004; Paley et al. 2007; Sibley et\nal. 2002]. In this paper, we explore the interplay between swarm dynamics,\ncovert leadership and theoretical information transfer. A leader is a member of\nthe swarm that acts upon information in addition to what is provided by local\ninteractions. Depending upon the leadership model, leaders can use their\nexternal information either all the time or in response to local conditions\n[Couzin et al. 2005; Sun et al. 2013]. A covert leader is a leader that is\ntreated no differently than others in the swarm, so leaders and followers\nparticipate equally in whatever interaction model is used [Rossi et al. 2007].\nIn this study, we use theoretical information transfer as a means of analyzing\nswarm interactions to explore whether or not it is possible to distinguish\nbetween followers and leaders based on interactions within the swarm. We find\nthat covert leaders can be distinguished from followers in a swarm because they\nreceive less transfer entropy than followers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 02:18:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Yu", ""], ["Rossi", "Louis F.", ""], ["Shen", "Chien-Chung", ""], ["Miller", "Jennifer", ""], ["Wang", "X.

In a BM approach, image frames in a video sequence are divided into\nblocks. For each block in the current frame, the best matching block is\nidentified inside a region of the previous frame, aiming to minimize the sum of\nabsolute differences (SAD). Unfortunately, the SAD evaluation is\ncomputationally expensive and represents the most consuming operation in the BM\nprocess. Therefore, BM motion estimation can be approached as an optimization\nproblem, where the goal is to find the best matching block within a search\nspace. The simplest available BM method is the full search algorithm (FSA)\nwhich finds the most accurate motion vector through an exhaustive computation\nof SAD values for all elements of the search window. Recently, several fast BM\nalgorithms have been proposed to reduce the number of SAD operations by\ncalculating only a fixed subset of search locations at the price of poor\naccuracy. In this paper, a new algorithm based on Artificial Bee Colony (ABC)\noptimization is proposed to reduce the number of search locations in the BM\nprocess. In our algorithm, the computation of search locations is drastically\nreduced by considering a fitness calculation strategy which indicates when it\nis feasible to calculate or only estimate new search locations. Since the\nproposed algorithm does not consider any fixed search pattern or any other\nmovement assumption as most of other BM approaches do, a high probability for\nfinding the true minimum (accurate motion vector) is expected.

When it is implemented into a legged robot's locomotion control as a\ncentral pattern generator (CPG), sophisticated gait patterns arise so that the\nrobot can perform various walking behaviors. However, such a single chaotic CPG\ncontroller has difficulties dealing with leg malfunction. Specifically, in the\nscenarios presented here, its movement permanently deviates from the desired\ntrajectory. To address this problem, we extend the single chaotic CPG to\nmultiple CPGs with learning. The learning mechanism is based on a simulated\nannealing algorithm. In a normal situation, the CPGs synchronize and their\ndynamics are identical. With leg malfunction or disability, the CPGs lose\nsynchronization leading to independent dynamics. In this case, the learning\nmechanism is applied to automatically adjust the remaining legs' oscillation\nfrequencies so that the robot adapts its locomotion to deal with the\nmalfunction. As a consequence, the trajectory produced by the multiple chaotic\nCPGs resembles the original trajectory far better than the one produced by only\na single CPG. The performance of the system is evaluated first in a physical\nsimulation of a quadruped as well as a hexapod robot and finally in a real\nsix-legged walking machine called AMOSII.
