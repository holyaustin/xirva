The question of how the performance of a\npopulation-based EA depends on the population size arises naturally. The\nperformance of an EA may be evaluated by different measures, such as the\naverage convergence rate to the optimal set per generation or the expected\nnumber of generations to encounter an optimal solution for the first time.\nPopulation scalability is the performance ratio between a benchmark EA and\nanother EA using identical genetic operators but a larger population size.\nAlthough intuitively the performance of an EA may improve if its population\nsize increases, currently there exist only a few case studies for simple\nfitness functions. This paper aims at providing a general study for discrete\noptimisation. A novel approach is introduced to analyse population scalability\nusing the fundamental matrix. The following two contributions summarize the\nmajor results of the current article. (1) We demonstrate rigorously that for\nelitist EAs with identical global mutation, using a lager population size\nalways increases the average rate of convergence to the optimal set; and yet,\nsometimes, the expected number of generations needed to find an optimal\nsolution (measured by either the maximal value or the average value) may\nincrease, rather than decrease. (2) We establish sufficient and/or necessary\nconditions for the superlinear scalability, that is, when the average\nconvergence rate of a $(\\mu+\\mu)$ EA (where $\\mu\\ge2$) is bigger than $\\mu$\ntimes that of a $(1+1)$ EA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Aug 2011 09:12:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2012 08:54:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 19:02:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2013 10:29:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Jun", ""], ["Chen", "Tianshi", ""], ["Mitavskiy", "Boris", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4548", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "J.L.
