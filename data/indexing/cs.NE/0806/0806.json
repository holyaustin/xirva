However, in the same way as operators have\nan impact on performance, the choice of migrants is due to have an impact too.\nIn this paper we propose a new policy (named multikulti) for choosing the\nindividuals that are going to be sent to other nodes, based on\nmulticulturality: the individual sent should be as different as possible to the\nreceiving population. We have checked this policy on different discrete\noptimization problems, and found that, in average or in median, this policy\noutperforms classical ones like sending the best or a random individual.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2008 17:19:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 15:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Araujo", "Lourdes", ""], ["Guervos", "Juan J.

The problem that is considered in this works\nconsists of estimating the existence, location and extent of stiffness\nreduction in structure which is indicated by the changes of the structural\nstatic parameters such as deflection and strain. The neural network was trained\nto recognize the behaviour of static parameter of the undamaged structure as\nwell as of the structure with various possible damage extent and location which\nwere modelled as random states. The proposed techniques were applied to detect\ndamage in a simply supported beam. The structure was analyzed using\nfinite-element-method (FEM) and the damage identification was conducted by a\nback-propagation neural network using the change of the structural strain and\ndisplacement. The results showed that using proposed method the strain is more\nefficient for identification of damage than the displacement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jun 2008 04:43:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Haryanto", "Ismoyo", ""], ["Setiawan", "Joga Dharma", ""], ["Budiyono", "Agus", ""]]}]
