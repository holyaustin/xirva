This paper proposes an analog implementation of the\nTSTDP rule. The proposed VLSI circuit has been designed using the AMS 0.35 um\nCMOS process and has been simulated using design kits for Synopsys and Cadence\ntools. Simulation results demonstrate how well the proposed circuit can alter\nsynaptic weights according to the timing difference amongst a set of different\npatterns of spikes. Furthermore, the circuit is shown to give rise to a\nBCM-like learning rule, which is a rate-based rule. To mimic implementation\nenvironment, a 1000 run Monte Carlo (MC) analysis was conducted on the proposed\ncircuit. The presented MC simulation analysis and the simulation result from\nfine-tuned circuits show that, it is possible to mitigate the effect of process\nvariations in the proof of concept circuit, however, a practical variation\naware design technique is required to promise a high circuit performance in a\nlarge scale neural network.

In existing studies, however, the experimenter\nhad to craft a domain dependent behaviour similarity measure to use novelty\nsearch in swarm robotics applications. The reliance on hand-crafted similarity\nmeasures places an additional burden to the experimenter and introduces a bias\nin the evolutionary process. In this paper, we propose and compare two\ntask-independent, generic behaviour similarity measures: combined state count\nand sampled average state. The proposed measures use the values of sensors and\neffectors recorded for each individual robot of the swarm. The characterisation\nof the group-level behaviour is then obtained by combining the sensor-effector\nvalues from all the robots. We evaluate the proposed measures in an aggregation\ntask and in a resource sharing task. We show that the generic measures match\nthe performance of domain dependent measures in terms of solution quality. Our\nresults indicate that the proposed generic measures operate as effective\nbehaviour similarity measures, and that it is possible to leverage the benefits\nof novelty search without having to craft domain specific similarity measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2013 18:58:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gomes", "Jorge", ""], ["Christensen", "Anders Lyhne", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3610", "submitter": "Hardik Parekh", "authors": "Hardik M.
