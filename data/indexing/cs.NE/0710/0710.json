One of the main problems of algorithmic self-assembly is the\nminimum tile set problem (MTSP), which asks for a collection of types of\nelementary objects (called tiles) to be found for the self-assembly of an\nobject having a pre-established shape. Such a collection is to be as concise as\npossible, thus minimizing supply diversity, while satisfying a set of stringent\nconstraints having to do with the termination and other properties of the\nself-assembly process from its tile types. We present a study of what we think\nis the first practical approach to MTSP.
