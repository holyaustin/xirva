First, the results of the up-to-date method\nused in all FEM softwares (Gibb's method) can be consistently improved; second,\nnone of the crossover operators tried so far (either general or problem\nspecific) proved useful; third, though the general tendency in Evolutionary\nComputation seems to be the hybridization with other methods (deterministic or\nheuristic), none of the presented attempt did encounter any success yet. The\ngood news, however, is that this algorithm allows an improvement over the\nstandard heuristic method between 12% and 20% for both the 1545 and 5453-nodes\nmeshes used as test-bed.
