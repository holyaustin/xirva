The aim of the proposed scheme is to minimize the test data\nvolume by allowing the device's microprogram to test its logic, providing an\nobservation structure to the system, and generating appropriate test data for\nthe given architecture. Two methods of deriving a deterministic test set at\nfunctional level are suggested. The first method is based on the classical\ngenetic algorithm with binary and arithmetic crossover and mutation operators.\nThe second one uses genetic programming, where test is represented as a\nsequence of microoperations. In the latter case, we apply two-point crossover\nbased on exchanging test subsequences and mutation implemented as random\nreplacement of microoperations or operands. Experimental data of the program\nrealization showing the efficiency of the proposed methods are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jul 2010 07:31:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Skobtsov", "Y.

I will discuss DXNN's mutation\noperators which are aimed at improving its efficiency, expandability, and\ncapabilities through a built in feature selection method that allows for the\nevolved system to expand, discover, and explore new sensors and actuators.\nFinally I will compare DXNN platform to other state of the art TWEANNs on a\ncontrol task to demonstrate its superior ability to produce highly compact\nsolutions faster than its competitors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Aug 2010 03:35:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Dec 2010 08:14:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 03:51:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sher", "Gene I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.3450", "submitter": "Farnood Merrikh-Bayat", "authors": "Farnood Merrikh-Bayat, Saeed Bagheri Shouraki, Iman Esmaili Paeen\n  Afrakoti", "title": "Bottleneck of using single memristor as a synapse and its solution", "comments": "17 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is now widely accepted that memristive devices are perfect candidates for\nthe emulation of biological synapses in neuromorphic systems. This is mainly\nbecause of the fact that like the strength of synapse, memristance of the\nmemristive device can be tuned actively (e.g., by the application of volt- age\nor current). In addition, it is also possible to fabricate very high density of\nmemristive devices (comparable to the number of synapses in real biological\nsystem) through the nano-crossbar structures. However, in this paper we will\nshow that there are some problems associated with memristive synapses\n(memristive devices which are playing the role of biological synapses). For\nexample, we show that the variation rate of the memristance of memristive\ndevice depends completely on the current memristance of the device and\ntherefore it can change significantly with time during the learning phase. This\nphenomenon can degrade the performance of learning methods like Spike\nTiming-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and cause the corresponding neuromorphic\nsystems to become unstable. Finally, at the end of this paper, we illustrate\nthat using two serially connected memristive devices with different polarities\nas a synapse can somewhat fix the aforementioned problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Aug 2010 07:43:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Sep 2010 07:34:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 Nov 2012 00:50:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Merrikh-Bayat", "Farnood", ""], ["Shouraki", "Saeed Bagheri", ""], ["Afrakoti", "Iman Esmaili Paeen", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.4049", "submitter": "Kevin Curran", "authors": "Kevin Curran, Peng Yuan, Damian Coyle", "title": "Discriminating between Nasal and Mouth Breathing", "comments": "Hi, I just wish to withdraw this paper from the site until further\n  notice.

The aim of undertaken this\nresearch is to come up with a block cipher where by the keys are randomly\ngenerated by ASNN which can then have any variable block length. This will show\nthe private key is kept and do not have to be exchange to the other side of the\ncommunication channel so it present a more secure procedure of key scheduling.\nThe process enables for a faster change in encryption keys and a network level\nencryption to be implemented at a high speed without the headache of\nfactorization. Approach: The block cipher is converted in public cryptosystem\nand had a low level of vulnerability to attack from brute, and moreover can\nable to defend against linear attacks since the Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANN) architecture convey non-linearity to the encryption/decryption\nprocedures. Result: In this paper is present to use the Spiking Neural Networks\n(SNNs) with spiking neurons as its basic unit. The timing for the SNNs is\nconsidered and the output is encoded in 1's and 0's depending on the occurrence\nor not occurrence of spikes as well as the spiking neural networks use a sign\nfunction as activation function, and present the weights and the filter\ncoefficients to be adjust, having more degrees of freedom than the classical\nneural networks. Conclusion: In conclusion therefore, encryption algorithm can\nbe deployed in communication and security applications where data transfers are\nmost crucial. So this paper, the neural block cipher proposed where the keys\nare generated by the SNN and the seed is considered the public key which\ngenerates the both keys on both sides In future therefore a new research will\nbe conducted on the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) impacts on communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Aug 2010 14:55:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Omari", "Saleh Ali K.", ""], ["Sumari", "Putra", ""]]}]
