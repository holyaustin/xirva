For\nsuccessful and efficient use of GAs, it is not enough to simply apply simple\nGAs (SGAs).

The representation must at least be able\nto encode all possible solutions of an optimization problem, and genetic\noperators such as crossover and mutation should be applicable to it. In this\npaper, serial alternation strategies between two codings are formulated in the\nframework of dynamic change of genotype encoding in GAs for function\noptimization. Likewise, a new variant of GAs for difficult optimization\nproblems denoted {\\it Split-and-Merge} GA (SM-GA) is developed using a parallel\nimplementation of an SGA and evolving a dynamic exchange of individual\nrepresentation in the context of Dual Coding concept.

This new scheme allows to enhance diversity and to control\nthe selective pressure which are two important issues in Genetic Algorithms,\nespecially when trying to solve difficult optimization problems. Varying the\nanisotropic degree of selection allows swapping from a cellular to an island\nmodel of parallel genetic algorithm. Measures of performances and diversity\nhave been performed on one well-known problem: the Quadratic Assignment Problem\nwhich is known to be difficult to optimize. Experiences show that, tuning the\nanisotropic degree, we can find the accurate trade-off between cGA and island\nmodels to optimize performances of parallel evolutionary algorithms. This\ntrade-off can be interpreted as the suitable degree of migration among\nsubpopulations in a parallel Genetic Algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Mar 2008 08:20:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Simoncini", "David", "", "I3S"], ["Collard", "Philippe", "", "I3S"], ["Verel", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "I3S"], ["Clergue", "Manuel", "", "I3S"]]}]
