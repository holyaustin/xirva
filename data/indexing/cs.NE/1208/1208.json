Particle Swarm\nOptimization is used as a method that is applied to a single stage amplifier\ncircuit to meet two criteria: desired gain and desired low noise. The aim is to\nget the best optimized design using the predefined constraints for gain and low\nnoise values. The code is written to apply the algorithm to meet the desired\ngoals and the obtained results are verified using different simulators. The\nresults obtained show that PSO can be applied very efficiently for this kind of\ndesign problems with multiple constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2012 11:32:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ulker", "Sadik", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6310", "submitter": "Irina Topalova", "authors": "Irina Topalova", "title": "Automated Marble Plate Classification System Based On Different Neural\n  Network Input Training Sets and PLC Implementation", "comments": "7 pages, 11 figures, 1 table, (IJARAI) International Journal of\n  Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 1, No. 2, 2012;\n  ISSN:2165-4069(Online), ISSN:2165-4050 (Print)", "journal-ref": "(IJARAI) International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial\n  Intelligence, Vol. 1, No. 2, 2012, 50-56", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The process of sorting marble plates according to their surface texture is an\nimportant task in the automated marble plate production. Nowadays some\ninspection systems in marble industry that automate the classification tasks\nare too expensive and are compatible only with specific technological equipment\nin the plant. In this paper a new approach to the design of an Automated Marble\nPlate Classification System (AMPCS),based on different neural network input\ntraining sets is proposed, aiming at high classification accuracy using simple\nprocessing and application of only standard devices. It is based on training a\nclassification MLP neural network with three different input training sets:\nextracted texture histograms, Discrete Cosine and Wavelet Transform over the\nhistograms. The algorithm is implemented in a PLC for real-time operation. The\nperformance of the system is assessed with each one of the input training sets.\nThe experimental test results regarding classification accuracy and quick\noperation are represented and discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Aug 2012 12:14:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Topalova", "Irina", ""]]}]
