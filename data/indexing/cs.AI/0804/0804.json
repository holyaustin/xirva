In this classical approach, querying uses Horn over- and\nunder-approximations of a given knowledge-base, which is represented as a\npropositional formula in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Along with the class of\nHorn functions, one could imagine other Boolean function classes that might\nserve the same purpose, owing to attractive deduction-computational properties\nsimilar to those of the Horn functions. Indeed, Zanuttini has suggested that\nthe class of affine Boolean functions could be useful in knowledge compilation\nand has presented an affine approximation algorithm. Since CNF is awkward for\npresenting affine functions, Zanuttini considers both a sets-of-models\nrepresentation and the use of modulo 2 congruence equations. In this paper, we\npropose an algorithm based on reduced ordered binary decision diagrams\n(ROBDDs). This leads to a representation which is more compact than the sets of\nmodels and, once we have established some useful properties of affine Boolean\nfunctions, a more efficient algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2008 05:08:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Henshall", "Kevin", ""], ["Schachte", "Peter", ""], ["S\u00f8ndergaard", "Harald", ""], ["Whiting", "Leigh", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0188", "submitter": "Alexandre d'Aspremont", "authors": "Ronny Luss, Alexandre d'Aspremont", "title": "Support Vector Machine Classification with Indefinite Kernels", "comments": "Final journal version.

From an empirical standpoint, we present the results of a\nsurvey involving the Chief Knowledge Officers (CKOs) of twelve large French\nbusinesses; the objective of this study was to identify the factors that might\ninfluence the success of such approaches. The survey was analysed using\nthematic content analysis and the results are presented here with some short\nillustrative quotes from the CKOs. Finally, the paper concludes with some brief\nreflections on what can be learnt from looking at this problem from these two\nperspectives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2008 16:00:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bourdon", "Isabelle", ""], ["Kimble", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3160", "submitter": "Giorgos Christodoulou", "authors": "George Christodoulou, Elias Koutsoupias and Paul Spirakis", "title": "On the performance of approximate equilibria in congestion games", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the performance of approximate Nash equilibria for linear congestion\ngames.

By expanding the spectrum, we also cast the existing results in a new\nlight. For example, the Pigou network, which gives tight results for exact Nash\nequilibria of selfish routing, remains tight for the price of stability of\n$\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria but not for the price of anarchy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 12:45:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 May 2008 15:45:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Christodoulou", "George", ""], ["Koutsoupias", "Elias", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3361", "submitter": "Forrest Bao", "authors": "Forrest Sheng Bao, Donald Yu-Chun Lie, Yuanlin Zhang", "title": "A New Approach to Automated Epileptic Diagnosis Using EEG and\n  Probabilistic Neural Network", "comments": "5 pages, 6 figures, 1 table, submitted to IEEE ICTAI 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ICTAI.2008.99", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CV", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders that greatly impair\npatient' daily lives. Traditional epileptic diagnosis relies on tedious visual\nscreening by neurologists from lengthy EEG recording that requires the presence\nof seizure (ictal) activities. Nowadays, there are many systems helping the\nneurologists to quickly find interesting segments of the lengthy signal by\nautomatic seizure detection. However, we notice that it is very difficult, if\nnot impossible, to obtain long-term EEG data with seizure activities for\nepilepsy patients in areas lack of medical resources and trained neurologists.\nTherefore, we propose to study automated epileptic diagnosis using interictal\nEEG data that is much easier to collect than ictal data. The authors are not\naware of any report on automated EEG diagnostic system that can accurately\ndistinguish patients' interictal EEG from the EEG of normal people. The\nresearch presented in this paper, therefore, aims to develop an automated\ndiagnostic system that can use interictal EEG data to diagnose whether the\nperson is epileptic. Such a system should also detect seizure activities for\nfurther investigation by doctors and potential patient monitoring. To develop\nsuch a system, we extract four classes of features from the EEG data and build\na Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) fed with these features. Leave-one-out\ncross-validation (LOO-CV) on a widely used epileptic-normal data set reflects\nan impressive 99.5% accuracy of our system on distinguishing normal people's\nEEG from patient's interictal EEG. We also find our system can be used in\npatient monitoring (seizure detection) and seizure focus localization, with\n96.7% and 77.5% accuracy respectively on the data set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 17:07:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Jul 2008 01:45:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bao", "Forrest Sheng", ""], ["Lie", "Donald Yu-Chun", ""], ["Zhang", "Yuanlin", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4073", "submitter": "Gilles Champenois", "authors": "Gilles Champenois", "title": "Grainy Numbers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LO cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Grainy numbers are defined as tuples of bits.
