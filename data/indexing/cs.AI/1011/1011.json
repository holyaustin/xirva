Therefore,\nRL methods are designed to work with features of state rather than state\nitself, and the success or failure of learning is often determined by the\nsuitability of the selected features. By comparison, subspace identification\n(SSID) methods are designed to select a feature set which preserves as much\ninformation as possible about state. In this paper we connect the two\napproaches, looking at the problem of reinforcement learning with a large set\nof features, each of which may only be marginally useful for value function\napproximation. We introduce a new algorithm for this situation, called\nPredictive State Temporal Difference (PSTD) learning. As in SSID for predictive\nstate representations, PSTD finds a linear compression operator that projects a\nlarge set of features down to a small set that preserves the maximum amount of\npredictive information. As in RL, PSTD then uses a Bellman recursion to\nestimate a value function. We discuss the connection between PSTD and prior\napproaches in RL and SSID. We prove that PSTD is statistically consistent,\nperform several experiments that illustrate its properties, and demonstrate its\npotential on a difficult optimal stopping problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Oct 2010 03:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Jan 2011 02:04:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Boots", "Byron", ""], ["Gordon", "Geoffrey J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.0098", "submitter": "Reinhard Moratz", "authors": "Till Mossakowski, Reinhard Moratz", "title": "Qualitative Reasoning about Relative Direction on Adjustable Levels of\n  Granularity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An important issue in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning is the representation of\nrelative direction.

In addition, we show that any reinforcement learning problem can\nbe encoded as a classical logic program with answer set semantics. We also show\nthat a reinforcement learning problem can be encoded as a SAT problem. We\npresent a new high level action description language that allows the factored\nrepresentation of POMDP. Moreover, we modify the original model of POMDP so\nthat it be able to distinguish between knowledge producing actions and actions\nthat change the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Nov 2010 07:48:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Saad", "Emad", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6220", "submitter": "Ramakrishna Kolikipogu", "authors": "K.Sasidhar, Vijaya L Kakulapati, Kolikipogu Ramakrishna and\n  K.KailasaRao", "title": "Multimodal Biometric Systems - Study to Improve Accuracy and Performance", "comments": "8 pages,5 figures, published in International Journal of Computer\n  Science & Engineering Survey (IJCSES) Vol.1, No.2, November 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biometrics is the science and technology of measuring and analyzing\nbiological data of human body, extracting a feature set from the acquired data,\nand comparing this set against to the template set in the database.\nExperimental studies show that Unimodal biometric systems had many\ndisadvantages regarding performance and accuracy. Multimodal biometric systems\nperform better than unimodal biometric systems and are popular even more\ncomplex also. We examine the accuracy and performance of multimodal biometric\nauthentication systems using state of the art Commercial Off- The-Shelf (COTS)\nproducts.
