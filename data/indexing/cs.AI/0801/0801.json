For a general\ngraphical model on a loopy graph the functional may show multiple minima, the\niterative BP algorithm may converge to one of the minima or may not converge at\nall, and the global minimum of the Bethe free energy functional is not\nguaranteed to correspond to the optimal Maximum-Likelihood (ML) solution in the\nzero-temperature limit. However, there are exceptions to this general rule,\ndiscussed in \\cite{05KW} and \\cite{08BSS} in two different contexts, where\nzero-temperature version of the BP algorithm finds ML solution for special\nmodels on graphs with loops. These two models share a key feature: their ML\nsolutions can be found by an efficient Linear Programming (LP) algorithm with a\nTotally-Uni-Modular (TUM) matrix of constraints. Generalizing the two models we\nconsider a class of graphical models reducible in the zero temperature limit to\nLP with TUM constraints. Assuming that a gedanken algorithm, g-BP, funding the\nglobal minimum of the Bethe free energy is available we show that in the limit\nof zero temperature g-BP outputs the ML solution.
