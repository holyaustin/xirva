Though relatively small in number these spurious records present a\nsignificant problem in many situations where they can become a large proportion\nof the records potentially of interest to a given astronomer. In this paper we\nfocus on the four most common causes of unwanted records in the SSS: satellite\nor aeroplane tracks, scratches fibres and other linear phenomena introduced to\nthe plate, circular halos around bright stars due to internal reflections\nwithin the telescope and diffraction spikes near to bright stars. Accurate and\nrobust techniques are needed for locating and flagging such spurious objects.\nWe have developed renewal strings, a probabilistic technique combining the\nHough transform, renewal processes and hidden Markov models which have proven\nhighly effective in this context. The methods are applied to the SSS data to\ndevelop a dataset of spurious object detections, along with confidence\nmeasures, which can allow this unwanted data to be removed from consideration.\nThese methods are general and can be adapted to any future astronomical survey\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2014 06:27:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Storkey", "Amos J.", ""], ["Hambly", "Nigel C.", ""], ["Williams", "Christopher K.

One promising solution is to provide\ngreater communication between a prosthesis and its user. Towards this end, we\npresent a simple machine learning interface to supplement the control of a\nrobotic limb with feedback to the user about what the limb will be experiencing\nin the near future. A real-time prediction learner was implemented to predict\nimpact-related electrical load experienced by a robot limb; the learning\nsystem's predictions were then communicated to the device's user to aid in\ntheir interactions with a workspace.

Our trials showed that communicable predictions could be learned\nquickly during human control of the robot arm. Using these predictions as a\nbasis for feedback led to a statistically significant improvement in task\nperformance when compared to purely reactive feedback from the device. Our\nstudy therefore contributes initial evidence that prediction learning and\nmachine intelligence can benefit not just control, but also feedback from an\nartificial limb.

Unlike previously proposed\nalgorithms that optimize abstract statistical objectives such as information\nmaximization (Infomax) [Butko & Movellan, 2010] or one-step look-ahead accuracy\n[Najemnik & Geisler, 2005], our active sensing model directly minimizes a\ncombination of behavioral costs, such as temporal delay, response error, and\neffort. We simulate these algorithms on a simple visual search task to\nillustrate scenarios in which context-sensitivity is particularly beneficial\nand optimization with respect to generic statistical objectives particularly\ninadequate. Motivated by the geometric properties of the C-DAC policy, we\npresent both parametric and non-parametric approximations, which retain\ncontext-sensitivity while significantly reducing computational complexity.\nThese approximations enable us to investigate the more complex problem\ninvolving peripheral vision, and we notice that the difference between C-DAC\nand statistical policies becomes even more evident in this scenario.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Aug 2014 05:55:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmad", "Sheeraz", ""], ["Yu", "Angela", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.2057", "submitter": "Giorgos Borboudakis", "authors": "Giorgos Borboudakis, Ioannis Tsamardinos", "title": "Scoring and Searching over Bayesian Networks with Causal and Associative\n  Priors", "comments": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Ninth Conference on Uncertainty\n  in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2013-PG-102-111", "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A significant theoretical advantage of search-and-score methods for learning\nBayesian Networks is that they can accept informative prior beliefs for each\npossible network, thus complementing the data.

For a simulation,\ntime reduction is helpful and it would be able to show how patterns may form\nand then fire in sequence, as part of a search or thought process. It uses a\nvery simple equation to show how the inhibitors in particular, can switch off\ncertain areas, to allow other areas to become the prominent ones and thereby\ndefine the current brain state. This allows for a small amount of control over\nwhat appears to be a chaotic structure inside of the brain. It is attractive\nbecause it is still mostly mechanical and therefore can be added as an\nautomatic process, or the modelling of that. The paper also describes how the\nnested pattern structure can be used as a basic counting mechanism. Another\nmathematical conclusion provides a basis for maintaining memory or concept\npatterns. The self-organisation can space itself through automatic processes.\nThis might allow new neurons to be added in a more even manner and could help\nto maintain the concept integrity. The process might also help with finding\nmemory structures afterwards.

As a result, we address the problem of converting\nthis definition into a more precise one where some fundamental properties\nensuring social behaviour (such as action and reward dependency and\nanticipation on competitive/cooperative behaviours) are met as well as some\nother more instrumental properties (such as secernment, boundedness, symmetry,\nvalidity, reliability, efficiency), which are convenient to convert the\ndefinition into a practical test.

To this end, building on the already established\ncharacterization and use of AI planning for similar problems, we propose use of\nplanning for the hypothesis generation problem.

We\nalso proposed a 9-step process that helps provide guidance to the domain expert\nin specifying the LTS++ model.
