In this\npaper, we propose a hierarchical translation-invariant representation for\ncumulative foot pressure images, inspired by the success of Convolutional deep\nbelief network for digital classification. Key contribution in our approach is\ndiscriminative hierarchical sparse coding scheme which helps to learn useful\ndiscriminative high-level visual features. Based on the feature representation\nof cumulative foot pressure images, we develop a pedestrian recognition system\nwhich is invariant to three different shoes and slight local shape change.\nExperiments are conducted on a proposed open dataset that contains more than\n2800 cumulative foot pressure images from 118 subjects. Evaluations suggest the\neffectiveness of the proposed method and the potential of cumulative foot\npressure images as a biometric.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Oct 2010 15:16:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Shuai", ""], ["Huang", "Kaiqi", ""], ["Tan", "Tieniu", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5943", "submitter": "Szymon Chojnacki Mr", "authors": "Szymon Chojnacki and Mieczys{\\l}aw K{\\l}opotek", "title": "Random Graph Generator for Bipartite Networks Modeling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this article is to introduce a new iterative algorithm with\nproperties resembling real life bipartite graphs.

The standard\napproach is to assess the quality of a system by means of accuracy related\nstatistics. However, the specificity of the environments in which recommender\nsystems are deployed requires to pay much attention to speed and memory\nrequirements of the algorithms. Unfortunately, it is implausible to assess\naccurately the complexity of various algorithms with formal tools. This can be\nattributed to the fact that such analyses are usually based on an assumption of\ndense representation of underlying data structures. Whereas, in real life the\nalgorithms operate on sparse data and are implemented with collections\ndedicated for them. Therefore, we propose to measure the complexity of\nrecommender systems with artificial datasets that posses real-life properties.\nWe utilize recently developed bipartite graph generator to evaluate how\nstate-of-the-art recommender systems' behavior is determined and diversified by\ntopological properties of the generated datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Oct 2010 13:10:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chojnacki", "Szymon", ""], ["K\u0142opotek", "Mieczys\u0142aw", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6234", "submitter": "Grazia Bombini", "authors": "Grazia Bombini, Raquel Ros, Stefano Ferilli, Ramon Lopez de Mantaras", "title": "Analysing the behaviour of robot teams through relational sequential\n  pattern mining", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This report outlines the use of a relational representation in a Multi-Agent\ndomain to model the behaviour of the whole system.
