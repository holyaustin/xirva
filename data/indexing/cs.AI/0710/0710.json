Such a coupling of\nbiological and linguistic ingredients results in an abrupt transition: upon a\nsmall change of a model control parameter a poorly communicating group of\nlinguistically unskilled agents transforms into almost perfectly communicating\ngroup with large learning abilities. When learning ability is kept fixed, the\ntransition appears to be continuous. Genetic imprinting of the learning\nabilities proceeds via Baldwin effect: initially unskilled communicating agents\nlearn a language and that creates a niche in which there is an evolutionary\npressure for the increase of learning ability.Our model suggests that when\nlinguistic (or cultural) processes became intensive enough, a transition took\nplace where both linguistic performance and biological endowment of our species\nexperienced an abrupt change that perhaps triggered the rapid expansion of\nhuman civilization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2007 09:39:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Oct 2007 13:20:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lipowski", "Adam", ""], ["Lipowska", "Dorota", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.0013", "submitter": "Jason Johnson", "authors": "Jason K.

The key idea is to\nreformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more\ntractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these\nconstraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which\nis then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization\nleads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then\nit corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise\nthere is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution.\nThus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming\ntechniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product\n(TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations,\nwhere the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also\nconsider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g.\nloops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we\npropose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary''\nvariables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or\neliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or\nLagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the\niterative optimization procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2007 21:29:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "Jason K.", ""], ["Malioutov", "Dmitry M.", ""], ["Willsky", "Alan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.0213", "submitter": "Marc Schoenauer", "authors": "Fei Jiang (INRIA Futurs, INRIA Futurs), Hugues Berry (INRIA Futurs),\n  Marc Schoenauer (INRIA Futurs)", "title": "Optimising the topology of complex neural networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Dans ECCS'07 (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.AI", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper, we study instances of complex neural networks, i.e. neural\nnetwo rks with complex topologies.
