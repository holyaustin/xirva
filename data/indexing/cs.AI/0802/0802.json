In particular, no complete\naxiomatisation of the logic under scrutiny is needed. This does not only\ncomplement our earlier, syntactic, approach conceptually, but also covers a\nwide variety of new examples which are difficult to harness by purely syntactic\nmeans.

The main problem of interaction with such\nspontaneously evolving computational systems is that the data are not uniformly\nstructured. An interesting approach is to try to extract the semantical content\nof the data from their distribution among the nodes. A concept is then\nidentified by finding the community of nodes that share it. The task of data\nstructuring is thus reduced to the task of finding the network communities, as\ngroups of nodes that together perform some non-local data processing.
