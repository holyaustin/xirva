Direct approaches prove termination\ndirectly on the basis of the logic program. Transformational approaches\ntransform a logic program into a term rewrite system (TRS) and then analyze\ntermination of the resulting TRS instead. Thus, transformational approaches\nmake all methods previously developed for TRSs available for logic programs as\nwell. However, the applicability of most existing transformations is quite\nrestricted, as they can only be used for certain subclasses of logic programs.\n(Most of them are restricted to well-moded programs.) In this paper we improve\nthese transformations such that they become applicable for any definite logic\nprogram. To simulate the behavior of logic programs by TRSs, we slightly modify\nthe notion of rewriting by permitting infinite terms. We show that our\ntransformation results in TRSs which are indeed suitable for automated\ntermination analysis. In contrast to most other methods for termination of\nlogic programs, our technique is also sound for logic programming without occur\ncheck, which is typically used in practice. We implemented our approach in the\ntermination prover AProVE and successfully evaluated it on a large collection\nof examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2008 14:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 09:50:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Schneider-Kamp", "P.", ""], ["Giesl", "J.", ""], ["Serebrenik", "A.", ""], ["Thiemann", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.1087", "submitter": "Cl\\'ement Vidal", "authors": "Clement Vidal", "title": "The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial\n  Cosmogenesis", "comments": "The text was improved in many respects, and a new figure was added.\n  Cite as: Vidal, C. 2008.

We argue that a simulation of an\nentire universe will result from future scientific activity. This requires us\nto tackle the challenge of simulating open-ended evolution at all levels in a\nsingle simulation. The simulation should encompass not only biological\nevolution, but also physical evolution (a level below) and cultural evolution\n(a level above). The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we\nwould \"replay the tape of the universe\" with the same or different laws and\ninitial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world\nmodelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire\nuniverse, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that\nwe may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a\nsimulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new\nuniverse.

This is the main motivation for using value-gradients, and it is\nargued that learning value-gradients is the actual objective of any\nvalue-function learning algorithm for control problems. It is also argued that\nlearning value-gradients is significantly more efficient than learning just the\nvalues, and this argument is supported in experiments by efficiency gains of\nseveral orders of magnitude, in several problem domains. Once value-gradients\nare introduced into learning, several analyses become possible. For example, a\nsurprising equivalence between a value-gradient learning algorithm and a\npolicy-gradient learning algorithm is proven, and this provides a robust\nconvergence proof for control problems using a value function with a general\nfunction approximator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 11:57:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Fairbank", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3812", "submitter": "Juan Carlos Nieves", "authors": "Juan Carlos Nieves, Mauricio Osorio, Ulises Cort\\'es", "title": "Preferred extensions as stable models", "comments": "17 pages, 2 Figures; to appear in Theory and Practice of Logic\n  Programming (TPLP)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given an argumentation framework AF, we introduce a mapping function that\nconstructs a disjunctive logic program P, such that the preferred extensions of\nAF correspond to the stable models of P, after intersecting each stable model\nwith the relevant atoms.

It is able to categorize all cells (or\nmolecules) within the body as self-cells or non-self cells. It does this with\nthe help of a distributed task force that has the intelligence to take action\nfrom a local and also a global perspective using its network of chemical\nmessengers for communication. There are two major branches of the immune\nsystem. The innate immune system is an unchanging mechanism that detects and\ndestroys certain invading organisms, whilst the adaptive immune system responds\nto previously unknown foreign cells and builds a response to them that can\nremain in the body over a long period of time. This remarkable information\nprocessing biological system has caught the attention of computer science in\nrecent years. A novel computational intelligence technique, inspired by\nimmunology, has emerged, called Artificial Immune Systems. Several concepts\nfrom the immune have been extracted and applied for solution to real world\nscience and engineering problems. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the\nimmune system metaphors that are relevant to existing Artificial Immune Systems\nmethods. We will then show illustrative real-world problems suitable for\nArtificial Immune Systems and give a step-by-step algorithm walkthrough for one\nsuch problem. A comparison of the Artificial Immune Systems to other well-known\nalgorithms, areas for future work, tips & tricks and a list of resources will\nround this tutorial off. It should be noted that as Artificial Immune Systems\nis still a young and evolving field, there is not yet a fixed algorithm\ntemplate and hence actual implementations might differ somewhat from time to\ntime and from those examples given here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Mar 2008 12:55:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""], ["Dasgupta", "Dipankar", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.4074", "submitter": "Yoshiharu Maeno", "authors": "Yoshiharu Maeno and Yukio Ohsawa", "title": "Reflective visualization and verbalization of unconscious preference", "comments": "This will be submitted to KES Journal", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Advanced Intelligence Paradigms Vol.2,\n  pp.125-139 (2010)", "doi": "10.1504/IJAIP.2010.030531", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new method is presented, that can help a person become aware of his or her\nunconscious preferences, and convey them to others in the form of verbal\nexplanation.

For this reason, research into semantic network metrics\nhas focused primarily on context-based rankings (i.e. user prescribed\ncontexts). Moreover, many of the current semantic network metrics rank semantic\nassociations (i.e. directed paths between two vertices) and not the vertices\nthemselves.

Random walkers, in the context of this article,\nare constrained by a grammar, where the grammar is a user defined data\nstructure that determines the meaning of the final vertex ranking.
