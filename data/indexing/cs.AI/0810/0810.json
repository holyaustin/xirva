The state (action) set can\nbe represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen\naction) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state\naccording to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of\nthe eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is\nparallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL\nsuch as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and\nexploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good\ntradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude\nand can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the\nperformance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given\nand the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm\nfor some complex problems. The present work is also an effective exploration on\nthe application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Oct 2008 13:38:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Daoyi", ""], ["Chen", "Chunlin", ""], ["Li", "Hanxiong", ""], ["Tarn", "Tzyh-Jong", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.3865", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "R.

As a consequence, data points that belong to the same class are\nlocated at a same position, whereas those that belong to different classes are\naway from one another.
