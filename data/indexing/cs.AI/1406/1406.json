If the\nchase terminates, then CQs can be evaluated directly in the resulting set of\nfacts. The chase, however, does not terminate necessarily, and checking whether\nthe chase terminates on a given set of rules and facts is undecidable. Numerous\nacyclicity notions were proposed as sufficient conditions for chase\ntermination. In this paper, we present two new acyclicity notions called\nmodel-faithful acyclicity (MFA) and model-summarising acyclicity (MSA).\nFurthermore, we investigate the landscape of the known acyclicity notions and\nestablish a complete taxonomy of all notions known to us. Finally, we show that\nMFA and MSA generalise most of these notions.\n  Existential rules are closely related to the Horn fragments of the OWL 2\nontology language; furthermore, several prominent OWL 2 reasoners implement CQ\nanswering by using the chase to materialise all relevant facts. In order to\navoid termination problems, many of these systems handle only the OWL 2 RL\nprofile of OWL 2; furthermore, some systems go beyond OWL 2 RL, but without any\ntermination guarantees. In this paper we also investigate whether various\nacyclicity notions can provide a principled and practical solution to these\nproblems. On the theoretical side, we show that query answering for acyclic\nontologies is of lower complexity than for general ontologies.

Hilbert terms rather differ from choice functions in\nthat there is one polymorphic operator and not one operator per formula. They\nalso open an intriguing connection between the logic for meaning assembly, the\ntyped lambda calculus handling compositionality and the many-sorted logic for\nsemantical representations.
