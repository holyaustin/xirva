The proponents of the Web of Data envision much of\nthe world's data being interrelated and openly accessible to the general\npublic. This vision is analogous in many ways to the Web of Documents of common\nknowledge, but instead of making documents and media openly accessible, the\nfocus is on making data openly accessible. In providing data for public use,\nthere has been a stimulated interest in a movement dubbed Open Data. Open Data\nis analogous in many ways to the Open Source movement. However, instead of\nfocusing on software, Open Data is focused on the legal and licensing issues\naround publicly exposed data. Together, various technological and legal tools\nare laying the groundwork for the future of global-scale data management on the\nWeb. As of today, in its early form, the Web of Data hosts a variety of data\nsets that include encyclopedic facts, drug and protein data, metadata on music,\nbooks and scholarly articles, social network representations, geospatial\ninformation, and many other types of information. The size and diversity of the\nWeb of Data is a demonstration of the flexibility of the underlying standards\nand the overall feasibility of the project as a whole. The purpose of this\narticle is to provide a review of the technological underpinnings of the Web of\nData as well as some of the hurdles that need to be overcome if the Web of Data\nis to emerge as the defacto medium for data representation, distribution, and\nultimately, processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 01:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2050", "submitter": "Guido Tack", "authors": "Christian Schulte and Guido Tack", "title": "View-based Propagator Derivation", "comments": "28 pages, 7 tables, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When implementing a propagator for a constraint, one must decide about\nvariants: When implementing min, should one also implement max? Should one\nimplement linear constraints both with unit and non-unit coefficients?\nConstraint variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if\nnot prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better\nperformance than resorting to constraint decomposition.\n  This paper shows how to use views to derive perfect propagator variants. A\nmodel for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are\nproved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as\ncorrectness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically\nderiving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization,\nand type conversion are developed. The paper introduces an implementation\narchitecture for views that is independent of the underlying constraint\nprogramming system. A detailed evaluation of views implemented in Gecode shows\nthat derived propagators are efficient and that views often incur no overhead.\nWithout views, Gecode would either require 180 000 rather than 40 000 lines of\npropagator code, or would lack many efficient propagator variants. Compared to\n8 000 lines of code for views, the reduction in code for propagators yields a\n1750% return on investment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2009 12:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Schulte", "Christian", ""], ["Tack", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3091", "submitter": "Attila Egri-Nagy", "authors": "Attila Egri-Nagy and Chrystopher L.
