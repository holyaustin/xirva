The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be\na vector representing the contexts in which it occurs in the corpus model.\nBased on this assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words\ncan be considered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in\napplications of vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an\nunderlying lattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice\nas describing entailment between meanings. We also define the context-theoretic\nprobability of a string, and, based on this and the lattice structure, a degree\nof entailment between strings.\n  We relate the framework to existing methods of composing vector-based\nrepresentations of meaning, and show that our approach generalises many of\nthese, including vector addition, component-wise multiplication, and the tensor\nproduct.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Jan 2011 09:52:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Clarke", "Daoud", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4573", "submitter": "Alfredo Braunstein", "authors": "M.

Many of the current approaches to context-awareness either lack a solid\ntheoretical basis for modeling or ignore important requirements such as\nmodularity, high-order uncertainty management and group-based\ncontext-awareness. Therefore, their real-world application and extendability\nremains limited. In this paper, we present f-Context as a service-based\ncontext-awareness framework, based on language-action perspective (LAP) theory\nfor modeling. Then we identify some of the complex, informational parts of\ncontext which contain high-order uncertainties due to differences between\nmembers of the group in defining them. An agent-based perceptual computer\narchitecture is proposed for implementing f-Context that uses computing with\nwords (CWW) for handling uncertainty. The feasibility of f-Context is analyzed\nusing a realistic scenario involving a group of mobile users. We believe that\nthe proposed approach can open the door to future research on context-awareness\nby offering a theoretical foundation based on human communication, and a\nservice-based layered architecture which exploits CWW for context-aware,\ngroup-based and platform-independent access to information systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 06:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ghadiri", "Nasser", ""], ["Baraani-Dastjerdi", "Ahmad", ""], ["Ghasem-Aghaee", "Nasser", ""], ["Nematbakhsh", "Mohammad A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5632", "submitter": "Kian Hsiang Low", "authors": "Kian Hsiang Low, John M.

Existing information-theoretic exploration strategies for\nlearning GP-based environmental field maps adopt the non-Markovian problem\nstructure and consequently scale poorly with the length of history of\nobservations. Hence, it becomes computationally impractical to use these\nstrategies for in situ, real-time active sampling. To ease this computational\nburden, this paper presents a Markov-based approach to efficient\ninformation-theoretic path planning for active sampling of GP-based fields. We\nanalyze the time complexity of solving the Markov-based path planning problem,\nand demonstrate analytically that it scales better than that of deriving the\nnon-Markovian strategies with increasing length of planning horizon. For a\nclass of exploration tasks called the transect sampling task, we provide\ntheoretical guarantees on the active sampling performance of our Markov-based\npolicy, from which ideal environmental field conditions and sampling task\nsettings can be established to limit its performance degradation due to\nviolation of the Markov assumption. Empirical evaluation on real-world\ntemperature and plankton density field data shows that our Markov-based policy\ncan generally achieve active sampling performance comparable to that of the\nwidely-used non-Markovian greedy policies under less favorable realistic field\nconditions and task settings while enjoying significant computational gain over\nthem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 21:27:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Low", "Kian Hsiang", ""], ["Dolan", "John M.", ""], ["Khosla", "Pradeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.6001", "submitter": "Andrea Roli", "authors": "Andrea Roli and Mattia Manfroni and Carlo Pinciroli and Mauro\n  Birattari", "title": "Boolean network robotics: a proof of concept", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.NE cs.RO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dynamical systems theory and complexity science provide powerful tools for\nanalysing artificial agents and robots.
