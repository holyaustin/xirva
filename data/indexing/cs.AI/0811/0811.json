In this\npaper, we study the Airport Gate Assignment Problem (AGAP), propose a new model\nand implement the model with Optimization Programming language (OPL). With the\nobjective to minimize the number of conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts\nassigned to the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical\nconstraints and the binary constraints, which can provide an efficient\nevaluation criterion for the Airlines to estimate the current gate assignment.\nTo illustrate the feasibility of the model we construct experiments with the\ndata obtained from Continental Airlines, Houston Gorge Bush Intercontinental\nAirport IAH, which indicate that our model is both energetic and effective.\nMoreover, we interpret experimental results, which further demonstrate that our\nproposed model can provide a powerful tool for airline companies to estimate\nthe efficiency of their current work of gate assignment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2008 02:33:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chendong", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.1711", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Sarah Wright and Tshilidzi Marwala", "title": "Artificial Intelligence Techniques for Steam Generator Modelling", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the use of different Artificial Intelligence methods\nto predict the values of several continuous variables from a Steam Generator.\nThe objective was to determine how the different artificial intelligence\nmethods performed in making predictions on the given dataset.

Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and\ndensity, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase\nfitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by\nsharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions\nthroughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces\ndiversity of actions.

An evaluation of our methods on three data\nsets shows that they are computationally feasible for realistic table sizes,\nand that the learned structures represent the statistical information in the\ndatabases well.
