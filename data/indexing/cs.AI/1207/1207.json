Prior knowledge is rarely used in current solutions due to the\nlack of a systematic approach to incorporate it into the E/E strategy.\n  To address a specific class of E/E problems, we propose to proceed in three\nsteps: (i) model prior knowledge in the form of a probability distribution over\nthe target class of E/E problems; (ii) choose a large hypothesis space of\ncandidate E/E strategies; and (iii), solve an optimization problem to find a\ncandidate E/E strategy of maximal average performance over a sample of problems\ndrawn from the prior distribution.\n  We illustrate this meta-learning approach with two different hypothesis\nspaces: one where E/E strategies are numerically parameterized and another\nwhere E/E strategies are represented as small symbolic formulas.

In this paper, we consider a novel solution for this challenge that\ncombines generative planning on incomplete domain models with a library of plan\ncases that are known to be correct. While this was arguably the original\nmotivation for case-based planning, most existing case-based planners assume\n(and depend on) from-scratch planners that work on complete domain models. In\ncontrast, our approach views the plan generated with respect to the incomplete\nmodel as a \"skeletal plan\" and augments it with directed mining of plan\nfragments from library cases. We will present the details of our approach and\npresent an empirical evaluation of our method in comparison to a\nstate-of-the-art case-based planner that depends on complete domain models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jul 2012 17:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Zhuo", "Hankz Hankui", ""], ["Kambhampati", "Subbarao", ""], ["Nguyen", "Tuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7079", "submitter": "Jos Vermaseren A", "authors": "J.
