For each time-stage, this\nenvironment randomly transmits Shannon type information-packets to the\ndecision-maker, who examines each of them for relevancy and then determines his\noptimal choices. Using this set of relevant information-packets, the\ndecision-maker adapts, over time, to the stochastic nature of his environment,\nand optimizes the subjective expected rate-of-growth of knowledge. The\ndecision-maker's optimal actions, lead to a decision function that involves,\nover time, his view of the subjective entropy of the environmental process and\nother important parameters at each time-stage of the process. Using this model\nof human behavior, one could create psychometric experiments using computer\nsimulation and real decision-makers, to play programmed games to measure the\nresulting human performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 20:43:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Murphy", "Roy E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0701", "submitter": "Alexandre d'Aspremont", "authors": "Ronny Luss, Alexandre d'Aspremont", "title": "Clustering and Feature Selection using Sparse Principal Component\n  Analysis", "comments": "More experiments", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.MS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the application of sparse principal component\nanalysis (PCA) to clustering and feature selection problems.
