Given a set of quartet topologies over a\nset of taxa, the Maximum Quartet Consistency (MQC) problem consists of\ncomputing a global phylogeny that satisfies the maximum number of quartets. A\nnumber of solutions have been proposed for the MQC problem, including Dynamic\nProgramming, Constraint Programming, and more recently Answer Set Programming\n(ASP). ASP is currently the most efficient approach for optimally solving the\nMQC problem. This paper proposes encoding the MQC problem with pseudo-Boolean\n(PB) constraints. The use of PB allows solving the MQC problem with efficient\nPB solvers, and also allows considering different modeling approaches for the\nMQC problem. Initial results are promising, and suggest that PB can be an\neffective alternative for solving the MQC problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 10:06:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Morgado", "Antonio", ""], ["Marques-Silva", "Joao", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0459", "submitter": "\\^Hamed  \\\"Owladeghaffari", "authors": "Hamed Owladeghaffari", "title": "Phase transition in SONFIS&SORST", "comments": "submitted to :The Sixth International Conference on Rough Sets and\n  Current Trends in Computing; Akron, Ohio, USA,2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-88425-5_35", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, we introduce general frame of MAny Connected Intelligent\nParticles Systems (MACIPS).

Conservatively extending classical predicate calculus and offering\nconsiderable additional expressive and deductive power, CL12 presents a\nreasonable, computationally meaningful, constructive alternative to classical\nlogic as a basis for applied theories. To obtain a model example of such\ntheories, this paper rebuilds the traditional, classical-logic-based Peano\narithmetic into a computability-logic-based counterpart. Among the purposes of\nthe present contribution is to provide a starting point for what, as the author\nwishes to hope, might become a new line of research with a potential of\ninteresting findings -- an exploration of the presumably quite unusual\nmetatheory of CL-based arithmetic and other CL-based applied systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2008 18:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2009 15:10:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2009 18:09:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2009 04:49:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Japaridze", "Giorgi", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3747", "submitter": "Anon Plangprasopchok", "authors": "Anon Plangprasopchok and Kristina Lerman", "title": "Constructing Folksonomies from User-specified Relations on Flickr", "comments": "14 Pages, Submitted to the Workshop on Web Mining and Web Usage\n  Analysis (WebKDD 2008)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many social Web sites allow users to publish content and annotate with\ndescriptive metadata. In addition to flat tags, some social Web sites have\nrecently began to allow users to organize their content and metadata\nhierarchically. The social photosharing site Flickr, for example, allows users\nto group related photos in sets, and related sets in collections. The social\nbookmarking site Del.icio.us similarly lets users group related tags into\nbundles. Although the sites themselves don't impose any constraints on how\nthese hierarchies are used, individuals generally use them to capture\nrelationships between concepts, most commonly the broader/narrower relations.\nCollective annotation of content with hierarchical relations may lead to an\nemergent classification system, called a folksonomy. While some researchers\nhave explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies, we believe that\nhierarchical relations described above offer a high-quality source of evidence\nfor this task.\n  We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many\ndistinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy. Our approach uses statistics to\ndetermine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded. The\nrelations are then woven together into larger hierarchies. Although we have not\ncarried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach, it looks very\npromising since it generates very reasonable, non-trivial hierarchies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 May 2008 07:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Plangprasopchok", "Anon", ""], ["Lerman", "Kristina", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3799", "submitter": "Fionn Murtagh", "authors": "Fionn Murtagh, Adam Ganz and Stewart McKie", "title": "The Structure of Narrative: the Case of Film Scripts", "comments": "28 pages, 7 figures, 21 references", "journal-ref": "Pattern Recognition, 42 (2), 302-312, 2009", "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2008.05.026", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the style and structure of story narrative using the case of film\nscripts.

Each time a clinician has to urgently take a\npatient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma\ntreatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the\ncondition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly.\nWhat happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about\nthe severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can\nbe fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from\nposttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can\nwe reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been\nshown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of\naveraging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty\nin decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at\nselecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We\nassume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows\nus to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in\ndecisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce\nthe cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers.

The second reason motivates us to\nenrich the incomplete annotation in a simple way before learning topic models.\nIn particular, some imagined keywords are poured into the incomplete annotation\nthrough measuring similarity between keywords. Then, both given and imagined\nannotations are used to learning probabilistic topic models for automatically\nannotating new images.
