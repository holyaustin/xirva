The calculation of Pseudomodal\nEnergies, for the purposes of condition monitoring, has previously been found\nto be an accurate method of extracting features from vibration signals. This\ncalculation is therefore used to extract features from vibration signals\nobtained from a diverse population of cylindrical shells. Some of the cylinders\nin the population have faults in different substructures. The pseudomodal\nenergies calculated from the vibration signals are then used as inputs to a\nneuro-fuzzy model. A leave-one-out cross-validation process is used to test the\nperformance of the model. It is found that the neuro-fuzzy model is able to\nclassify faults with an accuracy of 91.62%, which is higher than the previously\nused multilayer perceptron.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 May 2007 20:34:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Marwala", "Tshilidzi", ""], ["Tettey", "Thando", ""], ["Chakraverty", "Snehashish", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.2305", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Sizwe M.
