However, there is no single\nformalism to specify all three kinds of information. We therefore propose a\nframework, based on both CP-nets and soft constraints, that handles both hard\nand soft constraints as well as conditional preferences efficiently and\nuniformly. We study the complexity of testing the consistency of preference\nstatements, and show how soft constraints can faithfully approximate the\nsemantics of conditional preference statements whilst improving the\ncomputational complexity\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 May 2009 21:55:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Domshlak", "Carmel", ""], ["Rossi", "Francesca", ""], ["Venable", "Kristen Brent", ""], ["Walsh", "Toby", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3769", "submitter": "Toby Walsh", "authors": "Alan M.
