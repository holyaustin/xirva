Recent work\nhas shown that the use of meta-features, additional inputs describing each\nexample in a dataset, can boost the performance of ensemble methods, but the\ngreatest reported gains have come from nonlinear procedures requiring\nsignificant tuning and training time. Here, we present a linear technique,\nFeature-Weighted Linear Stacking (FWLS), that incorporates meta-features for\nimproved accuracy while retaining the well-known virtues of linear regression\nregarding speed, stability, and interpretability. FWLS combines model\npredictions linearly using coefficients that are themselves linear functions of\nmeta-features. This technique was a key facet of the solution of the second\nplace team in the recently concluded Netflix Prize competition.

Here we propose that rewards can be defined for any probability\ndistribution based on three desiderata, namely that rewards should be\nreal-valued, additive and order-preserving, where the latter implies that more\nprobable events should also be more desirable. Our main result states that\nrewards are then uniquely determined by the negative information content. To\nanalyze stochastic processes, we define the utility of a realization as its\nreward rate. Under this interpretation, we show that the expected utility of a\nstochastic process is its negative entropy rate. Furthermore, we apply our\nresults to analyze agent-environment interactions. We show that the expected\nutility that will actually be achieved by the agent is given by the negative\ncross-entropy from the input-output (I/O) distribution of the coupled\ninteraction system and the agent's I/O distribution. Thus, our results allow\nfor an information-theoretic interpretation of the notion of utility and the\ncharacterization of agent-environment interactions in terms of entropy\ndynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2009 15:56:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 23:30:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ortega", "Pedro A.", ""], ["Braun", "Daniel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5372", "submitter": "Srinivas Turaga", "authors": "Srinivas C.

To measure numerically the roughness of an approximation,\nPawlak introduced a quantitative measure of roughness by using the ratio of the\ncardinalities of the lower and upper approximations. Although the roughness\nmeasure is effective, it has the drawback of not being strictly monotonic with\nrespect to the standard ordering on partitions. Recently, some improvements\nhave been made by taking into account the granularity of partitions. In this\npaper, we approach the roughness measure in an axiomatic way. After\naxiomatically defining roughness measure and partition measure, we provide a\nunified construction of roughness measure, called strong Pawlak roughness\nmeasure, and then explore the properties of this measure. We show that the\nimproved roughness measures in the literature are special instances of our\nstrong Pawlak roughness measure and introduce three more strong Pawlak\nroughness measures as well. The advantage of our axiomatic approach is that\nsome properties of a roughness measure follow immediately as soon as the\nmeasure satisfies the relevant axiomatic definition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2009 11:07:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2010 12:04:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5548", "submitter": "Xiaofei Huang", "authors": "Xiaofei Huang", "title": "A Decision-Optimization Approach to Quantum Mechanics and Game Theory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fundamental laws of quantum world upsets the logical foundation of\nclassic physics.
