Consequently, larger\namounts of data must be acquired and processed by the beamformer. The\nsignificant growth in the amounts of data effects both machinery size and power\nconsumption. Within the classical sampling framework, state of the art systems\nreduce processing rates by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected\nsignals. It has been recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate\nreduction may be obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite\nRate of Innovation framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which\ncombines classic methods from sampling theory with recent developments in\nCompressed Sensing. Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual\ntransducer elements, which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is\nlimited by the noisy nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous\nparameter extraction, bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the\nlow-rate samples. In our work, we manage to achieve such SNR enhancement, by\nbeamforming the sub-Nyquist samples obtained from multiple elements. We refer\nto this process as \"compressed beamforming\". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound\ndata, we successfully image macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly\neight-fold reduction in sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Nov 2011 11:54:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wagner", "Noam", ""], ["Eldar", "Yonina C.", ""], ["Feuer", "Arie", ""], ["Friedman", "Zvi", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.1204", "submitter": "Lachhman Das Dhomeja", "authors": "Lachhman Das Dhomeja, Yasir Arfat Malkani, Asad Ali Shaikh and Ayaz\n  Keerio", "title": "Transparent caching of virtual stubs for improved performance in\n  ubiquitous environments", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1108.1472 by other authors", "journal-ref": "Lachhman Das Dhomeja, Yasir Arfat Malkani, Asad Ali Shaikh and\n  Ayaz Keerio, \"Transparent Caching of Virtual Stubs for Improved Performance\n  in Ubiquitous Environments \", International Journal of UbiComp (IJU), Vol.2,\n  No.4, October 2011", "doi": "10.5121/iju.2011.2401", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context-awareness is an essential requirement for pervasive computing\napplications, which enables them to adapt and perform tasks based on context.\nOne of the adaptive features of context-awareness is contextual\nreconfiguration.

Adapting envelope analysis to\ncharacterize the milling tool materials is an important contribution to the\nqualitative and quantitative characterization of milling capacity and a step by\nmodeling the three-dimensional cutting process. An experimental protocol was\ndesigned and developed for the acquisition, processing and analyzing\nthree-dimensional signal. The vibration envelope analysis is proposed to detect\nthe cutting capacity of the tool with the optimization application of cutting\nparameters. The research is focused on FFT Fourier transform optimization of\nvibration analysis and vibration envelope to evaluate the dynamic behavior of\nthe machine/ tool/workpiece\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Jan 2012 08:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bisu", "Claudiu-Florinel", "", "MPS"], ["Zapciu", "Miron", "", "MPS"], ["G\u00e9rard", "Alain", "", "I2M"], ["Vijelea", "V.", "", "DC"], ["Anica", "Marin", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.4553", "submitter": "Loet Leydesdorff", "authors": "Loet Leydesdorff", "title": "The Knowledge-Based Economy and the Triple Helix Model", "comments": "Annual Review of Information Science and Technology 44 (2010)\n  367-417; preprint version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  1.
