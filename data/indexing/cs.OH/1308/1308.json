The\nclassical method to solve this problem is based on division operation. In this\npaper, we investigate a decimal-to-binary conversion method based on addition\noperation. The method is very easily implemented by software. The cost analysis\nshows that the latter is more preferable than the classical method. Thus the\ncurrent Input/Output translation hardware to convert between the internal digit\npairs and the external standard BCD codes can be reasonably removed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 06:15:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Zhengjun", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.1797", "submitter": "Umakant Mishra", "authors": "Umakant Mishra", "title": "Introduction to Management Information system", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Management Information System (MIS) is a systematic organization and\npresentation of information that is generally required by the management of an\norganization for taking better decisions for the organization.

All\ncomponents in the air traffic system are connected to form an interactive\nnetwork. So, a disturbance that occurs in one component, for example, a severe\ndelay at an airport, can influence the entire network. Delays are easily\npropagated between flights through gates, but the propagation can be reduced if\ngate assignments are robust against stochastic delays. In this paper, we\nanalyze gate delays and suggest an approach that involves assigning gates while\nmaking them robust against stochastic delays. We extract an example flight\nschedule from data source and generate schedules with increased traffic to\nanalyze how the compact flight schedules impact the robustness of gate\nassignment. Simulation results show that our approach improves the robustness\nof gate assignment. Particularly, the robust gate assignment reduces average\nduration of gate conflicts by 96.3% and the number of gate conflicts by 96.7%\ncompared to the baseline assignment. However, the robust gate assignment\nresults in longer transit time for passengers, and a trade-off between the\nrobustness of gate assignment and passenger transit time is presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 16:55:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Sang Hyun", ""], ["Feron", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6251", "submitter": "Rad Niazadeh", "authors": "Rad Niazadeh, Sahar Nassirpour, Mohammad B.
