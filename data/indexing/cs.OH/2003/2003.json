As\nmemories contribute an estimated 25% to 40% to the overall power, performance,\nand area (PPA) of a chip, memories must be designed carefully to meet the\nsystem's requirements. Memory arrays are highly uniform and can be described by\napproximately 10 parameters depending mostly on the complexity of the\nperiphery. Thus, to improve PPA utilization, memories are typically generated\nby memory compilers. A key task in the design flow of a chip is to find optimal\nmemory compiler parametrizations which on the one hand fulfill system\nrequirements while on the other hand optimize PPA. Although most compiler\nvendors also provide optimizers for this task, these are often slow or\ninaccurate. To enable efficient optimization in spite of long compiler run\ntimes, we propose training fully connected feed-forward neural networks to\npredict PPA outputs given a memory compiler parametrization. Using an\nexhaustive search-based optimizer framework which obtains neural network\npredictions, PPA-optimal parametrizations are found within seconds after chip\ndesigners have specified their requirements. Average model prediction errors of\nless than 3%, a decision reliability of over 99% and productive usage of the\noptimizer for successful, large volume chip design projects illustrate the\neffectiveness of the approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2020 13:11:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Last", "Felix", ""], ["Haeberlein", "Max", ""], ["Schlichtmann", "Ulf", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.04204", "submitter": "Hongbo Zou", "authors": "Hongbo Zou, Hsuanwei Michelle Chen and Sharmistha Dey", "title": "Engaging Users through Social Media in Public Libraries", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.HC cs.LG cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The participatory library is an emerging concept which refers to the idea\nthat an integrated library system must allow users to take part in core\nfunctions of the library rather than engaging on the periphery.

Traditional approaches use cameras, body sensor networks,\nor radio patterns from various sources for activity recognition. However, these\napproaches are limited due to ease-of-use, coverage, or privacy preserving\nissues. In this paper, we present a novel wearable Radio Frequency\nIdentification (RFID) system aims at providing an easy-to-use solution with\nhigh detection coverage. Our system uses passive tags which are\nmaintenance-free and can be embedded into the clothes to reduce the wearing and\nmaintenance efforts. A small RFID reader is also worn on the user's body to\nextend the detection coverage as the user moves. We exploit RFID radio patterns\nand extract both spatial and temporal features to characterize various\nactivities. We also address the issues of false negative of tag readings and\ntag/antenna calibration, and design a fast online recognition system. Antenna\nand tag selection is done automatically to explore the minimum number of\ndevices required to achieve target accuracy. We develop a prototype system\nwhich consists of a wearable RFID system and a smartphone to demonstrate the\nworking principles, and conduct experimental studies with four subjects over\ntwo weeks. The results show that our system achieves a high recognition\naccuracy of 93.6 percent with a latency of 5 seconds.

However, many digital-twin-related approaches, found in\nindustries as well as literature, mainly focus on modelling individual physical\nthings with high-fidelity methods with limited scalability. In this paper, we\nintroduce a digital-twin architecture called TiLA (Twin-in-the-Loop\nArchitecture). TiLA employs heterogeneous models and online data to create a\ndigital twin, which follows a Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS)\nmodel of computation. It facilitates the creation of a scalable digital twin\nwith different levels of modelling abstraction as well as giving GALS formalism\nfor execution strategy. Furthermore, TiLA provides facilities to develop\napplications around the twin as well as an interface to synchronise the twin\nwith the physical system through an industrial communication protocol. A\ndigital twin for a manufacturing line has been developed as a case study using\nTiLA. It demonstrates the use of digital twin models together with online data\nfor monitoring and analysing failures in the physical system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2020 03:31:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Heejong", ""], ["Easwaran", "Arvind", ""], ["Andalam", "Sidharta", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.12463", "submitter": "Marcelo Fernandes", "authors": "Jos\\'e C.
