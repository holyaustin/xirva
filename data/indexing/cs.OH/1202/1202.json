The\nloss of sub channel orthogonality leads to inter-carrier interference (ICI).\nUsing many algorithms for channel estimation, we will show that, for a 16- QAM\nmodulation, the LMMSE algorithm performs well to achieve this estimation but\nwhen the SNR (Signal Noise Rate) is high, the four algorithms (LS, MMSE, LMMSE\nand Lr-LMMSE) perform similarly, this is not always the case for another scheme\nof modulation. We will improve also the mean squared error for these\nalgorithms. It will be illustrious in this paper that the LMMSE algorithm\nperforms well with the block- pilot insertion as well as its low rank version\nwhich behave very good even when the size of FFT is very high.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 22:49:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zaier", "Aida", ""], ["Bouallegue", "Ridha", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1680", "submitter": "Deepali Kadam", "authors": "D.

The scope of the engagement was to establish a standard set of\nprocesses based on CMMI\\textregistered and ITIL\\textregistered Framework across\nfour business verticals scattered in Europe, United States and Asia. The\nservices of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were\nleveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as\nthe Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS\nimplementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at\nthe organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the\nbusiness verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and\nmanaged by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be\nachieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity. This called for a need to\ndevise an innovative implementation solution before moving to a process\nimplementation model which proposed Project Managers implementing processes\nthemself. While there are process models and frameworks available in the market\nfor establishing processes in an organization, there is no model that\nelaborates activities to be performed by the SQA for effective implementation\nof processes. SQA service maturity model was proposed as a solution based on\nCMMI\\textregistered and developed to eventually proceed towards a 'Process\nImplementation Model proposing Project Managers implementing processes\nthemself'.\n  SQA Service Maturity Model is a Software Quality Assurance implementation\nframework that enables organisations to increase Efficiencies in Software\nQuality Assurance, reduce the Cost of Defects and ultimately Increasing Return\non Investment in IT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2012 15:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Shankar", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.5944", "submitter": "Olivia Saierli", "authors": "Alina Oana Zamo\\c{s}teanu", "title": "Computer applications in clinical psychology", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": "Ann.
