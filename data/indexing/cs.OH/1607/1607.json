To avoid the aforementioned problems, we\npropose Accelerated Evaluation, focusing on the car-following scenario. The\nstochastic human-controlled vehicle (HV) motions are modeled based on 1.3\nmillion miles of naturalistic driving data collected by the University of\nMichigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The statistics of the HV\nbehaviors are then modified to generate more intense interactions between HVs\nand AVs to accelerate the evaluation procedure. The Importance Sampling theory\nwas used to ensure that the safety benefits of AVs are accurately assessed\nunder accelerated tests. Crash, injury and conflict rates for a simulated AV\nare simulated to demonstrate the proposed approach. Results show that test\nduration is reduced by a factor of 300 to 100,000 compared with the\nnon-accelerated (naturalistic) evaluation.
