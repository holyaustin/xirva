These new, second-order causal processes enable\nus to treat the input processes as 'local laboratories' whose causal ordering\nneeds not be fixed in advance. Using this characterization, we give a\nfully-diagrammatic proof of a non-trivial theorem: namely that being\ncausality-preserving on separable processes implies being 'completely'\ncausality preserving. That is, causality is preserved even when the 'local\nlaboratories' are allowed to have ancilla systems. An immediate consequence is\nthat preserving causality is separable processes is equivalence to preserving\ncausality for strongly non-signalling (a.k.a. localizable) processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 11:15:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kissinger", "Aleks", "", "Radboud University"], ["Uijlen", "Sander", "", "Radboud\n  University"]]}, {"id": "1701.01726", "submitter": "Ramiro Marco Figuera", "authors": "R.

Between events, the\nstate does not change, resulting in a a piecewise constant state trajectory.\nMain advantages of DEVS are its rigorous formal definition, and its support for\nmodular composition.\n  This chapter introduces the Classic DEVS formalism in a bottom-up fashion,\nusing a simple traffic light example. The syntax and operational semantics of\nAtomic (i.e., non-hierarchical) models are intruced first. The semantics of\nCoupled (hierarchical) models is then given by translation into Atomic DEVS\nmodels. As this formal \"flattening\" is not efficient, a modular abstract\nsimulator which operates directly on the coupled model is also presented. This\nis the common basis for subsequent efficient implementations. We continue to\nactual applications of DEVS modelling and simulation, as seen in performance\nanalysis for queueing systems.
