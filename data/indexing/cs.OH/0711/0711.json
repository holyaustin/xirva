This work presents a new method for the modeling of fringing\nfield, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor.\nNumerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on\nthis model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of\ninput-to-state stabilization (ISS) and back-stepping state feedback design. The\nstability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are\ndemonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2007 10:27:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseini", "M.", ""], ["Zhu", "G.", ""], ["Peter", "Y. -A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.4516", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Philippe Merloz (CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato), Jocelyne Troccaz\n  (TIMC), Herv\\'e Vouaillat (CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato), Christian Vasile\n  (CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato), J\\'er\\^ome Tonetti (CHU-Grenoble\n  ortho-traumato), Ahmad Eid (CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato), St\\'ephane Plaweski\n  (CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato)", "title": "Fluoroscopy-based navigation system in spine surgery", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

The aim of the current\npaper is to describe a computer-assisted surgical navigation system based on\nfluoroscopic X-ray image calibration and three-dimensional optical localizers\nin order to reduce radiation exposure while increasing accuracy and reliability\nof the surgical procedure for pedicle screw insertion. Instrumentation using\ntranspedicular screw fixation was performed: in a first group, a conventional\nsurgical procedure was carried out with 26 patients (138 screws); in a second\ngroup, a navigated surgical procedure (virtual fluoroscopy) was performed with\n26 patients (140 screws). Evaluation of screw placement in every case was done\nby using plain X-rays and post-operative computer tomography scan. A 5 per cent\ncortex penetration (7 of 140 pedicle screws) occurred for the computer-assisted\ngroup. A 13 per cent penetration (18 of 138 pedicle screws) occurred for the\nnon computer-assisted group. The radiation running time for each vertebra level\n(two screws) reached 3.5 s on average in the computer-assisted group and 11.5 s\non average in the non computer-assisted group. The operative time for two\nscrews on the same vertebra level reaches 10 min on average in the non\ncomputer-assisted group and 11.9 min on average in the computer-assisted group.\nThe fluoroscopy-based (two-dimensional) navigation system for pedicle screw\ninsertion is a safe and reliable procedure for surgery in the lower thoracic\nand lumbar spine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 15:19:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Merloz", "Philippe", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"], ["Vouaillat", "Herv\u00e9", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Vasile", "Christian", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Tonetti", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "", "CHU-Grenoble\n  ortho-traumato"], ["Eid", "Ahmad", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Plaweski", "St\u00e9phane", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"]]}, {"id": "0711.4523", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Thomas Martinelli (CHU-Grenoble radio), Jean-Luc Bosson (TIMC,\n  CHU-Grenoble CIC), Luc Bressollette, Franck Pelissier, Eric Boidard (TIMC),\n  Jocelyne Troccaz (TIMC), Philippe Cinquin (TIMC)", "title": "Robot-based tele-echography: clinical evaluation of the TER system in\n  abdominal aortic exploration", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the\n  American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine 26, 11 (2007) 1611-6", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": null, "abstract": "  OBJECTIVE: The TER system is a robot-based tele-echography system allowing\nremote ultrasound examination. The specialist moves a mock-up of the ultrasound\nprobe at the master site, and the robot reproduces the movements of the real\nprobe, which sends back ultrasound images and force feedback. This tool could\nbe used to perform ultrasound examinations in small health care centers or from\nisolated sites. The objective of this study was to prove, under real\nconditions, the feasibility and reliability of the TER system in detecting\nabdominal aortic and iliac aneurysms. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients were\nincluded in 2 centers in Brest and Grenoble, France. The remote examination was\ncompared with the reference standard, the bedside examination, for aorta and\niliac artery diameter measurement, detection and description of aneurysms,\ndetection of atheromatosis, the duration of the examination, and acceptability.\nRESULTS: All aneurysms (8) were detected by both techniques as intramural\nthrombosis and extension to the iliac arteries. The interobserver correlation\ncoefficient was 0.982 (P < .0001) for aortic diameters. The rate of concordance\nbetween 2 operators in evaluating atheromatosis was 84% +/- 11% (95% confidence\ninterval). CONCLUSIONS: Our study on 58 patients suggests that the TER system\ncould be a reliable, acceptable, and effective robot-based system for\nperforming remote abdominal aortic ultrasound examinations. Research is\ncontinuing to improve the equipment for general abdominal use.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2007 15:51:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Martinelli", "Thomas", "", "CHU-Grenoble radio"], ["Bosson", "Jean-Luc", "", "TIMC,\n  CHU-Grenoble CIC"], ["Bressollette", "Luc", "", "TIMC"], ["Pelissier", "Franck", "", "TIMC"], ["Boidard", "Eric", "", "TIMC"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"], ["Cinquin", "Philippe", "", "TIMC"]]}, {"id": "0711.4944", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Jean-Alexandre Long (TIMC), Philippe Cinquin (TIMC), Jocelyne Troccaz\n  (TIMC), Sandrine Voros (TIMC), Jean-Luc Descotes, Peter Berkelman (TIMC),\n  Christian Letoublon, Jean-Jacques Rambeaud", "title": "Development of miniaturized light endoscope-holder robot for\n  laparoscopic surgery", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Endourology 21, 8 (2007) 911-4", "doi": "10.1089/end.2006.0328", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": null, "abstract": "  PURPOSE: We have conducted experiments with an innovatively designed robot\nendoscope holder for laparoscopic surgery that is small and low cost. MATERIALS\nAND METHODS: A compact light endoscope robot (LER) that is placed on the\npatient's skin and can be used with the patient in the lateral or dorsal supine\nposition was tested on cadavers and laboratory pigs in order to allow\nsuccessive modifications. The current control system is based on voice\nrecognition. The range of vision is 360 degrees with an angle of 160 degrees .\nTwenty-three procedures were performed. RESULTS: The tests made it possible to\nadvance the prototype on a variety of aspects, including reliability,\nsteadiness, ergonomics, and dimensions. The ease of installation of the robot,\nwhich takes only 5 minutes, and the easy handling made it possible for 21 of\nthe 23 procedures to be performed without an assistant. CONCLUSION: The LER is\na camera holder guided by the surgeon's voice that can eliminate the need for\nan assistant during laparoscopic surgery. The ease of installation and\nmanufacture should make it an effective and inexpensive system for use on\npatients in the lateral and dorsal supine positions. Randomized clinical trials\nwill soon validate a new version of this robot prior to marketing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2007 14:40:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Long", "Jean-Alexandre", "", "TIMC"], ["Cinquin", "Philippe", "", "TIMC"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"], ["Voros", "Sandrine", "", "TIMC"], ["Descotes", "Jean-Luc", "", "TIMC"], ["Berkelman", "Peter", "", "TIMC"], ["Letoublon", "Christian", ""], ["Rambeaud", "Jean-Jacques", ""]]}]
