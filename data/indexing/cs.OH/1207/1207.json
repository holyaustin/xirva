Several variations of their\ncurvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or\nthe machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of\nseveral parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of\nshapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure\nparts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several\ndeep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High\nSpeed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity\nlevel because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is\ngenerally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be\nsufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to\nan important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the\nCAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise\nchoice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for\nprismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely\nimplemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds\nof CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging\ndies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining\nareas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these\nareas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining\npreparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of\ncomplex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas\nextracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models\nof the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant\nduring machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he\ncarried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is\nbased on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which\nrepresent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical\nfeatures which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the\nidentification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.\nDetailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging\ndies is presented in the last part of the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2012 06:34:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tapie", "Laurent", "", "LURPA"], ["Mawussi", "Kwamiwi", "", "LURPA"], ["Bernard", "Alain", "", "IRCCyN"]]}, {"id": "1207.0911", "submitter": "Valentina  Colla", "authors": "Valentina Colla, Nicola Matarese and Gianluca Nastasi", "title": "Prediction of under pickling defects on steel strip surface", "comments": "9 Page", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Soft Computing and Software Engineering\n  [JSCSE], Vol. 1, No. 1, pp. 1-9, 2011", "doi": "10.7321/jscse.v1.n1.2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  An extremely important part of the finishing line is the pickling process, in\nwhich oxides formed during the hot rolling stage are removed from the surface\nof the steel sheets. The efficiency of the pickling process is mainly dependent\non the nature of the oxide present at the surface of the steel, but, also, on\nprocess parameters such as bath composition and time duration are relevant.\nWhen acid concentration, solution temperatures and line speed are not properly\nbalanced, in fact, sheet defects like under pickling or over pickling may\nhappen and their occurrence does have a very serious effect on cold-reduction\nperformance and surface appearance of the finished product. Furthermore,\nproduct damage from handling or improper equipment adjustment can render the\nsteel unsuitable for further processing. This is the reason why it is important\nthat process significant parameters are controlled and maintained as accurately\nas possible in order to avoid these undesired phenomena. In the present work, a\ncontrol algorithm, composed by two different modules, i.e. decision tree and\nrectangular Basis Function Network, has been implemented to aim of predicting\npickling defects and suggesting the optimal speed or the admissible speed range\nof the steel strip in the process line.
