First widespread E-Labs\nconsisted in proposing simulations of real systems (virtual labs), as building\nremote labs (remote control of real systems) was difficult by lack of\nindustrial standards and common protocols. Nowadays, robotics and automation\ntechnologies make easier the interfacing of systems with computers. In this\nframe, many researchers (such as those mentioned in [1]) focus on how to set up\nsuch a remote control. But, only a few of them deal with the educational point\nof view of the problem.

As an aid to those looking to develop\nhypercomputational theories, we will briefly survey the known landmarks both\ninside and outside the borders of computational theory. We will not focus in\nthis paper on why the structure of formal theory looks the way it does. Instead\nwe will focus on what this structure looks like, moving from hypocomputational,\nthrough traditional computational theories, and then beyond to\nhypercomputational theories.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Jun 2007 21:13:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Love", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4170", "submitter": "Alessandro Mirone", "authors": "Alessandro Mirone", "title": "Hilbert++ Manual", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cond-mat.str-el", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present here an installation guide, a hand-on mini-tutorial through\nexamples, and the theoretical foundations of the Hilbert++ code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2007 09:09:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2009 09:03:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mirone", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4440", "submitter": "Craig Alan Feinstein", "authors": "Craig Alan Feinstein", "title": "2-State 3-Symbol Universal Turing Machines Do Not Exist", "comments": "1 page", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this brief note, we give a simple information-theoretic proof that 2-state\n3-symbol universal Turing machines cannot possibly exist, unless one loosens\nthe definition of \"universal\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2007 16:47:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2007 15:16:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2007 19:17:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2007 19:55:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 18:34:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Feinstein", "Craig Alan", ""]]}]
