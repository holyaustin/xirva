As a result, those\nclasses include a wide number and variety of systems that result equivalent to\neach other. This paper introduces a different approach: First, systems\nbelonging to a same class are further differentiated according to five major\ngeneral characteristics. This introduces a \"horizontal dimension\" to system\nclassification. A second component of our approach considers systems as nested\ncompositional hierarchies of other sub-systems. The resulting \"vertical\ndimension\" further specializes the systemic classes and makes it easier to\nassess similarities and differences regarding properties such as resilience,\nperformance, and quality-of-experience. Our approach is exemplified by\nconsidering a telemonitoring system designed in the framework of Flemish\nproject \"Little Sister\". We show how our approach makes it possible to design\nintelligent environments able to closely follow a system's horizontal and\nvertical organization and to artificially augment its features by serving as\ncrosscutting optimizers and as enablers of antifragile behaviors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Aug 2015 08:31:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2015 07:23:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 19:13:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 06:21:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["De Florio", "Vincenzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02557", "submitter": "Sanjay Chakraborty", "authors": "Neha Bothra, Kritika Jain, Sanjay Chakraborty", "title": "Can JSP Code be Generated Using XML Tags?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.15864/ajac.v2i3.138", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Over the years, a variety of web services have started using server-side\nscripting to deliver results back to a client as a paid or free service; one\nsuch server-side scripting language is Java Server Pages (JSP).
