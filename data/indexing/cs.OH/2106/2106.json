In the big data era, massive heavy truck GPS\ntrajectories can be acquired cost effectively in real-time. Identifying freight\ntrip ends (origins and destinations) from heavy truck GPS trajectories is an\noutstanding problem. Although previous studies proposed a variety of trip end\nidentification methods from different perspectives, these studies subjectively\ndefined key threshold parameters and ignored the complex intracity heavy truck\ntravel characteristics. Here, we propose a data-driven trip end identification\nmethod in which the speed threshold for identifying truck stops and the\nmultilevel time thresholds for distinguishing temporary stops and freight trip\nends are objectively defined. Moreover, an appropriate time threshold level is\ndynamically selected by considering the intracity activity patterns of heavy\ntrucks. Furthermore, we use urban road networks and point-of-interest (POI)\ndata to eliminate misidentified trip ends to improve method accuracy. The\nvalidation results show that the accuracy of the method we propose is 87.45%.\nOur method incorporates the impact of the city freight context on truck\ntrajectory characteristics, and its results can reflect the spatial\ndistribution and chain patterns of intracity heavy truck freight trips, which\nhave a wide range of practical applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2021 02:47:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2021 00:57:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yitao", ""], ["Jia", "Bin", ""], ["Yan", "Xiao-Yong", ""], ["Jiang", "Rui", ""], ["Ji", "Hao", ""], ["Gao", "Ziyou", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.11010", "submitter": "Shijun Liao", "authors": "Shijun Liao, Xiaoming Li, Yu Yang", "title": "Three-body problem -- from Newton to supercomputer plus machine learning", "comments": "31 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables,\n  https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-395522/v1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH nlin.CD physics.comp-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The famous three-body problem can be traced back to Newton in 1687, but quite\nfew families of periodic orbits were found in 300 years thereafter.
