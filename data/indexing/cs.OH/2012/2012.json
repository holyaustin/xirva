Imaging is selective if\nonly selected data objects from an image that were explicitly chosen are\nincluded in the copied data. While selective imaging has been defined for\npost-mortem data acquisition, performing this process live, i.e., by using the\nsystem that contains the evidence also to execute the imaging software, is less\nwell defined and understood. We present the design and implementation of a new\nlive Selective Imaging Tool for Windows, called SIT, which is based on the DFIR\nORC framework and uses AFF4 as a container format.

Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research\nand industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety\nrelevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex\nreal-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is\nneeded. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was\nintroduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM\nand extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM\nprovides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore,\nfunctions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model\nenables a structured description and categorization of the general environment,\nwithout incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors.\nBeyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are\nelaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network\nand traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of\nthe former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information.\nThe work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are\nformulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of\nthe model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous\npublications, the model and its design are described in far more detail.\nFinally, the holistic description of the 6LM presented includes remarks on\npossible future work when expanding the concept to machine perception aspects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:11:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2021 16:39:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Scholtes", "Maike", ""], ["Westhofen", "Lukas", ""], ["Turner", "Lara Ruth", ""], ["Lotto", "Katrin", ""], ["Schuldes", "Michael", ""], ["Weber", "Hendrik", ""], ["Wagener", "Nicolas", ""], ["Neurohr", "Christian", ""], ["Bollmann", "Martin", ""], ["K\u00f6rtke", "Franziska", ""], ["Hiller", "Johannes", ""], ["Hoss", "Michael", ""], ["Bock", "Julian", ""], ["Eckstein", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.07731", "submitter": "Baichuan Mo", "authors": "Baichuan Mo, Zhenliang Ma, Haris N.

Important inputs to such models, in addition to\norigin-destination flows, include passenger path choices and train capacity.\nTrain capacity, which has often been overlooked in the literature, is an\nimportant input that exhibits a lot of variabilities. The paper proposes a\nsimulation-based optimization (SBO) framework to simultaneously calibrate path\nchoices and train capacity for urban rail systems using AFC and AVL data. The\ncalibration is formulated as an optimization problem with a black-box objective\nfunction. Seven algorithms from four branches of SBO solving methods are\nevaluated. The algorithms are evaluated using an experimental design that\nincludes five scenarios, representing different degrees of path choice\nrandomness and crowding sensitivity. Data from the Hong Kong Mass Transit\nRailway (MTR) system is used as a case study. The data is used to generate\nsynthetic observations used as \"ground truth\". The results show that the\nresponse surface methods (particularly Constrained Optimization using Response\nSurfaces) have consistently good performance under all scenarios. The proposed\napproach drives large-scale simulation applications for monitoring and\nplanning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:41:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Feb 2021 00:19:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mo", "Baichuan", ""], ["Ma", "Zhenliang", ""], ["Koutsopoulos", "Haris N.", ""], ["Zhao", "Jinhua", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.10211", "submitter": "Michael Robinson", "authors": "Michael Robinson", "title": "Looking for non-compliant documents using error messages from multiple\n  parsers", "comments": "15 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.PL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Whether a file is accepted by a single parser is not a reliable indication of\nwhether a file complies with its stated format. Bugs within both the parser and\nthe format specification mean that a compliant file may fail to parse, or that\na non-compliant file might be read without any apparent trouble. The latter\nsituation presents a significant security risk, and should be avoided. This\narticle suggests that a better way to assess format specification compliance is\nto examine the set of error messages produced by a set of parsers rather than a\nsingle parser. If both a sample of compliant files and a sample of\nnon-compliant files are available, then we show how a statistical test based on\na pseudo-likelihood ratio can be very effective at determining a file's\ncompliance. Our method is format agnostic, and does not directly rely upon a\nformal specification of the format. Although this article focuses upon the case\nof the PDF format (ISO 32000-2), we make no attempt to use any specific details\nof the format. Furthermore, we show how principal components analysis can be\nuseful for a format specification designer to assess the quality and structure\nof these samples of files and parsers. While these tests are absolutely\nrudimentary, it appears that their use to measure file format variability and\nto identify non-compliant files is both novel and surprisingly effective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2020 19:54:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Robinson", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.11036", "submitter": "Giacomo Cavalieri", "authors": "Giacomo Cavalieri, Dario Maio", "title": "A Quantum Edge Detection Algorithm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The application of quantum computing to the field of image processing has\nproduced several promising applications: quantum image representation\ntechniques have been developed showing how, by taking advantage of quantum\nproperties like entanglement and superposition, many image processing\nalgorithms could have an exponential speed-up in comparison to their\n\"classical\" counterparts.

However, though existing GIS tools can\ncalculate solar potential on surfaces that have buildings and trees, these\ntools do not estimate the conditions beneath trees and do not consider the\nseasonal changes in deciduous trees.
