This paper proposes a\nnew technique to estimate the DOAs when a few elements are malfunctioning. The\ntechnique combines Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) based Matrix Completion\n(MC) procedure with the Direct Data Domain (D^3) based Matrix Pencil (MP)\nMethod. When the element failure is observed, first, the MC is performed to\nrecover the missing data from failed elements, and then the MP method is used\nto estimate the DOAs. We also, propose a very simple technique to detect the\nlocation of elements failed, which is required to perform MC procedure. We\nprovide simulation studies to demonstrate the performance and usefulness of the\nproposed technique. The results indicate a better performance, of the proposed\nDOA estimation scheme under different antenna failure scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2011 16:06:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yerriswamy", "T.", ""], ["Jagadeesha", "S.

Within CES bio-inspired systems play a key role. The disclosure\nfrom bio-inspired systems and biological computation has not been sufficiently\nworked out, however. Biological computation is to be taken as the processing of\ninformation by living systems that is carried out in polynomial time, i.e.,\nefficiently; such processing however is grasped by current science and research\nas an intractable problem (for instance, the protein folding problem). A remark\nis needed here: P versus NP problems should be well defined and delimited but\nbiological computation problems are not. The shift from conventional\nengineering to bio-inspired engineering needs bring the subject (or problem) of\ncomputability to a new level. Within the frame of computation, so far, the\nprevailing paradigm is still the Turing-Church thesis. In other words,\nconventional engineering is still ruled by the Church-Turing thesis (CTt).\nHowever, CES is ruled by CTt, too. Contrarily to the above, we shall argue here\nthat biological computation demands a more careful thinking that leads us\ntowards hypercomputation. Bio-inspired engineering and CES thereafter, must\nturn its regard toward biological computation. Thus, biological computation can\nand should be taken as the ground for engineering complex non-linear systems.\nBiological systems do compute in terms of hypercomputation, indeed. If so, then\nthe focus is not algorithmic or computational complexity but\ncomputation-beyond-the-Church-Turing-barrier. We claim that we need a new\ncomputational theory that encompasses biological processes wherein the\nTuring-Church thesis is but a particular case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Oct 2011 17:05:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00f3mez-Cruz", "Nelson Alfonso", ""], ["Maldonado", "Carlos Eduardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3969", "submitter": "Md.

Safety critical systems are very sensitive to\nsoft errors. A bit flip due to soft error can change the value of critical\nvariable and consequently the system control flow can completely be changed\nwhich leads to system failure. To minimize soft error risks, a novel\nmethodology is proposed to detect and recover from soft errors considering only\n'critical code blocks' and 'critical variables' rather than considering all\nvariables and/or blocks in the whole program.
