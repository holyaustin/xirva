The model is inspired by the key observation that the\ninverter delay is a complicated function of several process parameters as well\nas load capacitance. These relationships are considered by fitting functions\nfor each parameter derived from the Curve Fitting Toolbox in Matlab. Compared\nto SPICE simulations based on the BSIM4 transistor model, the analytical delay\nmodel shows very good accuracy with an average error less than 2% over a wide\nrange of process parameters and output loads. Hence, the proposed model can be\nefficiently used for different technology nodes as well as statistical gate\ndelay characterisation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 14:33:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schneider", "Walter", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.02336", "submitter": "Esra'a Alkafaween", "authors": "Ahmad Abadleh, Eshraq Al-Hawari, Esra'a Alkafaween, Hamad Al-Sawalqah", "title": "Step Detection Algorithm For Accurate Distance Estimation Using Dynamic\n  Step Length", "comments": "this paper contains of 5 pages and 6 figures", "journal-ref": "In Mobile Data Management (MDM), 2017 18th IEEE International\n  Conference on, pp. 324-327.

Moreover, the objectives of\nend-user networking logic are neither clear nor uniform. This constitutes the\ncentral optimization of network resources an additional challenge. As a\nsolution to these problems, we propose the Socket Store. The Store is a\nmarketplace containing end-user network logic in modular form. The Store\nmodules act as intelligent mediators between the end-user and the network\nresources.

From the point of view of analog\ncomputability, the existence of an effective way to obtain solutions of these\nsystems is essential. A pioneering model of analog computation is the General\nPurpose Analog Computer (GPAC), introduced by Shannon as a model of the\nDifferential Analyzer and improved by Pour-El, Lipshitz and Rubel, Costa and\nGra\\c{c}a and others. Its power is known to be characterized by the class of\ndifferentially algebraic functions, which includes the solutions of initial\nvalue problems for ordinary differential equations. We address one of the\nlimitations of this model, concerning the notion of approximability, a\ndesirable property in computation over continuous spaces that is however absent\nin the GPAC. In particular, the Shannon GPAC cannot be used to generate\nnon-differentially algebraic functions which can be approximately computed in\nother models of computation. We extend the class of data types using networks\nwith channels which carry information on a general complete metric space $X$;\nfor example $X=C(R,R)$, the class of continuous functions of one real (spatial)\nvariable. We consider the original modules in Shannon's construction\n(constants, adders, multipliers, integrators) and we add \\emph{(continuous or\ndiscrete) limit} modules which have one input and one output. We then define an\nL-GPAC to be a network built with $X$-stream channels and the above-mentioned\nmodules. This leads us to a framework in which the specifications of such\nanalog systems are given by fixed points of certain operators on continuous\ndata streams. We study these analog systems and their associated operators, and\nshow how some classically non-generable functions, such as the gamma function\nand the zeta function, can be captured with the L-GPAC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 10:49:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2019 09:51:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2019 12:33:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Po\u00e7as", "Diogo", ""], ["Zucker", "Jeffery", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.08444", "submitter": "Harun Siljak", "authors": "Harun Siljak, Abdulhamit Subasi and Belle R.
