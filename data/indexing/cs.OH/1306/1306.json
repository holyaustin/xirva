The fundamental TE111 mode and higher-order TE113 mode are\nexcited with their resonant frequencies respectively. These frequencies can be\ncontrolled by changing the DRA dimensions. A dielectric resonator with high\npermittivity is used to miniaturize the global structure. The proposed antenna\nis designed to have dual band operation suitable for both DCS (1710 - 1880 MHz)\nand WLAN (2400 - 2484 MHz) applications. The return loss, radiation pattern and\ngain of the proposed antenna are evaluated. Reasonable agreement between\nsimulation and experimental results is obtained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 08:21:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Raggad", "H.", ""], ["Latrach", "M.", ""], ["Gharsallah", "A.", ""], ["Razban", "T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1702", "submitter": "Evgenii Evgenii Khokhryakov", "authors": "Evgenii Khokhryakov", "title": "Stable equilibrium study cascaded one bit sigma-delta modulator", "comments": "Pdf-format Russian version", "journal-ref": "Voprosi RadioElectronici ISSN 0233-9950 2 (2013) 144-154", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the paper defines a boundary of stability zone for sigma-delta modulator.\nThe boundary depends from inner sigma-delta modulator coefficients.

Excessive surface traffic is a cause of increased controller and\npilot workload. It is also a source of increased emissions and delays, and does\nnot yield improved runway throughput. Leveraging the extensive past research on\nairport departure management, this paper explores the environmental and safety\nbenefits that improved surveillance technologies can bring in the context of\ngate- or spot-release strategies. The paper shows that improved surveillance\ntechnologies can yield 4% to 6% reduction of aircraft on taxiway, and therefore\nemissions, in addition to the savings currently observed by implementing\nthreshold starategies under evaluation at Boston Logan Airport and other busy\nairports during congested periods. These calculated benefits contrast sharply\nwith our previous work, which relied on simplified airport ramp areas with a\nsingle departure spot, and where fewer environmental and economic benefits of\nadvanced surface surveillance systems could be established.

Because some\ndeparting flights are held at gates, there is a possibility that arriving\nflights cannot access the gates and have to wait until the gates are cleared.\nThis is called a gate conflict. Robust gate assignment is an assignment that\nminimizes gate conflicts by assigning gates to aircraft to maximize the time\ngap between two consecutive flights at the same gate; it makes gate assignment\nrobust, but passengers may walk longer to transfer flights. In order to\nsimulate the airport departure process, a queuing model is introduced. The\nmodel is calibrated and validated with actual data from New York La Guardia\nAirport (LGA) and a U.S. hub airport. Then, the model simulates the airport\ndeparture process with the current gate assignment and a robust gate assignment\nto assess the impact of gate assignment on gate-holding departure control. The\nresults show that the robust gate assignment reduces the number of gate\nconflicts caused by gate holding compared to the current gate assignment.\nTherefore, robust gate assignment can be combined with gate-holding departure\ncontrol to improve operations at congested airports with limited gate\nresources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 15:35:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Sang Hyun", ""], ["Feron", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.3875", "submitter": "Tiancheng Li", "authors": "Tiancheng Li, Tariq P.
