We\nthus developed SAXSDOG, a python based environment for real-time azimuthal\nintegration of large-area scattering-images. The software is primarily designed\nfor dedicated data-pipelines: once a scattering image is transferred from the\ndetector onto the storage-unit, it is automatically integrated and\npre-evaluated using integral parameters within milliseconds. The control and\nconfiguration of the underlying server-based processes is done via a graphical\nuser interface SAXSLEASH, which visualizes the resulting 1D data together with\nintegral classifiers in real time. SAXSDOG further includes a portable\n'take-home' version for users that runs on standalone computers, enabling its\nuse in labs or at the preferred workspace.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2020 06:58:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Burian", "Max", ""], ["Meisenbichler", "Christian", ""], ["Naumenko", "Denys", ""], ["Amenitsch", "Heinz", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.02415", "submitter": "Alessandro Ecclesie Agazzi", "authors": "Alessandro Ecclesie Agazzi", "title": "Business Email Compromise (BEC) and Cyberpsychology", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper gives a brief introduction about what BEC (Business Email\nCompromise) is and why we should be concerned about.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based FPGA function\nblock detection method with three major steps. In specific, we first analyze\nthe format of the bitstream to obtain the mapping relationship between the\nconfiguration bits and configurable logic blocks because of the discontinuity\nof the configuration bits in the bitstream for one element. In order to reap\nthe maturity of object detection based on deep learning techniques, our next\nstep is to convert an FPGA bitstream to an image, following the proposed\ntransformation method that takes account of both the adjacency nature of the\nprogrammable logic and the high degree of redundancy of configuration\ninformation. Once the image is obtained, a deep learning-based object detection\nalgorithm is applied to this transformed image, and the objects thus detected\ncan be reflected back to determine the function blocks of the original FPGA\ndesign. The deep neural network used for function block detection is trained\nand validated with a specially crafted bitstream/image dataset. Experiments\nhave confirmed high detection accuracy of the proposed function detection\nmethod, showing a 98.11% of mean Average Precision (IoU=0.5) for 10 function\nblocks within a YOLOv3 detector implemented on Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoCs and Zynq\nUltraScale+ MPSoCs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2020 07:45:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Jul 2021 15:55:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Minzhen", "", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"], ["Liu", "Peng", "", "Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"]]}, {"id": "2007.12271", "submitter": "Dharmesh Tarapore", "authors": "Dharmesh Tarapore, Shahin Roozkhosh, Steven Brzozowski, Renato Mancuso", "title": "Observing the Invisible: Live Cache Inspection for High-Performance\n  Embedded Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TC.2021.3060650", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The vast majority of high-performance embedded systems implement multi-level\nCPU cache hierarchies.

This\nenduring opacity further obscures the complex interplay among applications and\nOS-level components, particularly as they compete for the allocation of cache\nresources. Notwithstanding the relegation of cache comprehension to proxies\nsuch as static cache analysis, performance counter-based profiling, and cache\nhierarchy simulations, the underpinnings of cache structure and evolution\ncontinue to elude software-centric solutions.

However, these studies are limited in scope, require field visits\nand time-consuming measurements. Furthermore, they have not suggested ways to\nidentify suitable sites on a larger scale let alone means of surveying numerous\nmicro-locations across the same building. Using a case study area focused on\nhigh-rise buildings in Singapore, this paper examines a novel application of 3D\ncity models to identify suitable farming micro-locations in buildings. We\nspecifically investigate whether the vertical spaces of these buildings\ncomprising outdoor corridors, fa\\c{c}ades and windows receive sufficient\nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) for growing food crops and do so at a\nhigh resolution. We also analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of PAR,\nand the impact of shadows and different weather conditions on PAR in the\nbuilding. Environmental simulations on the 3D model of the study area indicated\nthat the cumulative daily PAR or Daily Light Integral (DLI) at a location in\nthe building was dependent on its orientation and shape, sun's diurnal and\nannual motion, weather conditions, and shadowing effects of the building's\nfa\\c{c}ades and surrounding buildings. The DLI in the study area generally\nincreased with building's levels and, depending on the particular\nmicro-location, was found suitable for growing moderately light-demanding crops\nsuch as lettuce and sweet pepper. These variations in DLI at different\nlocations of the same building affirmed the need for such simulations. The\nsimulations were validated with field measurements of PAR, and correlation\ncoefficients between them exceeded 0.5 in most cases thus, making a case that\n3D city models offer a promising practical solution to identifying suitable\nfarming locations in residential buildings, and have the potential for\nurban-scale applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2020 12:04:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2021 03:28:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Palliwal", "Ankit", ""], ["Song", "Shuang", ""], ["Tan", "Hugh Tiang Wah", ""], ["Biljecki", "Filip", ""]]}]
