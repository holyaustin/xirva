To address these\nproblems, this paper presents a low-cost, reusable, reconfigurable platform\nthat enables integrated design and implementation of embedded control systems.\nTo minimize the cost, free and open source software packages such as Linux and\nScilab are used. Scilab is ported to the embedded ARM-Linux system. The drivers\nfor interfacing Scilab with several communication protocols including serial,\nEthernet, and Modbus are developed. Experiments are conducted to test the\ndeveloped embedded platform. The use of Scilab enables implementation of\ncomplex control algorithms on embedded platforms.
