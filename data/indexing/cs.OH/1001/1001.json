CFO benefits\nsubstantially from the inclusion of a pseudorandom component (a numerical\nsequence that is precisely known by specification or calculation but otherwise\narbitrary). The essential requirement is that the sequence is uncorrelated with\nthe decision space topology, so that its effect is to pseudorandomly distribute\nprobes throughout the landscape. While this process may appear to be similar to\nthe randomness in an inherently stochastic algorithm, it is in fact\nfundamentally different because CFO remains deterministic at every step. Three\npseudorandom methods are discussed (initial probe distribution, repositioning\nfactor, and decision space adaptation). A sample problem is presented in detail\nand summary data included for a 23-function benchmark suite. CFO's performance\nis quite good compared to other highly developed, state-of-the-art algorithms.\nIncludes corrections 02-03-2010.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2010 16:39:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 21:17:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Formato", "Richard A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.1277", "submitter": "Ronan Quarez", "authors": "Ronan Quarez (IRMAR)", "title": "Piecewise Certificates of Positivity for matrix polynomials", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.RA cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that any symmetric positive definite homogeneous matrix polynomial\n$M\\in\\R[x_1,...,x_n]^{m\\times m}$ admits a piecewise semi-certificate, i.e. a\ncollection of identites $M(x)=\\sum_jf_{i,j}(x)U_{i,j}(x)^TU_{i,j}(x)$ where\n$U_{i,j}(x)$ is a matrix polynomial and $f_{i,j}(x)$ is a non negative\npolynomial on a semi-algebraic subset $S_i$, where $\\R^n=\\cup_{i=1}^r S_i$.\nThis result generalizes to the setting of biforms.

OFDM is very effective in combating\nintersymbol interference and can achieve high data rate in frequency selective\nchannel. For OFDM communication systems, the frequency offsets in mobile radio\nchannels distort the orthogonality between subcarriers resulting in Inter\nCarrier Interference (ICI). ICI causes power leakage among subcarriers thus\ndegrading the system performance. A wellknown problem of OFDM is its\nsensitivity to frequency offset between the transmitted and received carrier\nfrequencies. There are two deleterious effects caused by frequency offset one\nis the reduction of signal amplitude in the output of the filters matched to\neach of the carriers and the second is introduction of ICI from the other\ncarriers. This research work investigates three effective methods for combating\nthe effects of ICI: ICI Self Cancellation (SC), Maximum Likelihood (ML)\nestimation, and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) method. These three methods are\ncompared in terms of bit error rate performance and bandwidth efficiency.\nThrough simulations, it is shown that the three techniques are effective in\nmitigating the modulation schemes, the ML and EKF methods perform better than\nthe SC method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2010 18:14:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "B.
