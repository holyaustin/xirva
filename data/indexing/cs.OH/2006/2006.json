The extended lockdown has had\nsignificant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue' has likely\nset in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the\nmost crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of\ncases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368\ndeaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going to be made on\nre-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented\nan agent-based city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread\nof the infection in large metropolises like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed\nin IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city\nresidents at an individual level and to capture the impact of\nnon-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we\nfocus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for\nphased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These\ninclude phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public\ntransportation (modelling of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of\ncontainment zones on controlling infections, and the role of compliance with\nrespect to various intervention measures including use of masks, case\nisolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is\nthat a phased opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of\n20 to 33\\%, is a good way to restart economic activity while ensuring that the\ncity's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle the possible rise in\nthe number of COVID-19 patients in June and July.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2020 11:22:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Harsha", "Prahladh", ""], ["Juneja", "Sandeep", ""], ["Patil", "Preetam", ""], ["Rathod", "Nihesh", ""], ["Saptharishi", "Ramprasad", ""], ["Sarath", "A.
