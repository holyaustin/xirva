The HGV2C\nmethod involves the construction of a computer ego (CE) based on an individual\nobject that can be either a part of the system under analysis or a newly\ncreated object based on a certain hypothesis. The CE provides a capability to\nanalyze data from a specific standpoint, e.g. from a viewpoint of a certain\nobject. The CE is constructed from two identical copies of a query object, and\nits functioning mechanism involves: a hypothesis-parameter (HP) and\ninfothyristor (IT). HP is a parameter that is introduced into an existing set\nof parameters. The HP value for one of the clones of a query object is set to\nequal 1, whereas for another clone it is greater than 1. The IT is based on the\npreviously described algorithm of iterative averaging and performs three\nfunctions: 1) computation of a similarity matrix for the group of three objects\nincluding two clones of a query object and a target object; 2) division of the\ngroup into two alternative subgroups; and 3) a successive increase of the HP\nweight in the totality of all the parameters. Initially, both clones of the\nquery object appear together in one of the subgroups as all of their parameter\nvalues, except the HP, are identical. At a certain point of the HP\nmultiplication, one of the clones moves to the group of the target object. A\nrespective number of the HP multiplications represents the dissimilarity (D)\nbetween the query and target objects. The product of D multiplied by the\ndifference in HP values of the clones is strictly constant and linearly\nincreases as the difference in HP values of the clones decreases. This new\napproach to knowledge representation is demonstrated on the example of\npopulation pyramids of 220 countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2008 02:55:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Andreev", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0541", "submitter": "Liang Wang", "authors": "Wang Liang", "title": "Climate modification directed by control theory", "comments": "9 piges,8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Climate modification measures to counteract global warming receive some more\nnew attentions in these years.

The\naim of our research is to pattern large area ceramic green composites using a\nmodified roller laminating apparatus, which is compatible with screen printing\nmachines, for integration of embossing and screen printing. The instrumentation\nof our roller embossing apparatus, as shown in Figure1, consists of roller 1\nand rollers 2. Roller 1 is heated up to the desired embossing temperature ;\nroller 2 is, however, kept at room temperature. The mould is a nickel template\nmanufactured by plating nickel-based micro patterns (height : 50 $\\mu$m) on a\nnickel film (thickness : 70 $\\mu$m) ; the substrate for the roller embossing is\na multilayered Heraeus Heralock HL 2000 ceramic green composite. Comparing with\nthe conventional simultaneous embossing, the advantages of roller embossing\ninclude : (1) low embossing force ; (2) easiness of demoulding ; (3) localized\narea in contact with heater ; and etc. We have demonstrated the capability of\nlarge area roller embossing with a panel size of 150mmx 150mm on the mentioned\nsubstrate. We have explored and confirmed the impact of parameters (feed speed,\ntemperature of roller and applied pressure) to the pattern quality of roller\nembossing. Furthermore, under the optimized process parameters, we\ncharacterized the variations of pattern dimension over the panel area, and\ncalculated a scaling factor in order to make the panel compatible with other\nprocesses. Figure 2 shows the embossed patterns on a 150mmx 150mm green ceramic\npanel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 May 2008 08:58:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shan", "X.", ""], ["Soh", "Y.

Electrodes are placed on each sides of the nanowire and are used to\nactuate the structure (writing, erasing) and to measure the position through a\ncapactive bridge (reading). The structure is patterned by electron beam\nlithography on a pre-stressed thermally grown silicon dioxide layer. When later\nreleased, the stressed material relaxes and the beam buckles in a position of\nlower energy. Such symmetric beams, called Euler beams, show two stable\ndeformed positions thus form a bistable structure.

Considerable effort has been\nexpended in the EDA community during the past several years in trying to cope\nwith the so-called statistical timing problem. Most of this effort has been\naimed at generalizing the static timing analyzers to the statistical case. In\nthis paper, we take a pragmatic approach in pursuit of making the Monte Carlo\nmethod for timing yield estimation practically feasible. The Monte Carlo method\nis widely used as a golden reference in assessing the accuracy of other timing\nyield estimation techniques. However, it is generally believed that it can not\nbe used in practice for estimating timing yield as it requires too many costly\nfull circuit simulations for acceptable accuracy. In this paper, we present a\nnovel approach to constructing an improvedMonte Carlo estimator for timing\nyield which provides the same accuracy as the standard Monte Carlo estimator,\nbut at a cost of much fewer full circuit simulations. This improved estimator\nis based on a novel combination of a variance reduction technique, importance\nsampling, and a stochastic generalization of the logical effort formalism for\ncheap but approximate delay estimation. The results we present demonstrate that\nour improved yield estimator achieves the same accuracy as the standard Monte\nCarlo estimator at a cost reduction reaching several orders of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 May 2008 21:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 May 2008 22:20:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bayrakci", "Alp Arslan", ""], ["Demir", "Alper", ""], ["Tasiran", "Serdar", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2864", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Pierre Mozer (TIMC), Michael Baumann (TIMC), G.
