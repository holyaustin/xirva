The claim\nby [S{\\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] is that players outperform widely used\nalgorithms, in particular the KASS algorithm, based on the Krotov algorithm,\nand that player intuition is crucial to develop improved methods. However, as\ninitially discussed by D. Sels [D. Sels, Phys. Rev. A 97], a standard\nCoordinate Ascent algorithm outperforms all players by a large margin. Albeit\nD. Sels only compare to player solutions, the simple algorithm outperforms all\nalgorithms based on player solutions and Krotov, and it does so using much less\ntime and iterations. In this paper we elaborate on the methods discussed by D.\nSels and verify that the presented algorithm, solves the problem better than\nall players and algorithms derived from player solutions in [S{\\o}rensen et\nal., Nature 532]. We also verify the theoretical analysis presented by D. Sels,\nthat gives a theoretically derived protocol that outperforms all players. We\nadd a comparison with gradient ascent or GRAPE. Starting from uniform random\nvalues, GRAPE outperforms all players by a large margin. GRAPE works at least\nas well as the methods from [S{\\o}rensen et al., Nature 532] initialized with\nplayer solutions. A standard analysis of the results from GRAPE provides a\nstarting point for GRAPE, that outperform all algorithms from [S{\\o}rensen et\nal., Nature 532]. We compare with a basic Krotov algorithm, and get results\nsimilar to GRAPE, clearly outperforming players and the KASS algorithm. These\nexperiments verify and underline the result in [D.

Using the support vector machine\nclassification method, the specific types of behaviours of the segments\nextracted can be identified, and together with a data combination method, a\ntotal of ten types of behaviours can be identified. Then the kernel density\nanalysis is used to cluster different types of behaviours of all passing\nvehicles to show the distribution on maps. By this method, how vehicles travel\nthrough maintenance work zones, and how different vehicle behaviours distribute\nin maintenance work zones can be displayed intuitively on maps, which is a\nnovel traffic characteristic and can shed light to maintenance work zone\nrelated researches such as safety assessment and design method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2019 10:41:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Qun", ""], ["Xu", "Zhepu", ""], ["Gurupackiam", "Saravanan", ""], ["Wang", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11882", "submitter": "Dwj Sukeshkumar Sheth Mr", "authors": "Dwij Sukeshkumar Sheth, Shantanu Singh, Prakhar S Mathur, Vydeki D", "title": "Smart Laptop Bag with Machine Learning for Activity Recognition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.LG eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In todays world of smart living, the smart laptop bag, presented in this\npaper, provides a better solution to keep track of our precious possessions and\nmonitoring them in real time. As the world moves towards a much tech-savvy\ndirection, the novel laptop bag discussed here facilitates the user to perform\nlocation tracking, ambiance monitoring, user-state monitoring etc. in one\ndevice. The innovative design uses cloud computing and machine learning\nalgorithms to monitor the health of the user and many parameters of the bag.\nThe emergency alert system in this bag could be trained to send appropriate\nnotifications to emergency contacts of the user, in case of abnormal health\nconditions or theft of the bag. The experimental smart laptop bag uses deep\nneural network, which was trained and tested over the various parameters from\nthe bag and produces above 95% accurate results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Apr 2019 06:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sheth", "Dwij Sukeshkumar", ""], ["Singh", "Shantanu", ""], ["Mathur", "Prakhar S", ""], ["D", "Vydeki", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11979", "submitter": "Chang Xu", "authors": "Yao Cheng, Chang Xu, Daisuke Mashima, Vrizlynn L.

Accurate forecasting allows grid operators\nto better maintain the balance of supply and demand as well as to optimize\noperational cost for generation and transmission. This article proposes a novel\nneural network architecture PowerNet, which can incorporate multiple\nheterogeneous features, such as historical energy consumption data, weather\ndata, and calendar information, for the power demand forecasting task. Compared\nto two recent works based on Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) and Support Vector\nRegression (SVR), PowerNet demonstrates a decrease of 33.3% and 14.3% in\nforecasting error, respectively. We further provide empirical results the two\noperational considerations that are crucial when using PowerNet in practice,\ni.e., how far in the future the model can forecast with a decent accuracy and\nhow often we should re-train the forecasting model to retain its modeling\ncapability. Finally, we briefly discuss a multilayer anomaly detection approach\nbased on PowerNet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2019 11:59:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Yao", ""], ["Xu", "Chang", ""], ["Mashima", "Daisuke", ""], ["Thing", "Vrizlynn L.
