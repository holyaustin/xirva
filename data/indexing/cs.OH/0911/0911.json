Interaction of the teacher with his students has a\ngreat importance in the process of learning and education. The pattern and\nstyle of this interaction is determined by the educational situation, trends\nand concerns, and educational characteristics. Classroom interaction has an\nimportance and a big role in increasing the efficiency of the learning process\nand raising the achievement levels of students. Students need to learn skills\nand habits of study, especially at the university level. The effectiveness of\nlearning is affected by several factors that include the prevailing patterns of\ninteractive behavior in the classroom. These patterns are reflected in the\nactivities of teacher and learners during the learning process. The\neffectiveness of learning is also influenced by the cognitive and non cognitive\ncharacteristics of teacher that help him to succeed, the characteristics of\nlearners, teaching subject, and the teaching methods. This paper presents a\nmachine learning algorithm for extracting knowledge from student model. The\nproposed algorithm utilizes the inherent characteristic of genetic algorithm\nand neural network for extracting comprehensible rules from the student\ndatabase. The knowledge is used for discriminating male and female levels in\nlogical reasoning as a part of an expert system course.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 19:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Elalfi", "A.

We show that such a system is capable of\nstoring one bit and its performance improves with the addition of noise. The\nproposed device can be regarded as asynchronous, in the sense that stored\ninformation can be retrieved at any time and, after a certain synchronization\ntime, the probability of erroneous retrieval does not depend on the\ninterrogated oscillator. We characterize memory persistence time and show it to\nbe maximized for the same noise range that both minimizes the probability of\nerror and ensures synchronization. We also present experimental results for a\nhard-wired version of the proposed memory, consisting of a loop of two Schmitt\ntriggers.
