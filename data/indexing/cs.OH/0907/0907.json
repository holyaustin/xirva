Our technique\nfor the simulation of biochemical reaction networks has the ability to mimic\nthe Gillespie Algorithm for some networks and solutions to ordinary\ndifferential equations for other networks, depending on the rules of the\nsystem, the kinetic rates and numbers of molecules. We provide a full\ndescription of the algorithm as well as specifics on its implementation. Some\nresults for two well-known models are reported. We have used the algorithm to\nexplore Fas-mediated apoptosis models in cancerous and HIV-1 infected T cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 07:26:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Jack", "John", "", "Louisiana Tech University"], ["Paun", "Andrei", "", "Louisiana Tech\n  University, INCDSB, UPM"]]}]
