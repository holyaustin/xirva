It is\ndescribed, how, during the course of a special ITIL project, the As-Is-Status\nof the various original processes was documented as part of the process life\ncycle and then transformed in the To-Be-Status, according to the ITIL Best\nPractice Framework. It is also shown, how the ITIL framework fits into the\nfour-layered-process model, that could be derived from interviews with the\nuniversities IT support staff, and how the various modified processes\ninterconnect with each other to form a value chain. The paper highlights the\nfinal results of the project and gives an outlook on the future use of ITIL as\na business modelling tool in the IT Service Centre of Harz University. It is\ncurrently being considered, whether the process model developed during the\nproject could be used as a reference model for other university IT centres.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2007 13:20:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Scheruhn", "Hans-Juergen", ""], ["Reinboth", "Christian", ""], ["Habel", "Thomas", ""]]}]
