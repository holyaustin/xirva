We argue that self-forensics, with the forensics taken out of the\ncybercrime domain, is applicable to \"self-dissection\" of intelligent vehicles\nand hardware systems for automated incident and anomaly analysis and event\nreconstruction by the software with or without the aid of the engineering teams\nin a variety of forensic scenarios. We propose a formal design, requirements,\nand specification of the self-forensic enabled units (similar to blackboxes) in\nvehicles that will help investigation of incidents and also automated reasoning\nand verification of theories along with the events reconstruction in a formal\nmodel. We argue such an analysis is beneficial to improve the safety of the\npassengers and their vehicles, like the airline industry does for planes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 00:08:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mokhov", "Serguei A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3569", "submitter": "Christophe Paoli", "authors": "Cyril Voyant, Marc Muselli, Christophe Paoli, Marie Laure Nivet and\n  Philippe Poggi", "title": "Predictability of PV power grid performance on insular sites without\n  weather stations: use of artificial neural networks", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures, 24th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy\n  Conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The official meteorological network is poor on the island of Corsica: only\nthree sites being about 50 km apart are equipped with pyranometers which enable\nmeasurements by hourly and daily step. These sites are Ajaccio (seaside),\nBastia (seaside) and Corte (average altitude of 486 meters). This lack of\nweather station makes difficult the predictability of PV power grid\nperformance. This work intends to study a methodology which can predict global\nsolar irradiation using data available from another location for daily and\nhourly horizon. In order to achieve this prediction, we have used Artificial\nNeural Network which is a popular artificial intelligence technique in the\nforecasting domain. A simulator has been obtained using data available for the\nstation of Ajaccio that is the only station for which we have a lot of data: 16\nyears from 1972 to 1987. Then we have tested the efficiency of this simulator\nin two places with different geographical features: Corte, a mountainous region\nand Bastia, a coastal region. On daily horizon, the relocation has implied\nfewer errors than a naive prediction method based on the persistence (RMSE=1468\nVs 1383Wh/m2 to Bastia and 1325 Vs 1213Wh/m2 to Corte). On hourly case, the\nresults were still satisfactory, and widely better than persistence (RMSE=138.8\nVs 109.3 Wh/m2 to Bastia and 135.1 Vs 114.7 Wh/m2 to Corte). The last\nexperiment was to evaluate the accuracy of our simulator on a PV power grid\nlocalized at 10 km from the station of Ajaccio. We got errors very suitable\n(nRMSE=27.9%, RMSE=99.0 W.h) compared to those obtained with the persistence\n(nRMSE=42.2%, RMSE=149.7 W.h).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2009 21:34:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Voyant", "Cyril", ""], ["Muselli", "Marc", ""], ["Paoli", "Christophe", ""], ["Nivet", "Marie Laure", ""], ["Poggi", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4203", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Alasu Paul Sabrin", "title": "Multimedia Aplication for Solving a Sudoku Game", "comments": "10 pages, exposed on 5th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2009, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.
