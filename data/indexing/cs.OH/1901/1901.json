We build a real-time cloud-based system\nthat can receive heterogeneous IoT data, allow users to create a\nthree-dimensional model online according to the real world structure, and the\nmonitoring results can be visualized in that model. In this paper, we\nillustrate the software architecture of the proposed system and focus on the\ntechnologies that are used, like client-side scripting, NoSql database, and\nsocket communication. We also present the challenges of displaying the overall\nmovement and shape transformation of the 3D structural model. Thus, each\ninternal-connected element's rotations and translations are obtained by\nconverting the monitoring results of each sensor device measured in the global\ncoordinate system. To overcome this, we create an inverted movement calculation\nmethod. A simple 3D two-level structural model and simulated sensor\ndisplacements are used to demonstrate system function and validate the inverted\nmovement calculation method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2019 10:26:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Hung-Fu", ""], ["Lin", "Tzu-Kang", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03229", "submitter": "Aaron Wong", "authors": "Aaron S.W.

The breakdown of Dennard scaling and stagnating\nenergy storage improvements further amplify these threats. However, the\ncomputational burden we put on our mobile devices is not always justified. In a\nmyriad of situations the result of a computation is further manipulated,\ninterpreted, and finally acted upon. This allows for the computation to be\nrelaxed, so that the result is calculated with \"good enough\", not perfect\naccuracy. For example, results of a Web search may be perfectly acceptable even\nif the order of the last few listed items is shuffled, as an end user decides\nwhich of the available links to follow. Similarly, the quality of a\nvoice-over-IP call may be acceptable, despite being imperfect, as long as the\ntwo involved parties can clearly understand each other. This novel way of\nthinking about computation is termed Approximate Computing (AC) and promises to\nreduce resource usage, while ensuring that satisfactory performance is\ndelivered to end-users. AC is already experimented with on various levels of\ndesktop computer architecture, from the hardware level where incorrect adders\nhave been designed to sacrifice result correctness for reduced energy\nconsumption, to compiler-level optimisations that omit certain lines of code to\nspeed up video encoding. AC is yet to be attempted on mobile devices and in\nthis article we examine the potential benefits of mobile AC and present an\noverview of AC techniques applicable in the mobile domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jan 2019 13:10:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pejovic", "Veljko", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.09756", "submitter": "Christian Negre", "authors": "Christian F.

This problem is known\nas community detection, and has become very important in various fields of\nscience including chemistry, biology and social sciences. The problem of\ncommunity detection is a twofold problem that consists of determining the\nnumber of communities and, at the same time, finding those communities. This\ndrastically increases the solution space for heuristics to work on, compared to\ntraditional graph partitioning problems. In many of the scientific domains in\nwhich graphs are used, there is the need to have the ability to partition a\ngraph into communities with the ``highest quality'' possible since the presence\nof even small isolated communities can become crucial to explain a particular\nphenomenon. We have explored community detection using the power of quantum\nannealers, and in particular the D-Wave 2X and 2000Q machines. It turns out\nthat the problem of detecting at most two communities naturally fits into the\narchitecture of a quantum annealer with almost no need of reformulation. This\npaper addresses a systematic study of detecting two or more communities in a\nnetwork using a quantum annealer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2019 15:57:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Negre", "Christian F.
