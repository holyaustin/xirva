With the increasing\nimportance of mobile embedded systems and flexible applications, considerable\nprogress in research has been made for power management. Power constraints are\nincreasingly becoming the critical component of the design specifications of\nthese systems. It helps in pre-determining the suitable hardware architecture\nfor the target application. The aim of this paper is to present a technique to\nestimate 'pre-run time' and 'power' of a software mapped onto a hardware\nsystem; guaranteeing the compliance of temporal constraints while generating a\nschedule of tasks of software. Real time systems must handle several\nindependent macro-tasks, each represented by a task graph, which includes\ncommunications and precedence constraints. We propose a novel approach for\npower estimation of embedded software using the Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG)\nor task graph model. This methodology uses an existing Hierarchical Concurrent\nFlow Graph (HCFG) technique for the power analysis of the CDFGs. We have\nevaluated our technique for energy efficient scheduling over various task graph\nbenchmarks. The results obtained prove the utility and efficacy of our proposed\napproach for power analysis of embedded software. We also present a methodology\nto obtain an energy optimal voltage assignment and perform scheduling by taking\nadvantage of the relaxation in execution time of tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2013 15:14:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Namita", ""], ["Sahula", "Vineet", ""], ["Ravikumar", "C.

In this paper, we show that using two\nultra-wideband (UWB) impulse radios, in addition to multiple RSS sensors,\nimproves the localization accuracy, particularly on the axis where no sensors\nare placed (which we call the x-axis). We introduce three methods for combining\nthe RSS and UWB data.

The\napproach consists of using UWB (ultra-wide band) based data collection to\ncharacterise behaviour in specific scenarios. From a number of experiments\ncarried out, we detail the single-file scenario to demonstrate the ability of\nthis approach to represent macroscopic characteristics of the pedestrian flow.\nResults are discussed and we can conclude that UWB-based data collection shows\ngreat potential and suitability for human trajectory extraction, when compared\nto other traditional approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 17:06:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Vasconcelos", "Gon\u00e7alo", ""], ["Petry", "Marcelo", ""], ["Almeida", "Jo\u00e3o Em\u00edlio", ""], ["Rossetti", "Rosaldo J.

From high-performance computing (HPC) to\nmobile application processors, low multicore utilization rates result from the\nslowness of accessing off-chip operands, i.e. the memory wall. The APplication\nAXcelerator (APAX) universal numerical encoder reduces computing's memory wall\nby compressing numerical operands (integers and floats), thereby decreasing CPU\naccess time by 3:1 to 10:1 as operands stream between memory and cores. APAX\nencodes numbers using a low-complexity algorithm designed both for time series\nsensor data and for multi-dimensional data, including images. APAX encoding\nparameters are determined by a profiler that quantifies the uncertainty\ninherent in numerical datasets and recommends encoding parameters reflecting\nthis uncertainty. Compatible software, FPGA, and systemon-chip (SoC)\nimplementations efficiently support encoding rates between 150 MByte/sec and\n1.5 GByte/sec at low power. On 25 integer and floating-point datasets, we\nachieved encoding rates between 3:1 and 10:1, with average correlation of\n0.999959, while accelerating computational \"time to results.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 17:11:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wegener", "Albert", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6311", "submitter": "Rustem Valeyev", "authors": "Rustem Valeyev", "title": "Principle \"synthesis\" for the solution of tasks of class NP", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Initial contours of the non-standard approach to reception of the answer of\nany task on discrete structures are considered: the algorithm independently\ncreates such answer from separate fragments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 20:54:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Valeyev", "Rustem", ""]]}]
