This is due to some excellent properties of the MEMS\ndevices like low loss, excellent isolation etc. in the microwave frequency\ndomain where the on-chip passives normally tend to become leakier and degrades\nthe transceiver performance. This paper presents a comparative analysis between\nMEMS-resonator based and MEMS-passives based band-pass filter configurations\nfor RF applications, along with their design, simulation, fabrication and\ncharacterization. The filters were designed to have a center frequency of 455\nkHz, meant for use as the intermediate frequency (IF) filter in superheterodyne\nreceivers. The filter structures have been fabricated in PolyMUMPs process, a\nthree-polysilicon layer surface micromachining process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 06:41:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Basu", "J.", ""], ["Bhattacharya", "A.", ""], ["Chakraborty", "S.", ""], ["Bhattacharyya", "T.

The tooth track is linked\nwith the velocity giving the surface topography resulting from actual machining\nconditions. The model is assessed thanks to a series of sweeping over planes\naccording to various tool axis orientations and cutting conditions. 3D surface\ntopography analyses are performed through the new areal surface roughness\nparameters proposed by recent standards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jun 2011 14:35:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Quinsat", "Yann", "", "LURPA"], ["Lavernhe", "Sylvain", "", "LURPA"], ["Lartigue", "Claire", "", "LURPA"]]}, {"id": "1106.2207", "submitter": "Maurice Pillet", "authors": "Barbara Lyonnet (SYMME), Maurice Pillet (SYMME), Magali Pralus (SYMME)", "title": "Optimisation de la taille de la s\\'erie: illustration par un cas\n  industriel de sous-traitance m\\'ecanique", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Congr\\`es International de G\\'enie Industriel CIGI'09, Tarbes :\n  France (2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reducing costs of manufactured products is one of the key issues of\ncompanies.

The\nidentification is based on volumetric error measurements for different poses\nwith a non-contact measuring instrument called CapBall, developed in house. In\norder to evaluate the uncertainty on each identified error, a multi-output\nMonte Carlo approach is implemented. Uncertainty sources in the measurement and\nidentification chain - such as sensors output, machine drift and frame\ntransformation uncertainties - can be included in the model and propagated to\nthe identified errors. The estimated uncertainties are finally compared to\nexperimental results to assess the method. It shows that the effect of the\ndrift, a disturbance, must be simulated as a function of time the Monte Carlo\napproach.
