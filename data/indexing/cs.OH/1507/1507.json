These areas are ordinary in the proximity of built-up areas and buffers\nareas of 1 km were delimited for every locality. Based on various map layers in\nvector formats (land use, rivers, built-up areas, roads etc) an assessment\nmethod is performed to highlight the potential areas vulnerable to illegal\ndumping inside these buffer areas at local scale. The results are correlated to\nfield observations and current situation of waste management systems. The maps\noutline local disparities due to various geographical conditions of county.\nThis approach is a necessary tool in EIA studies particularly for rural waste\nmanagement systems at local and regional scale which are less studied in\ncurrent literature than urban areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2015 15:25:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mihai", "Florin-Constantin", ""], ["Ursu", "Adrian", ""], ["Ichim", "Pavel", ""], ["Chelaru", "Dan-Adrian", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.00921", "submitter": "Marco Secondini", "authors": "Marco Secondini, Simon Rommel, Francesco Fresi, Enrico Forestieri,\n  Gianluca Meloni, Luca Pot\\`i", "title": "Coherent 100G Nonlinear Compensation with Single-Step Digital\n  Backpropagation", "comments": "This work has been presented at Optical Networks Design & Modeling\n  (ONDM) 2015, Pisa, Italy, May 11-14, 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Enhanced-SSFM digital backpropagation (DBP) is experimentally demonstrated\nand compared to conventional DBP.

In\ncomparison, conventional DBP requires twenty steps to achieve the same\nperformance. An analysis of the computational complexity and structure of the\ntwo algorithms reveals that the overall complexity and power consumption of DBP\nare reduced by a factor of 16 with respect to a conventional implementation,\nwhile the computation time is reduced by a factor of 20. As a result, the\nproposed algorithm enables a practical and effective implementation of DBP in\nreal-time optical receivers, with only a moderate increase of the computational\ncomplexity, power consumption, and latency with respect to a simple\nfeed-forward equalizer for dispersion compensation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 21:11:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Secondini", "Marco", ""], ["Rommel", "Simon", ""], ["Fresi", "Francesco", ""], ["Forestieri", "Enrico", ""], ["Meloni", "Gianluca", ""], ["Pot\u00ec", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.01444", "submitter": "Vladimir Garcia-Morales", "authors": "Vladimir Garcia-Morales", "title": "Fractal surfaces from simple arithmetic operations", "comments": "15 pages, 6 figures, minor corrections.
