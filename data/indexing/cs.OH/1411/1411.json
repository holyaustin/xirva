One of the major challenges associated with wireless\nsensor networks is the quality of the data and more specifically the detection\nof segment outliers and unusual events. Most previous research has focused on\ndetecting outliers that are errors that are caused by unreliable sensors and\nsensor nodes. However, there is an urgent need for the development of new tools\ncapable of identifying, tagging and visualizing erroneous segment outliers and\nunusual events from sensor data streams. In this paper, we present a SOUE\nDetector (Segment Outlier and Unusual Event-Detector) system for wireless\nsensor networks that combines statistical analyses using Dynamic Time Warping\n(DTW) with domain expert knowledge (captured via an ontology and semantic\ninferencing rules). The resulting Web portal enables scientist to efficiently\nsearch across a collection of wireless sensor data streams and identify,\nretrieve and display segment outliers (both erroneous and genuine) within the\ndata streams. In this paper, we firstly describe the detection algorithms, the\nimplementation details and the functionality of the SOUE Detector system.\nSecondly we evaluate our approach using data that comprises sensor observations\ncollected from a sensor network deployed in the Springbrook National Park in\nQueensland, Australia. The experimental results show that the SOUE-Detector can\nefficiently detect segment outliers and unusual events with high levels of\nprecision and recall.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 02:58:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Lianli", ""], ["Bruenig", "Michael", ""], ["Hunter", "Jane", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.3506", "submitter": "Alireza Mesri", "authors": "Alireza Mesri, Mahmoud Mahdipour Pirbazari, Khayrollah Hadidi, and\n  Abdollah Khoei", "title": "High gain two-stage amplifier with positive capacitive feedback\n  compensation", "comments": "26 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables Accepted for publication in IET\n  Circuits, Devices and Systems", "journal-ref": "Circuits, Devices & Systems, IET (Volume:9 , Issue: 3 ), 2015", "doi": "10.1049/iet-cds.2014.0139", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A novel topology for a high gain two-stage amplifier is proposed. The\nproposed circuit is designed in a way that the non-dominant pole is at output\nof the first stage. A positive capacitive feedback (PCF) around the second\nstage introduces a left half plane (LHP) zero which cancels the phase shift\nintroduced by the non-dominant pole, considerably. The dominant pole is at the\noutput node which means that increasing the load capacitance has minimal effect\non stability. Moreover, a simple and effective method is proposed to enhance\nslew rate. Simulation shows that slew rate is improved by a factor of 2.44\nusing the proposed method. The proposed amplifier is designed in a 0.18um CMOS\nprocess. It consumes 0.86mW power from a 1.8V power supply and occupies\n3038.5um2 of chip area. The DC gain is 82.7dB and gain bandwidth (GBW) is 88.9\nMHz when driving a 5pF capacitive load. Also low frequency CMRR and PSRR+ are\n127dB and 83.2dB, respectively.

In\nthis paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) driven multi-path routing\nalgorithm to provide diverse paths for different categories of evacuees. This\nalgorithm borrows the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), which is a\nflexible protocol that can rapidly solve optimal solution for any user-defined\ngoal function. Spatial information regarding the location and spread of hazards\nis taken into consideration to avoid that evacuees be directed towards\nhazardous zones. Furthermore, since previous emergency navigation algorithms\nare normally insensitive to sudden changes in the hazard environment such as\nabrupt congestion or injury of civilians, evacuees are dynamically assigned to\nseveral groups to adapt their course of action with regard to their on-going\nphysical condition and environments. Simulation results indicate that the\nproposed algorithm which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees produces better\nresults than the use of a single metric. Simulations also show that the use of\ndynamic grouping to adjust the evacuees' category and routing algorithms with\nregard for their on-going health conditions and mobility, can achieve higher\nsurvival rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 16:04:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 15:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Akinwande", "Olumide J.", ""], ["Bi", "Huibo", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.4221", "submitter": "Zhi Cheng", "authors": "Zhi Cheng", "title": "A dynamic mechanism of Alzheimer based on artificial neural network", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we provide another angle to analyze the reasons why Alzheimer\nDisease exists.
