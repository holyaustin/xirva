A few researches have focused on improving TEG\nefficiency at the system level on vehicle radiators. The most recent\nreconfiguration algorithm shows improvement in performance but suffers from\nmajor drawback on computational time and energy overhead, and non-scalability\nin terms of array size and processing frequency. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel TEG array reconfiguration algorithm that determines near-optimal\nconfiguration with an acceptable computational time. More precisely, with\n$O(N)$ time complexity, our prediction-based fast TEG reconfiguration algorithm\nenables all modules to work at or near their maximum power points (MPP).\nAdditionally, we incorporate prediction methods to further reduce the runtime\nand switching overhead during the reconfiguration process. Experimental results\npresent $30\\%$ performance improvement, almost $100\\times$ reduction on\nswitching overhead and $13\\times$ enhancement on computational speed compared\nto the baseline and prior work. The scalability of our algorithm makes it\napplicable to larger scale systems such as industrial boilers and heat\nexchangers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Mar 2018 14:34:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Hanchen", ""], ["Kang", "Feiyang", ""], ["Ding", "Caiwen", ""], ["Li", "Ji", ""], ["Kim", "Jaemin", ""], ["Baek", "Donkyu", ""], ["Nazarian", "Shahin", ""], ["Lin", "Xue", ""], ["Bogdan", "Paul", ""], ["Chang", "Naehyuck", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.01754", "submitter": "Mohamed Elshatshat", "authors": "Georgios Smpokos, Mohamed A.
