The key to this assessment is an index called betweenness\nindex which is based on ideas from complex network theory. The proposed\nbetweenness index is an improvement of previous works since it considers the\nactual real power flow through the transmission lines along the network.\nFurthermore, this work initiates a new area for complex system research to\nassess the stability of the power system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2011 05:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nasiruzzaman", "A.

The\nmotivation of each pedestrian is to leave the facility. The events used to\nredirect pedestrians include the identification of a jam situation and/or\nidentification of a better route than the current. This study considers two\ntypes of pedestrians: familiar and unfamiliar with the facility. Four\nstrategies are modelled to cover those groups. The modelled strategies are the\nshortest path (local and global); They are combined with a quickest path\napproach, which is based on an observation principle. In the quickest path\napproach, pedestrians take their decisions based on the observed environment\nand are routed dynamically in the network using an appropriate cost benefit\nanalysis function. The dynamic modelling of route choice with different\nstrategies and types of pedestrians considers the manifold of in uences which\nappears in the real system and raises questions about the criticality of an\nevacuation process. To address this question criteria are elaborated. The\ncriteria we focus on in this contribution are the evacuation time, the\nindividual times spent in jam, the jam size evolution and the overall jam size\nitself. The in uences of the different strategies on those evaluation criteria\nare investigated. The sensibility of the system to disturbances (e.g. broken\nescape route) is also analysed.
