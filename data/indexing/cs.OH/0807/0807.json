Consequently,\nairport ground operations face critically congested taxiways and long runway\nqueues. In this report, we show how improved management of departure operations\nfrom the ready-to-push-back time to the wheels-off time can potentially yield\nsignificant benefits to airlines and air traffic services. We develop a\nCollaborative Virtual Queue to enable better optimization capabilities during\ncongested situations while taking into account the laissez-faire competitive\nenvironment. Results are evaluated using a departure system model, validated\nusing current statistics and previous studies. First, the Collaborative Virtual\nQueue enables keeping aircraft away from runway queues, which increases\nwheels-off time predictability. Second, holding aircraft enables last-minute\nintra-airline flight switching. This creates new optimization capabilities for\nairlines i.e. it gives airlines the flexibility to prioritize their flight\nsequence in real-time. These capabilities are illustrated by the trade-off\nbetween minimizing the average passenger waiting time and minimizing the level\nof unfairness between aircraft of the same airline. For instance, airlines\ncould choose to decrease by up to 15% their average passenger waiting time by\nprioritizing heavy planes over small planes when the taxiway system is\ncongested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2008 22:39:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Burgain", "Pierrick", ""], ["Feron", "Eric", ""], ["Clarke", "John-Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.0992", "submitter": "Alexis Darrasse", "authors": "Alexis Darrasse (LIP6)", "title": "Random XML sampling the Boltzmann way", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we present the prototype of a framework capable of producing,\nwith linear complexity, uniformly random XML documents with respect to a given\nRELAX NG grammar.
