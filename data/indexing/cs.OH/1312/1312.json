The\nobjective of this scoping review is to compile communication theories,\nframeworks, and models used by high risk organizations outside healthcare to\nstudy and resolve workplace communication issues. The healthcare databases\nsearched included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. In addition, we\nsearched engineering and science literature to include articles in the fields\nof information sciences, computer sciences, nuclear power generation, aviation,\nthe military and other domains such as sociology that address the science and\ntheory of communication. Comprehensive searching was also done in the\ncommunication studies literature. We also reviewed conference proceedings and\ngrey literature and conducted citation tracking. Our initial systematic search\nyielded 15,365 articles. Hand searching and reviewing references resulted in a\nset of 181 articles. 144 full text articles were read and 40 of them were\nselected to be included in the review. We were able to identify 14 theories and\n12 models which could be applied in hospital communication research. However,\nit must be noted that most of them have not yet been applied in biomedical\nresearch in hospital communication and as such their applicability can only be\nsuggested-a gap which future research may be able to address.

In both frameworks, so-called\ntokens (denoted as small circles) represent individual entities comprising the\nsystem; however, SPN graphs contain two distinct types of nodes (called places\nand transitions) with transitions serving the purpose of routing tokens among\nplaces. As a result, a pair of place nodes in SPNs can be linked to each other\nonly via a transient stop, a transition node. In contrast, APN graphs link\nplace nodes directly by arcs (transitions), similar to state space diagrams for\nMarkov chains, and separate transition nodes are not needed.\n  Tokens in APN are distinct and have labels that can assume both discrete\nvalues (\"colors\") and continuous values (\"ages\"), both of which can change\nduring simulation. Component interactions are modeled in APNs using triggers,\nwhich are either inhibitors or enablers (the inhibitors' opposites).\nHierarchical construction of APNs rely on using stacks (layers) of submodels\nwith automatically matching color policies. As a result, APNs provide at least\nthe same modeling power as SPNs, but, as demonstrated by means of several\nexamples, the resulting models are often more compact and transparent,\ntherefore facilitating more efficient performance evaluation of complex\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 16:38:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Volovoi", "Vitali", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2868", "submitter": "Victoriano Valencia Garc\\'ia", "authors": "Victoriano Valencia Garc\\'ia, Eugenio J.
