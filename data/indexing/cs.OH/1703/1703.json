The model\ndescribes the relation between a set of manifold valued observations, such as\nshapes of anatomical objects, and Euclidean explanatory variables. The approach\nis based on stochastic development of Euclidean diffusion processes to the\nmanifold. Defining the data distribution as the transition distribution of the\nmapped stochastic process, parameters of the model, the non-linear analogue of\ndesign matrix and intercept, are found via maximum likelihood. The model is\nintrinsically related to the geometry encoded in the connection of the\nmanifold. We propose an estimation procedure which applies the Laplace\napproximation of the likelihood function. A simulation study of the performance\nof the model is performed and the model is applied to a real dataset of Corpus\nCallosum shapes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 13:32:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["K\u00fchnel", "Line", ""], ["Sommer", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.00444", "submitter": "Tetsuya Kobayashi", "authors": "Tetsuya J.

Since the down-sizing of micro-fabrication\ngenerates non-negligible noise in these systems, a new approach for designing\nnoise-immune gates is required. In this paper, we demonstrate that noise-immune\ngates can be designed by combining Bayesian inference theory with the idea of\ncomputation over a noisy signal. To reveal their practical advantages, the\nperformance of these gates is evaluated in comparison with a stochastic\nresonance-based gate proposed previously. This approach for computation is also\ndemonstrated to be better than a conventional one that conducts information\ntransmission and computation separately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 05:52:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Dec 2019 14:48:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2019 04:05:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kobayashi", "Tetsuya J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.00785", "submitter": "Anthony Faustine Sambaiga", "authors": "Anthony Faustine, Nerey Henry Mvungi, Shubi Kaijage, Kisangiri Michael", "title": "A Survey on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Methodies and Techniques for\n  Energy Disaggregation Problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rapid urbanization of developing countries coupled with explosion in\nconstruction of high rising buildings and the high power usage in them calls\nfor conservation and efficient energy program.

Today's apps offload processing and storing contextual information,\nbut this increases response time, often relies on the user's data connection,\nand runs the very real risk of revealing sensitive information. In this paper\nwe motivate the feasibility of on-loading large amounts of context and\nintroduce PACO (Programming Abstraction for Contextual On-loading), an\narchitecture for on-loading data that optimizes for location and time while\nallowing flexibility in storing additional context. The PACO API's innovations\nenable on-loading very dense traces of information, even given devices'\nresource constraints. Using real-world traces and our implementation for\nAndroid, we demonstrate that PACO can support expressive application queries\nentirely on-device. Our quantitative evaluation assesses PACO's energy\nconsumption, execution time, and spatiotemporal query accuracy. Further, PACO\nfacilitates unified contextual reasoning across multiple applications and also\nsupports user-controlled release of contextual data to other devices or the\ncloud; we demonstrate these assets through a proof-of-concept case study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 01:29:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wendt", "Nathaniel", ""], ["Julien", "Christine", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.03740", "submitter": "Sebastiaan Van Zelst", "authors": "Wil M.P. van der Aalst, Alfredo Bolt, Sebastiaan J. van Zelst", "title": "RapidProM: Mine Your Processes and Not Just Your Data", "comments": "Will be published in 2nd version of \"RapidMiner: Data Mining Use\n  Cases and Business Analytics Applications\"; Markus Hofmann, Ralf Klinkenberg;\n  published by Chapman & Hall/CRC Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Series", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The number of events recorded for operational processes is growing every\nyear.
