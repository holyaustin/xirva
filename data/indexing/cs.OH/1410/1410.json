Since the power consumption and reliability of\nmicroprocessors are highly dependent on temperature, management units need\naccurate thermal models. Exponential cooling models are justified for\nactively-cooled systems. Here, we analyze the tractability of the cooling law\nfor a passively cooled body, subject to radiative and convective cooling,\nincluding internal heat generation. Focusing then on embedded system-like\nobjects, we compare the performance difference between our new passive cooling\nlaw and the conventionally-used exponential one. We show that, for quasi\nisothermal cooling surfaces of the order of 1\\,dm$^2$ or greater, the radiative\ncooling effect may become comparable to the convective cooling one. In other\nwords, radiation becomes non-negligible for systems with a cooling surface\nlarger than about 1\\,dm$^2$. Otherwise for surfaces below 1\\,dm$^2$, we show\nthat the differences between the exact solution and the exponential cooling law\nbecomes negligible. In the absence of accurate temperature measurements, an\nexponential cooling model is shown to be accurate enough for systems, such as\nsmall-sized SoCs, that require low processing overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 08:42:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 14:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["De Vogeleer", "Karel", ""], ["Memmi", "Gerard", ""], ["Jouvelot", "Pierre", ""], ["Coelho", "Fabien", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0705", "submitter": "Mikhail Prisheltsev", "authors": "Mikhail Prisheltsev", "title": "Adaptive two-dimensional wavelet transformation based on the Haar system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose is to study qualitative and quantitative rates of image\ncompression by using different Haar wavelet banks.

The design\nengineering of PV systems requires modeling and evaluating shading losses. Some\nPV systems are affected by complex shading scenes whose resulting PV energy\nlosses are very difficult to evaluate with current modeling tools. Several\nspecialized PV design and simulation software include the possibility to\nevaluate shading losses. They generally possess a Graphical User Interface\n(GUI) through which the user can draw a 3D shading scene, and then evaluate its\ncorresponding PV energy losses. The complexity of the objects that these tools\ncan handle is relatively limited. We have created a software solution, 3DPV,\nwhich allows evaluating the energy losses induced by complex 3D scenes on PV\ngenerators. The 3D objects can be imported from specialized 3D modeling\nsoftware or from a 3D object library. The shadows cast by this 3D scene on the\nPV generator are then directly evaluated from the Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU). Thanks to the recent development of GPUs for the video game industry,\nthe shadows can be evaluated with a very high spatial resolution that reaches\nwell beyond the PV cell level, in very short calculation times. A PV simulation\nmodel then translates the geometrical shading into PV energy output losses.\n3DPV has been implemented using WebGL, which allows it to run directly from a\nWeb browser, without requiring any local installation from the user. This also\nallows taken full benefits from the information already available from\nInternet, such as the 3D object libraries. This contribution describes, step by\nstep, the method that allows 3DPV to evaluate the PV energy losses caused by\ncomplex shading. We then illustrate the results of this methodology to several\napplication cases that are encountered in the world of PV systems design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2014 22:25:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Robledo", "Jesus", ""], ["Leloux", "Jonathan", ""], ["Lorenzo", "Eduardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.6831", "submitter": "Benjamin Larrousse", "authors": "Benjamin Larrousse, Olivier Beaude and Samson Lasaulce", "title": "Crawford-Sobel meet Lloyd-Max on the grid", "comments": "ICASSP 2014, 5 pages", "journal-ref": "IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal\n  Processing (ICASSP), Florence, Italy, May 2014", "doi": "10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854781", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main contribution of this work is twofold. First, we apply, for the first\ntime, a framework borrowed from economics to a problem in the smart grid\nnamely, the design of signaling schemes between a consumer and an electricity\naggregator when these have non-aligned objectives. The consumer's objective is\nto meet its need in terms of power and send a request (a message) to the\naggregator which does not correspond, in general, to its actual need. The\naggregator, which receives this request, not only wants to satisfy it but also\nwants to manage the cost induced by the residential electricity distribution\nnetwork. Second, we establish connections between the exploited framework and\nthe quantization problem. Although the model assumed for the payoff functions\nfor the consumer and aggregator is quite simple, it allows one to extract\ninsights of practical interest from the analysis conducted. This allows us to\nestablish a direct connection with quantization, and more importantly, to open\na much more general challenge for source and channel coding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Sep 2014 12:45:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Larrousse", "Benjamin", ""], ["Beaude", "Olivier", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8402", "submitter": "Nabarun Mondal Mr", "authors": "Nabarun Mondal and Partha P.
