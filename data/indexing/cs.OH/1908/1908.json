We address this task by means of adaptive neural\nnetworks, which re-adjust their weights when transferred to new conditions.\nSuch an adaptive account for computational models is typical of the field of\ndevelopmental robotics, which investigates learning of motor control in\nartificial systems inspired on infants development. Similarly to robots,\ngreenhouses are complex systems comprising technical and biological elements,\nwhose state can be measured and modified through control actions. We present an\nadaptive model architecture to perform online learning on greenhouse models.\nThis learning process makes use of an episodic memory and of online\nre-training. This allows for adaptation without the need for a complete new\ntraining, which might be prohibitive if the data under the new conditions is\nscarce. Current experiments focus on how a model of tomato photosynthesis,\ndeveloped in a research facility, can adapt itself to a new environment in a\nproduction greenhouse. Further research will focus on model plasticity by means\nof adaptive learning rates and management of the episodic memory described in\nthis paper. The models presented as a proof-of-concept estimate the\ntranspiration and photosynthesis of a hydroponic tomato crop by using\nmeasurements of the climate as inputs. The models are trained and tested using\ndata from a greenhouse in Berlin, Germany. Thereafter, the adaptive\narchitecture is fed with data from a production greenhouse in southern Germany,\nwhere other tomato varieties were grown under different irrigation and climate\nstrategies. The proposed adaptive architecture represents a promising tool for\nspreading the use of models produced by high-tech research centers to the\ngreenhouse production sector.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 13:09:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2019 09:49:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Miranda", "Luis", ""], ["Schillaci", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.03202", "submitter": "Yang Liu", "authors": "Yang Liu, Guojun Han (Senior Member, IEEE), Yonghua Wang (Member,\n  IEEE), Zheng Xue, Jing Chen", "title": "Received Signal Strength Based Wireless Source Localization with\n  Inaccurate Anchor Position", "comments": "12 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SP cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Received signal strength (RSS)-based wireless localization is easy to\nimplement at low cost.
