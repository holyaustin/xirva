In particular, the less critical tasks are carelessly\ndiscarded when the computation demand of (some of) the high critical tasks\nincreases. This might nevertheless result in system failure, as these less\ncritical tasks could be accessing data, the consistency of which should be\npreserved. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a method to\ncautiously handle task suspension. Furthermore, it is usually assumed that the\nless critical tasks will never be re-enabled once discarded.
