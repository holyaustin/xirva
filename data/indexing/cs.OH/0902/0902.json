Individuals are connected to households\nand workplaces and represent crucial links in the Swedish social contact\nnetwork. This enables significant policy experiments in the domain of epidemic\noutbreaks. Development of the model started in 2004 at the Swedish Institute\nfor Infectious Disease Control (SMI) in Solna, Sweden with the goal of creating\na tool for testing the effects of intervention policies. These interventions\ninclude mass vaccination, targeted vaccination, isolation and social\ndistancing. The model was initially designed for simulating smallpox outbreaks.\nIn 2006, it was modified to support simulations of pandemic influenza. All nine\nmillions members of the Swedish population are represented in the model. This\narticle is a technical description of the simulation model; the input data, the\nsimulation engine and the basic object types.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2009 13:37:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Brouwers", "Lisa", ""], ["Camitz", "Martin", ""], ["Cakici", "Baki", ""], ["M\u00e4kil\u00e4", "Kalle", ""], ["Saretok", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1232", "submitter": "Soubhik Chakraborty", "authors": "Soubhik Chakraborty", "title": "On Why and What of Randomness", "comments": "This article will definitely assist both teaching and research(esp on\n  the interface of statistics and computing)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has several objectives. First, it separates randomness from\nlawlessness and shows why even genuine randomness does not imply lawlessness.\nSecond, it separates the question -why should I call a phenomenon random? (and\nanswers it in part one) from the patent question -What is a random sequence?\n-for which the answer lies in Kolmogorov complexity (which is explained in part\ntwo). While answering the first question the note argues why there should be\nfour motivating factors for calling a phenomenon random: ontic, epistemic,\npseudo and telescopic, the first two depicting genuine randomness and the last\ntwo false. Third, ontic and epistemic randomness have been distinguished from\nontic and epistemic probability. Fourth, it encourages students to be applied\nstatisticians and advises against becoming armchair theorists but this is\ninterestingly achieved by a straight application of telescopic randomness.\nOverall, it tells (the teacher) not to jump to probability without explaining\nrandomness properly first and similarly advises the students to read (and\nunderstand) randomness minutely before taking on probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Feb 2009 10:46:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Soubhik", ""]]}]
