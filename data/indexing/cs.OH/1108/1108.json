Therefore, taking\nadvantage of information technologies (IT) is an increasing challenge for\ndeveloping countries. There is now growing evidence that Knowledge-driven\ninnovation is a decisive factor in the competitiveness of nations, industries,\norganizations and firms. Organizations like the banking sector have benefited\nsubstantially from e-banking, which is one among the IT applications for\nstrengthening the competitiveness. This paper presents the current trend in the\napplication of IT in the banking industries in Nigeria and gives an insight\ninto how quality banking has been enhanced via IT. The paper further reveals\nthat the deployment of IT facilities in the Nigerian Banking industry has\nbrought about fundamental changes in the content and quality of banking\nbusiness in the country. This analysis and clarification of how Nigerian Banks\nhave used IT to reengineer their operations is detailed through literature\nreview and observation. Three categories of variables that relate to the use\nand implementation of information technology devices were considered in this\npaper. These include the nature and degree of adoption of innovative\ntechnologies; degree of utilization of the identified technologies; and the\nimpact of the adoption of IT devices on the bank operations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2011 18:06:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Oluwatolani", "Oluwagbemi", ""], ["Joshua", "Abah", ""], ["Philip", "Achimugu", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1472", "submitter": "Lachhman Das Dhomeja", "authors": "Lachhman Das, Yasir Arfat, Azhar Shah, Khalil Khoumbati", "title": "System Support for Managing Invalid Bindings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Lachhman Das Dhomeja, Yasir Arfat Malkani, Azhar Ali Shah and\n  Khalil Khoumbati, \"System Support For Managing Invalid Bindings\",\n  International Journal of UbiComp (IJU), Vol.2, No.3, July 2011", "doi": "10.5121/iju.2011.2303", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Context-aware adaptation is a central aspect of pervasive computing\napplications, enabling them to adapt and perform tasks based on contextual\ninformation. One of the aspects of context-aware adaptation is reconfiguration\nin which bindings are created between application component and remote services\nin order to realize new behaviour in response to contextual information.\nVarious research efforts provide reconfiguration support and allow the\ndevelopment of adaptive context-aware applications from high-level\nspecifications, but don't consider failure conditions that might arise during\nexecution of such applications, making bindings between application and remote\nservices invalid. To this end, we propose and implement our design approach to\nreconfiguration to manage invalid bindings. The development and modification of\nadaptive context-aware applications is a complex task, and an issue of an\ninvalidity of bindings further complicates development efforts. To reduce the\ndevelopment efforts, our approach provides an application-transparent solution\nwhere the issue of the invalidity of bindings is handled by our system,\nPolicy-Based Contextual Reconfiguration and Adaptation (PCRA), not by an\napplication developer.

The cost of the\nredistribution is tied to the number and density of participating suppliers,\nand costs can be reduced (and supply increased) simply by recruiting additional\ndonors to participate.
