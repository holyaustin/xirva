In order to reach the best possible performances, it\nis necessary to take into account a maximum of constraints during tool path\ncalculation. For this purpose, we have developed a surface representation of\nthe tool paths to manage 5-axis High Speed Milling, which is the most\ncomplicated case. This model allows integrating early in the step of tool path\ncomputation the machine tool geometrical constraints (axis ranges, part holder\norientation), kinematical constraints (speed and acceleration on the axes,\nsingularities) as well as gouging issues between the tool and the part. The aim\nof the paper is to optimize the step of 5-axis HSM tool path calculation with a\nbi-parameter surface representation of the tool path. We propose an example of\nintegration of the digital process for tool path computation, ensuring the\nrequired quality and maximum productivity\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2009 09:05:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Tournier", "Christophe", "", "LURPA"], ["Lavernhe", "Sylvain", "", "LURPA"], ["Lartigue", "Claire", "", "LURPA"]]}, {"id": "0904.1084", "submitter": "Sylvain Lavernhe", "authors": "Kwamiwi Mawussi (LURPA), Sylvain Lavernhe (LURPA), Claire Lartigue\n  (LURPA)", "title": "Usinage de poches en UGV - Aide au choix de strat\\'egies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Revue Internationale de CFAO et d'informatique graphique 18, 3\n  (2003) 337-349", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper deals with associating the optimal machining strategy to a given\npocket geometry, within the context of High-Speed Machining (HSM) of\naeronautical pockets.
