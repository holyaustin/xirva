Human retinotopic mapping can be revealed by analyzing cortex\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals when the subject is under\nspecific visual stimuli. Conventional methods process, smooth, and analyze the\nretinotopic mapping based on the parametrization of the (partial) cortical\nsurface. However, the retinotopic maps generated by this approach frequently\ncontradict neuropsychology results. To address this problem, we propose an\nintegrated approach that parameterizes the cortical surface, such that the\nparametric coordinates linearly relates the visual coordinate. The proposed\nmethod helps the smoothing of noisy retinotopic maps and obtains\nneurophysiological insights in human vision systems. One key element of the\napproach is the Error-Tolerant Teichmuller Map, which uniforms the angle\ndistortion and maximizes the alignments to self-contradicting landmarks. We\nvalidated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping\ndatasets. The experimental results show the proposed approach is superior in\naccuracy and compatibility.
