Sentaurus TCAD simulation tool is used to investigate the\neffect of work function of gates ont he performance FDSOI MOSFET. Specific\nchannel length of the device that had been concentrated is 25nm. From\nsimulation we observed that by changing the work function of the metal gates of\nFD-SOI MOSFET we can change the threshold voltage. Hence by using this\ntechnique we can set the appropriate threshold voltage of FD-SOI MOSFET at same\nvoltage and we can decrease the leakage current, gate tunneling current and\nshort channel effects and increase drive current.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Apr 2011 07:09:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ranka", "Deepesh", ""], ["Rana", "Ashwani K.", ""], ["Yadav", "Rakesh Kumar", ""], ["Yadav", "Kamalesh", ""], ["Giri", "Devendra", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1962", "submitter": "Lilatul Ferdouse", "authors": "Lilatul Ferdouse, Nasrin Akhter, Tamanna Haque Nipa and Fariha Tasmin\n  Jaigirdar", "title": "Simulation and Performance Analysis of Adaptive Filtering Algorithms in\n  Noise Cancellation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 8,\n  Issue 1, January 2011, 185-192", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Noise problems in signals have gained huge attention due to the need of\nnoise-free output signal in numerous communication systems. The principal of\nadaptive noise cancellation is to acquire an estimation of the unwanted\ninterfering signal and subtract it from the corrupted signal. Noise\ncancellation operation is controlled adaptively with the target of achieving\nimproved signal to noise ratio. This paper concentrates upon the analysis of\nadaptive noise canceller using Recursive Least Square (RLS), Fast Transversal\nRecursive Least Square (FTRLS) and Gradient Adaptive Lattice (GAL) algorithms.\nThe performance analysis of the algorithms is done based on convergence\nbehavior, convergence time, correlation coefficients and signal to noise ratio.\nAfter comparing all the simulated results we observed that GAL performs the\nbest in noise cancellation in terms of Correlation Coefficient, SNR and\nConvergence Time. RLS, FTRLS and GAL were never evaluated and compared before\non their performance in noise cancellation in terms of the criteria we\nconsidered here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 14:44:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ferdouse", "Lilatul", ""], ["Akhter", "Nasrin", ""], ["Nipa", "Tamanna Haque", ""], ["Jaigirdar", "Fariha Tasmin", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.3525", "submitter": "Ruhi Tuncer", "authors": "Ruhi Tuncer", "title": "Evolutionary Foundations of Mathematics", "comments": "22 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a simple cognitive model where qualitative and quantitative com-\nparisons enable animals to identify objects, associate them with their\nproperties held in memory and make naive inference.
