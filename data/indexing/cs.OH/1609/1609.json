In this paper, we focus on deeply embedded devices, typically used\nfor Internet of Things (IoT) applications, and demonstrate how to enable energy\ntransparency through existing Static Resource Analysis (SRA) techniques and a\nnew target-agnostic profiling technique, without hardware energy measurements.\nOur novel mapping technique enables software energy consumption estimations at\na higher level than the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), namely the LLVM\nIntermediate Representation (IR) level, and therefore introduces energy\ntransparency directly to the LLVM optimizer. We apply our energy estimation\ntechniques to a comprehensive set of benchmarks, including single- and also\nmulti-threaded embedded programs from two commonly used concurrency patterns,\ntask farms and pipelines. Using SRA, our LLVM IR results demonstrate a high\naccuracy with a deviation in the range of 1% from the ISA SRA. Our profiling\ntechnique captures the actual energy consumption at the LLVM IR level with an\naverage error of 3%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 20:55:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jan 2017 16:12:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 12:08:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Georgiou", "Kyriakos", ""], ["Kerrison", "Steve", ""], ["Chamski", "Zbigniew", ""], ["Eder", "Kerstin", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.02769", "submitter": "Riccardo Spolaor", "authors": "Mauro Conti, Elia Dal Santo and Riccardo Spolaor", "title": "DELTA: Data Extraction and Logging Tool for Android", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the past few years, the use of smartphones has increased exponentially,\nand so have the capabilities of such devices. Together with an increase in raw\nprocessing power, modern smartphones are equipped with a wide variety of\nsensors and expose an extensive set of API (Accessible Programming Interface).\nThese capabilities allow us to extract a wide spectrum of data that ranges from\ninformation about the environment (e.g., position, orientation) to user habits\n(e.g., which apps she uses and when), as well as about the status of the\noperating system itself (e.g., memory, network adapters).

More precisely, the increase in organized complexity refers\nhere to the wealth, variety and intricacy of structures, and should not be\nconfused with the increase of random complexity, formalized by Kolmogorov\n(1965). If Bennett is right in proposing to assimilate organized complexity\nwith \"computational content\", then the fundamental cause of the increase of\ncomplexity in the universe is the existence of computing mechanisms with\nmemory, and able to cumulatively create and preserve computational contents. In\nthis view, the universe computes, remembers its calculations, and reuses them\nto conduct further computations. Evolutionary mechanisms are such forms of\ncumulative computation with memory and we owe them the organized complexity of\nlife. Language, writing, culture, science and technology can also be analyzed\nas computation mechanisms generating, preserving and accelerating the increase\nin organized complexity. The main unifying theme for big history is the energy\nrate density, a metric based on thermodynamics.
