In this research, we designed a Yagi antenna (900MHz) to expand\nthe range of jamming because Yagi has a great gain. Results of impedance by\ngamma match are 50.16 Om. Obtained the value of VSWR Yagi is 1.46:1 and jamming\ndistance that can be taken approximately 16 meters, It is different from the\njamming distance of helical antenna on a mobile phone jammer itself is about 4\nmeters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2012 04:21:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Fitriyani", "Y.", ""], ["Mutiara", "A.

We investigate the issue\nof designing a search strategy operating at the neighborhood tree level by\nexploring different paths of the tree in a heuristic way. We show that allowing\nthe search to 'backtrack' to a previously visited solution and resuming the\niterative variable neighborhood descent by 'pruning' the already explored\nneighborhood branches leads to the design of effective and efficient search\nheuristics. We describe this idea by discussing its basic design components\nwithin a generic algorithmic scheme and we propose some simple and intuitive\nstrategies to guide the search when traversing the neighborhood tree. We\nconduct a thorough experimental analysis of this approach by considering two\ndifferent problem domains, namely, the Total Weighted Tardiness Problem\n(SMTWTP), and the more sophisticated Location Routing Problem (LRP). We show\nthat independently of the considered domain, the approach is highly\ncompetitive. In particular, we show that using different branching and\nbacktracking strategies when exploring the neighborhood tree allows us to\nachieve different trade-offs in terms of solution quality and computing cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2012 12:31:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Derbel", "Houda", "", "LIFL, INRIA Lille - Nord Europe"], ["Derbel", "Bilel", "", "LIFL, INRIA Lille - Nord Europe"]]}]
