It proposes to cluster nodes together using\nRecursive-DBSCAN - an algorithm that recursively applies DBSCAN until clusters\nbelow the preset maximum number of nodes are obtained. That approach leads to\n61% decrease in runtimes of the CVRPTW solver as benchmarked against Google\nOptimization Tools, while the difference of total distance and number of\nvehicles used by found solutions is below 7%. The improvement of runtimes with\nthe Recursive-DBSCAN method is because of splitting the node-set into\nconstituent clusters, which limits the number of solutions checked by the\nsolver, consequently reducing the runtime. The proposed method consumes less\nmemory and is able to find solutions for problems up to 5000 nodes, while the\nbaseline Google Optimisation Tools solves problems up to 2000 nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2018 14:01:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 23 Mar 2019 08:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bujel", "Kamil", ""], ["Lai", "Feiko", ""], ["Szczecinski", "Michal", ""], ["So", "Winnie", ""], ["Fernandez", "Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02634", "submitter": "Anshul Goyal", "authors": "Anshul Goyal, Kartikeya Bhardwaj, Radu Marculescu", "title": "Climate Anomalies vs Air Pollution: Carbon Emissions and Anomaly\n  Networks", "comments": "This is a class project report for CMU course 18-755 in Fall 2016. 7\n  pages, 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This project aims to shed light on how man-made carbon emissions are\naffecting global wind patterns by looking for temporal and geographical\ncorrelations between carbon emissions, surface temperatures anomalies, and wind\nspeed anomalies at high altitude.
