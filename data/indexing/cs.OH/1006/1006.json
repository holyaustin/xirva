Our\nmodel is systematic and generic; it can be adapted to concrete communities in\nthe web. The knowledge of a community's life cycle allows influencing the group\nstructure: Stage transitions can be supported or harmed, e.g. to strengthen the\nbinding of a user to a site and keep communities alive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2010 11:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sonnenbichler", "Andreas C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4444", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Bruno Osorno", "title": "Analysis of Microprocessor Based Protective Re-lay's (MBPR) Differential\n  Equation Algorithms", "comments": "IEEE Publication Format,\n  https://sites.google.com/site/journalofcomputing/", "journal-ref": "Journal of Computing, Vol. 2 No. 6, June 2010, NY, USA, ISSN\n  2151-9617", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyses and explains from the systems point of view,\nmicroprocessor based protective relay (MBPR) systems with emphasis on\ndifferential equation algorithms.

This paper shows that the algorithm is a\nsystem description based and it is immune from distortions such as DC-offset.\nDifferential equation algorithms implemented in MBPR are widely used in the\nprotection of transmission and distribution lines, transformers, buses, motors,\netc. The parameters from the system, utilized in these algorithms, are obtained\nfrom the power system current i(t) or voltage v(t), which are abnormal values\nunder fault or distortion situations.

A typical blog may consist of texts, images, audios and\nvideos etc. Most of the blogs work as personal online diaries, while others may\nfocus on specific interest such as photographs (photoblog), art (artblog),\ntravel (tourblog), IT (techblog) etc. Another type of blogging called\nmicroblogging is also very well known now-a-days which contains very short\nposts. Like the developed countries, the users of blogs are gradually\nincreasing in the developing countries e.g. Bangladesh. Due to the nature of\nopen access to all users, some people misuse it to spread fake news to achieve\nindividual or political goals. Some of them also post vulgar materials that\nmake an embarrass situation for other bloggers. Even, sometimes it indulges the\nreputation of the victim. The only way to overcome this problem is to bring all\nthe posts under supervision of the blog moderator. But it totally contradicts\nwith blogging concepts. In this paper, we have implemented an algorithm that\nwould help to prevent the offensive entries from being posted. These entries\nwould go through a supervision process to justify themselves as legal posts.\nFrom the analysis of the result, we have shown that this approach can eliminate\nthe chaotic situations in blogosphere at a great extent. Our experiment shows\nthat about 90% of offensive posts can be detected and stopped from being\npublished using this approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 14:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Biswas", "Kamanashis", ""], ["Ali", "Md.

The basic mathematical tool used for\nemotion recognition is Pattern recognition which involves three operations,\nnamely, pre-processing, feature extraction and classification. This paper\nintroduces a procedure for emotion recognition using Hidden Markov Models\n(HMM), which is used to divide five emotional states: anger, surprise,\nhappiness, sadness and neutral state. The approach is based on standard speech\nrecognition technology using hidden continuous markov model by selection of low\nlevel features and the design of the recognition system. Emotional Speech\nDatabase from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed\nusing several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states. The accuracy of\nrecognizing five different emotions for both genders of classification is 80%\nfor anger-emotion which is achieved by using the best combination of\n39-dimensioanl feature vector for every frame (13 MFCCs, 13 Delta Coefficients\nand 13 Acceleration Coefficients) and a classifier using HMM. This outcome very\nmuch matches with that acquired with the same database with subjective\nevaluation by human judges.
