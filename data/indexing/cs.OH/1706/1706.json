For instance, in testing refrigeration compressors, we want to\nfind the true refrigeration capacity of the compressor being tested. Such test\n(also called an episode) may take up to four hours, being an actual hindrance\nto applying it to the total number of compressors produced. This work seeks to\nreduce the time spent on such industrial trials by employing Recurrent Neural\nNetworks (RNNs) as dynamical models for detecting when a test is entering the\nso-called steady-state region. Specifically, we use Reservoir Computing (RC)\nnetworks which simplify the learning of RNNs by speeding up training time and\nshowing convergence to a global optimum. Also, this work proposes a\nself-organized subspace projection method for RC networks which uses\ninformation from the beginning of the episode to define a cluster to which the\nepisode belongs to. This assigned cluster defines a particular binary input\nthat shifts the operating point of the reservoir to a subspace of trajectories\nfor the duration of the episode. This new method is shown to turn the RC model\nrobust in performance with respect to varying combination of reservoir\nparameters, such as spectral radius and leak rate, when compared to a standard\nRC network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 15:21:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Antonelo", "Eric Aislan", ""], ["Flesch", "Carlos Alberto", ""], ["Schmitz", "Filipe", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.03042", "submitter": "Fernando Quintao Pereira", "authors": "Tarsila Bessa, Christopher Gull, Pedro Quint\\~ao, Michael Frank,\n  Jos\\'e Nacif, Fernando Magno Quint\\~ao Pereira", "title": "JetsonLEAP: a Framework to Measure Power on a Heterogeneous\n  System-on-a-Chip Device", "comments": "31 pages, 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computer science marches towards energy-aware practices. This trend impacts\nnot only the design of computer architectures, but also the design of programs.\nHowever, developers still lack affordable and accurate technology to measure\nenergy consumption in computing systems. The goal of this paper is to mitigate\nsuch problem. To this end, we introduce JetsonLEAP, a framework that supports\nthe implementation of energy-aware programs. JetsonLEAP consists of an embedded\nhardware, in our case, the Nvidia Tegra TK1 System-on-a-chip device, a circuit\nto control the flow of energy, of our own design, plus a library to instrument\nprogram parts. We discuss two different circuit setups. The most precise setup\nlets us reliably measure the energy spent by 225,000 instructions, the least\nprecise, although more affordable setup, gives us a window of 975,000\ninstructions. To probe the precision of our system, we use it in tandem with a\nhigh-precision, high-cost acquisition system, and show that results do not\ndiffer in any significant way from those that we get using our simpler\napparatus. Our entire infrastructure - board, power meter and both circuits -\ncan be reproduced with about $500.00. To demonstrate the efficacy of our\nframework, we have used it to measure the energy consumed by programs running\non ARM cores, on the GPU, and on a remote server. Furthermore, we have studied\nthe impact of OpenACC directives on the energy efficiency of high-performance\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 16:45:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bessa", "Tarsila", ""], ["Gull", "Christopher", ""], ["Quint\u00e3o", "Pedro", ""], ["Frank", "Michael", ""], ["Nacif", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Pereira", "Fernando Magno Quint\u00e3o", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07690", "submitter": "Line K\\\"uhnel", "authors": "Line K\\\"uhnel and Stefan Sommer", "title": "Computational Anatomy in Theano", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To model deformation of anatomical shapes, non-linear statistics are required\nto take into account the non-linear structure of the data space.
