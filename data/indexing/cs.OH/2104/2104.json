To address\nthese challenges, inspired from neuro-physiological signatures of MI, this\npaper proposes a novel Filter-Bank Convolutional Network (FBCNet) for MI\nclassification. FBCNet employs a multi-view data representation followed by\nspatial filtering to extract spectro-spatially discriminative features. This\nmultistage approach enables efficient training of the network even when limited\ntraining data is available. More significantly, in FBCNet, we propose a novel\nVariance layer that effectively aggregates the EEG time-domain information.\nWith this design, we compare FBCNet with state-of-the-art (SOTA) BCI algorithm\non four MI datasets: The BCI competition IV dataset 2a (BCIC-IV-2a), the\nOpenBMI dataset, and two large datasets from chronic stroke patients. The\nresults show that, by achieving 76.20% 4-class classification accuracy, FBCNet\nsets a new SOTA for BCIC-IV-2a dataset. On the other three datasets, FBCNet\nyields up to 8% higher binary classification accuracies. Additionally, using\nexplainable AI techniques we present one of the first reports about the\ndifferences in discriminative EEG features between healthy subjects and stroke\npatients.

In its present form,\nhowever, it has shortcomings that limit its practical applicability and\nutility. First, IDM delay predictions are conceptually based on discretizing\nthe analog signal waveforms using specific matching input and output\ndiscretization threshold voltages. Unfortunately, they are difficult to\ndetermine and typically different for interconnected gates. Second,\nmetastability and high-frequency oscillations in a real circuit could be\ninvisible in the IDM signal predictions. Our CIDM reduces the characterization\neffort by allowing independent discretization thresholds, improves\ncomposability and increases the modeling power by exposing canceled pulse\ntrains at the gate interconnect. We formally show that, despite these\nimprovements, the CIDM still retains the IDM's faithfulness, which is a\nconsequence of the mathematical properties of involution delay functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 10:02:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Maier", "J\u00fcrgen", ""], ["\u00d6hlinger", "Daniel", ""], ["Schmid", "Ulrich", ""], ["F\u00fcgger", "Matthias", ""], ["Nowak", "Thomas", ""]]}]
