The breakdown induced by load mismatch can be avoided by\nattenuating the RF power to the final stage during over voltage conditions.\nPower control is realized by means of \"open loop\" techniques to regulate the\npower supply voltage, and a novel controllable bias network with temperature\ncompensated is proposed, which allows a moderate power control slope (dB/V) to\nbe achieved. Post-layout Simulation results show that the level of output power\ncan be controlled in 2dBm steps; especially the output power in every step is\nquite insensitive to temperature variations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Aug 2011 02:56:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Lin", "Wei", ""], ["Huang", "Shizhen", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0214", "submitter": "Carlos Gershenson", "authors": "Carlos Gershenson", "title": "Complexity", "comments": "Draft entry for the Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Social Sciences,\n  Sage, 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "C3 2011.05", "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The term complexity derives etymologically from the Latin plexus, which means\ninterwoven.

On\nthe other hand, Knowledge Management (KM) will enhance the organisations\nperformance by providing collaborative tools to learn, create and share the\nknowledge among the employees. The main intention of the BI is to enhance the\nemployees' knowledge with information that allows them to make decisions to\nachieve its organisational strategies. However only twenty percent of data\nexist in structured form, majority of banks knowledge is in unstructured or\nminds of its employees. Organizations are needed to integrate KM with Knowledge\nwhich is discovered from data and information. The purpose of this paper is to\ndiscuss the need of business insiders in the process of knowledge discovery and\ndistribution, to make BI more relevant to business of the bank.

Sourcing and outsourcing are\npositioned as different areas of activity, neither one of which is subsumed\nunder the other one. It is argued that competences relevant for outsourcing are\nmainly community based rather than evidence based. Subjective ability and\nobjective ability are distinguished as categories, together making up ability,\nwhich are distinct but not necessarily disjoint from competence. Conjectural\nability is introduced as a form of subjective ability. A person's competence\nprofile includes competences as well as abilities, including subjective ones.\nCompetence assessment and acquisition as well as the impact of assessed\ncompetence on practical work is described. The analysis of competence and\nability thus developed is used as standpoint from which to extract a\nspecification of an audience for a theory of outsourcing, yet to be written.\nMoreover, it allows to formulate requirements for and in preparation of the\ndevelopment of an outsourcing theory. Formulating these requirements is done\nunder the assumption that a person's awareness of a theory of outsourcing is\nexpected to strengthen that person's outsourcing competence profile.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 14:18:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "J.
