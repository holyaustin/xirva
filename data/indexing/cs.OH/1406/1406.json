Unfortunately, it was\nrecently proved [F\\\"ugger et al., ASYNC'13] that no existing binary-valued\ncircuit model proposed so far, including the two most commonly used pure and\ninertial delay channels, faithfully captures glitch propagation: For the simple\nShort-Pulse Filtration (SPF) problem, which is related to a circuit's ability\nto suppress a single glitch, we showed that the quite broad class of bounded\nsingle-history channels either contradict the unsolvability of SPF in bounded\ntime or the solvability of SPF in unbounded time in physical circuits.\n  In this paper, we propose a class of binary circuit models that do not suffer\nfrom this deficiency: Like bounded single-history channels, our involution\nchannels involve delays that may depend on the time of the previous output\ntransition. Their characteristic property are delay functions which are based\non involutions, i.e., functions that form their own inverse. A concrete example\nof such a delay function, which is derived from a generalized first-order\nanalog circuit model, reveals that this is not an unrealistic assumption. We\nprove that, in sharp contrast to what is possible with bounded single-history\nchannels, SPF cannot be solved in bounded time due to the nonexistence of a\nlower bound on the delay of involution channels, whereas it is easy to provide\nan unbounded SPF implementation. It hence follows that binary-valued circuit\nmodels based on involution channels allow to solve SPF precisely when this is\npossible in physical circuits. To the best of our knowledge, our model is hence\nthe very first candidate for a model that indeed guarantees faithful glitch\npropagation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 13:37:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["F\u00fcgger", "Matthias", ""], ["Najvirt", "Robert", ""], ["Nowak", "Thomas", ""], ["Schmid", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.3172", "submitter": "Sunil Kumar Kopparapu Dr", "authors": "Sunil Kopparapu and M Satish", "title": "Optimal Gaussian Filter for Effective Noise Filtering", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we show that the knowledge of noise statistics contaminating a\nsignal can be effectively used to choose an optimal Gaussian filter to\neliminate noise.
