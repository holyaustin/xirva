In businesses, interlocking spreadsheets are regularly used to\nfill functional gaps in core administrative systems. The growth and deployment\nof such integrated spreadsheet SYSTEMS raises the scale of issues to a whole\nnew level. The correct management of spreadsheet systems is necessary to ensure\nthat the business achieves its goals of improved performance and good corporate\ngovernance, within the constraints of legislative compliance - poor management\nwill deliver the opposite. This paper is an anatomy of the real-life issues of\nthe commercial use of spreadsheets in business, and demonstrates how\nQtier-Rapor has been used to instil best practice in the use of integrated\ncommercial spreadsheet systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 21:39:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bishop", "Keith", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0034", "submitter": "Leonid Andreev V", "authors": "Leonid Andreev", "title": "From a set of parts to an indivisible whole.

Contrary to common\nlogic, the iterative averaging of a system's elements does not result in\nhomogenization of the system; instead, it causes an obligatory subdivision of\nthe system into two alternative subgroups, leaving no outliers. Within each of\nthe formed subgroups, similarity coefficients between the elements reach the\nvalue of 1, whereas similarity coefficients between the elements of different\nsubgroups equal a certain constant value greater than 0 but lower than 1. When\nsubjected to iterative averaging, any system consisting of three or more\nelements of which at least two elements are not completely identical undergo\nsuch a process of bifurcation that occurs non-linearly. Successive iterative\naveraging of each of the forming subgroups eventually provides a hierarchical\nsystem that reflects relationships between the elements of an input system\nunder analysis. We propose a definition of a natural hierarchy that can exist\nonly in conditions of closeness of a system and can be discovered upon\nproviding such an effect onto a system which allows its elements interact with\neach other based on the principle of self-organization. Self-organization can\nbe achieved through an overall and total cross-averaging of a system's\nelements. We demonstrate the application potentials of the proposed technology\non a number of examples, including a system of scattered points, randomized\ndatasets, as well as meteorological and demographical datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Mar 2008 01:58:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 04:43:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Andreev", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0529", "submitter": "Michel Martinez", "authors": "M.
