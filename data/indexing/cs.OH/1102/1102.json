A system of partial differential equations describing\nheat and moisture transfer during drying copra in the solar greenhouse dryer\nwas developed and this system of non-linear partial differential equations was\nsolved numerically using the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical\nsolution was programmed in Compaq Visual FORTRAN version 6.5. The simulated\nresults reasonably agreed with the experimental data for solar drying copra.\nThis model can be used to provide the design data and is also essential for\noptimal design of the dryer.
