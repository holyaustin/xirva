Tests are\nphenomena and classify phenomena. A phenomenon occupies both time and space,\nfacts and inferences having physical counterparts which are phenomena of\nspecified classes. Identifiers such as f are conventional, assigned by humans;\na fact (f', f'') reports the success of a test of generic class f', the outcome\nf'' of the reported application classifying the successful test in more detail.\nFacts then exist only within structures of a form dictated by constraints on\nthe structural design of tests.

The finite-size\nparameters make a quantitative distinction between the in-directed and\nout-directed networks. For the out-degree distribution, the initial condition\nfor a dynamic evolution corresponds to the limiting count of the most heavily\nliked nodes that the out-directed network can finally have. The number of nodes\ncontributing out-directed links grows with every generation of software\nrelease, but this growth ultimately saturates towards a terminal value due to\nthe finiteness of semantic possibilities in the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jan 2009 15:17:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2009 20:03:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2010 05:08:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 13 Apr 2014 06:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "Rajiv", ""], ["Nagarjuna", "G.", ""], ["Ray", "Arnab K.", ""]]}]
