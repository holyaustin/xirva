In spite of considerable attention, these\nmaps are imperfect in many ways: they create an abundance of spurious\nconnections, have poor coverage, and are visually confusing. Hence, commercial\nand crowd-sourced mapping services heavily use human annotation to minimize the\nmapping errors. Consequently, their response to changes in the road network is\ninevitably slow. In this paper we describe \\mapfuse, a system which fuses a\nhuman-annotated map (e.g., OpenStreetMap) with any automatically inferred map,\nthus effectively enabling quick map updates. In addition to new road creation,\nwe study in depth road closure, which have not been examined in the past. By\nleveraging solid, human-annotated maps with minor corrections, we derive maps\nwhich minimize the trajectory matching errors due to both road network change\nand imperfect map inference of fully-automatic approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Feb 2018 08:41:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Stanojevic", "Rade", ""], ["Abbar", "Sofiane", ""], ["Thirumuruganathan", "Saravanan", ""], ["Morales", "Gianmarco De Francisci", ""], ["Chawla", "Sanjay", ""], ["Filali", "Fethi", ""], ["Aleimat", "Ahid", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.03500", "submitter": "Yunyou Huang", "authors": "Yunyou Huang, Jianfeng Zhan, Chunjie Luo, Lei Wang, Nana Wang, Daoyi\n  Zheng, Fanda Fan and Rui Ren", "title": "A veracity preserving model for synthesizing scalable electricity load\n  profiles", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electricity users are the major players of the electric systems, and\nelectricity consumption is growing at an extraordinary rate. The research on\nelectricity consumption behaviors is becoming increasingly important to design\nand deployment of the electric systems. Unfortunately, electricity load\nprofiles are difficult to acquire. Data synthesis is one of the best approaches\nto solving the lack of data, and the key is the model that preserves the real\nelectricity consumption behaviors. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical\nmulti-matrices Markov Chain (HMMC) model to synthesize scalable electricity\nload profiles that preserve the real consumption behavior on three time scales:\nper day, per week, and per year. To promote the research on the electricity\nconsumption behavior, we use the HMMC approach to model two distinctive raw\nelectricity load profiles. One is collected from the resident sector, and the\nother is collected from the non-resident sectors, including different\nindustries such as education, finance, and manufacturing. The experiments show\nour model performs much better than the classical Markov Chain model. We\npublish two trained models online, and researchers can directly use these\ntrained models to synthesize scalable electricity load profiles for further\nresearches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Feb 2018 01:56:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Yunyou", ""], ["Zhan", "Jianfeng", ""], ["Luo", "Chunjie", ""], ["Wang", "Lei", ""], ["Wang", "Nana", ""], ["Zheng", "Daoyi", ""], ["Fan", "Fanda", ""], ["Ren", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.07885", "submitter": "Wolf-Peter Schill", "authors": "Alexander Zerrahn, Wolf-Peter Schill, Claudia Kemfert", "title": "On the economics of electrical storage for variable renewable energy\n  sources", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "European Economic Review 2018", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.07.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of renewable energy sources is a major strategy to mitigate climate\nchange.
