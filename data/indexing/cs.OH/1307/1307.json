However, the evolution of portable\nsystems and advanced Deep Sub-Micron fabrication technologies have brought\npower dissipation as another critical design factor. Low power design reduces\ncooling cost and increases reliability especially for high density systems.\nMoreover, it reduces the weight and size of portable devices. The power\ndissipation in CMOS circuits consists of static and dynamic components. Since\ndynamic power is proportional to V2 dd and static power is proportional to Vdd,\nlowering the supply voltage and device dimensions, the transistor threshold\nvoltage also has to be scaled down to achieve the required performance. In case\nof static power, the power is consumed during the steady state condition i.e\nwhen there are no input/output transitions. Static power has two sources: DC\npower and Leakage power. Consecutively to facilitate voltage scaling without\ndisturbing the performance, threshold voltage has to be minimized. Furthermore\nit leads to better noise margins and helps to avoid the hot carrier effects in\nshort channel devices. In this paper we have been proposed the new CMOS library\nfor the complex digital design using scaling the supply voltage and device\ndimensions and also suggest the methods to control the leakage current to\nobtain the minimum power dissipation at optimum value of supply voltage and\ntransistor threshold.
