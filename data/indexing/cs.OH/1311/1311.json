Our models are especially useful for the\ntheoretical investigation and the simulation of energetically self-sufficient\ncommunication systems including these devices. The Markov models that we derive\nin this paper are obtained from extensive solar radiation databases, that are\nwidely available online. Basically, from hourly radiance patterns, we derive\nthe corresponding amount of energy (current and voltage) that is accumulated\nover time, and we finally use it to represent the scavenged energy in terms of\nits relevant statistics. Toward this end, two clustering approaches for the raw\nradiance data are described and the resulting Markov models are compared\nagainst the empirical distributions. Our results indicate that Markov models\nwith just two states provide a rough characterization of the real data traces.\nWhile these could be sufficiently accurate for certain applications, slightly\nincreasing the number of states to, e.g., eight, allows the representation of\nthe real energy inflow process with an excellent level of accuracy in terms of\nfirst and second order statistics.

The aim of this work is that of designing a full-fledged\nsystem that extends existing state of the art algorithms for the distributed\nminimization of power losses. We take into account practical aspects such as\nthe design of a communication and coordination protocol that is resilient to\nlink failures and manages channel access, message delivery and DG coordination.\nThus, we analyze the performance of the resulting optimization and\ncommunication scheme in terms of power loss reduction, reduction of aggregate\npower demand, convergence rate and resilience to communication link failures.\nAfter that, we discuss the results of a thorough simulation campaign, obtained\nusing topologies generated through a statistical approach that has been\nvalidated in previous research, by also assessing the performance deviation\nwith respect to localized schemes, where the DGs are operated independently.\nOur results reveal that the convergence and stability performance of the\nselected algorithms vary greatly. However, configurations exist for which\nconvergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just\n30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved. Also,\nsome of the considered approaches are quite robust against link failures as\nthey still provide gains with respect to the localized solutions for failure\nrates as high as 50%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2013 12:16:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bonetto", "Riccardo", ""], ["Tomasin", "Stefano", ""], ["Rossi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.6981", "submitter": "Gaurav Ojha", "authors": "Anupam Shukla, Gaurav Ojha, Sachin Acharya, Shubham Jain", "title": "A customized flocking algorithm for swarms of sensors tracking a swarm\n  of targets", "comments": "13 Pages, 11 Figures, SAI 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless mobile sensor networks (WMSNs) are groups of mobile sensing agents\nwith multi-modal sensing capabilities that communicate over wireless networks.\nWMSNs have more flexibility in terms of deployment and exploration abilities\nover static sensor networks.
