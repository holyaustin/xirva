In this paper, we develop an\nintelligent accident detection, location tracking and notification system that\ndetects an accident immediately when it takes place.

Global System for Mobile\n(GSM) module sends a notification message including the link of location in the\ngoogle map to the nearest police control room and hospital so that they can\nvisit the link, find out the shortest route of the accident spot and take\ninitiatives to speed up the rescue process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 14:15:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sarker", "Supriya", ""], ["Rahman", "Md.

At the same time, cybernetics\nalso got the attention of philosophers, such as the Frenchman Gilbert Simondon,\nwho made use of cybernetical concepts in order to establish a metaphysics and a\nnatural philosophy of individuation, giving cybernetics thereby a philosophical\ninterpretation, which he baptised allagmatic. In this paper, we emphasise this\nallagmatic theory by showing how Simondon's philosophical concepts can be used\nto formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems\nmodelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic\nprogramming. We also present how the developed allagmatic metamodel is capable\nof building simple cellular automata and artificial neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2019 21:02:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 May 2020 20:59:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 21:41:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Christen", "Patrik", ""], ["Del Fabbro", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.04227", "submitter": "Michael Laskin", "authors": "Chris Heinrich, Michael Laskin, Simas Glinskis, Evert van Nieuwenburg", "title": "Roof Age Determination for the Automated Site-Selection of Rooftop Solar", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Rooftop solar is one of the most promising tools for drawing down greenhouse\ngas (GHG) emissions and is cost-competitive with fossil fuels in many areas of\nthe world today. One of the most important criteria for determining the\nsuitability of a building for rooftop solar is the current age of its roof. The\nreason for this is simple -- because rooftop solar installations are\nlong-lived, the roof needs to be new enough to last for the lifetime of the\nsolar array or old enough to justify being replaced. In this paper we present a\ndata-driven method for determining the age of a roof from historical satellite\nimagery, which removes one of the last obstacles to a fully automated pipeline\nfor rooftop solar site selection.

G\\\"odel's numbering technique is universal for enumerable\nstructures and shows strong limits of the language technology. Computability\ntheory is a particular example: programs can be numbered and all sorts of\nlimits can be studied from there. Computability is also at the heart of science\nsince any experimental validation of a theory supposes that theoretical results\nhave been computed, then checked against concrete experiments. It implies that\nlimitations on what is computable ultimately are also limits of what we\nunderstand as \"scientific theory\", and more generally to all the transmissible\nknowledge.
