No work has been found to develop courseware applying generalized\nclustered content. We have proposed a clustering of content supporting computer\nmediated courseware development based on data mining techniques to construct a\nhierarchical general structure of a group of courseware combining the\nindividual structure of a set of books. The clustering will help the courseware\ndeveloper to dynamically allocate contents to develop different courses using a\ngroup of books. The authors have applied this methodology for different level\nof courses on database. The methodology is generalized and can be applied to\nany other courses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 18:27:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bashir", "G.

We have presented a comparison for improving the\nperformance of SCM-WDM system in presence of OBI. Non-return-to zero (NRZ),\nManchester and Miller code (MC) line coding are used for performance\ninvestigation of SCM-WDM system. A suitable signal bandwidth is selected and\n200 KHz is considered as channel bandwidth. Power spectrum of signal and cross\ncomponent for those line coding are analyzed. Comparison results are evaluated\nin terms of signal to OBI ratio for the three linecoding schemes which is\ncalled signal to interference ratio (SIR). It is found that there is a\nsignificant increase in the SIR by employing Miller code compared to NRZ and\nManchester for the same data rate. For example, for a number of subcarriers of\n10, the achievable SIR is about -24 dB for Miller coded system compared to -46\ndB for NRZ coded system and -49 dB for Manchester coded system. The results are\nfound to be satisfactorily agreed with the expected results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 19:05:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Reza", "Md.
