Numerous variants of QTC have been proposed in\nthe past and QTC has been applied towards analyzing various interaction\ndomains.

Apart from the theoretical exposition, including definition\nand properties, as well as computational aspects, we also present an\napplication of QTC3D towards modeling bird flight.
