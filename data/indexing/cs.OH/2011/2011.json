Heating, Ventilation, and Air\nConditioning (HVAC) system account for the majority of the energy consumption\nin the built environment, and among which, the chiller plant constitutes the\ntop portion. The optimization of chiller system power consumption had been\nextensively studied in the mechanical engineering and building service domains.\nMany works employ physical models from the domain knowledge. With the advance\nof big data and AI, the adoption of machine learning into the optimization\nproblems becomes popular. Although many research works and projects turn to\nthis direction for energy saving, the application into the optimization problem\nremains a challenging task. This work is targeted to outline a framework for\nsuch problems on how the energy saving should be benchmarked, if holistic or\nindividually modeling should be used, how the optimization is to be conducted,\nwhy data pattern augmentation at the initial deployment is a must, why the\ngradually increasing changes strategy must be used. Results of analysis on\nhistorical data and empirical experiment on live data are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2020 09:51:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Yong", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.03425", "submitter": "Evangelos Mitsakis", "authors": "Evangelos Mitsakis, Areti Kotsi, Vasileios Psonis", "title": "C-ITS bundling for integrated traffic management", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) enable vehicles\ncommunication with each other (Vehicle-to-Vehicle, V2V) and with roadside\ninfrastructure (Vehicle-to-Infrastructure, V2I). In the context of traffic\nefficiency, C-ITS technologies could assist in road network status\nvisualization and monitoring, through data exchange, improving this way traffic\ncontrol organization and traffic management implementation. Bundling is the\nprovision of several C-ITS services as one combined service. The purpose of\nbundling is to harvest the usability of C-ITS services by developing a strategy\nfor the operation and exploitation of services in real-time and within varying\ngeographical areas. Two different dimensions of bundling have been recognized\ncovering: 1) end-users, and 2) operators-managers. The objective of the\noperators-managers dimension is the integration of C-ITS services in\noperational traffic management. This work spotlights the operators-managers\nbundling dimension, presenting a framework based on a step-by-step approach for\nintegrating C-ITS services in traditional traffic management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 17:11:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mitsakis", "Evangelos", ""], ["Kotsi", "Areti", ""], ["Psonis", "Vasileios", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.14914", "submitter": "Carlos Batista Mr.", "authors": "Carlos Leandro Gomes Batista and Tania Basso and F\\'atima\n  Mattiello-Francisco and Regina Moraes", "title": "Impacts of the Space Technology Evolution in the V\\&V of Embedded\n  Software-Intensive Systems", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures 2020 International Conference on Computational\n  Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.SE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  CubeSat-based nanosatellites are composed of COTS components and rely on its\nstructure and standardized interfaces.
