The EDCA uses Carrier Sense Multiple\nAccess with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and slotted Binary Exponential\nBackoff (BEB) mechanism. We present a simple mathematical analysis framework\nfor the EDCA function. Our analysis considers the fact that the distributed\nrandom access systems exhibit cyclic behavior where each station successfully\ntransmits a packet in a cycle. Our analysis shows that an AC-specific cycle\ntime exists for the EDCA function. Validating the theoretical results via\nsimulations, we show that the proposed analysis accurately captures EDCA\nsaturation performance in terms of average throughput, medium access delay, and\npacket loss ratio. The cycle time analysis is a simple and insightful\nsubstitute for previously proposed more complex EDCA models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2007 23:01:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Inan", "Inanc", ""], ["Keceli", "Feyza", ""], ["Ayanoglu", "Ender", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1842", "submitter": "Inanc Inan", "authors": "Feyza Keceli, Inanc Inan, Ender Ayanoglu", "title": "Fairness Provision in the IEEE 802.11e Infrastructure Basic Service Set", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Most of the deployed IEEE 802.11e Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) use\ninfrastructure Basic Service Set (BSS) in which an Access Point (AP) serves as\na gateway between wired and wireless domains.

Sending a so-called soliton over an\nopen channel between ports (external nodes) of the graph changes the Kekul\\'e\nstate and therewith the set of open channels in the graph. This switching\nbehaviour is proposed as a basis for molecular computation. The proposal is\nhighly speculative but may have tremendous impact.\n  Kekul\\'e states with the same boundary behaviour (port assignment) can be\nregarded as equivalent. This gives rise to the abstraction of Kekul\\'e cells.\nThe basic theory of Kekul\\'e states and Kekul\\'e cells is developed here, up to\nthe classification of Kekul\\'e cells with $\\leq 4$ ports. To put the theory in\ncontext, we generalize Kekul\\'e states to semi-Kekul\\'e states, which form the\nsolutions of a linear system of equations over the field of the bits 0 and 1.\nWe briefly study so-called omniconjugated graphs, in which every port\nassignment of the right signature has a Kekul\\'e state. Omniconjugated graphs\nmay be useful as connectors between computational elements. We finally\ninvestigate some examples with potentially useful switching behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2007 07:44:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2007 09:16:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hesselink", "W.
