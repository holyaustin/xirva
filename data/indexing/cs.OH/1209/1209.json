In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS)\nand Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the\nrequirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the\nrapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making.\nWhereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has\nbeen used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation\nof knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and\ndisseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control,\nanalysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the\nunderstanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage\nglobal corporations and provide customers with products and services of value.\nIn this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an\necosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the\ncustomer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its\ndistribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or\nsometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part\nof day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business\nneeds, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources,\nwhich makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the\nSociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the\nmodel proposed regarding an ecosystem. Finally, whereas the summary above, the\nmain objective of this opinion paper is to propose the guidelines for a\nSociotechnical Management Model of Governance for an Ecosystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Sep 2012 16:08:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Balloni", "Antonio J.", ""], ["de Azevedo", "Adalberto Mantovani Martiniano", ""], ["Silveira", "Marco Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.3794", "submitter": "Moustafa Alzantot", "authors": "Moustafa Alzantot, Moustafa Youssef", "title": "CrowdInside: Automatic Construction of Indoor Floorplans", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "20th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in\n  Geographic Information Systems (ACM SIGSPATIAL GIS 2012)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The existence of a worldwide indoor floorplans database can lead to\nsignificant growth in location-based applications, especially for indoor\nenvironments. In this paper, we present CrowdInside: a crowdsourcing-based\nsystem for the automatic construction of buildings floorplans. CrowdInside\nleverages the smart phones sensors that are ubiquitously available with humans\nwho use a building to automatically and transparently construct accurate motion\ntraces. These accurate traces are generated based on a novel technique for\nreducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of\ninterest in the indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for error\nresetting. The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall\nfloorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and\ncorridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment.\nImplementation of the system in two testbeds, using different Android phones,\nshows that CrowdInside can detect the points of interest accurately with 0.2%\nfalse positive rate and 1.3% false negative rate. In addition, the proposed\nerror resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median\ndistance error compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed\nfloorplan can be accurately estimated with a a relatively small number of\ntraces. This number is amortized over the number of users of the building. We\nalso discuss possible extensions to CrowdInside for inferring even higher level\nsemantics about the discovered floorplans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2012 20:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alzantot", "Moustafa", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4015", "submitter": "Roja Reddy B", "authors": "B.

To control the system remotely, GPRS connectivity is added. We\ncan also monitor our home from remote area by using Remote Video Surveillance\nSystem.

For reading unit we identified the disk rotation of the energy meter\nand stored the data in microcontroller. So it is not required to change the\ncurrent analog energy meter. An external module will be added with the current\nenergy meter. In the communication unit Wimax transceiver was used for wireless\ncommunication between meter end and the server end because of its wide coverage\narea. In the data receiving and processing unit meter reading will be collected\nfrom the transceiver which is controlled by another microcontroller. There will\nbe a computer application that will take the data from the microcontroller.\nThis will also help to avoid any tampering or break down of energy meter.
