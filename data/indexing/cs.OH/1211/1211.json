Two recent\ntrends in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources\n(such as wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both\nelectricity and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented\nchallenges to the design of intelligent control strategies for microgrids.\nTraditional generation scheduling paradigms rely on perfect prediction of\nfuture electricity supply and demand. They are no longer applicable to\nmicrogrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation\n(that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we\nstudy online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with\nintermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of\nmaximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from\nthe structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of\ncompetitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm\nfor Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online\nfashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best\ncompetitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is\nno larger than a small constant 3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 15:59:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 06:17:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Lian", ""], ["Tu", "Jinlong", ""], ["Chau", "Chi-Kin", ""], ["Chen", "Minghua", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaojun", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.4547", "submitter": "Gordana Dodig Crnkovic", "authors": "Mark Burgin and Gordana Dodig-Crnkovic", "title": "From the Closed Classical Algorithmic Universe to an Open World of\n  Algorithmic Constellations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we analyze methodological and philosophical implications of\nalgorithmic aspects of unconventional computation.
