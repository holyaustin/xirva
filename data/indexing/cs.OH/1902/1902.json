However, the\ndata capacity properties of modern QR codes are still not perfect. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to make double-sided QR\ncodes, which could carry two different messages in a straight and mirrored\nposition. To facilitate the process of creation of such codes we propose two\nmethods of their construction: the brute-force method and the analytic\nsolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2019 08:34:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Tikhonov", "Alexey", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.05982", "submitter": "Binbin Liu", "authors": "Binbin Liu, Qilong Zheng", "title": "Realize special instructions on clustering VLIW DSP:\n  multiplication-accumulation instruction", "comments": "7 pages, in Chinese, 4 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  BWDSP is a 32bit static scalar digital signal processor with VLIW and SIMD\nfeatures, which is designed for high-performance computing.
