During airlines daily operations,\nassigning the available gates to the arriving aircrafts based on the fixed\nschedule is a very important issue, which motivates researchers to study and\nsolve Airport Gate Assignment Problems (AGAP) with all kinds of\nstate-of-the-art combinatorial optimization techniques. In this paper, we study\nthe AGAP and propose a novel hybrid mathematical model based on the method of\nconstraint programming and 0 - 1 mixed-integer programming. With the objective\nto minimize the number of gate conflicts of any two adjacent aircrafts assigned\nto the same gate, we build a mathematical model with logical constraints and\nthe binary constraints. For practical considerations, the potential objective\nof the model is also to minimize the number of gates that airlines must lease\nor purchase in order to run their business smoothly. We implement the model in\nthe Optimization Programming Language (OPL) and carry out empirical studies\nwith the data obtained from online timetable of Continental Airlines, Houston\nGorge Bush Intercontinental Airport IAH, which demonstrate that our model can\nprovide an efficient evaluation criteria for the airline companies to estimate\nthe efficiency of their current gate assignments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2009 05:23:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chendong", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.2598", "submitter": "Susan Khor", "authors": "Susan Khor", "title": "Generating Hierarchically Modular Networks via Link Switching", "comments": "Appendix B", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a method to generate hierarchically modular networks\nwith prescribed node degree list by link switching. Unlike many existing\nnetwork generating models, our method does not use link probabilities to\nachieve modularity. Instead, it utilizes a user-specified topology to determine\nrelatedness between pairs of nodes in terms of edge distances and links are\nswitched to increase edge distances. To measure the modular-ness of a network\nas a whole, a new metric called Q2 is proposed. Comparisons are made between\nthe Q [15] and Q2 measures. We also comment on the effect of our modularization\nmethod on other network characteristics such as clustering, hierarchy, average\npath length, small-worldness, degree correlation and centrality.
