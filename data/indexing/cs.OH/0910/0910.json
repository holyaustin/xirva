Coordinated symbol transmission between base stations (BS) is\noperated where the same symbol is transmitted from different BS on different\nsub-carriers. At the mobile station (MS) receiver, we introduce a soft decision\nmaximum likelihood CCI canceler and a modified maximum ratio combining (M-MRC)\nto obtain an estimate of the transmitted symbols. Weights used in the combining\nmethod are derived from the channels coefficients between the cooperated BS and\nthe MS. Simulations show that the proposed scheme works well under\nfrequency-selective channels and frequency non-selective channels. A gain of 9\ndB and 6 dB in SIR is obtained under multipath fading and flat-fading channels,\nrespectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 11:38:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mohaisen", "Manar", ""], ["Chang", "KyungHi", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0735", "submitter": "Erika De Francesco", "authors": "Erika De Francesco, Salvatore Iiritano, Antonino Spagnolo, Marco\n  Iannelli", "title": "A methodology for semi-automatic classification schema building", "comments": "36 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describe a methodology for semi-automatic classification schema\ndefinition (a classification schema is a taxonomy of categories useful for\nautomatic document classification).

However, it reveals\nproviding a valuable tool to train orthopaedic surgeons and help them to plan\ncomplex surgical procedures. PURPOSE: This work's objective was to assess\neducational efficiency of a path simulator under fluoroscopic guidance applied\nto sacroiliac joint percutaneous screw fixation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We\nevaluated 23 surgeons' accuracy inserting a guide-wire in a human cadaver\nexperiment, following a pre-established procedure. These medical trainees were\ndefined in three prospective respects: novice or skilled; with or without\ntheoretical knowledge; with or without surgical procedure familiarity. Analysed\ncriteria for each tested surgeon included the number of intraoperative X-rays\ntaken in order to achieve the surgical procedure as well as an iatrogenic index\nreflecting the surgeon's ability to detect any hazardous trajectory at the time\nof performing said procedure. RESULTS: An average number of 13 X-rays was\nrequired for wire implantation by the G1 group. G2 group, assisted by the\nsimulator use, required an average of 10 X-rays. A substantial difference was\nespecially observed within the novice sub-group (N), with an average of 12.75\nX-rays for the G1 category and an average of 8.5 X-rays for the G2 category. As\nfar as the iatrogenic index is concerned, we were unable to observe any\nsignificant difference between the groups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Oct 2009 12:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Tonetti", "J.", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Vadcard", "L.", "", "LSE"], ["Girard", "P.", "", "IHPC"], ["Dubois", "M.", "", "LPS"], ["Merloz", "P.", "", "CHU-Grenoble ortho-traumato"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"]]}, {"id": "0910.2859", "submitter": "Apostolos Syropoulos", "authors": "Apostolos Syropoulos", "title": "Can we debug the Universe?", "comments": "An early version of this paper was read in the \"Future Trends in\n  Hypercomputation\" Workshop held in Sheffield U.K., 11-13 September 2006", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Roughly, the Church-Turing thesis is a hypothesis that describes exactly what\ncan be computed by any real or feasible conceptual computing device.
