To evenly distribute the\ntraffic flow, an advanced driver information system should be aware of the\ntraffic control operations. However, such requirement can not ultimately be\nsatisfied due to the gaps in state of the art in advanced traffic management\nsystems. Therefore, this study proposes a distributed traffic control system,\nin which agents embedded in connected vehicles, traffic signals, urban elements\nand a traffic control center interact with each other to provide a greater\ntraffic fluidity. Therefore, the agents depend strongly on a heterogeneous\nvehicular network. In this sense, this study also proposes a heterogeneous\nvehicular network whose communication protocol can satisfy the communication\nrequirements of intelligent transportation systems service applications.\nAccording to the results obtained from simulations, the distributed traffic\ncontrol system was able to maximize the flow of vehicles and the mean speed of\nthe vehicles, and minimize the wait time, travel time, fuel consume and\nemissions (CO, CO$_2$, HC, NOx and PMx).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 17:30:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gon\u00e7alves", "Fabr\u00edcio Barros", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.03518", "submitter": "Erivelton Geraldo Nepomuceno", "authors": "Diego A.

Following the increasing trend in\nelectricity generation from renewable sources, pushed by the need to meet\nsustainable energy goals in many countries, more sophisticated control\nstrategies are being adopted to regulate the operation of the electric power\nsystem, driving electrical infrastructures towards the so called Smart Grid\nscenario. It is therefore paramount to be assisted by technologies able to\nanalyze the Smart Grid behavior in critical scenarios, e.g. where cyber\nmalfunctions or grid disruptions occur.

In DDDAS computations and measurements form a dynamic closed\nfeedback loop in which they tune one another in response to changes in the\nenvironment. Our proposed system enables dynamic augmentation of a base\nelectrical mesh topology with an optical express bus during the run-time. In\naddition, the measurement process itself adjusts to the environment. In order\nto achieve lower latencies, lower dynamic power, and higher throughput, we take\nadvantage of a Configurable Hybrid Photonic Plasmonic Interconnect (CHyPPI) for\nour reconfigurable connections. We evaluate the performance and power of our\nsystem against kernels from NAS Parallel Benchmark (NPB) in addition to some\nsynthetically generated traffic. In comparison to a 16x16 base electrical mesh,\nD3NOC shows up to 89% latency and 67% dynamic power net improvements beyond\noverhead-corrected performance. It should be noted that the design-space of NoC\nreconfiguration is vast and the goal of this study is not design-space\nexploration.
