Six different geometrical parameters, channel doping, source/drain\ndoping and gate electrode work function are studied for their sensitivity on\nft. It is found that ft is more sensitive to gate length, underlap, gate-oxide\nthickness, channel and Source/Drain doping and less sensitive to source/drain\nwidth and length, and work function variations. Statistical modelling has been\nperformed for ft through design of experiment with respect to sensitive\nparameters. The model has been validated through a comparison between random\nset of experimental data simulations and predicted values obtained from the\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Oct 2010 04:02:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lakshmi", "B.", ""], ["Srinivasan", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1853", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "Vladimir Privman", "title": "Control of Noise in Chemical and Biochemical Information Processing", "comments": "39 pages, 8 figures, PDF", "journal-ref": "Israel J.

With the rapid increase in the capacity and size of\ndata centers, there is a continuous increase in the demand for energy\nconsumption. These data centers not only consume a tremendous amount of energy\nbut are riddled with IT inefficiencies. All data center are plagued with\nthousands of servers as major components. These servers consume huge energy\nwithout performing useful work. In an average server environment, 30% of the\nservers are \"dead\" only consuming energy, without being properly utilized.\nTheir utilization ratio is only 5 to 10 percent. This paper focuses on the use\nof an emerging technology called virtualization to achieve energy efficient\ndata centers by providing a solution called server consolidation. It increases\nthe utilization ratio up to 50% saving huge amount of energy. Server\nconsolidation helps in implementing green data centers to ensure that IT\ninfrastructure contributes as little as possible to the emission of green house\ngases, and helps to regain power and cooling capacity, recapture resilience and\ndramatically reducing energy costs and total cost of ownership.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Oct 2010 04:32:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Uddin", "Mueen", ""], ["Rahman", "Azizah Abdul", ""]]}]
