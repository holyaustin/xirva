For real-world control cabinets it\nis impractical to evaluate all possible cabinet configurations. Therefore, we\nneed to apply methods for intelligent exploration of cabinet configuration\nspace that enable to find a near-optimal configuration without evaluation of\nall possible configurations. In this paper, we describe an approach for\nmulti-objective optimization of control cabinet layout that is based on Pareto\nSimulated Annealing. Optimization aims at minimizing the total wire length used\nfor interconnection of components and the heat convection within the cabinet.\nWe simulate heat convection to study the warm air flow within the control\ncabinet and determine the optimal position of components that generate heat\nduring the operation. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach empirically for various control cabinet sizes and usage scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2019 10:05:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Pllana", "Sabri", ""], ["Memeti", "Suejb", ""], ["Kolodziej", "Joanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.06170", "submitter": "Tianmou Liu", "authors": "Lijun Wang, Jianbing Gong, Yingxia Zhang, Tianmou Liu, Junhui Gao", "title": "FPScreen: A Rapid Similarity Search Tool for Massive Molecular Library\n  Based on Molecular Fingerprint Comparison", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We designed a fast similarity search engine for large molecular libraries:\nFPScreen.
