Process mining has proven very successful with a\nvariety of methods and techniques, including discovering process models based\non event logs. Process mining has traditionally focussed on control flow and\ntiming aspects. However, getting insights about a process is not only based on\nactivities and their orderings, but also on the data generated and manipulated\nduring process executions. Today, almost every process activity generates data;\nthese data do not play the role in process mining that it deserves. This paper\nintroduces a visualization technique for enhancing discovered process models\nwith domain data, thereby allowing data-based exploration of processes.\nData-enhanced process models aim at supporting domain experts to explore the\nprocess, where they can select attributes of interest and observe their\ninfluence on the process. The visualization technique is illustrated by the\nMIMIC-IV real-world data set on hospitalizations in the US.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 08:47:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cremerius", "Jonas", ""], ["Weske", "Mathias", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.03282", "submitter": "Matteo B\\\"ohm", "authors": "Matteo B\\\"ohm, Mirco Nanni, Luca Pappalardo", "title": "Improving vehicles' emissions reduction policies by targeting gross\n  polluters", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vehicles' emissions produce a significant share of cities' air pollution,\nwith a substantial impact on the environment and human health.

Comparisons to digital (inertial delay) and analog\n(SPICE) simulations reveal, that the IDM delivers very fine-grained results,\nwhich match analog simulations very closely.
