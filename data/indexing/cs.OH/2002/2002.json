This paper investigates the transition from CS1 to CS2 in\nsearch of leading indicators of success in CS2. Both CS1 and CS2 at the\nUniversity of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) are taught in Python with annual\nenrollments of 300 and 150 respectively. In this paper, we report on the\nfollowing research questions: 1) Are CS1 grades indicators of CS2 grades? 2)\nDoes a quantitative relationship exist between CS2 course grade and a modified\nversion of the SCS1 concept inventory? 3) What are the most challenging aspects\nof CS2, and how well does CS1 prepare students for CS2 from the student's\nperspective? We provide a quantitative analysis of 2300 CS1 and CS2 course\ngrades from 2013--2019. In Spring 2019, we administered a modified version of\nthe SCS1 concept inventory to 44 students in the first week of CS2. Further, 69\nstudents completed an exit questionnaire at the conclusion of CS2 to gain\nqualitative student feedback on their challenges in CS2 and on how well CS1\nprepared them for CS2. We find that 56% of students' grades were lower in CS2\nthan CS1, 18% improved their grades, and 26% earned the same grade. Of the\nchanges, 62% were within one grade point. We find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between the modified SCS1 score and CS2 grade points. Students\nidentify linked lists and class/object concepts among the most challenging.\nStudent feedback on CS2 challenges and the adequacy of their CS1 preparations\nidentify possible avenues for improving the CS1-CS2 transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Feb 2020 01:49:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Layman", "Lucas", ""], ["Song", "Yang", ""], ["Guinn", "Curry", ""]]}]
