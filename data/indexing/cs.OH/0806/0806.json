Interactions between objects\nwere analyzed within the space of an isotropic field of one of the objects\n(drifter). Such an isotropic field of an individual object can be viewed as a\nprototype of computer ego. It allows visualization of a holistic space of\nmulti-object relations (HSMOR) which has a complex structure depending on the\nnumber of objects, their mutual arrangement in space, and the type of metric\nused for assessment of (dis)similarities between the objects. In the course of\ncomputer simulation of cooperative interactions between the objects, only those\npoints of the space were registered which corresponded to transitions in\nhierarchical grouping. Such points appeared to aggregate into complex spatial\nstructures determining a unique internal organization of a respective HSMOR. We\ndescribe some of the peculiarities of such structures, referred to by us as\nattractor membranes, and discuss their properties. We also demonstrate the\npeculiarities of the changing of intergroup similarities which occurs when a\ndrifter infinitely moves away from the fixed objects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Jun 2008 20:50:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Andreev", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1385", "submitter": "Feng Xia", "authors": "Feng Xia, Youxian Sun", "title": "Control-Scheduling Codesign: A Perspective on Integrating Control and\n  Computing", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures; A review paper", "journal-ref": "Dynamics of Continuous, Discrete and Impulsive Systems - Series B,\n  vol. 13, no.

To achieve much better system\nperformance in unpredictable environments than traditional design approaches, a\nnovel methodology, control-scheduling codesign, is emerging in the context of\nintegrating feedback control and real-time computing. The aim of this work is\nto provide a better understanding of this emerging methodology and to spark new\ninterests and developments in both the control and computer science\ncommunities. The state of the art of control-scheduling codesign is captured.\nRelevant research efforts in the literature are discussed under two categories,\ni.e., control of computing systems and codesign for control systems.

Methods:\nThe method is based on the registration of an anatomical atlas computed from a\npopulation of 18 MRI exams onto a patient image. An hybrid registration\nframework which couples an intensity-based registration with a robust\npoint-matching algorithm is used for both atlas building and atlas\nregistration. Results: The method has been validated on the same dataset that\nthe one used to construct the atlas using the \"leave-one-out method\". Results\ngives a mean error of 3.39 mm and a standard deviation of 1.95 mm with respect\nto expert segmentations. Conclusions: We think that this segmentation tool may\nbe a very valuable help to the clinician for routine quantitative image\nexploitation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2008 15:43:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "TIMC"], ["Daanen", "Vincent", "", "TIMC"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"]]}, {"id": "0806.4572", "submitter": "Vladimir Vyugin", "authors": "V.V.V'yugin", "title": "Problems of robustness for universal coding schemes", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": "Problems of Information Transmission, 39 (2003), pp. 32-46", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.OH math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Lempel-Ziv universal coding scheme is asymptotically optimal for the\nclass of all stationary ergodic sources.
