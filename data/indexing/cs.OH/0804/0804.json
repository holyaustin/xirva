An asynchronous system f is a multi-valued\nfunction that assigns to each admissible input u a set f(u) of possible states\nx in f(u). A special case of asynchronous system consists in the existence of a\nBoolean function \\Upsilon such that for any u and any x in f(u), a certain\nequation involving \\Upsilon is fulfilled. Then \\Upsilon is called the generator\nfunction of f (Moisil used the terminology of network function) and we say that\nf is generated by \\Upsilon. The systems that have a generator function are\ncalled regular.\n  Our purpose is to continue the study of the generation of the asynchronous\nsystems that was started in [2], [3].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Apr 2008 01:11:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Vlad", "Serban E.", ""]]}]
