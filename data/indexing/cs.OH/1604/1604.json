These\ntechniques constitute a good asset in bioinformatics if there exist efficient\nmethods for transforming biological data into graphs.

This repository contains graph\nrepresentations of all currently known protein 3D-structures described in the\nProtein Data Bank (PDB). PGR also provides an efficient online converter of\nprotein 3D-structures into graphs, biological and graph-based description,\npre-computed protein graph attributes and statistics, visualization of each\nprotein graph, as well as graph-based protein similarity search tool. Such\nrepository presents an enrichment of existing online databases that will help\nbridging the gap between graph mining and protein structure analysis.

The state of the art challenges include AC\nfeasibility and performance, computational complexity, the ability to handle\nlarge-scale real power systems, and dynamic stability. This two-part paper\ninvestigates these challenges by developing an AC TS-based real-time\ncontingency analysis (RTCA) tool that can handle large-scale systems within a\nreasonable time. The tool proposes multiple corrective switching actions, after\ndetection of a contingency with potential violations. To reduce the\ncomputational complexity, three heuristic algorithms are proposed to generate a\nsmall set of candidates for switching. Parallel computing is implemented to\nfurther speed up the solution time. Furthermore, stability analysis is\nperformed to check for dynamic stability of proposed TS solutions.

Despite its statistical promise as an alternative\nto the lasso, square-root lasso, and scaled lasso, the TREX is computationally\nchallenging in that it requires solving a non-convex optimization problem. This\npaper shows a remarkable result: despite the non-convexity of the TREX problem,\nthere exists a polynomial-time algorithm that is guaranteed to find the global\nminimum. This result adds the TREX to a very short list of non-convex\noptimization problems that can be globally optimized (principal components\nanalysis being a famous example). After deriving and developing this new\napproach, we demonstrate that (i) the ability of the preexisting TREX heuristic\nto reach the global minimum is strongly dependent on the difficulty of the\nunderlying statistical problem, (ii) the new polynomial-time algorithm for TREX\npermits a novel variable ranking and selection scheme, (iii) this scheme can be\nincorporated into a rule that controls the false discovery rate (FDR) of\nincluded features in the model. To achieve this last aim, we provide an\nextension of the results of Barber & Candes (2015) to establish that the\nknockoff filter framework can be applied to the TREX. This investigation thus\nprovides both a rare case study of a heuristic for non-convex optimization and\na novel way of exploiting non-convexity for statistical inference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 20:28:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 20:07:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bien", "Jacob", ""], ["Gaynanova", "Irina", ""], ["Lederer", "Johannes", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Christian", ""]]}]
