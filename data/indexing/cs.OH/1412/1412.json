Hence, casualties caused by the poor decisions\nand guidance are only apparent at the end of the evacuation process and cannot\nthen be remedied. Previous research shows that the performance of routing\nalgorithms for evacuation purposes are sensitive to the initial distribution of\nevacuees, the occupancy levels, the type of disaster and its as well its\nlocations. Thus an algorithm that performs well in one scenario may achieve bad\nresults in another scenario. This problem is especially serious in\nheuristic-based routing algorithms for evacuees where results are affected by\nthe choice of certain parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a\nsimulation-based evacuee routing algorithm that optimises evacuation by making\nuse of the high computational power of cloud servers. Rather than guiding\nevacuees with a predetermined routing algorithm, a robust Cognitive Packet\nNetwork based algorithm is first evaluated via a cloud-based simulator in a\nfaster-than-real-time manner, and any \"simulated casualties\" are then re-routed\nusing a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm to obtain new safe paths for them to\nexits. This approach can be iterated as long as corrective action is still\npossible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 17:08:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Jan 2015 15:41:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bi", "Huibo", ""], ["Gelenbe", "Erol", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8561", "submitter": "Nidhi Lal", "authors": "Nidhi Kumari Lal, Ashutosh Kumar Singh", "title": "Modified Design of Microstrip Patch Antenna for WiMAX Communication\n  System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.9781/ijimai.2014.315", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a new design for U-shaped microstrip patch antenna is\nproposed, which can be used in WiMAX communication systems.
