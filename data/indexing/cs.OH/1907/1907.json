Through\nthis progress in technology, autonomous vehicles, especially autonomous trains\nare getting more attention from industry and are already under test. The use of\nautonomous trains is known for increasing operation efficiency and reduction of\npersonnel and infrastructure costs, which is mostly considered for main tracks.\nHowever, for less-used secondary lines, autonomous trains and their underlying\nsensor infrastructure are not yet considered. Thus, a system needs to be\ndeveloped, which is less expensive for installation and operation of these\ntrains and underlying infrastructure for secondary lines. Therefore, this\nposition paper describes the process of how to derive an approach to help\ndevelop a digital interlocking system at design time for the use with secondary\nrailway lines. In this work, we motivate the necessary research by\ninvestigating gaps in existing work as well as presenting a possible solution\nfor this problem, a meta-model. The model considers safety, security as well as\ninteroperability like 5G and socio-technical aspects to provide a holistic\nmodeling approach for the development of the interlocking system for industrial\nsecondary line use cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 11:22:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hofbauer", "David", ""], ["Schmittner", "Christoph", ""], ["Brandstetter", "Manuela", ""], ["Tauber", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.01960", "submitter": "Pawan Kumar Singh", "authors": "Pawan Kumar Singh, Yadunath Gupta, Nilpa Jha, Aruna Rajan", "title": "Fashion Retail: Forecasting Demand for New Items", "comments": "KDD - AI4Fashion Workshop", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fashion merchandising is one of the most complicated problems in forecasting,\ngiven the transient nature of trends in colours, prints, cuts, patterns, and\nmaterials in fashion, the economies of scale achievable only in bulk\nproduction, as well as geographical variations in consumption.

To our knowledge, none of these models have\ngeneralized well to predict future demand at an abstracted level for a new\ndesign/style of fashion article. To address this problem, we present a study of\nlarge scale fashion sales data and directly infer which clothing/footwear\nattributes and merchandising factors drove demand for those items.
