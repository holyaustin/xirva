This indirect visualization causes\npotential occlusion, hinders hand-eye coordination, leads to increased\nprocedure duration and surgeon load. Methods: We propose a virtual monitor\nsystem that displays medical images in a mixed reality visualization using\noptical see-through head-mounted displays. The system streams high-resolution\nmedical images from any modality to the head-mounted display in real-time that\nare blended with the surgical site. It allows for mixed reality visualization\nof images in head-, world-, or body-anchored mode and can thus be adapted to\nspecific procedural needs. Results: For typical image sizes, the proposed\nsystem exhibits an average end-to-end delay and refresh rate of 214 +- 30 ms\nand 41:4 +- 32:0 Hz, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed virtual monitor\nsystem is capable of real-time mixed reality visualization of medical images.\nIn future, we seek to conduct first pre-clinical studies to quantitatively\nassess the impact of the system on standard image guided procedures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 17:39:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Long", ""], ["Unberath", "Mathias", ""], ["Yu", "Kevin", ""], ["Fuerst", "Bernhard", ""], ["Johnson", "Alex", ""], ["Navab", "Nassir", ""], ["Osgood", "Greg", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01446", "submitter": "Ayaka Takamoto", "authors": "Ayaka Takamoto, Mayu Umemura, Mitsuo Yoshida, Kyoji Umemura", "title": "Improving Compression Based Dissimilarity Measure for Music Score\n  Analysis", "comments": "The 2016 International Conference On Advanced Informatics: Concepts,\n  Theory And Application (ICAICTA2016)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SD cs.OH eess.AS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a way to improve the compression based\ndissimilarity measure, CDM.

By applying statistical methods to prior known gene and\nprotein regulatory information, pathway analysis provides a meaningful way to\ninterpret genomic data.

In order to\ncope with a data rate 100 times higher than during LHC Run 1 and with the\ncontinuous read-out of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), it is necessary to\nupgrade the Online and Offline Computing to a new common system called O2 .
