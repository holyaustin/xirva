All emotions and thoughts are an\nemergent property of the chemical and electrical activity of neurons. Most of\nthese cells are regarded as excitable cells (spiking neurons), which produce\ntemporally localized electric patterns (spikes). Researchers usually consider\nthat only the instant of occurrence (timestamp) of these spikes encodes\ninformation. Registering neural activity evoked by stimuli demands timing\ndeterminism and data storage capabilities that cannot be met without dedicated\nhardware and a hard real-time operational system (RTOS). Indeed, research in\nneuroscience usually requires dedicated electronic instrumentation for studies\nin neural coding, brain machine interfaces and closed loop in vivo or in vitro\nexperiments. We developed a complete embedded system solution consisting of a\nhardware/software co-design with the Intel Atom processor running a free RTOS\nand a FPGA communicating via a PCIe-to-Avalon bridge. Our system is capable of\nregistering input event timestamps with 1{\\mu}s precision and digitally\ngenerating stimuli output in hard real-time. The whole system is controlled by\na Linux-based Graphical User Interface (GUI). Collected results are\nsimultaneously saved in a local file and broadcasted wirelessly to mobile\ndevice web-browsers in an user-friendly graphic format, enhanced by HTML5\ntechnology. The developed system is low-cost and highly configurable, enabling\nvarious neuroscience experimental setups, while the commercial off-the-shelf\nsystems have low availability and are less flexible to adapt to specific\nexperimental configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Apr 2015 20:05:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["de Almeida", "Lirio Onofre Baptista", ""], ["Matias", "Paulo", ""], ["Guariento", "Rafael Tuma", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01375", "submitter": "Zhihan Lv", "authors": "Xiaoming Li, Zhihan Lv, Jinxing Hu, Baoyun Zhang, Ling Yin, Chen\n  Zhong, Weixi Wang, Shengzhong Feng", "title": "Preprint Traffic Management and Forecasting System Based on 3D GIS", "comments": "This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 15th IEEE/ACM\n  International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid). arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1504.01057", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is the preprint version of our paper on 2015 15th IEEE/ACM International\nSymposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid).

Traditional ways for collecting travel-speed oriented traffic data\nalways depend on dedicated sensors and supporting infrastructures, and are\ntherefore financial costly. Differently, vehicular crowdsensing as an\ninfrastructure-free way, can be used to collect data including real-time\nlocations and velocities of vehicles for road travel speed estimation, which is\na quite low-cost way. However, vehicular crowdsensing data is always\ncoarse-grained. This coarseness can lead to the incompleteness of travel\nspeeds. Aiming to handle this problem as well as estimate travel speed\naccurately, in this paper, we propose an approach named STC that exploits the\nspatial-temporal correlation among travel speeds for roads by introducing the\ntime-lagged cross correlation function. The time lagging factor describes the\ntime consumption of traffic feature diffusion along roads. To properly\ncalculate cross correlation, we novelly make the determination of the time\nlagging factor self-adaptive by recording the locations of vehicles at\ndifferent roads. Then, utilizing the local stationarity of cross correlation,\nwe further reduce the problem of single-road travel speed vacancy completion to\na minimization problem. Finally, we fill all the vacancies of travel speed for\nroads in a recursive way using the geometric structure of road net. Elaborate\nexperiments based on real taxi trace data show that STC can settle the\nincompleteness problem of vehicle crowdsensing data based travel speed\nestimation and ensure the accuracy of estimated travel speed better, in\ncomparison with representative existing methods such as KNN, Kriging and ARIMA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 03:40:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 02:03:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 03:27:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Shao", "Lu", ""], ["Wang", "Cheng", ""], ["Jiang", "Changjun", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.04532", "submitter": "Mikhail Berlinkov", "authors": "Mikhail V.
