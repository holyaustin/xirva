A demanding solution to this problem is redundant via\ninsertion during post-routing optimization. It becomes very critical when a\nmulti-layer routing solution already incurs a large number of vias. Very few\nglobal routers addressed unconstrained via minimization (UVM) problem, while\nusing minimal pattern routing and layer assignment of nets. It also includes a\nrecent floorplan based early global routability assessment tool STAIRoute\n\\cite{karb2}.\n  This work addresses an early version of unconstrained via minimization\nproblem during early global routing by identifying a set of minimal bend\nrouting regions in any floorplan, by a new recursive bipartitioning framework.\nThese regions facilitate monotone pattern routing of a set of nets in the\nfloorplan by STAIRoute. The area/number balanced floorplan bipartitionining is\na multi-objective optimization problem and known to be NP-hard \\cite{majum2}.\nNo existing approaches considered bend minimization as an objective and some of\nthem incurred higher runtime overhead. In this paper, we present a Greedy as\nwell as randomized neighbor search based staircase wave-front propagation\nmethods for obtaining optimal bipartitioning results for minimal bend routing\nthrough multiple routing layers, for a balanced trade-off between routability,\nwirelength and congestion.\n  Experiments were conducted on MCNC/GSRC floorplanning benchmarks for studying\nthe variation of early via count obtained by STAIRoute for different values of\nthe trade-off parameters ($\\gamma, \\beta$) in this multi-objective optimization\nproblem, using $8$ metal layers. We studied the impact of ($\\gamma, \\beta$)\nvalues on each of the objectives as well as their linear combination function\n$Gain$ of these objectives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2018 08:32:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kar", "Bapi", ""], ["Sur-Kolay", "Susmita", ""], ["Mandal", "Chittaranjan", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06862", "submitter": "Cornelius Steinbrink", "authors": "Cornelius Steinbrink, Florian Schl\\\"ogl, Davood Babazadeh, Sebastian\n  Lehnhoff, Sebastian Rohjans, Anand Narajan", "title": "Future Perspectives of Co-Simulation in the Smart Grid Domain", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE International Energy Conference (2018)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The recent attention towards research and development in cyber-physical\nenergy systems has introduced the necessity of emerging multi-domain\nco-simulation tools.

The overall application environment is a continuously growing\nand interconnected cyber-physical system so that analytical assessment is\npractically impossible to realize. Consequently, new solutions must be\nevaluated in simulation studies. Due to the interdisciplinarity of the\nsimulation scenarios, various heterogeneous tools must be connected. This\napproach is known as co-simulation. During the last years, different approaches\nhave been developed or adapted for applications in energy systems. In this\npaper, two co-simulation approaches are compared that follow generic, versatile\nconcepts. The tool mosaik, which has been explicitly developed for the purpose\nof co-simulation in complex energy systems, is compared to the High Level\nArchitecture (HLA), which possesses a domain-independent scope but is often\nemployed in the energy domain. The comparison is twofold, considering the\ntools' conceptual architectures as well as results from the simulation of\nrepresentative test cases. It suggests that mosaik may be the better choice for\nentry-level, prototypical co-simulation while HLA is more suited for complex\nand extensive studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2018 08:25:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Steinbrink", "Cornelius", ""], ["van der Meer", "Arjen A.", ""], ["Cvetkovic", "Milos", ""], ["Babazadeh", "Davood", ""], ["Rohjans", "Sebastian", ""], ["Palensky", "Peter", ""], ["Lehnhoff", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.07897", "submitter": "Miki Verma", "authors": "Miki E.
