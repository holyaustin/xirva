Therefore a closer look at the impact of ICT in\npublic financial management and performance is highly justified. Public finance\nis defined as a field of economics concerned with paying for collective or\ngovernmental activities, and with the administration and design of those\nactivities. Activities will be viewed as services or more precisely as public\nservices. We believe that there is need to consider performance from the\nperspective of effective performance and the perceived performance. In fact the\nreal or effective performance might not correspond to the perceived\nperformance. A service can be considered from the perspective of the\ndecision-maker, who in our case could be a government or a collectivity. ICT\ncan be employed in the three phases that concern the decision-maker: design,\nimplementation and evaluation. The beneficiaries of a service can employ ICT in\nany of the three phases - awareness, exploitation and assessment - for\nguarantying a high level of efficiency. Each phase in the environment of a\nservice will be presented as well as illustrations of how ICT can be employed\nin order to improve the end-result of each one of them. We believe that a high\nefficiency of each phase will produce a high global efficiency. It should be\nnoted however that the effectiveness of any system is highly dependent on the\nhuman engagement in the system. Therefore, the impact of ICT in public\nfinancial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users\nof the services engage themselves in the success of the system. Instead of\ngiving a catalog of services, the focus has been on the model (or methodology)\nto adopt in designing services for which ICT could enhance the implementation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 20:49:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["David", "Amos", "", "LORIA"]]}, {"id": "0812.3933", "submitter": "Masud Hasan", "authors": "Masud Hasan, Atif Rahman, M.

We consider the variations in the sorting process by adding with\nprefix reversals other similar operations such as prefix transpositions and\nprefix transreversals. These type of sorting problems have applications in\ninterconnection networks and computational biology. We first study the problem\nof sorting unsigned permutations by prefix reversals and prefix transpositions\nand present a 3-approximation algorithm for this problem. Then we give a\n2-approximation algorithm for sorting by prefix reversals and prefix\ntransreversals. We also provide a 3-approximation algorithm for sorting by\nprefix reversals and prefix transpositions where the operations are always\napplied at the unsorted suffix of the permutation. We further analyze the\nproblem in more practical way and show quantitatively how approximation ratios\nof our algorithms improve with the increase of number of prefix reversals\napplied by optimal algorithms. Finally, we present experimental results to\nsupport our analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Dec 2008 03:10:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2009 12:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hasan", "Masud", ""], ["Rahman", "Atif", ""], ["Rahman", "M.
