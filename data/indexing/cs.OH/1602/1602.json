This problem\nconsists of the problem of establishing identities in formal mathematical\nsystems and hence is formally unsolvable. However, there is a way to cope with\nthe issue. We suggest to reinforce the standard algorithm for function\ncomparison with an additional pointwise checking procedure. An error might\nappear in this case. The article provides a detailed analysis of the\nprobability of this error. It appears that the error probability is extremely\nlow in most common cases. Generally speaking, this means that such an\nadditional checking procedure can be quite successfully used in order to\nsupport standard algorithms for functions comparison. The results, obtained in\nthis article, help avoiding some sudden effects of the identity problem, and\nprovide a way to estimate the reliability of answer checking procedure in\ninteractive learning systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2016 13:26:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Danilov", "Vladimir G.", ""], ["Turuntaev", "Ilya S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.03100", "submitter": "V.M.

A key component of ITS is traveler information.

The new ODOT system is based on travel data collected from a\nrecently-increased set of sensors installed on its freeways. Our current\nproject investigates novel data cleaning methodologies and the integration of\nthose methodologies into the prediction of travel times. We use machine\nlearning techniques on our archive to identify suspect data, and calculate\nrevised travel times excluding this suspect data.

For the latter, classification\naccuracy increased as visual angles between two glance locations increased. In\nother words, the greater the shift in gaze, the higher the accuracy of\nclassification.
