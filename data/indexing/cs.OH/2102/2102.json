Moreover, these statistics are correlated to poor verification\nand validation processes used by hobbyists satellite developers because major\nspace agencies keep high successful ratings even with small/nano satellites\nmissions due to its rigorous V\\&V processes. Aiming to improve payloads\nintegration testing of NanosatC-BR-2, a 2-U Cubesat based nanosatellite under\ndevelopment by INPE, the fault injection technique has been used. It is very\nuseful technique to test systems prototypes. We present the design and\nimplementation of a Failure Emulator Mechanism (FEM) on I2C communication bus\nfor testing the interaction among the NCBR2 subsystems, supporting\ninteroperability and robustness requirements verification. The FEM is modelled\nto work at the communication bus emulating eventual faults of the communicating\nsubsystems in the messages exchanged. Using an Arduino board for the FEM and NI\nLabView environment it is possible to program the mechanism to inject different\nfaults at the I2C bus during different operation modes. Based on a serial\narchitecture, the FEM will be able to intercept all messages and implement\ndifferent faults as service and timing faults. The FEM interface with the\ntester is designed in LabView environment. Control and observation facilities\nare available to generate and upload the faultload script to FEM Arduino board.\nThe proposed FEM architecture and its implementation are validated using two\nsubsystems under testing prototypes: the OnBoard Data Handling Computer and the\nLangmuir Probe NCBR2 payload. For this analysis purpose, the prototypes\nsimulate in two different Arduinos boards the expected behavior of each\nsubsystem in the communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:22:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Batista", "Carlos Leandro Gomes", ""], ["Corsetti", "Andr\u00e9", ""], ["Mattiello-Francisco", "F\u00e1tima", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11814", "submitter": "I.

In this study, we address this core limitation by\npresenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental model, which\nintegrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control\nan infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program\ninvolves various disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of\ntreatment centers and resources while minimizing the total expected number of\nnew infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics, namely infection\nand capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment\nfunds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage\nvalue of the stochastic solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of\nthe proposed stochastic programming model over its deterministic counterpart.\nWe apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in\nGuinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and\nfair resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of\ninfections over all regions, even without including the infection equity or\nprevalence equity constraints. Model results also show that allocating\ntreatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing\nsuch a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of\ninfections and deaths, and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay\nfor the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic epidemic-logistics model is\npractical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases in\nmeta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2021 17:28:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Xuecheng", ""], ["Buyuktahtakin", "I.
