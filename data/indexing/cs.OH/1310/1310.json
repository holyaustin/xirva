Previous algorithms which commonly need either a full\ngraph search or a convergence process suffer from high computational and\ncommunication overheads. This research report surveys the current emergency\nnavigation algorithms and adapts the concept of Cognitive Packet Network (CPN)\nto the context of emergency evacuation. By using random neural networks, the\nCPN based algorithm can explore optimal routes rapidly and adaptively in a\nhighly dynamic emergency environment with low expense.

The CPN algorithm is simulated in a graph based discrete-event\nsimulator and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm is taken as reference.

Smart\nhomes define optimal consumption as either balancing/leveling consumption such\nthat the utility company is presented with a uniform demand or as minimizing\nconsumption costs by storing energy during off-peak time periods when prices\nare lower and use the stored energy during peak time periods when prices are\nhigher. Due to the varying nature of energy requirements of household and\nmarket energy prices over different time periods in a day, households face a\ntrade-off between consuming to meet their current energy requirements and/or\nstoring energy for future consumption and/or spending energy stored in the\npast. These trade-offs or consumption preferences of the household are modeled\nas utility functions using consumer theory. We introduce two different utility\nfunctions, one for cost minimization and another for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, that are maximized subject to respective budget,\nconsumption, storage and savings constraints to solve for the optimum\nconsumption profile. The optimization problem of a household with energy\nstorage is formulated as a geometric program for consumption\nbalancing/leveling, while cost minimization is formulated as a linear\nprogramming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed model achieves\nextremely low peak to average ratio in the consumption balancing/leveling\nscheme with about 8% reduction in consumption costs and the least possible\namount for electricity bill with about 12% reduction in consumption costs in\nthe cost minimization scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Oct 2013 21:14:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rajasekharan", "Jayaprakash", ""], ["Koivunen", "Visa", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.4270", "submitter": "Rajib Rana", "authors": "Rajib Rana, Chun Tung Chou, Nirupama Bulusu, Salil Kanhere, Wen Hu", "title": "Ear-Phone: A Context-Aware Noise Mapping using Smart Phones", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A noise map facilitates the monitoring of environmental noise pollution in\nurban areas. However, state-of-the-art techniques for rendering noise maps in\nurban areas are expensive and rarely updated, as they rely on population and\ntraffic models rather than on real data. Smart phone based urban sensing can be\nleveraged to create an open and inexpensive platform for rendering up-to- date\nnoise maps. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and\nperformance evaluation of an end-to-end, context-aware, noise mapping system\ncalled Ear-Phone. Ear-Phone investigates the use of different interpolation and\nregularization methods to address the fundamental problem of recovering the\nnoise map from incomplete and random samples obtained by crowdsourcing data\ncollection. Ear-Phone, implemented on Nokia N95, N97 and HP iPAQ, HTC One\nmobile devices, also addresses the challenge of collecting accurate noise\npollution readings at a mobile device. A major challenge of using smart phones\nas sensors is that even at the same location, the sensor reading may vary\ndepending on the phone orientation and user context (for example, whether the\nuser is carrying the phone in a bag or holding it in her palm). To address this\nproblem, Ear-Phone leverages context-aware sensing. We develop classifiers to\naccurately determine the phone sensing context. Upon context discovery,\nEar-Phone automatically decides whether to sense or not. Ear-phone also\nimplements in-situ calibration which performs simple calibration that can be\ncarried out without any technical skills whatsoever required on the user's\npart. Extensive simulations and outdoor experiments demonstrate that Ear-Phone\nis a feasible platform to assess noise pollution, incurring reasonable system\nresource consumption at mobile devices and providing high reconstruction\naccuracy of the noise map.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 05:04:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rana", "Rajib", ""], ["Chou", "Chun Tung", ""], ["Bulusu", "Nirupama", ""], ["Kanhere", "Salil", ""], ["Hu", "Wen", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.4880", "submitter": "Rajib Rana", "authors": "Rajib Rana, Daniel Austin, Peter G.
