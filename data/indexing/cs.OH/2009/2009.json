Following its desktop counterpart, the mobile browsers\necosystem has been growing from few browsers (Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) to a\nplethora of browsers, each with unique characteristics (battery friendly,\nprivacy preserving, lightweight, etc.). In this paper, we introduce a browser\nbenchmarking pipeline for Android browsers encompassing automation, in-depth\nexperimentation, and result analysis. We tested 15 Android browsers, using\nCappuccino a novel testing suite we built for third party Android applications.\nWe perform a battery-centric analysis of such browsers and show that: 1)\npopular browsers tend also to consume the most, 2) adblocking produces\nsignificant battery savings (between 20 and 40% depending on the browser), and\n3) dark mode offers an extra 10% battery savings on AMOLED screens. We exploit\nthis observation to build AttentionDim, a screen dimming mechanism driven by\nbrowser events. Via integration with the Brave browser and 10 volunteers, we\nshow potential battery savings up to 30%, on both devices with AMOLED and LCD\nscreens.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 22:01:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Varvello", "Matteo", ""], ["Livshits", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06363", "submitter": "Madhavi B Shankar", "authors": "Madhavi Bangalore Shankara Narayana, Hossameldin Khalifa, Wil van der\n  Aalst", "title": "JXES: JSON Support for the XES Event Log Standard", "comments": "4 pages, IEEE format", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Process mining assumes the existence of an event log where each event refers\nto a case, an activity, and a point in time.

In\nparticular, we study relaxations related to the perspective transformation of a\nnatural piecewise-linear under-estimator of $f$, obtained by choosing\nlinearization points for $f$. Using 3-d volume (in $(x,y,z)$) as a measure of\nthe tightness of a convex relaxation, we investigate relaxation quality as a\nfunction of $f$, $\\ell$, $u$, and the linearization points chosen. We make a\ndetailed investigation for convex power functions $f(x):=x^p$, $p>1$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:31:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Jon", ""], ["Skipper", "Daphne", ""], ["Speakman", "Emily", ""], ["Xu", "Luze", ""]]}]
