The virtual reality concept is\nfamiliar to us from online worlds, but our world as a virtual reality is\nusually a subject for science fiction rather than science. Yet logically the\nworld could be an information simulation running on a multi-dimensional\nspace-time screen. Indeed, if the essence of the universe is information,\nmatter, charge, energy and movement could be aspects of information, and the\nmany conservation laws could be a single law of information conservation. If\nthe universe were a virtual reality, its creation at the big bang would no\nlonger be paradoxical, as every virtual system must be booted up. It is\nsuggested that whether the world is an objective reality or a virtual reality\nis a matter for science to resolve. Modern information science can suggest how\ncore physical properties like space, time, light, matter and movement could\nderive from information processing. Such an approach could reconcile relativity\nand quantum theories, with the former being how information processing creates\nspace-time, and the latter how it creates energy and matter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2008 05:04:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2008 08:00:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Whitworth", "Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.1715", "submitter": "Srivatsava Ranjit Ganta", "authors": "Srivatsava Ranjit Ganta, Raj Acharya", "title": "On Breaching Enterprise Data Privacy Through Adversarial Information\n  Fusion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.CR cs.OH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Data privacy is one of the key challenges faced by enterprises today.\nAnonymization techniques address this problem by sanitizing sensitive data such\nthat individual privacy is preserved while allowing enterprises to maintain and\nshare sensitive data.

Treatment planning\nand seed implanting are most often based on the intensive use of transrectal\nultrasound (TRUS) imaging. This is not easy because prostate visualization is\ndifficult in this imaging modality particularly as regards the apex of the\ngland and from an intra- and interobserver variability standpoint. Radioactive\nseeds are implanted inside open interventional MR machines in some centers.\nSince MRI was shown to be sensitive and specific for prostate imaging whilst\nopen MR is prohibitive for most centers and makes surgical procedures very\ncomplex, this work suggests bringing the MR virtually in the operating room\nwith MRI/TRUS data fusion.

The paper describes the method developed and\nimplemented in the PROCUR system. Results are reported for a phantom and first\nseries of patients.
