As such organisms\nbecome more common it is desirable to be able to distinguish between natural\nand artificial life forms. In this paper, we present this challenge as a\ngeneralized version of Darwin's original problem, which he so brilliantly\naddressed in On the Origin of Species. After formalizing the problem of\ndetermining origin of samples we demonstrate that the problem is in fact\nunsolvable, in the general case, if computational resources of considered\noriginator algorithms have not been limited and priors for such algorithms are\nknown to be equal. Our results should be of interest to astrobiologists and\nscientists interested in producing a more complete theory of life, as well as\nto AI-Safety researchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 19:05:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yampolskiy", "Roman V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07809", "submitter": "Ulf R\\\"uegg", "authors": "Ulf R\\\"uegg and Thorsten Ehlers and Miro Sp\\\"onemann and Reinhard von\n  Hanxleden", "title": "A Generalization of the Directed Graph Layering Problem", "comments": "Appears in the Proceedings of the 24th International Symposium on\n  Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2016)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Directed Layering Problem (DLP) solves a step of the widely used\nlayer-based approach to automatically draw directed acyclic graphs. To cater\nfor cyclic graphs, usually a preprocessing step is used that solves the\nFeedback Arc Set Problem (FASP) to make the graph acyclic before a layering is\ndetermined. Here we present the Generalized Layering Problem (GLP), which\nsolves the combination of DLP and FASP simultaneously, allowing general graphs\nas input. We present an integer programming model and a heuristic to solve the\nNP-complete GLP and perform thorough evaluations on different sets of graphs\nand with different implementations for the steps of the layer-based approach.\nWe observe that GLP reduces the number of dummy nodes significantly, can\nproduce more compact drawings, and improves on graphs where DLP yields poor\naspect ratios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 13:38:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["R\u00fcegg", "Ulf", ""], ["Ehlers", "Thorsten", ""], ["Sp\u00f6nemann", "Miro", ""], ["von Hanxleden", "Reinhard", ""]]}]
