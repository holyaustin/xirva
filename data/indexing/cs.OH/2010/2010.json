Such formulations correspond to determining an optimal\nflow in a network. One particular class of network flow formulations is the arc\nflow, where variables represent flows on individual arcs of the network. For\n$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems, polynomial-sized arc flow models typically\nprovide weak linear relaxations and may have too much symmetry to be efficient\nin practice. Instead, arc flow models with a pseudo-polynomial size usually\nprovide strong relaxations and are efficient in practice. The interest in\npseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations has grown considerably in the last\ntwenty years, in which they have been used to solve many open instances of hard\nproblems. A remarkable advantage of pseudo-polynomial arc flow models is the\npossibility to solve practical-sized instances directly by a Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming solver, avoiding the implementation of complex methods based\non column generation.\n  In this survey, we present theoretical foundations of pseudo-polynomial arc\nflow formulations, by showing a relation between their network and Dynamic\nProgramming (DP). This relation allows a better understanding of the strength\nof these formulations, through a link with models obtained by Dantzig-Wolfe\ndecomposition. The relation with DP also allows a new perspective to relate\nstate-space relaxation methods for DP with arc flow models. We also present a\ndual point of view to contrast the linear relaxation of arc flow models with\nthat of models based on paths and cycles. To conclude, we review the main\nsolution methods and applications of arc flow models based on DP in several\ndomains such as cutting, packing, scheduling, and routing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 17:23:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:50:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["de Lima", "Vin\u00edcius L.", ""], ["Alves", "Cl\u00e1udio", ""], ["Clautiaux", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Iori", "Manuel", ""], ["de Carvalho", "Jos\u00e9 M.

Because of inherent differences between internal\ninfrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be\namenable to developing ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing\ncountries are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge.\nFor example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based traffic\nflow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally\nexperiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed\ntraffic simulator 'RoadBird', we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and\nnon-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed\ncountries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted\nfrom the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering\ndifferent scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or\nheterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate\ndifferent car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and\ninvestigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open\nresearch question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based\napproaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted\nnon-lane-based scenarios; and (ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system\nperformance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic.\nNonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences both in\ndeveloping and developed countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2020 16:23:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Mushfiq", "Md.
