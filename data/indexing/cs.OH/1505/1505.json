The system handles various challenges such as noise\nelimination, interfering humans, sudden user movements, as well as detecting\nabnormal breathing situations. Our implementation of UbiBreathe using\noff-the-shelf devices in a wide range of environmental conditions shows that it\ncan estimate different breathing rates with less than 1 breaths per minute\n(bpm) error.
