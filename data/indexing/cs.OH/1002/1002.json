We proposed\nto realize a global optimization of a deep drawing industrial progression (made\nof several stages) for a cup manufacture. The objectives of the process were\nthe thickness decrease and the geometrical parameters (especially the height).\nThis paper improves on this previous work in the aim of mastering the contour\nerror. From the optimal configuration, we expect to cut down the amount of the\nneeded material and the number of forming operations. Our action is focused on\nthe appearance of unexpected undulations (ears) located on the rim of the cups\nduring forming due to a nonuniform crystallographic texture. Those undulations\ncan cause a significant amount of scraps, productivity loss, and cost during\nmanufacture. In this paper, this phenomenon causes the use of four forming\noperations for the cup manufacture. The aim is to cut down from four to two\nforming stages by defining an optimal blank (size and shape). The advantage is\nto reduce the cost of the tool manufacturing and to minimize the needed\nmaterial (by suppressing the part flange). The chosen approach consists in\ndefining a particular description of the ears' part by modal decomposition and\nthen simulating several blank shapes and sizes generated by discrete cosine\ntransformation (DCT). The use of a numerical simulation for the forming\noperation and the design of an experiment technique allow mathematical links\nbetween the ears' formation and the DCT coefficients. An optimization is then\npossible by using mathematical links.

The distributed prediction algorithm represents the optimal\nlinear fusion by weighting matrices under the minimum mean square criterion.\nThe algorithm has the parallel structure and allows parallel processing of\nobservations making it reliable since the rest faultless sensors can continue\nto the fusion estimation if some sensors occur faulty. The derivation of\nequations for error cross-covariances between the local predictors is the key\nof this paper. Example demonstrates effectiveness of the distributed limited\nmemory predictor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 18:12:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Ha-ryong", ""], ["Shin", "Vladimir", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.3340", "submitter": "Ashley Smith", "authors": "S.

In an effort to\nutilize these energies effectively through Power converter, a great deal of\nresearch is being carried out by different researchers / scientist and\nengineers at different places in the world to meet the increasing demand of\nload. The study presents methodology to integrate solar (PV) energy (which is\nfreely available in every corner of the world) with grid source and supplement\nthe existing grid power in rural houses during its cut off or restricted supply\nperiod. In order to get consistency in supply a DG is also added as a standby\nsource in the proposed integration of network. The software using novel Direct\nPWM modulation strategy and its soft control features extend the flexibility to\ncontrol converter (inverter) parameters like voltage, frequency, number of\nsamples of PWM pulses constituting sine-wave without changing any hardware\nconfiguration in the circuit. The system simulation of PWM Pulse generation has\nbeen done on a XILINX based FPGA Spartan 3E board using VHDL code.
