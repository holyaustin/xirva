To meet the business requiements\nrelated to these areas, service providers are going through three major\ntransformation programs namely the Business Support Systems transformation\nprogram for Customer related aspects, the Operations Support System\ntransformation program for mainly service Fulfillment and Assurance and\nResource, Fulfillment and Assurance, and Time To Market Transformation program\nfor Products ans Services development and management. These transformations are\nabout making a transition from a current situation with all its views to a\ndesired one. The information view transformation is about reorganizing and\nreengineering the existing information to be used for the day to day activities\nand reporting to support decision making. For reporting purpose, service\nproviders have to invest in Business Intelligence solutions. For which the main\npurpose is to provide the right information in a timely manner to efficiently\nsupport the decision making. One of the key BI challenges is to model an\ninformation structure where to host all the information coming from multiple\nsources. The purpose of this paper is to suggest a step by step methodology to\ndesign a Telco Data Mart, one of the fundamental BI components.\nOrder-To-Payment, an end to end customer process, will be used as an\napplication for this methodology. Our methodology consists on bringing together\nthe concepts of business intelligence and the telecom business frameworks\ndeveloped by the TM Forum: the Business Process Framework, the Information\nFramework, and the Business Metrics. The advantage of this solution is its\nability to adapt to any telecom enterprise architecture since it's built around\nthe business standards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 14:33:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Benhima", "Mounire", ""], ["Reilly", "John P.", ""], ["Naamane", "Zaineb", ""], ["Kharbat", "Meriam", ""], ["Kabbaj", "Mohammed Issam", ""], ["Esqalli", "Oussama", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.1451", "submitter": "Kalpana Pandey", "authors": "Kalpana Kandpal, Anjali Singhal", "title": "Smart Grid Demand Monitoring Model", "comments": "3 pages, 1 figure, International Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is in related to the demand genrated by the consumer for a time\nfor the power which is being viewed by taking some measures to solve the demand\nneed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 17:30:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kandpal", "Kalpana", ""], ["Singhal", "Anjali", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.3038", "submitter": "Richard Formato", "authors": "Richard A.

Further, flops are getting cheaper\nwhile the energy cost of data movement is increasingly dominant. The\nunderstanding and characterization of data locality properties of computations\nis critical in order to guide efforts to enhance data locality. Reuse distance\nanalysis of memory address traces is a valuable tool to perform data locality\ncharacterization of programs. A single reuse distance analysis can be used to\nestimate the number of cache misses in a fully associative LRU cache of any\nsize, thereby providing estimates on the minimum bandwidth requirements at\ndifferent levels of the memory hierarchy to avoid being bandwidth bound.\nHowever, such an analysis only holds for the particular execution order that\nproduced the trace. It cannot estimate potential improvement in data locality\nthrough dependence preserving transformations that change the execution\nschedule of the operations in the computation. In this article, we develop a\nnovel dynamic analysis approach to characterize the inherent locality\nproperties of a computation and thereby assess the potential for data locality\nenhancement via dependence preserving transformations. The execution trace of a\ncode is analyzed to extract a computational directed acyclic graph (CDAG) of\nthe data dependences. The CDAG is then partitioned into convex subsets, and the\nconvex partitioning is used to reorder the operations in the execution trace to\nenhance data locality. The approach enables us to go beyond reuse distance\nanalysis of a single specific order of execution of the operations of a\ncomputation in characterization of its data locality properties. It can serve a\nvaluable role in identifying promising code regions for manual transformation,\nas well as assessing the effectiveness of compiler transformations for data\nlocality enhancement. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using a\nnumber of benchmarks, including case studies where the potential shown by the\nanalysis is exploited to achieve lower data movement costs and better\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 08:06:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Fauzia", "Naznin", "", "OSU"], ["Elango", "Venmugil", "", "OSU"], ["Ravishankar", "Mahesh", "", "OSU"], ["Ramanujam", "J.", "", "ECE"], ["Rastello", "Fabrice", "", "LIP"], ["Rountev", "Atanas", "", "OSU"], ["Pouchet", "Louis-No\u00ebl", "", "UCLA-CS"], ["Sadayappan", "P.", "", "CSE"]]}, {"id": "1401.5209", "submitter": "Pablo Cristian Tissera", "authors": "Pablo Cristian Tissera (1), Alicia Castro (1), A.

It\nprovides a conceptual framework for the unified view of cognition as evolved\nfrom the simplest to the most complex organisms, based on new empirical and\ntheoretical results. It addresses three fundamental questions: what cognition\nis, how cognition works and what cognition does at different levels of\ncomplexity of living organisms. By explicating the info-computational character\nof cognition, its evolution, agent-dependency and generative mechanisms we can\nbetter understand its life-sustaining and life-propagating role. The\ninfo-computational approach contributes to rethinking cognition as a process of\nnatural computation in living beings that can be applied for cognitive\ncomputation in artificial systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2014 14:14:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dodig-Crnkovic", "Gordana", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8136", "submitter": "Ivan  Arakistain", "authors": "Ivan Arakistain, Jose Miguel Abascal, Oriol Munne", "title": "ICT technologies for the refurbishment of wooden structure buildings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nowadays, one would think that after years of massive concrete and steel\nconstruction in Spain, there are not many wood structure buildings left to be\nrefurbished except for some palaces or cathedrals. However, if we go for a walk\nand have a look at the old part of any city, we will realize that still most of\nthe buildings have a wood structure. In spite of the fact that the majority of\nurban regulations forbid their demolition, other bad practices such as casting\nand overloading the wood structure are very common. Considering that we want to\nreach a standard of sustainable construction, the economical and environmental\ncosts, which are implied by the deficient refurbishment makes it well worth a\nprevious study of the structure, which in most cases represents less than a 1%\nof the total budget. The main goal of this paper is to present most relevant\nparts of the whole process of diagnosis of a wood structure building by means\nof Non-Destructive Testing Techniques. Among the ones to be considered, we\ncould mention the analysis of the building and its surroundings, on-site\ninspection of the building, structural diagnosis, definition of the corrective\nactions to be taken, definition of treatments, quality control and a\nmaintenance plan. For the on-site inspection of the building, in the paper we\nwill highlight the use of Non-Destructive methods such as resistograph\ndrilling, X-ray imaging, ultrasound-based testing or moisture measurement. We\nwill provide practical examples of all this. The aim of this paper is to give\nthe audience an overall idea on how a pre-assessment work can enhance the\nrefurbishment of a wood structure building while reducing costs and\nenvironmental impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 11:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Arakistain", "Ivan", ""], ["Abascal", "Jose Miguel", ""], ["Munne", "Oriol", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8252", "submitter": "Abdessamad Mouzoune", "authors": "Abdessamad Mouzoune, Saoudi Taibi", "title": "Introducing E-maintenance 2.0", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Business\n  Informatics, Vol. 9, No. 1, pp. 80-90", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While research literature is still debating e-maintenance definition, a new\nreality is emerging in business world confirming the enterprise 2.0 model.\nExecutives are more and more forced to stop running against current trend\ntowards social media and instead envisage harnessing its power within the\nenterprise.
