Current approaches for quantifying\nthe output accuracy of a localization system in real-time either do not provide\na distance metric, require an extensive training process, and/or are tailored\nto a specific localization system. In this paper, we present the design,\nimplementation, and evaluation of CONE: a novel calibration-free accurate\nconfidence estimation system that can work in real-time with any location\ndetermination system. CONE builds on a sound theoretical model that allows it\nto trade the required user confidence with tight bound on the estimated\nconfidence radius. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating confidence\nestimation systems that can capture new aspects of their performance.\nEvaluation of CONE on Android phones in a typical testbed using the iBeacons\nBLE technology with a side-by-side comparison with traditional confidence\nestimation techniques shows that CONE can achieve a consistent median absolute\nerror difference accuracy of less than 2.7m while estimating the user position\nmore than 80% of the time within the confidence circle. This is significantly\nbetter than the state-of-the-art confidence estimation systems that are\ntailored to the specific localization system in use. Moreover, CONE does not\nrequire any calibration and therefore provides a scalable and ubiquitous\nconfidence estimation system for pervasive applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 06:02:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Elbakly", "Rizanne", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.02606", "submitter": "Mike Fagan", "authors": "Sven Leyffer (1), Stefan M.

We show that our feature choice outperforms other\nmore commonly used jerk-based formulations and we discuss the handling of\nnoisy, inconsistent, and incomplete data as this is a notorious problem when\ndealing with real-world GPS logs.\n  Our solving strategy relies on an agglomerative hierarchical clustering\ncombined with an L-term heuristic to determine the relevant number of clusters.\nIt can easily be implemented and performs fast, even on very large, real-world\ndata sets.
