On the other hand, the\namount of publicly available datasets collected from commercial buildings is\nvery limited, which makes the NILM research even more challenging for this type\nof large buildings. In this study, we aim at addressing these issues. We first\npresent an extensive statistical analysis of both commercial and residential\nmeasurements from public and private datasets and show important differences.\nSecondly, we develop an algorithm for generating synthetic current waveforms.\nWe then demonstrate using real measurement and quantitative metrics that both\nour device model and our simulations are realistic and can be used to evaluate\nNILM algorithms. Finally, to encourage research on commercial buildings we\nrelease a synthesized dataset.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Feb 2018 15:40:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Henriet", "Simon", ""], ["Simsekli", "Umut", ""], ["Fuentes", "Benoit", ""], ["Richard", "Ga\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.02309", "submitter": "Miran Boric", "authors": "Miran Bori\\'c, Ana Fern\\'andez Vilas, Rebeca P.

These tasks require a way to reconstruct/model a city. Traditionally,\nmuch attention has been given to buildings reconstruction, yet an essential\npart of city were neglected: streets. Streets reconstruction has been seldom\nresearched. Streets are also complex compositions of urban features, and have a\nunique role for transportation (as they comprise roads). We aim at completing\nthe recent state of the art for building reconstruction (Musialski2012) by\nconsidering all other aspect of urban reconstruction. We introduce the need for\ncity models. Because reconstruction always necessitates data, we first analyse\nwhich data are available. We then expose a state of the art of street\nreconstruction, street network reconstruction, urban features\nreconstruction/modelling, vegetation , and urban objects\nreconstruction/modelling.\n  Although reconstruction strategies vary widely, we can order them by the role\nthe model plays, from data driven approach, to model-based approach, to inverse\nprocedural modelling and model catalogue matching. The main challenges seems to\ncome from the complex nature of urban environment and from the limitations of\nthe available data. Urban features have strong relationships, between them, and\nto their surrounding, as well as in hierarchical relations. Procedural\nmodelling has the power to express these relations, and could be applied to the\nreconstruction of urban features via the Inverse Procedural Modelling paradigm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jan 2018 02:11:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cura", "Remi", ""], ["Perret", "Julien", ""], ["Paparoditis", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.04774", "submitter": "Rion Brattig Correia", "authors": "Rion Brattig Correia and Alexander J.

However, even simple automata components can lead to collective\ndynamics that are computationally intractable when aggregated into networks.

The precise charting\nand measurement of such canalization simplifies these models, making even very\nlarge networks amenable to analysis. Moreover, canalization plays an important\nrole in the control, robustness, modularity and criticality of Boolean network\ndynamics, especially those used to model biochemical regulation (Gates and\nRocha, 2016; Gates et al., 2016; Manicka, 2017).

New technology only exacerbates this dependence by increasing\nthe number, performance, and degree of autonomy and inter-connectivity of\nsoftware-empowered computers and cyber-physical \"things\", which translates into\nunprecedented scenarios of interdependence. As a consequence, guaranteeing the\npersistence-of-identity of individual & collective software systems and\nsoftware-backed organisations becomes an important prerequisite toward\nsustaining the safety, security, & quality of the computer services supporting\nhuman societies. Resilience is the term used to refer to the ability of a\nsystem to retain its functional and non-functional identity. In this article we\nconjecture that a better understanding of resilience may be reached by\ndecomposing it into ancillary constituent properties, the same way as a better\ninsight in system dependability was obtained by breaking it down into\nsub-properties. 3 of the main sub-properties of resilience proposed here refer\nrespectively to the ability to perceive environmental changes; understand the\nimplications introduced by those changes; and plan & enact adjustments intended\nto improve the system-environment fit. A fourth property characterises the way\nthe above abilities manifest themselves in computer systems. The 4 properties\nare then analyzed in 3 families of case studies, each consisting of 3 software\nsystems that embed different resilience methods. Our major conclusion is that\nreasoning in terms of resilience sub-properties may help revealing the\ncharacteristics and limitations of classic methods and tools meant to achieve\nsystem and organisational resilience. We conclude by suggesting that our method\nmay prelude to meta-resilient systems -- systems, that is, able to adjust\noptimally their own resilience with respect to changing environmental\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:18:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Vincenzo", "De Florio", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.08005", "submitter": "Avishek Sinha Roy", "authors": "Avishek Sinha Roy, Anindya Sundar Dhar", "title": "A Novel Approach for Fast and Accurate Mean Error Distance Computation\n  in Approximate Adders", "comments": "Paper accepted at ISCAS 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.ET", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In error-tolerant applications, approximate adders have been exploited\nextensively to achieve energy efficient system designs.
