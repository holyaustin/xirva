MAED\nincludes some areas which contains its own power generation and loads. By\ntransmitting the power from the area with lower cost to the area with higher\ncost, the total cost function can be minimized greatly. The tie line capacity,\nmulti-fuel generator and the prohibited operating zones are satisfied in this\nstudy. In addition, a new algorithm based on electro search optimization\nalgorithm (ESOA) is proposed to solve the MAED optimization problem with\nconsidering all the constraints. In ESOA algorithm all probable moving states\nfor individuals to get away from or move towards the worst or best solution\nneeds to be considered. To evaluate the performance of the ESOA algorithm, the\nalgorithm is applied to both the original economic dispatch with 40 generator\nsystems and the multi-area economic dispatch with 3 different systems such as:\n6 generators in 2 areas; and 40 generators in 4 areas. It can be concluded\nthat, ESOA algorithm is more accurate and robust in comparison with other\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2018 06:25:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Yazdandoost", "Mina", ""], ["Khazaei", "Peyman", ""], ["Saadatian", "Salar", ""], ["Kamali", "Rahim", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.08721", "submitter": "Noor Farhan", "authors": "Hayder O.
