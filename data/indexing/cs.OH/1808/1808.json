In this paper, we\nconduct a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) aimed at getting insights about\ndifferent facets of SG data analysis: application sub-domains (e.g., power load\ncontrol), aspects covered (e.g., forecasting), used techniques (e.g.,\nclustering), tool-support, research methods (e.g., experiments/simulations),\nreplicability/reproducibility of research. The final goal is to provide a view\nof the current status of research. Overall, we found that each sub-domain has\nits peculiarities in terms of techniques, approaches and research methodologies\napplied. Simulations and experiments play a crucial role in many areas.

For instance, conventional DFM rule scoring\nmethodologies usually use rule-based techniques to compute scores without\nconsidering neighboring geometric scenarios of targeted layout shapes. That can\nlead to inaccurate scoring results since computed DFM rule scores can be either\ntoo optimistic or too pessimistic.
