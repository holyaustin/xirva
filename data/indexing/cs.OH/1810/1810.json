This starts with placement optimization aimed at improving\nroutability, wirelength, congestion and timing in the design. Contrarily, no\nsuch practice exists on a floorplanned layout, during the early stage of the\ndesign flow. Recently, STAIRoute \\cite{karb2} aimed to address that by\nidentifying the shortest routing path of a net through a set of routing regions\nin the floorplan in multiple metal layers. Since the blocks in hierarchical\nASIC/SoC designs do not use all the permissible routing layers for the internal\nrouting corresponding to standard cell connectivity, the proposed STAIRoute\nframework is not an effective for early global routability assessment. This\nleads to improper utilization of routing area, specifically in higher routing\nlayers with fewer routing blockages, as the lack of placement of standard cells\ndoes not facilitates any routing of their interconnections.\n  This paper presents a generalized model for early global routability\nassessment, HGR, by utilizing the free regions over the blocks beyond certain\nmetal layers. The proposed (hybrid) routing model comprises of (a) the junction\ngraph model in STAIRoute routing through the block boundary regions in lower\nrouting layers, and (ii) the grid graph model for routing in higher layers over\nthe free regions of the blocks.\n  Experiment with the latest floorplanning benchmarks exhibit an average\nreduction of $4\\%$, $54\\%$ and $70\\%$ in netlength, via count, and congestion\nrespectively when HGR is used over STAIRoute.
