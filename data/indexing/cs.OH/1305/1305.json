To overcome human in manual control\nfaults in controlling GRS systems, automation system becomes the best solution.\nThe purpose of this research is to design and implement embedded automation\nsystem that can be used to control a GRS automatically through a GUI and from\nremote location by using programmable interface controller (PIC16F877A). In\nthis research the (PIC) software which is based on (C language), developed by\nMicrochip (MPLAB) is used in programming a PIC microcontroller, then Visual\nBasic is used in the construction of GUI, the RS-232 serial cable is used as a\nconnector between PIC and PC.
