Conventional LELELE type TPL technology\nsuffers from native conflict and overlapping problems. Recently, as an\nalternative process, triple patterning lithography with end cutting (LELE-EC)\nwas proposed to overcome the limitations of LELELE manufacturing. In LELE-EC\nprocess the first two masks are LELE type double patterning, while the third\nmask is used to generate the end-cuts. Although the layout decomposition\nproblem for LELELE has been well-studied in the literature, only few attempts\nhave been made to address the LELE-EC layout decomposition problem. In this\npaper we propose the comprehensive study for LELE-EC layout decomposition.\nConflict graph and end-cut graph are constructed to extract all the geometrical\nrelationships of both input layout and end-cut candidates. Based on these\ngraphs, integer linear programming (ILP) is formulated to minimize the conflict\nnumber and the stitch number. The experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Aug 2014 19:19:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Bei", ""], ["Roy", "Subhendu", ""], ["Gao", "Jhih-Rong", ""], ["Pan", "David Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0652", "submitter": "Guenther Brandner", "authors": "G\\\"unther Brandner, Johannes Klinglmayr, Udo Schilcher, Dominik\n  Egarter, Christian Bettstetter", "title": "Precision of Pulse-Coupled Oscillator Synchronization on FPGA-Based\n  Radios", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International ITG Conference on Systems, Communications and Coding\n  (SCC) 2015", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The precision of synchronization algorithms based on the theory of\npulse-coupled oscillators is evaluated on FPGA-based radios for the first time.\nMeasurements show that such algorithms can reach precision in the low\nmicrosecond range when being implemented in the physical layer.
