For this\ndata communication is performed between two modules using the concept of IPT.\nIPT was deemed to be the best solution to the system houses a multi parameter\nacquisition module such as temperature, speed, voltage, current and data\ntransfer from the motor. The receiver side is another microcontroller coupled\nto an inductive coil that gets the data and displays in the LCD. A brief\nbackground to IPT Inductive Power Transfer technology and its applications is\ngiven and the design criteria for the paper are defined in detail. To be\naccurate, IPT data communication helps to reduce unnecessary wire connections\nand data is transmitted without any touch. Further the paper can be enhanced by\nlooking for fault analysis inside the motor. This can be done by analyzing\nvarious parameters of the motor. A novel two-way IPT communication system was\ndesigned, which worked on the concept of pulsing the system on and off to send\ndata serially. The paper involves transmission of data through inductive flux\nwithout any contact between the two modules. Further as no frequency tunings or\nany calibration is required between different modules a single system can be\nused with multiple clients. This reduces a lot of hazards such as interference\nwith other modules and RF transmitters in the vicinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2013 05:34:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Shaji", "K.

Inherent\ndelays in the tracking system combined with typical high stiffness at contact\nchallenge the stability of the closed-loop system.

This paper is concerned with an analytical study of the system's\nclosed-loop stability, and with an experimental validation of the hybrid\nconcept of operations in one dimension (1D). The robotics simulator is modeled\nas a second-order loop-delay system and closed-form expressions for the\ncritical delay and associated frequency are derived as a function of the\nsatellites' mass and the contact dynamics stiffness and damping parameters. A\nnumerical illustration sheds light on the impact of the parameters on the\nstability regions. A first-order Pade approximation provides additional means\nof stability investigation.
