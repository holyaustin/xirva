Despite the ubiquity of these\nurban systems, aging infrastructure, and increased risk of terrorism, decision\nsupport models for a timely and adaptive contamination emergency response still\nremain at an undeveloped stage. Emergency response is characterized as a\nprogressive, interactive, and adaptive process that involves parallel\nactivities of processing streaming information and executing response actions.\nThis study develops a dynamic decision support model that adaptively simulates\nthe time-varying emergency environment and tracks changing best health\nprotection response measures at every stage of an emergency in real-time.\nFeedback mechanisms between the contaminated network, emergency managers, and\nconsumers are incorporated in a dynamic simulation model to capture\ntime-varying characteristics of an emergency environment. An\nevolutionary-computation-based dynamic optimization model is developed to\nadaptively identify time-dependant optimal health protection measures during an\nemergency. This dynamic simulation-optimization model treats perceived\ncontaminant source attributes as time-varying parameters to account for\nperceived contamination source updates as more data stream in over time.\nPerformance of the developed dynamic decision support model is analyzed and\ndemonstrated using a mid-size virtual city that resembles the dynamics and\ncomplexity of real-world urban systems. This adaptive emergency response\noptimization model is intended to be a major component of an all-inclusive\ncyberinfrastructure for efficient contamination threat management, which is\ncurrently under development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 23:08:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rasekh", "Amin", ""], ["Brumbelow", "Kelly", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0697", "submitter": "Anuradha Rana", "authors": "Anuradha Rana, Pratima Sharma", "title": "How to Track Online SLA", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  SLA (Service level agreement) is defined by an organization to fulfil its\nclient requirements, the time within which the deliverables should be turned\nover to the clients.

The\nfirst problem is the reconstruction of the angular-domain periodogram from\nspatial-domain signals received at different time indices. The second one is\nthe reconstruction of the frequency-domain periodogram from time-domain signals\nreceived at different wireless sensors. We split the entire angular or\nfrequency band into uniform bins. The bin size is set such that the received\nspectra at two frequencies or angles, whose distance is equal to or larger than\nthe size of a bin, are uncorrelated. These problems in the two different\ndomains lead to a similar circulant structure in the so-called coset\ncorrelation matrix. This circulant structure allows for a strong compression\nand a simple least-squares reconstruction method. The latter is possible under\nthe full column rank condition of the system matrix, which can be achieved by\ndesigning the spatial or temporal sampling patterns based on a circular sparse\nruler. We analyze the statistical performance of the compressively\nreconstructed periodogram including bias and variance. We further consider the\ncase when the bins are so small that the received spectra at two frequencies or\nangles, with a spacing between them larger than the size of the bin, can still\nbe correlated.
