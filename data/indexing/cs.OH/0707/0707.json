Our goal is to obtain a high\nquality reconstruction of the field, with the mean square error (MSE) of the\nestimate as performance metric. In particular, we analytically derive the\nperformance of several reconstruction/estimation techniques based on linear\nfiltering. For each technique, we obtain the MSE, as well as its asymptotic\nexpression in the case where the field number of harmonics and the number of\nsensors grow to infinity, while their ratio is kept constant. Through numerical\nsimulations, we show the validity of the asymptotic analysis, even for a small\nnumber of sensors. We provide some novel guidelines for the design of sensor\nnetworks when many parameters, such as field bandwidth, number of sensors,\nreconstruction quality, sensor motion characteristics, and noise level of the\nmeasures, have to be traded off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2007 14:58:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nordio", "A.", ""], ["Chiasserini", "C. -F.", ""], ["Viterbo", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.1954", "submitter": "Alessandro Nordio", "authors": "A.

On the other hand, the paper\nprovides a bunch of useful techniques, most of which stemming from some key\nproperties of CPs, for designing the proposed filters in a variety of\narchitectures.
