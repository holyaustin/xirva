Although there are methods for visualizing\nthe solutions in the design space, they do not provide any information about\ntheir relationship. In this work, we propose a novel methodology that allows\nthe visualization of the non-dominated solutions in the design space and their\nrelationships by means of a network. The nodes represent the solutions in the\nobjective space, while the edges show the relationships between the solutions\nin the design space. Our proposal (called moGrams) thus provides a joint\nvisualization of both objective and design spaces. It aims at helping the\ndecision maker to get more understanding of the problem so that (s)he can\nchoose the more appropriate final solution. moGrams can be applied to any\nmulticriteria problem in which the solutions are related by a similarity\nmetric. Besides, the decision maker interaction is facilitated by modifying the\nnetwork based on the current preferences to obtain a clearer view. An\nexhaustive experimental study is performed using three multiobjective problems\nin order to show both the usefulness and versatility of moGrams. The results\nexhibit interesting characteristics of our methodology for visualizing and\nanalyzing solutions of multiobjective problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 12:11:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Trawi\u0144ski", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Chica", "Manuel", ""], ["Pancho", "David P.", ""], ["Damas", "Sergio", ""], ["Cord\u00f3n", "Oscar", ""]]}]
