A time interleaved A to D converter system is an\neffective way to implement a high sampling rate ADC with relatively slow\ncircuits. This paper analyses the benefits and derives an upper band on the\nperformance by considering kT/C noise and slewing requirement of the circuit\ndriving the system. In the system, several channel ADCs operate at interleaved\nsampling times as if they were effectively a single ADC operating at a much\nhigher sampling rate. A timing mismatch calibration technique is proposed that\ncovers linear and non linear channel mismatches, unifies, and extends the\nchannel models. A novel foreground channel mismatch identification method has\nbeen developed, which can be used to fully characterize dynamic linear\nmismatches. A background identification method provides accurate timing\nmismatch estimates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Apr 2014 06:25:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Rajiv", ""], ["Gupta", "Rakesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.6508", "submitter": "Guoru Ding", "authors": "Guoru Ding, Qihui Wu, Jinlong Wang, and Yu-Dong Yao", "title": "Big Spectrum Data: The New Resource for Cognitive Wireless Networking", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The era of Big Data is here now, which has brought both unprecedented\nopportunities and critical challenges.

Towards the\ndevelopment of a smart grid, utilities and governments across the world are\nencouraging smart meter deployments. High resolution (often at every 15\nminutes) data from these smart meters can be used to understand and optimize\nenergy consumptions in buildings. In addition to smart meters, buildings are\nalso increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control\ndifferent sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air\nconditioning (HVAC). With the advent of these smart meters, increased usage of\nBMS and easy availability and widespread installation of ambient sensors, there\nis a deluge of building energy data. This data has been leveraged for a variety\nof applications such as demand response, appliance fault detection and\noptimizing HVAC schedules. Beyond the traditional use of such data sets, they\ncan be put to effective use towards making buildings smarter and hence driving\nevery possible bit of energy efficiency. Effective use of this data entails\nseveral critical areas from sensing to decision making and participatory\ninvolvement of occupants. Picking from wide literature in building energy\nefficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for\nrealizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally;\nii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve\noccupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5\nIs and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them.\nBuilding upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy\nefficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area\nspans across the 5 Is.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 03:45:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 02:04:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 21:53:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Batra", "Nipun", ""], ["Singh", "Amarjeet", ""], ["Singh", "Pushpendra", ""], ["Dutta", "Haimonti", ""], ["Sarangan", "Venkatesh", ""], ["Srivastava", "Mani", ""]]}]
