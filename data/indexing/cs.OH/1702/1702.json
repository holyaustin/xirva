While\nmulti-level approaches, surgical process modeling and other workflow analysis\nmethods exist, this is to our knowledge the first quantitative approach.\nMethods: Inspired by the group decision making problem from the field of\noperational research, we define event impact factors, which combine independent\nand very diverse low-level functions. This allows us to rate surgical events by\ntheir importance. Results: We conducted surveys with 4 surgeons to determine\nthe importance of roles, phases and their combinations within a laparoscopic\ncholecystectomy. Applying this data on a recorded surgery, we showed that it is\npossible to define a quantitative measure for deciding on acception or\nrejection of calls to different roles and at different phases of surgery.\nConclusions: This methodology allows us to use components such as expertise and\nrole of the surgical staff and other aspects of a given surgery in order to\nquantitatively analyze and evaluate events, actions, user interfaces or\nprocedures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 08:44:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Okur", "Asli", ""], ["Stauder", "Ralf", ""], ["Feussner", "Hubertus", ""], ["Navab", "Nassir", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00650", "submitter": "Tom Van Steenkiste", "authors": "Tom Van Steenkiste, Joachim van der Herten, Ivo Couckuyt, Tom Dhaene", "title": "Sensitivity Analysis of Expensive Black-Box Systems Using Metamodeling", "comments": "proceedings of winter simulation conference 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/WSC.2016.7822123", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Simulations are becoming ever more common as a tool for designing complex\nproducts.

A method is also\ndescribed to validate cluster membership of identified ambiguous potential\noutliers. Using the 2006 NLEX Balintawak Northbound (BLK-NB) data set, we were\nable to identify two absolute potential outliers, nine valid potential\noutliers, and five ambiguous potential outliers.
