Our idea is to develop a portable wireless music player and text\nreader using a Cortex-M series microcontroller and bare-metal programming\ntechniques. We chose to use an SD card as the storage device. The resulting\nelectronic device is similar to a consumer grade music player available in a\ncar. The system comprises an MCU, an MP3 encoder/decoder, an LCD, an audio\noutput jack, an SD card and a remote control. We also present various\nchallenges involved in developing the system and solutions we used to overcome\nthe challenges. The intricacy of the work lies in the fact that the system was\ndeveloped to be consumer-centric by providing a rich User Experience.

Recorded Sentinel-1 data have shown a potential for\nremotely observing and monitoring local conditions on broad acre fields. Remote\nsensing using Sentinel-1 have the potential to provide daily updates on the\ncurrent conditions in the individual fields and at the same time give an\noverview of the agricultural areas in the region. Research depends on the\nability of independent validation of the presented results. In the case of the\nSentinel-1 satellites, every researcher has access to the same base dataset,\nand therefore independent validation is possible. Well documented research\nperformed with Sentinel-1 allow other research the ability to redo the\nexperiments and either validate or falsify presented findings. Based on current\nstate-of-art research we have chosen to provide a service for researchers in\nthe agricultural domain. The service allows researchers the ability to monitor\nlocal conditions by using the Sentinel-1 information combined with a priori\nknowledge from broad acre fields. Correlating processed Sentinel-1 to the\nactual conditions is still a task the individual researchers must perform to\nbenefit from the service. In this paper, we presented our methodology in\ntranslating sentinel-1 data to a level that is more accessible to researchers\nin the agricultural field. The goal here was to make the data more easily\navailable, so the primary focus can be on correlating and comparing to\nmeasurements collected in the broadacre fields.

Growing complexity of such composite model leads to the\nneed of specific approaches for management of such model. This need extends\nwhere the model itself becomes a complex system. One of the important aspects\nof complex model management is dealing with the uncertainty of various kinds\n(context, parametric, structural, input/output) to control the model.
