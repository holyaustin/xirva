In this paper, this optimization\ntechnique is used for designing fractional order PID controllers that give\nbetter performance than their integer order counterparts. Controller synthesis\nis based on required peak overshoot and rise time specifications. The\ncharacteristic equation is minimized to obtain an optimum set of controller\nparameters. Results show that this design method can effectively tune the\nparameters of the fractional order controller.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Oct 2008 09:06:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Maiti", "Deepyaman", ""], ["Biswas", "Sagnik", ""], ["Konar", "Amit", ""]]}]
