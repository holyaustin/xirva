One of the concepts for achieving this\nrequirement is the design of resilient and survivable digital embedded systems.\nIn the last two decades, development of self-healing digital systems based on\nmolecular and cellular biology have received attention for the design of robust\ndigital systems. However, many of these approaches have not been architected\nfrom the outset with safety in mind, nor have they been targeted for the\napplications of automation community where a significant need exists. This\npaper presents a new self-healing hardware architecture, inspired from the way\nnature responds, defends and heals: the stem cells in the immune system of\nliving organisms, the life cycle of the living cell, and the pathway from\nDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to protein. The proposed architecture is\nintegrating cellular-based biological concepts, traditional fault tolerance\ntechniques, and operational schematics for the international standard IEC\n61131-3 to facilitate adoption in the automation industry and safety-critical\napplications. To date, two industrial applications have been mapped on the\nproposed architecture, which are capable of tolerating a significant number of\nfaults that can stem from harsh environmental changes and external disturbances\nand we believe the nexus of its concepts can positively impact the next\ngeneration of critical systems in the automation industry\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 19:32:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Khairullah", "Shawkat Sabah", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00475", "submitter": "\\\"Ozg\\\"ur Akg\\\"un", "authors": "\\\"Ozg\\\"ur Akg\\\"un, Andr\\'as Salamon", "title": "Conjure Documentation, Release 2.3.0", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Conjure is an automated modelling tool for Constraint Programming.

Mutation in the BRAF\nserine/threonine kinase is the most frequent genetic alteration in thyroid\ncancer. Target therapy for advanced and poorly differentiated thyroid\ncarcinomas include BRAF pathway inhibitors. Here, we evaluated the role of\nMAP3K8 expression as a potential driver of resistance to BRAF inhibition in\nthyroid cancer. By analyzing Gene Expression Omnibus data repository, across\nall thyroid cancer histotypes, we found that MAP3K8 is up-regulated in poorly\ndifferentiated thyroid carcinomas and its expression is related to a stem cell\nlike phenotype and a poorer prognosis and survival. Taken together these data\nunravel a novel mechanism for thyroid cancer progression and chemo-resistance\nand confirm previous results obtained in cultured thyroid cancer stem cells\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Oct 2019 12:42:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Di Salvatore", "Valentina", ""], ["Gian\u00ec", "Fiorenza", ""], ["Russo", "Giulia", ""], ["Pennisi", "Marzio", ""], ["Malandrino", "Pasqualino", ""], ["Frasca", "Francesco", ""], ["Pappalardo", "Francesco", ""]]}]
