The primary advantage of this methodology is that it\nenables rapid porting of directed tests to new targets and derivatives, with\nonly a minimum amount of code refactoring. As a consequence, considerable\nverification development time and effort was saved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2007 12:25:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Macbeth", "John S.", ""], ["Heinz", "Dietmar", ""], ["Gray", "Ken", ""]]}]
