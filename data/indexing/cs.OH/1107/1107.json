The new methodology is illustrated by applying\nit to the design of a resistively-loaded bowtie antenna and to two broadband\nYagi-Uda arrays. Variable Zo is applicable to any antenna design or\noptimization methodology. Using it will result in generally better antenna\ndesigns across any user-specified set of performance objectives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 16:01:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2011 15:34:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Formato", "Richard A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3217", "submitter": "Dimple Juneja Dr.", "authors": "Harjit Singh Lamba and Gurdev Singh", "title": "Cloud Computing Future Framework for e-management of NGO's", "comments": "Eight pages,Three figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Cloud computing is an emerging new computing paradigm for delivering\ncomputing services.

As feed drives are one part of the set Machine tool - Numerical\nController, it is necessary to improve their performances to optimize feed\ndrive dynamics during trajectory follow up. Hence, this paper deals with the\nmodelling of the feed drive in the case of multi axis machining. This model can\nbe used for the simulation of axis dynamics and tool-path tracking to tune\nparameters and optimize new frameworks of command strategies. A procedure of\nidentification based on modern NC capabilities is presented and applied to\nindustrial HSM centres. Efficiency of this modelling is assessed by\nexperimental verifications on various representative trajectories. After\nimplementing a Generalized Predictive Control, reliable simulations are\nperformed thanks to the model. These simulations can then be used to tune\nparameters of this new framework according to the tool-path geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2011 12:58:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Pr\u00e9vost", "David", "", "LURPA"], ["Lavernhe", "Sylvain", "", "LURPA"], ["Lartigue", "Claire", "", "LURPA"], ["Dumur", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3541", "submitter": "Sylvain Lavernhe", "authors": "Lo\\\"ic Andolfatto (LURPA), Sylvain Lavernhe (LURPA), Ren\\'e Mayer\n  (LRFV)", "title": "Evaluation of servo, geometric and dynamic error sources on five axis\n  high-speed machine tool", "comments": "13 pages; International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture\n  (2011) pp XX-XX", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many sources of errors exist in the manufacturing process of complex shapes.\nSome approximations occur at each step from the design geometry to the machined\npart.

The machine encoder signals are also compared to the actual\ntool center point position as recorded with a non-contact measuring instrument\ncalled CapBall to evaluate the total geometric errors. The novelty of the work\nlies in the method that is proposed to decompose the geometric errors in two\ncategories: the quasi-static geometric errors independent from the speed of the\ntrajectory and the dynamic geometric errors, dependent on the programmed feed\nrate and resulting from the machine structure deflection during the\nacceleration of its axes. The evolution of the respective contributions for\ncontouring errors, quasi-static geometric errors and dynamic geomet- ric errors\nis experimentally evaluated and a relation between programmed feed rate and\ndynamic errors is highlighted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 19:44:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Andolfatto", "Lo\u00efc", "", "LURPA"], ["Lavernhe", "Sylvain", "", "LURPA"], ["Mayer", "Ren\u00e9", "", "LRFV"]]}]
