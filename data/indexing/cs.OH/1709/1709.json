We explicitly borrow from the conclusions in some key chapters and\nintroduce them by a reflection on \"incompleteness\", also proposed in the book.\nWe consider that incompleteness is a fundamental notion to understand the way\nin which we construct knowledge. Then we will introduce an approach to\nbiological dynamics where randomness is central to the theoretical\ndetermination: randomness does not oppose biological stability but contributes\nto it by variability, adaptation, and diversity. Then, evolutionary and\nontogenetic trajectories are continual changes of coherence structures\ninvolving symmetry changes within an ever-changing global stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 13:24:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 20:14:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Longo", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Mont\u00e9vil", "Ma\u00ebl", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06005", "submitter": "J\\\"urgen Hackl", "authors": "J\\\"urgen Hackl", "title": "TikZ-network manual", "comments": "Version 1.0", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  TikZ-network is an open source software project for visualizing graphs and\nnetworks in LaTeX.
