We also observe fluctuations of the path loss caused by the\ninhomogeneity of the human body. In comparison with the path loss measured with\nmonopole antennas, we conclude that the significant variations in Received\nSignal Strength is caused by both the angular dependent path loss and the\nsignificantly modified in vivo antenna effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 00:04:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yang", ""], ["Ketterl", "Thomas P.", ""], ["Arrobo", "Gabriel E.", ""], ["Gitlin", "Richard D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8021", "submitter": "C.

The\ncushion comprises of an integrated micro-bending fiber sensor, which records\nthe BCG (Ballistocardiogram) signal without direct skin-electrode contact, and\nan optical transceiver that does signal amplification, digitization, and\npre-filtering. To remove the artifacts and extract heart rate from BCG signal,\na computationally efficient heart rate detection algorithm is developed. The\nsystem doesn't require any pre-training and is highly responsive with the\noutputs updated every 3 sec and initial response within first 10 sec. Tests\nconducted on human subjects show the detected heart rate closely matches the\none from a commercial SpO2 device.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 08:24:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Deepu", "Chacko John", ""], ["Chen", "Zhihao", ""], ["Teo", "Ju Teng", ""], ["Ng", "Soon Huat", ""], ["Yang", "Xiefeng", ""], ["Lian", "Yong", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8227", "submitter": "Yury Kirienko", "authors": "D.

We develop a novel hybrid maximum likelihood (HML)\nclassification scheme based on a generalized expectation maximization (GEM)\nalgorithm. GEM is capable of finding ML estimates numerically that are\nextremely hard to obtain otherwise. Assuming a good initialization technique is\navailable for GEM, we show that the classification performance can be greatly\nimproved with multiple sensors compared to that with a single sensor,\nespecially when the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is low. We further demonstrate\nthe superior performance of our approach when simulated annealing (SA) with\nuniform as well as nonuniform grids is employed for initialization of GEM in\nlow SNR regions. The proposed GEM based approach employs only a small number of\nsamples (in the order of hundreds) at a given sensor node to perform both time\nand phase synchronization, signal power estimation, followed by modulation\nclassification. We provide simulation results to show the computational\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 03:01:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 22:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ozdemir", "O.", ""], ["Wimalajeewa", "T.", ""], ["Dulek", "B.", ""], ["Varshney", "P.
