The Operating\nSystem performs online task scheduling and handles resource management. There\nare many challenges in adaptive computing and dynamic reconfigurable systems.\nOne of the major understudied challenges is estimating the required resources\nin terms of soft cores, Programmable Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs), the\nappropriate communication infrastructure, and to predict a near optimal layout\nand floorplan of the reconfigurable logic fabric.
