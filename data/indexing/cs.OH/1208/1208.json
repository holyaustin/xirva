This is deemed significant\nas yet little research has tackled this important domain from the business\nintelligence perspective. The D&M IS Success Model was used as a foundational\ntheory and then was refined to match the context of the current research.\nImportantly, in this study, system quality and information quality constructs\nwere defined on the basis of portals' characteristics since a mapping was\nconducted between the most significant functions and features of Web portals\nand quality constructs. The developed framework is deemed useful for theory and\npractice. From theoretical perspective, the dimensions that affect the\nperceived quality of Web portals are identified, and the measures that affect\neach quality dimension are also defined. On the practical level, contributions\ngained by this study can be observed in terms of the benefits decision makers,\nstrategists, operational employees and IT developers can gain. Assessing\nportals success in improving task innovation is important to help managers\n(i.e. decision makers) in making appropriate decisions concerning the adoption\nof portals' technology, by weighing its benefits against the costs needed to\nestablish and run such a technology. Moreover, assessing Web portals' success\ngives some insight to IT developers and designers concerning what aspects\nshould be taken when designing and establishing high quality portals, and what\nfunctions and features should be contained that would affect the perceived\nquality of portals and therefore users' intention to use portals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Aug 2012 05:31:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Jalal", "Dima", ""], ["Al-Debei", "Mutaz M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0944", "submitter": "Nader Ale Ebrahim", "authors": "Nader Ale Ebrahim, Shamsuddin Ahmed, Zahari Taha", "title": "Establishing Virtual R&D Teams: Obliged Policy", "comments": "6th IMC (International Management Conference).
