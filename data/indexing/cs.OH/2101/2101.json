In this paper, we discuss scheduling a single-server\nsystem when exact information about the jobs' processing times is not\navailable. When the SRPT policy uses estimated processing times, the\nunderestimation of large jobs can significantly degrade performance. We propose\na simple heuristic, Size Estimate Hedging (SEH), that only uses jobs' estimated\nprocessing times for scheduling decisions. A job's priority is increased\ndynamically according to an SRPT rule until it is determined that it is\nunderestimated, at which time the priority is frozen. Numerical results suggest\nthat SEH has desirable performance when estimation errors are not unreasonably\nlarge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:25:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:21:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2021 14:28:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 01:50:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Akbari-Moghaddam", "Maryam", ""], ["Down", "Douglas G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03111", "submitter": "Mihai Nadin", "authors": "Mihai Nadin", "title": "Foresight AND Hindsight", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  To model is to represent.

In this paper, we\npropose a data processing system to generate space-centric insights about the\nutilization of an urban residential region of multiple points of interest\n(PoIs) that consists of 190,000m$^2$ real estate. We identify the activeness of\neach PoI based on the spectral clustering, and then study their corresponding\nstatic features, which are composed of transportation, commercial facilities,\npopulation density, along with other characteristics.
