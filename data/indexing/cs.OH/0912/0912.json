Especially among the academic works,\nsuch issue will definitely affect the student's works including the quality of\ntheir assignments and paper works. In this paper, we propose a new approach in\ndetecting cross language plagiarism. Our web based cross language plagiarism\ndetection system is specially tuned to detect translation plagiarism by\nimplementing different techniques and tools to assist the detection process.\nGoogle Translate API is used as our translation tool and Google Search API,\nwhich is used in our information retrieval process. Our system is also\nintegrated with the fingerprint matching technique, which is a widely used\nplagiarism detection technique. In general, our proposed system is started by\ntranslating the input documents from Malay to English, followed by removal of\nstop words and stemming words, identification of similar documents in corpus,\ncomparison of similar pattern and finally summary of the result. Three\nleast-frequent 4-grams fingerprint matching is used to implement the core\ncomparison phase during the plagiarism detection process. In K-gram fingerprint\nmatching technique, although any value of K can be considered, yet K = 4 was\nstated as an ideal choice. This is because smaller values of K (i.e., K = 1, 2,\nor 3), do not provide good discrimination between sentences. On the other hand,\nthe larger the values of K (i.e., K = 5, 6, 7...etc), the better discrimination\nof words in one sentence from words in another.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2009 02:19:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kent", "Chow Kok", ""], ["Salim", "Naomie", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3962", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "G.
