A task generates jobs that can be\ngiven arbitrary service times before their deadlines. A task then obtains\nrewards based on the service times received by its jobs. We show that this\nmodel is compatible to the imprecise computation models and the increasing\nreward with increasing service models. In contrast to previous work on these\nmodels, which mainly focus on maximize the total reward in the system, we aim\nto fulfill different reward requirements by different tasks, which offers\nbetter fairness and allows fine-grained tradeoff between tasks. We first derive\na necessary and sufficient condition for a system, along with reward\nrequirements of tasks, to be feasible. We also obtain an off-line feasibility\noptimal scheduling policy. We then studies a sufficient condition for a policy\nto be feasibility optimal or achieves some approximation bound. This condition\ncan serve as a guideline for designing on-line scheduling policy and we obtains\na greedy policy based on it. We prove that the on-line policy is feasibility\noptimal when all tasks have the same periods and also obtain an approximation\nbound for the policy under general cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 01:31:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "I-Hong", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

The system implementation, using the universal software radio peripheral\n(USRP) and GNU Radio, is described and compared to previous work.

A key to the development of protocols for\ninter-vehicle communication and services lies in the knowledge of the\ntopological characteristics of the VANET communication graph. This paper\nexplores the dynamics of VANETs in urban environments and investigates the\nimpact of these findings in the design of VANET routing protocols. Using both\nreal and realistic mobility traces, we study the networking shape of VANETs\nunder different transmission and market penetration ranges. Given that a number\nof RSUs have to be deployed for disseminating information to vehicles in an\nurban area, we also study their impact on vehicular connectivity.
