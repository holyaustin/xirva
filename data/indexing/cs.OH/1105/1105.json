A solution to overcome this problem is to design\nthe beamforming vector using a limited number of feedback bits sent from the\nreceiver to the transmitter. In the case of limited feedback, the beamforming\nvector is limited to lie in a codebook that is known to both the transmitter\nand receiver.When the feedback is strictly limited, important issues are how to\nquantize the information needed at the transmitter and how much improvement in\nassociated performance can be obtained as a function of the amount of feedback\navailable.In this paper channel quantization schema using simple approach to\ncodebook design (random vector quantization)is illustrated.

These evolutions, combined with High Speed Machining (HSM) process of\nforging die lead to important increase in time for machining preparation. In\nthis context, an original approach for generating machining process based on\nmachining knowledge is proposed in this paper. The core of this approach is to\ndecompose a CAD model of complex forging die in geometric features.\nTechnological data and topological relations are aggregated to a geometric\nfeature in order to create machining features. Technological data, such as\nmaterial, surface roughness and form tolerance are defined during forging\nprocess and dies design. These data are used to choose cutting tools and\nmachining strategies. Topological relations define relative positions between\nthe surfaces of the die CAD model. After machining features identification\ncutting tools and machining strategies currently used in HSM of forging die,\nare associated to them in order to generate machining sequences. A machining\nprocess model is proposed to formalize the links between information imbedded\nin the machining features and the parameters of cutting tools and machining\nstrategies. At last machining sequences are grouped and ordered to generate the\ncomplete die machining process. In this paper the identification of geometrical\nfeatures is detailed. Geometrical features identification is based on machining\nknowledge formalization which is translated in the generation of maps from STL\nmodels. A map based on the contact area between cutting tools and die shape\ngives basic geometrical features which are connected or not according to the\ncontinuity maps. The proposed approach is illustrated by an application on an\nindustrial study case which was accomplished as part of collaboration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 07:55:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Mawussi", "Kwamiwi", "", "LURPA"], ["Tapie", "Laurent Pierre", "", "LURPA"]]}, {"id": "1105.5275", "submitter": "Nelly Pustelnik", "authors": "Nelly Pustelnik, Jean-Christophe Pesquet, Caroline Chaux", "title": "Relaxing Tight Frame Condition in Parallel Proximal Methods for Signal\n  Restoration", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2011.2173684", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A fruitful approach for solving signal deconvolution problems consists of\nresorting to a frame-based convex variational formulation. In this context,\nparallel proximal algorithms and related alternating direction methods of\nmultipliers have become popular optimization techniques to approximate\niteratively the desired solution. Until now, in most of these methods, either\nLipschitz differentiability properties or tight frame representations were\nassumed. In this paper, it is shown that it is possible to relax these\nassumptions by considering a class of non necessarily tight frame\nrepresentations, thus offering the possibility of addressing a broader class of\nsignal restoration problems. In particular, it is possible to use non\nnecessarily maximally decimated filter banks with perfect reconstruction, which\nare common tools in digital signal processing. The proposed approach allows us\nto solve both frame analysis and frame synthesis problems for various noise\ndistributions. In our simulations, it is applied to the deconvolution of data\ncorrupted with Poisson noise or Laplacian noise by using (non-tight) discrete\ndual-tree wavelet representations and filter bank structures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 15:00:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:41:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2011 16:15:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 18 Dec 2011 17:03:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pustelnik", "Nelly", ""], ["Pesquet", "Jean-Christophe", ""], ["Chaux", "Caroline", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5875", "submitter": "Youlia Buldakova V.", "authors": "Yulia V.
