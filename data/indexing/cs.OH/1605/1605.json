Such domains are represented by graphs, for which\none can compute a particular matrix, called the normalized Laplacian. It was\nshown that the eigenvalues of this Laplacian correspond to the frequencies of\nthe Fourier domain in classical signal processing. Therefore, the frequency\ndomain is not the same for every support graph. A consequence of this is that\nthere is no non-trivial generalization of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,\nthat states that a signal cannot be fully localized both in the time domain and\nin the frequency domain. A way to generalize this principle, introduced by\nAgaskar and Lu, consists in determining a curve that represents a lower bound\non the compromise between precision in the graph domain and precision in the\nspectral domain. The aim of this paper is to propose a characterization of the\nsignals achieving this curve, for a larger class of graphs than the one studied\nby Agaskar and Lu.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 07:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pasdeloup", "Bastien", ""], ["Gripon", "Vincent", ""], ["Mercier", "Gr\u00e9goire", ""], ["Pastor", "Dominique", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.01302", "submitter": "Di Liu", "authors": "Di Liu, Jelena Spasic, Gang Chen, Nan Guan, Songran Liu, Todor\n  Stefanov, Wang Yi", "title": "EDF-VD Scheduling of Mixed-Criticality Systems with Degraded Quality\n  Guarantees", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/RTSS.2016.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies real-time scheduling of mixed-criticality systems where\nlow-criticality tasks are still guaranteed some service in the high-criticality\nmode, with reduced execution budgets.
