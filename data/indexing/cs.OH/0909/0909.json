We found that some difficulties in physics and mathematics are in fact\nintroduced by infinity, which can not be rightly expressed by minds. Based on\nthis point, we suggest a general observation system, where we use region (a\ntype of infinity) to substitute for infinitesimal (another type of infinity)\nand thus get a consistent image with the mind. Furthermore, we declare that\nwithout world pictures we can never have ideas to any expressive events, which\nis the primary condition for a wave function like mind to collapse to a series\nof numbers. A following observation by expanding algorithm brings the final\ncollapse: classifying the numbers and coming up with a certain yes or no\nanswer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 13:51:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2010 13:39:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hsiao", "Ching-an", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2318", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Gr\\'egoire Chevreau, Jocelyne Troccaz (TIMC), Pierre Conort,\n  Rapha\\\"elle Renard-Penna, Alain Mallet, Michel Daudon (CRISTAL), Pierre Mozer", "title": "Estimation of urinary stone composition by automated processing of CT\n  images", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Urological Research (2009) epub ahead of print", "doi": "10.1007/s00240-009-0195-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The objective of this article was developing an automated tool for routine\nclinical practice to estimate urinary stone composition from CT images based on\nthe density of all constituent voxels. A total of 118 stones for which the\ncomposition had been determined by infrared spectroscopy were placed in a\nhelical CT scanner. A standard acquisition, low-dose and high-dose acquisitions\nwere performed. All voxels constituting each stone were automatically selected.\nA dissimilarity index evaluating variations of density around each voxel was\ncreated in order to minimize partial volume effects: stone composition was\nestablished on the basis of voxel density of homogeneous zones. Stone\ncomposition was determined in 52% of cases. Sensitivities for each compound\nwere: uric acid: 65%, struvite: 19%, cystine: 78%, carbapatite: 33.5%, calcium\noxalate dihydrate: 57%, calcium oxalate monohydrate: 66.5%, brushite: 75%.\nLow-dose acquisition did not lower the performances (P < 0.05).

The prostate tracking systems\npresented so far are limited to rigid transformation tracking.
