The objectives of this project are to produce and demonstrate the\nefficiency of the passive cooling technology (heat pipe) integrated in a very\nthin electronic substrate that is a part of a multifunctional 3-D electronic\npackage. The enhanced technology is dedicated to the thermal management of high\ndissipative microsystems having heat densities of more than 10W/cm2. Future\napplications are envisaged in the avionics sector. In this research 2D\nnumerical hydraulic model has been developed to investigate the performance of\na very thin flat micro heat pipe with sintered copper wick structure, using\nwater as a refrigerant. Finite difference method has been used to develop the\nmodel. The model has been used to determine the mass transfer and fluid flow in\norder to evaluate the limits of heat transport capacity as functions of the\ndimensions of the wick and the vapour space and for various copper spheres\nradii. The results are presented in terms of liquid and vapour pressures within\nthe heat pipe. The simulated results are validated by experiments and proved\nthat the method can be further used to predict thermal performance of the heat\npipe and to optimise its design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2008 13:46:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tzanova", "S.", "", "CIME"], ["Kamenova", "L.", "", "CIME"], ["Avenas", "Y.", "", "CIME"], ["Schaeffer", "Ch.", "", "CIME"]]}, {"id": "0802.3767", "submitter": "EDA Publishing Association", "authors": "H.

Fu\net al. in the context of orthogonal frequency-division multiple-access (OFDMA)\nnetworks based on the IEEE 802.16e-2005 standard. The proposed solution aims at\nestimating the power levels and timing offsets of the ranging subscriber\nstations (RSSs) without taking into account the effect of possible carrier\nfrequency offsets (CFOs) between the received signals and the base station\nlocal reference. Motivated by the above problem, in the present work we design\na novel ranging scheme for OFDMA in which the ranging signals are assumed to be\nmisaligned both in time and frequency. Our goal is to estimate the timing\nerrors and CFOs of each active RSS. Specifically, CFO estimation is\naccomplished by resorting to subspacebased methods while a least-squares\napproach is employed for timing recovery. Computer simulations are used to\nassess the effectiveness of the proposed solution and to make comparisons with\nexisting alternatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Feb 2008 20:09:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sanguinetti", "Luca", ""], ["Morelli", "Michele", ""], ["Poor", "H.
