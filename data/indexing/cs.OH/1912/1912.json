To capture the\nunderpinning physics, tracers are introduced to make a supplement to discrete\nBoltzmann simulation of RTI in compressible flows. Via marking two types of\ntracers with different colors, the tracer distribution provides a clear\nboundary of two fluids during the RTI evolution. Fine structures of the flow\nand thermodynamic nonequilibrium behavior around the interface in a miscible\ntwo-fluid system are delineated. Distribution of tracers in its velocity phase\nspace makes a charming pattern showing quite dense information on the flow\nbehavior, which opens a new perspective for analyzing and accessing\nsignificantly deep insights into the flow system. RTI mixing is further\ninvestigated via tracer defined local mixedness. The appearance of\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability is quantitatively captured by mixedness averaged\nalign the direction of the pressure gradient. The role of compressibility and\nviscosity on mixing are investigated separately, both of which show two-stage\neffect. The underlying mechanism of the two-stage effect is interpreted as the\ndevelopment of large structures at the initial stage and the generation of\nsmall structures at the late stage. At the late stage, for a fixed time, a\nsaturation phenomenon of viscosity is found that further increase of viscosity\ncannot see an evident decline in mixedness. The mixing statues of heavy and\nlight fluids are not synchronous and the mixing of a RTI system is\nheterogenous. The results are helpful for understanding the mechanism of flow\nand mixing induced by RTI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 05:40:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2021 10:20:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Ge", ""], ["Xu", "Aiguo", ""], ["Zhang", "Dejia", ""], ["Li", "Yingjun", ""], ["Lai", "Huilin", ""], ["Hu", "Xiaomian", ""]]}]
