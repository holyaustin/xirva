Recently, many different novel NILM approaches were\nintroduced, tested on real-world data and evaluated with a common evaluation\nmetric. However, the fair comparison between different NILM approaches even\nwith the usage of the same evaluation metric is nearly impossible due to\nincomplete or missing problem definitions. Each NILM approach typically is\nevaluated under different test scenarios. Test results are thus influenced by\nthe considered appliances, the number of used appliances, the device type\nrepresenting the appliance and the pre-processing stages denoising the\nconsumption data. This paper introduces a novel complexity measure of\naggregated consumption data providing an assessment of the problem complexity\naffected by the used appliances, the appliance characteristics and the\nappliance usage over time. We test our load disaggregation complexity on\ndifferent real-world datasets and with a state-of-the-art NILM approach. The\nintroduced disaggregation complexity measure is able to classify the\ndisaggregation problem based on the used appliance set and the considered\nmeasurement noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 11:09:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Egarter", "Dominik", ""], ["P\u00f6chacker", "Manfred", ""], ["Elmenreich", "Wilfried", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05581", "submitter": "Daniele Riboni", "authors": "Daniele Riboni, Claudio Bettini, Gabriele Civitarese, Zaffar Haider\n  Janjua, Rim Helaoui", "title": "Extended Report: Fine-grained Recognition of Abnormal Behaviors for\n  Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  According to the World Health Organization, the rate of people aged 60 or\nmore is growing faster than any other age group in almost every country, and\nthis trend is not going to change in a near future. Since senior citizens are\nat high risk of non communicable diseases requiring long-term care, this trend\nwill challenge the sustainability of the entire health system. Pervasive\ncomputing can provide innovative methods and tools for early detecting the\nonset of health issues. In this paper we propose a novel method to detect\nabnormal behaviors of elderly people living at home. The method relies on\nmedical models, provided by cognitive neuroscience researchers, describing\nabnormal activity routines that may indicate the onset of early symptoms of\nmild cognitive impairment. A non-intrusive sensor-based infrastructure acquires\nlow-level data about the interaction of the individual with home appliances and\nfurniture, as well as data from environmental sensors. Based on those data, a\nnovel hybrid statistical-symbolical technique is used to detect the abnormal\nbehaviors of the patient, which are communicated to the medical center.\nDifferently from related works, our method can detect abnormal behaviors at a\nfine-grained level, thus providing an important tool to support the medical\ndiagnosis. In order to evaluate our method we have developed a prototype of the\nsystem and acquired a large dataset of abnormal behaviors carried out in an\ninstrumented smart home.

In this paper, we propose SparseS-XCorr: cross-correlation via\nstructured sparse representation, a new computing framework for ranging based\non L1-minimization and structured sparsity. The key idea is to compress the\nranging signal samples on the mote by efficient random projections and transfer\nthem to a central device; where a convex optimization process estimates the\nrange by exploiting the sparse signal structure in the proposed correlation\ndictionary. Through theoretical validation, extensive empirical studies and\nexperiments on an end-to-end acoustic ranging system implemented on resource\nlimited off-the-shelf sensor nodes, we show that the proposed framework can\nachieve up to two orders of magnitude better performance compared to other\napproaches such as working on DCT domain and downsampling. Compared to the\nstandard cross-correlation, it is able to obtain range estimates with a bias of\n2-6cm with 30% and approximately 100cm with 5% compressed measurements. Its\nstructured sparsity model is able to improve the ranging accuracy by 40% under\nchallenging recovery conditions (such as high compression factor and low\nsignal-to-noise ratio) by overcoming limitations due to dictionary coherence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 16:38:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 10:08:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 05:21:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Misra", "Prasant", ""], ["Hu", "Wen", ""], ["Yang", "Mingrui", ""], ["Duarte", "Marco", ""], ["Jha", "Sanjay", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06802", "submitter": "Gamal Abd El-Nasser A.
