The obtained cluster\nranges are evaluated according to the reference level proposed by the TCO\nstandard in order to define dangerous areas in the neighborhood of tablet,\nwhich are established during the typical work with tablet computers.

Modeling and\npredicting city traffic flow remains to be a challenge task and the main\ndifficulties are how to specify the supply and demands and how to parameterize\nthe model. In this paper we attempt to solve these problems with the help of\nlarge amount of floating car data. We propose a coarse-grained cellular\nautomata model that simulates vehicles moving on uniform grids whose size are\nmuch larger compared with the microscopic cellular automata model. The car-car\ninteraction in the microscopic model is replaced by the coupling between\nvehicles and coarse-grained state variables in our model. To parameterize the\nmodel, flux-occupancy relations are fitted from the historical data at every\ngrids, which serve as the coarse-grained fundamental diagrams coupling the\noccupancy and speed. To evaluate the model, we feed it with the historical\ntravel demands and trajectories obtained from the floating car data and use the\nmodel to predict road speed one hour into the future. Numerical results show\nthat our model can capture the traffic flow pattern of the entire city and make\nreasonable predictions. The current work can be considered a prototype for a\nmodel-based forecasting system for city traffic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 06:17:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Yucheng", ""], ["Li", "Minwei", ""], ["Liu", "Hao", ""], ["Guo", "Xiaolu", ""], ["Wang", "Xiaowei", ""], ["Li", "Tiejun", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.02652", "submitter": "Yan Grange", "authors": "Yan Guillaume Grange, Kevin Vinsen, Juan Carlos Guzman, Jos\\'e Alfredo\n  Parra, Jan David Mol, Rosly Renil and Christoper Schollar", "title": "Operations in the era of large distributed telescopes", "comments": "4 pages; to be published in ADASS XXVI (held October 16-20, 2016)\n  proceedings.

Because\nof this, most astronomical data sets were small enough that the raw data could\neasily be downloaded and processed on a single machine.\n  In the last decade, several large, complex Radio Astronomy instruments have\nbeen built and the SKA is currently being designed. Many of these instruments\nhave been designed by international teams, and, in the case of LOFAR span an\narea larger than a single country. Such systems are ICT telescopes and consist\nmainly of complex software. This causes the main operational issues to be\nrelated to the ICT systems and not the telescope hardware. However, it is\nimportant that the operations of the ICT systems are coordinated with the\ntraditional operational work. Managing the operations of such telescopes\ntherefore requires an approach that significantly differs from classical\ntelescope operations.\n  The goal of this session is to bring together members of operational teams\nresponsible for such large-scale ICT telescopes. This gathering will be used to\nexchange experiences and knowledge between those teams. Also, we consider such\na meeting as very valuable input for future instrumentation, especially the SKA\nand its regional centres.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Grange", "Yan Guillaume", ""], ["Vinsen", "Kevin", ""], ["Guzman", "Juan Carlos", ""], ["Parra", "Jos\u00e9 Alfredo", ""], ["Mol", "Jan David", ""], ["Renil", "Rosly", ""], ["Schollar", "Christoper", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.04191", "submitter": "Rasmus Ulslev Pedersen", "authors": "Rasmus Ulslev Pedersen", "title": "DEMoS Manifesto", "comments": "Invited talk UiO, IfI", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is a manifesto for DEMoS, which is a Distributed Embedded Modular\nSystem, but also a manifesto addressing the need for more\ninter-/cross-disciplinary mastery of working knowledge related to installing\nthis class of systems in the real world.
