Basically, GCF filters are\nanti-aliasing filters that guarantee superior performance in terms of\nselectivity and quantization noise rejection compared to classical comb\nfilters, when used as decimation filters in multistage architectures. Upon\nemploying a partial polyphase (PP) architecture proposed in a companion paper,\nwe develop a sensitivity analysis in order to investigate the effects of the\ncoefficients' quantization on the frequency response of the designed filters.\nWe show that the sensitivity of the filter response to errors in the\ncoefficients is dependent on the particular split of the decimation factor\nbetween the two sub-filters constituting the PP architecture. The sensitivity\nanalysis is then used for developing a fixed-point implementation of a sample\nfilter from the class of GCF filters, used as reference filter throughout the\npaper. Finally, we present computer simulations in order to evaluate the\nperformance of the designed fixed-point filters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Aug 2008 15:41:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Laddomada", "Massimiliano", ""]]}]
