From a pragmatic perspective, MPUs function very close to CPUs.\nBoth processors have unique operation codes that command the hardware to\nperform a distinct chain of subprocesses upon operands and generate a specific\nresult unique to the opcode and the operand(s). In medical environments, MPU\ndecodes the mopcs and executes a series of medical sub-processes and sends out\nsecondary commands to the medical machine. Whereas operands in a typical\ncomputer system are numerical and logical entities, the operands in medical\nmachine are objects such as such as patients, blood samples, tissues, operating\nrooms, medical staff, medical bills, patient payments, etc. We follow the\nfunctional overlap between the two processes and evolve the design of medical\ncomputer systems and networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Nov 2011 23:54:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ahamed", "Syed V.", ""], ["Rahman", "Syed Shawon M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3859", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "H.
