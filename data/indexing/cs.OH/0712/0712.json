METHODS: A prostate phantom was created. A three-dimensional real-time\nultrasound system with a 5.9MHz probe was used, making it possible to see\nseveral reconstructed orthogonal viewing planes in real time. Fourteen\noperators performed biopsies first under 2-D then 4-D transurethral ultrasound\n(TRUS) guidance (336 biopsies). The biopsy path was modelled using segmentation\nin a 3-D ultrasonographic volume. Special software was used to visualise the\nbiopsy paths in a reference prostate and assess the sampled area. A comparative\nstudy was performed to examine the accuracy of the entry points and target of\nthe needle. Distribution was assessed by measuring the volume sampled and a\nredundancy ratio of the sampled prostate. RESULTS: A significant increase in\naccuracy in hitting the target zone was identified using 4-D ultrasonography as\ncompared to 2-D. There was no increase in the sampled volume or improvement in\nthe biopsy distribution with 4-D ultrasonography as compared to 2-D.\nCONCLUSION: The 4-D TRUS guidance appears to show, on a synthetic model, an\nimprovement in location accuracy and in the ability to reproduce a protocol.\nThe biopsy distribution does not seem improved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 14:38:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Long", "Jean-Alexandre", "", "TIMC"], ["Daanen", "Vincent", "", "TIMC"], ["Moreau-Gaudry", "Alexandre", "", "TIMC, CHU-Grenoble CIC"], ["Troccaz", "Jocelyne", "", "TIMC"], ["Rambeaud", "Jean-Jacques", ""], ["Descotes", "Jean-Luc", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.0769", "submitter": "Jocelyne Troccaz", "authors": "Michael Baumann (TIMC), Pierre Mozer (TIMC), Vincent Daanen (TIMC),\n  Jocelyne Troccaz (TIMC)", "title": "Towards 3D ultrasound image based soft tissue tracking: a transrectal\n  ultrasound prostate image alignment system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Dans Proceedings of MICCAI 2007 - Medical Image Computing and\n  Computer Assisted Interventions 2007, Brisbane : Australie (2007)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH physics.med-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  The emergence of real-time 3D ultrasound (US) makes it possible to consider\nimage-based tracking of subcutaneous soft tissue targets for computer guided\ndiagnosis and therapy. We propose a 3D transrectal US based tracking system for\nprecise prostate biopsy sample localisation. The aim is to improve sample\ndistribution, to enable targeting of unsampled regions for repeated biopsies,\nand to make post-interventional quality controls possible. Since the patient is\nnot immobilized, since the prostate is mobile and due to the fact that probe\nmovements are only constrained by the rectum during biopsy acquisition, the\ntracking system must be able to estimate rigid transformations that are beyond\nthe capture range of common image similarity measures. We propose a fast and\nrobust multi-resolution attribute-vector registration approach that combines\nglobal and local optimization methods to solve this problem. Global\noptimization is performed on a probe movement model that reduces the\ndimensionality of the search space and thus renders optimization efficient. The\nmethod was tested on 237 prostate volumes acquired from 14 different patients\nfor 3D to 3D and 3D to orthogonal 2D slices registration. The 3D-3D version of\nthe algorithm converged correctly in 96.7% of all cases in 6.5s with an\naccuracy of 1.41mm (r.m.s.) and 3.84mm (max).

The objective is to determine what impact this system may have on\nthe treatment of the patient. Dose planning is performed from initial TRUS\nprostate contours and evaluated on contours modified by data fusion.
