Migration to 3D has been long sought as a possible pathway to\ncontinue scaling, however, intrinsic requirements of CMOS are not compatible\nfor fine-grained 3D integration. We proposed a truly fine-grained 3D integrated\ncircuit fabric called Skybridge that solves nanoscale challenges and achieves\norders of magnitude benefits over CMOS. In Skybridge, device, circuit,\nconnectivity, thermal management and manufacturing issues are addressed in an\nintegrated 3D compatible manner. At the core of Skybridge assembly are uniform\nvertical nanowires, which are functionalized with architected features for\nfabric integration. All active components are created primarily using\nsequential material deposition steps on these nanowires. Lithography and doping\nare performed prior to any functionalization and their precision requirements\nare significantly reduced. This paper introduces Skybridge manufacturing\npathway that is developed based on extensive process, device simulations and\nexperimental metrology, and uses established processes. Experimental\ndemonstrations of key process steps are also shown.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 May 2015 20:27:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rahman", "Mostafizur", ""], ["Shi", "Jiajun", ""], ["Li", "Mingyu", ""], ["Khasanvis", "Santosh", ""], ["Moritz", "Csaba Andras", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.00632", "submitter": "Olivier Buu", "authors": "Olivier Buu", "title": "Sensitivity Analysis of Resonant Circuits", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use first-order perturbation theory to provide a local linear relation\nbetween the circuit parameters and the poles of an RLC network.
