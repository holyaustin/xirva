The theory is\napplicable to a nano devices characterization: current-voltage, Auger current\ndependence. Generally small response of device under test on an applied\nstimulus is masked by an unknown deterministic background and a random noise.\nCharacterization test in this signal corruption scenario should be based on\ncorrelation measurement technique of device response on applied optimal\nstimulus with optimal reference signal. Co-synthesis solution of stimulus and\nreference signal is proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2012 19:08:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Dorman", "A.

The proposed reversible Programming logic array\ncalled RPLA is designed by MUX gate [10] & Feynman gate for 3- inputs, which is\nable to perform any reversible 3- input logic function or Boolean function.\nFurthermore the quantized analysis with camparitive finding is shown for the\nrealized RPLA against the existing one. The result shows improvement in the\nquantum cost and total logical caculation in proposed RPLA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2012 01:08:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Singla", "Pradeep", ""], ["Malik", "Naveen Kr.", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.5526", "submitter": "Pradeep  Singla", "authors": "Pradeep Singla, Satyan", "title": "Towards the Solution of Power Dissipation in Electronics Systems through\n  Thermodynamics", "comments": "4 Pages, 10 Figures", "journal-ref": "Pradeep Singla and Satyan.
