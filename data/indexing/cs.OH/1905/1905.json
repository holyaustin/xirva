However, to further apply AI technologies in\nreal-world context, several significant issues regarding the AI ecosystem\nshould be addressed. We identify the main issues as data privacy, ownership,\nand exchange, which are difficult to be solved with the current centralized\nparadigm of machine learning training methodology. As a result, we propose a\nnovel model training paradigm based on blockchain, named Galaxy Learning, which\naims to train a model with distributed data and to reserve the data ownership\nfor their owners. In this new paradigm, encrypted models are moved around\ninstead, and are federated once trained. Model training, as well as the\ncommunication, is achieved with blockchain and its smart contracts. Pricing of\ntraining data is determined by its contribution, and therefore it is not about\nthe exchange of data ownership. In this position paper, we describe the\nmotivation, paradigm, design, and challenges as well as opportunities of Galaxy\nLearning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Apr 2019 11:05:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Chao", ""], ["Xiao", "Jun", ""], ["Huang", "Gang", ""], ["Wu", "Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01163", "submitter": "Thomas Liebig", "authors": "Christian R\\\"omer and Johannes Hiry and Chris Kittl and Thomas Liebig\n  and Christian Rehtanz", "title": "Charging control of electric vehicles using contextual bandits\n  considering the electrical distribution grid", "comments": "appeared in KNOWme workshop @ECMLPKDD2018, 19 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the proliferation of electric vehicles, the electrical distribution\ngrids are more prone to overloads.

The focus on inputs and outputs allows for the verification and\ncomparison of vastly different intelligent systems; from deep neural networks\nto agent-based systems. The explicit transformation of abstract moral values\ninto concrete norms brings great benefits in terms of explainability;\nstakeholders know exactly how the system is interpreting and employing relevant\nabstract moral human values and calibrate their trust accordingly.
