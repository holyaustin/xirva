Specifically, a WiFi signal is acquired\nthrough two channels where the first channel is the reference one, whereas the\nother signal is acquired by a passive receiver after reflection from the human\ntarget. Using signal processing of cross-ambiguity function, various features\nin the signal are extracted. The entire implementations are performed using\nsoftware defined radios having directional antennas. We report the accuracy of\nour system in different conditions and environments and show that breathing\nrate can be measured with an accuracy of 87% when there are no obstacles. We\nalso show a 98% accuracy in detecting falls and 93% accuracy in classifying\ntremor. The results indicate that passive WiFi systems show great promise in\nreplacing typical invasive health devices as standard tools for health care.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 14:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "U.

To make this\ndecision in an informed manner, one should study and compare general properties\nof candidate measures. However, analysing measures with respect to complete\nranges of their domain values is a difficult and challenging task. In this\nstudy, we attempt to support such analyses with a specialized visualization\ntechnique, which operates in a barycentric coordinate system using a 3D\ntetrahedron. Additionally, we adapt this technique to the context of imbalanced\ndata and put forward a set of properties which should be taken into account\nwhen selecting a classification performance measure. As a result, we compare 22\npopular measures and show important differences in their behaviour. Moreover,\nfor parametric measures such as the F$_{\\beta}$ and IBA$_\\alpha$(G-mean), we\nanalytically derive parameter thresholds that change measure properties.\nFinally, we provide an online visualization tool that can aid the analysis of\ncomplete domain ranges of performance measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 10:06:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 18:49:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Brzezinski", "Dariusz", ""], ["Stefanowski", "Jerzy", ""], ["Susmaga", "Robert", ""], ["Szcz\u0119ch", "Izabela", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07887", "submitter": "Marek Szuba", "authors": "Theo Beffart, Maximilian Fr\\\"uh, Christoph Haas, Sachin Rajgopal,\n  Jonas Schwabe, Christoph Wolff, Marek Szuba", "title": "RootJS: Node.js Bindings for ROOT 6", "comments": "7 pages, 1 figure.

All rootJS methods are invoked asynchronously and support callback\nfunctions, allowing non-blocking operation of Node.js applications using them.\nLast but not least, our bindings have been designed to platform-independent and\nshould therefore work on all systems supporting both ROOT 6 and Node.js.\n  Thanks to rootJS it is now possible to create ROOT-aware Web applications\ntaking full advantage of the high performance and extensive capabilities of\nNode.js.
