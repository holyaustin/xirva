But in\npractice, the various cell phone blocks are best powered by LDOs with different\nperformance characteristics. This paper provides a new design methodology to\nchoosing the right LDO to power each cell phone and especially for the Voltage\nPhase-Locked loops (VPLLs) blocks. Fabricated in a 0.18 {\\mu}m CMOS process,\nthe measured results show the adopted topology achieves a better phase noise\nthan the conventional saturation current source. and the spread of the current\nlimitation (without matching) is 100mA, the VPLLs system demonstrates a phase\nnoise of 782 nv/sqrtHz at 100-kHz, and 33 nv/sqrtHz at 1 MHz, while quiescent\ncurrent 33 {\\mu}A from a 2.6 V supply voltage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Mar 2012 01:55:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Salah-ddine", "Krit", ""], ["Kamal", "Zared", ""], ["Hassan", "Qjidaa", ""], ["Mohcine", "Zouak", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6438", "submitter": "Gopalakrishnan Tr Nair", "authors": "T.

This paper deals\nwith the analysis of such raw data files which are made up of the sequences of\nthe tokens. It also depicts the method in which the files are parsed for\nextracting the information leading to the final storage in predefined data base\ntables. The parser is capable of reading the file in a line structured way and\nstore the tokens into the predefined tables of data bases. The whole process is\nautomated using the SSIS tools available in the SQL server. The log table is\nmaintained in each step of the process which will enable tracking of the file\nfor any risk mitigation. It can extract, transform and load data resulting in\nthe processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2012 06:11:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "T.

In order to meet a fully coordinated supervisory control of multiple\ndomains of a large scale system, it requires the scenario of engaging\nmultiprocessor real time design. There are various types of scheduling schemes\nexisting for meeting the critical task assignment in multiple processor\nenvironments and it requires the tracking of faulty conditions of the subsystem\nto avoid system underperformance from failure patterns. Hybrid scheduling\nusually engages a combined scheduling philosophy comprising of a static\nscheduling of a set of tasks and a highly pre-emptive scheduling for another\nset of tasks in different situations of process control. There are instances\nwhere highly critical tasks need to be introduced at a least expected\ncatastrophe and it cannot be ensured to meet all deadline in selected\nprocessors because of the arrival pattern of such tasks and they bear low\ntolerance of time to meet the required target. In such circumstances an\neffective switching of processors for this set of task is feasible and we\ndescribe a method to achieve this effectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 05:31:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "Gopalakrishnan T.
