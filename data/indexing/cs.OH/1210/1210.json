The paper\nstresses to find an answer for a question Is there any relationship between\ncompany size, Internet connection facility and virtuality?. The survey data\nshows SMEs are now technologically capable of performing the virtual\ncollaborative team, but the infrastructure usage is less. SMEs now have the\nnecessary technology to begin the implementation process of collaboration tools\nto reduce research and development time, costs and increase productivity. So,\nthe manager of R and D should take the potentials of virtual teams into\naccount.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 02:41:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ebrahim", "Nader Ale", ""], ["Ahmed", "Shamsuddin", ""], ["Rashid", "Salwa Hanim Abdul", ""], ["Taha", "Zahari", ""], ["Wazed", "M.

The latter school is more philosophical than is usual with the\npractitioners of Bayesian inference and claims the existence of a world mind.\nWhen these two disciplines inform each other semiotics is provided with\nmathematical mechanism and Bayesian inference is seen to be closely related to\nthe act of distinction, the fundamental basis of logic in the work of\nSpencer-Brown. This hybridization also suggests a definition for knowledge\nwithin Bayesian inference; a definition that has been curiously lacking. Given\nthat Darwinian processes are physical implementations of Bayesian inference and\nare utilized within numerous scientific theories across a wide range of\ndisciplines as mechanisms for the creation and evolution of knowledge we may\nview the conjunction of these theories, within universal Darwinism, as\ndescriptive of a world mind. Placing the world mind in this context provides\ndetailed support from the scientific literature and goes some way to refute the\ncharges of mysticism which have been leveled at the semiotic approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Oct 2012 21:09:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Campbell", "John O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.8055", "submitter": "Sudhindu Bikash Mandal SBM", "authors": "Sudhindu Bikash Mandal, Amlan Chakrabarti, Susmita Sur-Kolay", "title": "A Synthesis Method for Quaternary Quantum Logic Circuits", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": "Progress in VLSI Design and Test Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n  Volume 7373, 2012, pp 270-280", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-31494-0_31", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Synthesis of quaternary quantum circuits involves basic quaternary gates and\nlogic operations in the quaternary quantum domain.
