CFO's gradient-like nature is\ndiscussed, and it is speculated that a \"generalized hyperspace derivative\"\nmight be defined for optimization problems as a new mathematical construct\nbased on the Unit Step function. What appears to be a sufficient but not\nnecessary condition for local trapping, oscillation in the probe average\ndistance curve, is discussed in the context of the theory of gravitational\n\"resonant returns\" that gives rise to strikingly similar oscillatory curves. It\nis suggested that the theory may be applicable to CFO as an aid to\nunderstanding trapping and to developing effective mitigation techniques,\npossibly based on a concept of \"energy\" in CFO space.

A central tool in systems\ntheory for synthesizing control laws that achieve stability are control\nLyapunov functions (CLFs). Classically, a CLF enforces that the resulting\nclosed-loop state trajectory is contained within a cone with a fixed,\npredefined shape, and which is centered at and converges to a desired\nconverging point. However, such a requirement often proves to be\noverconservative, which is why most of the real-time controllers do not have a\nstability guarantee. Recently, a novel idea that improves the design of CLFs in\nterms of flexibility was proposed. The focus of this new approach is on the\ndesign of optimization problems that allow certain parameters that define a\ncone associated with a standard CLF to be decision variables. In this way\nnon-monotonicity of the CLF is explicitly linked with a decision variable that\ncan be optimized on-line. Conservativeness is significantly reduced compared to\nclassical CLFs, which makes \\emph{flexible CLFs} more suitable for\nstabilization of constrained discrete-time nonlinear systems and real-time\ncontrol. The purpose of this overview is to highlight the potential of flexible\nCLFs for real-time control of fast mechatronic systems, with sampling periods\nbelow one millisecond, which are widely employed in aerospace and automotive\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 17:18:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lazar", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.1010", "submitter": "Anca Muscholl", "authors": "Blaise Genest (INRIA - Irisa), Anca Muscholl (LaBRI), Zhilin Wu\n  (LaBRI)", "title": "Verifying Recursive Active Documents with Positive Data Tree Rewriting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes a data tree-rewriting framework for modeling evolving\ndocuments.

The design is scalable:\nall species of DNA strands can in principle be mixed and prepared in a single\ntest tube, rather than requiring separate purification of each species, which\nis a barrier to large-scale synthesis. The design is time-responsive: the\nconcentration of output species changes in response to the concentration of\ninput species, so that time-varying inputs may be continuously processed. The\ndesign is digital: Boolean values of wires in the circuit are represented as\nhigh or low concentrations of certain species, and we show how to construct a\nsingle-input, single-output signal restoration gate that amplifies the\ndifference between high and low, which can be distributed to each wire in the\ncircuit to overcome signal degradation. This means we can achieve a digital\nabstraction of the analog values of concentrations. Finally, the design is\nenergy-efficient: if input species are specified ideally (meaning absolutely 0\nconcentration of unwanted species), then output species converge to their ideal\nconcentrations at steady-state, and the system at steady-state is in (dynamic)\nequilibrium, meaning that no energy is consumed by irreversible reactions until\nthe input again changes.\n  Drawbacks of our design include the following. If input is provided\nnon-ideally (small positive concentration of unwanted species), then energy\nmust be continually expended to maintain correct output concentrations even at\nsteady-state. In addition, our fuel species - those species that are\npermanently consumed in irreversible reactions - are not \"generic\"; each gate\nin the circuit is powered by its own specific type of fuel species. Hence\ndifferent circuits must be powered by different types of fuel. Finally, we\nrequire input to be given according to the dual-rail convention, so that an\ninput of 0 is specified not only by the absence of a certain species, but by\nthe presence of another. That is, we do not construct a \"true NOT gate\" that\nsets its output to high concentration if and only if its input's concentration\nis low. It remains an open problem to design scalable, time-responsive,\ndigital, energy-efficient molecular circuits that additionally solve one of\nthese problems, or to prove that some subset of their resolutions are mutually\nincompatible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Mar 2010 23:46:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 01:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chiniforooshan", "Ehsan", ""], ["Doty", "David", ""], ["Kari", "Lila", ""], ["Seki", "Shinnosuke", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.3932", "submitter": "Laszlo Kish", "authors": "Zoltan Gingl, Sunil Khatri, Laszlo Kish", "title": "Towards brain-inspired computing", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": "Fluctuation and Noise Letters 9 (2010) pp. 403-412", "doi": "10.1142/S0219477510000332", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.gen-ph cs.OH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present introductory considerations and analysis toward computing\napplications based on the recently introduced deterministic logic scheme with\nrandom spike (pulse) trains [Phys.

Pulse trains are realized by an element called\northogonator. We discuss two different types of orthogonators, parallel\n(intersection-based) and serial (demultiplexer-based) orthogonators. The last\none can be slower but it makes sequential logic design straightforward. We\npropose generating a multidimensional logic hyperspace [Physics Letters A 373\n(2009) 1928-1934] by using the zero-crossing events of uncorrelated Gaussian\nelectrical noises available in the chips. The spike trains in the hyperspace\nare non-overlapping, and are referred to as neuro-bits. To demonstrate this\nidea, we generate 3-dimensional hyperspace bases using 2 Gaussian noises as\nsources for neuro-bits, respectively. In such a scenario, the detection of\ndifferent hyperspace basis elements may have vastly differing delays. We show\nthat it is possible to provide an identical speed for all the hyperspace bases\nelements using correlated noise sources, and demonstrate this for the 2\nneuro-bits situations. The key impact of this paper is to demonstrate that a\nlogic design approach using such neuro-bits can yield a fast, low power\nprocessing and environmental variation tolerant means of designing computer\ncircuitry. It also enables the realization of multi-valued logic, significantly\nincreasing the complexity of computer circuits by allowing several neuro-bits\nto be transmitted on a single wire.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Mar 2010 15:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Gingl", "Zoltan", ""], ["Khatri", "Sunil", ""], ["Kish", "Laszlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.4065", "submitter": "William Jackson", "authors": "Chien-Ying Chen, Jen-Yuan Yeh, Hao-Ren Ke", "title": "Plagiarism Detection using ROUGE and WordNet", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Computing, Volume 2, Issue 3, March 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the arrival of digital era and Internet, the lack of information control\nprovides an incentive for people to freely use any content available to them.\nPlagiarism occurs when users fail to credit the original owner for the content\nreferred to, and such behavior leads to violation of intellectual property.

The unique behaviour of the MOS transistors in subthreshold\nregion not only allows a designer to work at low input bias current but also at\nlow voltage. While operating the device at weak inversion results low power\ndissipation but dynamic range is degraded. Optimum balance between power\ndissipation and dynamic range results when the MOS transistors are operated at\nmoderate inversion. Power is again minimised by the application of input\ndependant bias current using feedback loops in the input transistors of the\ndifferential pair with two current substractors. In comparison with the\nreported low power low voltage opamps at 0.8 micron technology, this opamp has\nvery low standby power consumption with a high driving capability and operates\nat low voltage. The opamp is fairly small (0.0084 mm 2) and slew rate is more\nthan other low power low voltage opamps reported at 0.8 um technology [1,2].\nVittoz at al [3] reported that slew rate can be improved by adaptive biasing\ntechnique and power dissipation can be reduced by operating the device in weak\ninversion.

Basically the principle of sub- threshold logics is\noperating MOSFET in sub-threshold region and using the leakage current in that\nregion for switching action, there by drastically decreasing power. To reduce\nthe power consumption of sub-threshold circuits further, a novel body biasing\ntechnique termed VTMOS is introduced .VTMOS approach is realized from DTMOS\napproach. Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS) circuits provide low leakage and high\ncurrent drive, compared to CMOS circuits, operated at lower voltages. The VTMOS\nis based on operating the MOS devices with an appropriate substrate bias which\nvaries with gate voltage, by connecting a positive bias voltage between gate\nand substrate for NMOS and negative bias voltage between gate and substrate for\nPMOS. With VTMOS, there is a considerable reduction in operating current and\npower dissipation, while the remaining characteristics are almost the same as\nthose of DTMOS. Results of our investigations show that VTMOS circuits improves\nthe power up to 50% when compared to CMOS and DTMOS circuits, in sub- threshold\nregion.. The performance analysis and comparison of VTMOS, DTMOS and CMOS is\nmade and test results of Power dissipation, Propagation delay and Power delay\nproduct are presented to justify the superiority of VTMOS logic over\nconventional sub-threshold logics using Hspice Tool.
