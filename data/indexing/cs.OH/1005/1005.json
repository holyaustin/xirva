After\nyears of working on a semantically annotated corpus of sTeX documents (GenCS),\nwe identified a set of common, time-consuming subtasks, which can be supported\nin an integrated authoring environment. We have adapted the modular Eclipse IDE\ninto sTeXIDE, an authoring solution for enhancing productivity in contributing\nto sTeX based corpora. sTeXIDE supports context-aware command completion,\nmodule management, semantic macro retrieval, and theory graph navigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 May 2010 22:31:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jucovschi", "Constantin", ""], ["Kohlhase", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5490", "submitter": "Richard Formato", "authors": "Richard A.

Because it is\npossible for a probe to fly outside the domain of feasible solutions, a simple\nerrant probe retrieval method has been used previously that does not include\nthe directional information contained in a probe's acceleration vector. This\nnote investigates the effect of adding directionality to the \"repositioning\nfactor\" approach. As a general proposition, it appears that doing so does not\nimprove convergence speed or accuracy. In fact, adding directionality to the\noriginal errant probe retrieval scheme appears to be highly inadvisable.\nNevertheless, there may be alternative probe retrieval schemes that do benefit\nfrom directional information, and the results reported here may assist in or\nencourage their development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 May 2010 22:38:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 6 Jun 2010 13:03:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Formato", "Richard A.", ""]]}]
