This paper describes the various components of\nour prototype implementation of a Real-time Passenger Information System\n(RTPIS) for a public transport system like a fleet of buses. Vehicle-mounted\nunits, bus station units and a server located at the transport company premises\ncomprise the system. The vehicle unit reports the current position of the\nvehicle to a central server periodically via General Packet Radio Service\n(GPRS). An Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) algorithm running on the server\npredicts the arrival times of buses at their stops based on real-time\nobservations of the buses' current Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates.\nThis information is displayed and announced to passengers at stops using\nstation units, which periodically fetch the required ETA from the server via\nGPRS. Novel features of our prototype include: (a) a route creator utility\nwhich automatically creates new routes from scratch when a bus is driven along\nthe new route, and (b) voice tagging of stops and points of interest along any\nroute. Besides, the prototype provides: (i) web-based applications for\npassengers, providing useful information like a snapshot of present bus\nlocations on the streets, and (ii) web-based analysis tools for the transport\nauthority, providing information useful for fleet management, like number of\ntrips undertaken by a specific bus. The prototype has been demonstrated in a\ncampus environment, with four-wheelers and two-wheelers emulating buses.

A\nkey finding is that the majority of reviewed studies concentrates on client\nsatisfaction, thus neglecting the vendor perspective. We argue that this raises\nquestions about the construct validity of these studies. Consequently, concerns\nexist about the validity and reliability of their empirical findings.

Given the stochastic features of these elements, most\nmodeling approaches rely on Monte Carlo simulation. The computational costs\nassociated to the simulation approach force to treating mostly small-sized\nsystems, i.e. with a limited number of lumped components of a given renewable\ntechnology (e.g. wind or solar, etc.) whose behavior is described by a binary\nstate, working or failed. In this paper, we propose an analytical multi-state\nmodeling approach for the reliability assessment of distributed generation\n(DG). The approach allows looking to a number of diverse energy generation\ntechnologies distributed on the system. Multiple states are used to describe\nthe randomness in the generation units, due to the stochastic nature of the\ngeneration sources and of the mechanical degradation/failure behavior of the\ngeneration systems. The universal generating function (UGF) technique is used\nfor the individual component multi-state modeling. A multiplication-type\ncomposition operator is introduced to combine the UGFs for the mechanical\ndegradation and renewable generation source states into the UGF of the\nrenewable generator power output. The overall multi-state DG system UGF is then\nconstructed and classical reliability indices (e.g. loss of load expectation\n(LOLE), expected energy not supplied (EENS)) are computed from the DG system\ngeneration and load UGFs. An application of the model is shown on a DG system\nadapted from the IEEE 34 nodes distribution test feeder.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2012 19:50:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Yan-Fu", "", "SSEC, LGI"], ["Zio", "Enrico", "", "SSEC, LGI"]]}]
