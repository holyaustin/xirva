The research has been completed and created mathematical models\nwhich used for research and statistical analysis. In mathematical modeling has\nbeen including a few models: Model of atmosphere, Model of speed of sound,\nModel of flight head in space, Model of flight in atmosphere, Models of\nnavigation and guidance, Model and statistical analysis of approximation of\naerodynamic characteristics. Modeling has been created for a Space-to-Surface\nsystem defined for an optimal trajectory in terminal phase. The modeling\nincludes models for simulation atmosphere, aerodynamic flight and navigation by\nan infrared system. The modeling simulation includes statistical analysis of\nthe modeling results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2009 18:33:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gorneff", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3902", "submitter": "Harm Hollestelle", "authors": "Harm Hollestelle", "title": "On the Expressiveness of Line Drawings", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.OH cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Can expressiveness of a drawing be traced with a computer? In this study a\nneural network (perceptron) and a support vector machine are used to classify\nline drawings. To do this the line drawings are attributed values according to\na kinematic model and a diffusion model for the lines they consist of. The\nvalues for both models are related to looking times. Extreme values according\nto these models, that is both extremely short and extremely long looking times,\nare interpreted as indicating expressiveness. The results strongly indicate\nthat expressiveness in this sense can be detected, at least with a neural\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2009 20:34:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Hollestelle", "Harm", ""]]}]
