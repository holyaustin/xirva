These messages contain position, speed,\nheading, and other vital information that makes the vehicles aware of their\nsurroundings. The drawback of exchanging periodic cooperative messages is that\nthey generate significant channel load. Decentralized Congestion Control (DCC)\nalgorithms have been proposed to minimize the channel load. However, while the\nrationale for periodic message exchange is to improve awareness, existing DCC\nalgorithms do not use awareness as a metric for deciding when, at what power,\nand at what rate the periodic messages need to be sent in order to make sure\nall vehicles are informed. We propose an environment- and context-aware DCC\nalgorithm combines power and rate control in order to improve cooperative\nawareness by adapting to both specific propagation environments (e.g., urban\nintersections, open highways, suburban roads) as well as application\nrequirements (e.g., different target cooperative awareness range). Studying\nvarious operational conditions (e.g., speed, direction, and application\nrequirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach\nthe desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time\ncontrolling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By\nperforming extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as\nenvironment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying\ndemand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase\nawareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the\nsame level. When permitted by the awareness requirements, ECPR can improve the\naverage message rate by 18% compared to algorithms that perform rate adaptation\nonly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2015 01:34:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 20:03:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aygun", "Bengi", ""], ["Boban", "Mate", ""], ["Wyglinski", "Alexander M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.00621", "submitter": "Bei Yu", "authors": "Bei Yu and Kun Yuan and Jhih-Rong Gao and David Z.

To overcome its throughput limitation,\nindustry has proposed character projection (CP) technique, where some complex\nshapes (characters) can be printed in one shot. Recently the traditional EBL\nsystem is extended into multi-column cell (MCC) system to further improve the\nthroughput. In MCC system, several independent CPs are used to further speed-up\nthe writing process. Because of the area constraint of stencil, MCC system\nneeds to be packed/planned carefully to take advantage of the characters. In\nthis paper, we prove that the overlapping aware stencil planning (OSP) problem\nis NP-hard. To solve OSP problem in MCC system, we present a tool, E-BLOW, with\nseveral novel speedup techniques, such as successive relaxation, dynamic\nprogramming, and KD-Tree based clustering.

These chronic problems\noften fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe\nimpacts (e.g. system failure). Therefore it's a challenging issue how to timely\ndetect these problems to prevent system crash. Although a large quantity of\napproaches have been proposed to solve this issue, the accuracy and\neffectiveness of these approaches are still far from satisfactory due to the\ninsufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. In this paper, we present a\nnovel entropy-based aging indicator, Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy\n(MMSE). MMSE employs the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to\nindicate software aging and leverages multi-scale and multi-dimension\nintegration to tolerate system fluctuations. Via theoretical proof and\nexperimental evaluation, we demonstrate that MMSE satisfies Stability,\nMonotonicity and Integration which we conjecture that an ideal aging indicator\nshould have. Based upon MMSE, we develop three failure detection approaches\nencapsulated in a proof-of-concept named CHAOS. The experimental evaluations in\na Video on Demand (VoD) system and in a real-world production system,\nAntVision, show that CHAOS can detect the failure-prone state in an\nextraordinarily high accuracy and a near 0 Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF).\nCompared to previous approaches, CHAOS improves the detection accuracy by about\n5 times and reduces the ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude.

Existing\nsolutions do not make full use of trajectory planning of nearby vehicles, or\nsocial attributes. The development of onboard navigation system provides\ndrivers some traveling route information. The main novelty of our approach is\nto envision sharing partial traveling information to the encountered vehicles\nfor better service. Our data forwarding algorithm utilizes this lightweight\ninformation under the delusive paths privacy preservation together with the\nsocial community structure in vehicular networks. We assume that data\ntransmission is carried by vehicles and road side units (RSUs), while cellular\nnetwork manages and coordinates relevant global information. The approximate\ndestination set is the set of RSUs that are often passed by the destination\nvehicle. RSU importance is raised by summing encounter ratios of RSUs in the\nsame connected component. We first define a concept of space-time\napproachability which is derived from shared partial traveling route and\nencounter information. It describes the capability of a vehicle to advance\nmessages toward destination. Then, we design a novel data forwarding algorithm,\ncalled approachability based algorithm, which combines the space-time\napproachability with the social community attribute in vehicular networks. We\nevaluate our approachability based algorithm on data sets from San Francisco\nCabspotting and Shanghai Taxi Movement.
