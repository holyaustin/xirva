Excluding some highly or lowly cited publications, the double\nrank plot fits well with a power law, which can be explained because citations\nfor local and world publications follow lognormal distributions. We report here\nthat the distribution of the number of country or institution publications in\nworld percentiles is a double rank distribution that can be fitted to a power\nlaw. Only the data points in high percentiles deviate from it when the local\nand world $\\mu$ parameters of the lognormal distributions are very different.\nThe likelihood of publishing very highly cited papers can be calculated from\nthe power law that can be fitted either to the upper tail of the citation\ndistribution or to the percentile-based double rank distribution. The great\nadvantage of the latter method is that it has universal application, because it\nis based on all publications and not just on highly cited publications.\nFurthermore, this method extends the application of the well-established\npercentile approach to very low percentiles where breakthroughs are reported\nbut paper counts cannot be performed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 16:46:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 21:55:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Brito", "Ricardo", ""], ["Rodriguez-Navarro", "Alonso", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.00805", "submitter": "Juste Raimbault", "authors": "Juste Raimbault", "title": "Exploration of an Interdisciplinary Scientific Landscape", "comments": "24 pages, 11 figures, 1 table.

A\nsurvey of editors validates that those who primarily edit liberal articles\nidentify more strongly with the Democratic party and those who edit\nconservative ones with the Republican party. Our analysis then reveals that\npolarized teams---those consisting of a balanced set of politically diverse\neditors---create articles of higher quality than politically homogeneous teams.\nThe effect appears most strongly in Wikipedia's Political articles, but is also\nobserved in Social Issues and even Science articles. Analysis of article \"talk\npages\" reveals that politically polarized teams engage in longer, more\nconstructive, competitive, and substantively focused but linguistically diverse\ndebates than political moderates.

Since our study approves the MHq\nas a convergent valid indicator, we apply the MHq to four different Twitter\ngroups as defined by the company Altmetric (e.g., science communicators). Our\nresults show that there is a weak relationship between all four Twitter groups\nand scientific quality, much weaker than between citations and scientific\nquality. Therefore, our results discourage the use of Twitter counts in\nresearch evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Dec 2017 10:34:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 May 2018 10:09:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Haunschild", "Robin", ""], ["Bornmann", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.09601", "submitter": "Alberto Laender", "authors": "Wellington Dores, Elias Soares, Fabr\\'icio Benevenuto, Alberto H.

Currently, identifying and studying the formation of researchers\nover the years is a challenging task as current repositories of theses and\ndissertations are cataloged in a decentralized way through many local digital\nlibraries. Following our previous work in which we created and analyzed a large\ncollection of genealogy trees extracted from NDLTD, in this paper we focus our\nattention on building such trees for the Brazilian research community. For\nthis, we use data from the Lattes Platform, an internationally renowned\ninitiative from CNPq, the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and\nTechnological Development, for managing information about individual\nresearchers and research groups in Brazil.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 15:30:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dores", "Wellington", ""], ["Soares", "Elias", ""], ["Benevenuto", "Fabr\u00edcio", ""], ["Laender", "Alberto H.
