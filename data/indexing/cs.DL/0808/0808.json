Due to the heterogeneity of these systems, mapping between\nvocabularies becomes crucial for retrieving relevant information.

Further\nanalyses are necessary:\n  (1) Not just author-choice (paid) OA but Free OA self-archiving needs to be\ntaken into account rather than being counted as non-OA.\n  (2) proportion of OA articles per journal per year needs to be reported and\ntaken into account.\n  (3) The Journal Impact Factor and the relation between the size of the OA\nAdvantage article 'citation-bracket' need to be taken into account.\n  (4) The sample-size for the highest-impact, largest-sample journal analyzed,\nPNAS, is restricted and excluded from some of the analyses. The full PNAS\ndataset is needed.\n  (5) The interaction between OA and time, 2004-2007, is based on retrospective\ndata from a June 2008 total cumulative citation count. The dates of both the\ncited articles and the citing articles need to be taken into account.\n  The author proposes that author self-selection bias for is the primary cause\nof the observed OA Advantage, but this study does not test this or of any of\nthe other potential causal factors.
