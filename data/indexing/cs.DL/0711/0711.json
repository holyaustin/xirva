In such communities users introduce and tag\ncontent for later use. Although recent studies advocate and attempt to harness\nsocial knowledge in this context by exploiting collaboration among users,\nlittle research has been done to quantify the current level of user\ncollaboration in these communities. This paper introduces two metrics to\nquantify the level of collaboration: content reuse and shared interest. Using\nthese two metrics, this paper shows that the current level of collaboration in\nCiteULike and Connotea is consistently low, which significantly limits the\npotential of harnessing the social knowledge in communities. This study also\ndiscusses implications of these findings in the context of recommendation and\nreputation systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Nov 2007 23:05:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2008 01:05:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Santos-Neto", "Elizeu", ""], ["Ripeanu", "Matei", ""], ["Iamnitchi", "Adriana", ""]]}]
