These texts are challenging because they were rarely\ncopied straightforwardly; rather, sayings were selected, reorganised, modified\nor re-attributed between manuscripts, resulting in a highly interconnected\ncorpus for which a standard approach to digital publication is insufficient.\nFocusing on Greek and Arabic collections, we address this challenge using\nsemantic web techniques to create an ecosystem of texts, relationships and\nannotations, and consider a new model - organic, collaborative, interconnected,\nand open-ended - of what constitutes an edition. This semantic web-based\napproach allows scholars to add their own materials and annotations to the\nnetwork of information and to explore the conceptual networks that arise from\nthese interconnected sayings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2016 11:59:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Dec 2016 00:04:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 1 Jan 2017 22:25:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hedges", "Mark", ""], ["Jordanous", "Anna", ""], ["Lawrence", "K.

Specifically, it is\ndemonstrated that the laser / inkjet printer technology emerged from the\nrecombination of two existing technologies: sequential printing and static\nimage production. The dynamics of the citations coming from the different\n\"precursor\" classes illuminates the mechanism of the emergence of new fields\nand give the possibility to make predictions about future technological\ndevelopment.

Here we use a large dataset of scholarly publications disambiguated at\nthe individual level to create a map of science-or research space-where links\nconnect pairs of fields based on the probability that an individual has\npublished in both of them. We find that the research space is a significantly\nmore accurate predictor of the fields that individuals and organizations will\nenter in the future than citation based science maps. At the country level,\nhowever, the research space and citations based science maps are equally\naccurate. These findings show that data on career trajectories-the set of\nfields that individuals have previously published in-provide more accurate\npredictors of future research output for more focalized units-such as\nindividuals or organizations-than citation based science maps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 17:31:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 16:26:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Apr 2016 20:21:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Guevara", "Miguel R.", ""], ["Hartmann", "Dominik", ""], ["Aristar\u00e1n", "Manuel", ""], ["Mendoza", "Marcelo", ""], ["Hidalgo", "C\u00e9sar A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08451", "submitter": "Vasyl Palchykov", "authors": "Vasyl Palchykov, Valerio Gemmetto, Alexey Boyarsky and Diego\n  Garlaschelli", "title": "Ground truth?

Despite demonstrating high accuracy on\nbenchmarks, they reproduce the external classification for many real-world\nsystems with a significant level of discrepancy. A widely accepted reason\nbehind such outcome is the unavoidable loss of non-topological information\n(such as node attributes) encountered when the original complex system is\nrepresented as a network. In this article we emphasize that the observed\ndiscrepancies may also be caused by a different reason: the external\nclassification itself. For this end we use scientific publication data which i)\nexhibit a well defined modular structure and ii) hold an expert-made\nclassification of research articles. Having represented the articles and the\nextracted scientific concepts both as a bipartite network and as its unipartite\nprojection, we applied modularity optimization to uncover the inner thematic\nstructure. The resulting clusters are shown to partly reflect the author-made\nclassification, although some significant discrepancies are observed. A\ndetailed analysis of these discrepancies shows that they carry essential\ninformation about the system, mainly related to the use of similar techniques\nand methods across different (sub)disciplines, that is otherwise omitted when\nonly the external classification is considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 13:49:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Palchykov", "Vasyl", ""], ["Gemmetto", "Valerio", ""], ["Boyarsky", "Alexey", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.08539", "submitter": "Alessandro Delfanti", "authors": "Alessandro Delfanti", "title": "Beams of particles and papers.

Theorists live in a state of\naccelerated time that shapes their reading and publishing practices around\nprecise cycles. Experimentalists turn to tactics that allow them to circumvent\nthe slowed-down time and invisibility they experience as members of large\ncollaborations.

In this study, we investigate retractions from a\nquantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how\ndo retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and\ninstitutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic\ncommunity through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of\nretracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WoS), and ran\nmultiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control\nset of non-retracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied\nthe Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics\nare dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our\nresults show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers\nand authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe\nimpact decrease correlates to retractions based on proven purposeful scientific\nmisconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the\nbroader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect.\nOur findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to\nevaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to\nretractions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 20:13:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shuai", "Xin", ""], ["Moulinier", "Isabelle", ""], ["Rollins", "Jason", ""], ["Custis", "Tonya", ""], ["Schilder", "Frank", ""], ["Edmunds", "Mathilda", ""]]}]
