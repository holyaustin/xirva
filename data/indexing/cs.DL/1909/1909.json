We explore\nthe interdependence between evolving citation and co-authorship networks\nfocused on the publications, by Indian authors, in American Physical Society\njournals between 1970 and 2013. We record interactions between each possible\npair of authors in two ways: first, by tracing the change in citations they\nexchanged and, second, by tracing the shortest path between authors in the\nco-authorship network. We create these data for every year of the period of our\nanalysis. We use probability methods to quantify the correlation between\ncitations and shortest paths, and the effect on the dynamics of the\ncitation-co-authorship system. We find that author pairs who have a\nco-authorship distance $d \\leq 3$ significantly affect each others citations,\nbut that this effect falls off rapidly for longer distances in the\nco-authorship network. The exchange of citation between pairs with $d=1$\nexhibits a sudden increase at the time of first co-authorship events and decays\nthereafter, indicating an aging effect in collaboration. This suggests that the\ndynamics of the co-authorship network appear to be driving those of the\ncitation network rather than vice versa. Moreover, the majority of citations\nreceived by most authors are due to reciprocal citations from current, or past,\nco-authors. We conclude that, in order to answer questions on nature and\ndynamics of scientific collaboration, it is necessary to study both\nco-authorship and citation network simultaneously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Aug 2019 10:37:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Chakresh Kr.", ""], ["Filho", "Demival Vasques", ""], ["Jolad", "Shivakumar", ""], ["O'Neale", "Dion R.

Managing, exploring, and utilizing such\nlarge and complicated datasets effectively are challenging. In recent years,\nthe knowledge graph has emerged as a universal data format for representing\nknowledge about heterogeneous entities and their relationships. The knowledge\ngraph can be modeled by knowledge graph embedding methods, which represent\nentities and relations as embedding vectors in semantic space, then model the\ninteractions between these embedding vectors. However, the semantic structures\nin the knowledge graph embedding space are not well-studied, thus knowledge\ngraph embedding methods are usually only used for knowledge graph completion\nbut not data representation and analysis. In this paper, we propose to analyze\nthese semantic structures based on the well-studied word embedding space and\nuse them to support data exploration. We also define the semantic queries,\nwhich are algebraic operations between the embedding vectors in the knowledge\ngraph embedding space, to solve queries such as similarity and analogy between\nthe entities on the original datasets. We then design a general framework for\ndata exploration by semantic queries and discuss the solution to some\ntraditional scholarly data exploration tasks.
