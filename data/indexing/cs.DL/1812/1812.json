Reasons for open peer review include giving better credit to reviewers\nand enabling readers to better appraise the quality of a publication. In most\ncases, the full, unstructured text of an open review is published next to the\nfull, unstructured text of the article reviewed. This approach prevents human\nreaders from getting a quick impression of the quality of parts of an article,\nand it does not easily support secondary exploitation, e.g., for scientometrics\non reviews. While document formats have been proposed for publishing structured\narticles including reviews, integrated tool support for entire open peer review\nworkflows resulting in such documents is still scarce. We present AR-Annotator,\nthe Automatic Article and Review Annotator which employs a semantic information\nmodel of an article and its reviews, using semantic markup and unique\nidentifiers for all entities of interest. The fine-grained article structure is\nnot only exposed to authors and reviewers but also preserved in the published\nversion. We publish articles and their reviews in a Linked Data representation\nand thus maximize their reusability by third-party applications.

Analysis on large-scale citation network\nreveals two main findings. First, direct citations mainly occurred between\npapers with similar scores. Second, shortest paths are more likely ended up\nwith a paper closer to the basic end of the spectrum, regardless of where the\nstarting paper is on the spectrum.

We propose Wikibook-Bot, a\nmachine-learning based technique for automatically generating high quality\nWikibooks based on a concept provided by the user. In order to create the\nWikibook we apply machine learning algorithms to the different steps of the\nproposed technique. Firs, we need to decide whether an article belongs to a\nspecific Wikibook - a classification task. Then, we need to divide the chosen\narticles into chapters - a clustering task - and finally, we deal with the\nordering task which includes two subtasks: order articles within each chapter\nand order the chapters themselves. We propose a set of structural, text-based\nand unique Wikipedia features, and we show that by using these features, a\nmachine learning classifier can successfully address the above challenges. The\npredictive performance of the proposed method is evaluated by comparing the\nauto-generated books to existing 407 Wikibooks which were manually generated by\nhumans. For all the tasks we were able to obtain high and statistically\nsignificant results when comparing the Wikibook-bot books to books that were\nmanually generated by Wikipedia contributors\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2018 09:49:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Admati", "Shahar", ""], ["Rokach", "Lior", ""], ["Shapira", "Bracha", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11252", "submitter": "Haofeng Jia", "authors": "Haofeng Jia and Erik Saule", "title": "Towards Finding Non-obvious Papers: An Analysis of Citation Recommender\n  Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As science advances, the academic community has published millions of\nresearch papers.

Our analysis shows the degrees of cited\npapers in the subgraph induced by the citations of a paper, called projection\ngraph, follow a power law distribution. Existing popular methods are only good\nat finding the long tail papers, the ones that are highly connected to others.\nIn other words, the majority of cited papers are loosely connected in the\nprojection graph but they are not going to be found by existing methods. To\naddress this problem, we propose to combine author, venue and keyword\ninformation to interpret the citation behavior behind those loosely connected\npapers. Results show that different methods are finding cited papers with\nwidely different properties. We suggest multiple recommended lists by different\nalgorithms could satisfy various users for a real citation recommendation\nsystem.
