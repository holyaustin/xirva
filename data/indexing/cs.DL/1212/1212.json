With four large research centers of\nthe German Helmholtz association the Large Scale Data Management and Analysis\n(LSDMA) project supports an initial set of scientific projects, initiatives and\ninstruments to organize and efficiently analyze the increasing amount of data\nproduced in modern science. LSDMA bridges the gap between data production and\ndata analysis using a novel approach by combining specific community support\nand generic, cross community development. In the Data Life Cycle Labs (DLCL)\nexperts from the data domain work closely with scientific groups of selected\nresearch domains in joint R&D where community-specific data life cycles are\niteratively optimized, data and meta-data formats are defined and standardized,\nsimple access and use is established as well as data and scientific insights\nare preserved in long-term and open accessible archives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 16:16:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["van Wezel", "Jos", ""], ["Streit", "Achim", ""], ["Jung", "Christopher", ""], ["Stotzka", "Rainer", ""], ["Halstenberg", "Silke", ""], ["Rigoll", "Fabian", ""], ["Garcia", "Ariel", ""], ["Heiss", "Andreas", ""], ["Schwarz", "Kilian", ""], ["Gasthuber", "Martin", ""], ["Giesler", "Andr\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6177", "submitter": "Scott Ainsworth", "authors": "Scott G.

With varying resources, audiences and\ncollection development policies, these archives have varying levels of overlap\nwith each other. While individual archives can be measured in terms of number\nof URIs, number of copies per URI, and intersection with other archives, to\ndate there has been no answer to the question \"How much of the Web is\narchived?\" We study the question by approximating the Web using sample URIs\nfrom DMOZ, Delicious, Bitly, and search engine indexes; and, counting the\nnumber of copies of the sample URIs exist in various public web archives. Each\nsample set provides its own bias. The results from our sample sets indicate\nthat range from 35%-90% of the Web has at least one archived copy, 17%-49% has\nbetween 2-5 copies, 1%-8% has 6-10 copies, and 8%-63% has more than 10 copies\nin public web archives. The number of URI copies varies as a function of time,\nbut no more than 31.3% of URIs are archived more than once per month.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2012 13:36:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 6 Jan 2013 04:18:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ainsworth", "Scott G.", ""], ["AlSum", "Ahmed", ""], ["SalahEldeen", "Hany", ""], ["Weigle", "Michele C.", ""], ["Nelson", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6773", "submitter": "John Mingers", "authors": "John Mingers and Loet Leydesdorff", "title": "Identifying Research Fields within Business and Management: A Journal\n  Cross-Citation Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of the Operational Research Society 66, 8, pp. 1370-1384,\n  2015", "doi": "10.1057/jors.2014.113", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A discipline such as business and management (B&M) is very broad and has many\nfields within it, ranging from fairly scientific ones such as management\nscience or economics to softer ones such as information systems. There are at\nleast two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately.\nFirstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that\ncitation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly,\nbecause journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into\ndifferent subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS)\nlist, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at\nthe moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The\npurpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously\nbased on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which\nare included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation\nrates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent\nsub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several\ncategories. Implications and limitations of the analysis are discussed\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2012 20:35:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mingers", "John", ""], ["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}]
