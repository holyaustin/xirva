Using\npublication and citation data, it compares the degree of interdisciplinarity\nand the research performance of a number of Innovation Studies units with that\nof leading Business & Management schools in the UK. On the basis of various\nmappings and metrics, this study shows that: (i) Innovation Studies units are\nconsistently more interdisciplinary in their research than Business &\nManagement schools; (ii) the top journals in the Association of Business\nSchools' rankings span a less diverse set of disciplines than lower-ranked\njournals; (iii) this results in a more favourable assessment of the performance\nof Business & Management schools, which are more disciplinary-focused. This\ncitation-based analysis challenges the journal ranking-based assessment. In\nshort, the investigation illustrates how ostensibly 'excellence-based' journal\nrankings exhibit a systematic bias in favour of mono-disciplinary research. The\npaper concludes with a discussion of implications of these phenomena, in\nparticular how the bias is likely to affect negatively the evaluation and\nassociated financial resourcing of interdisciplinary research organisations,\nand may result in researchers becoming more compliant with disciplinary\nauthority over time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2011 05:42:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 10:54:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 5 Dec 2011 08:56:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 19 Apr 2012 15:24:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rafols", "Ismael", ""], ["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""], ["O'Hare", "Alice", ""], ["Nightingale", "Paul", ""], ["Stirling", "Andy", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1917", "submitter": "Santo Fortunato Dr", "authors": "Amin Mazloumian, Young-Ho Eom, Dirk Helbing, Sergi Lozano, Santo\n  Fortunato", "title": "How citation boosts promote scientific paradigm shifts and Nobel Prizes", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS One 6(5), e18975 (2011)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0018975", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nobel Prizes are commonly seen to be among the most prestigious achievements\nof our times. Based on mining several million citations, we quantitatively\nanalyze the processes driving paradigm shifts in science. We find that\ngroundbreaking discoveries of Nobel Prize Laureates and other famous scientists\nare not only acknowledged by many citations of their landmark papers.\nSurprisingly, they also boost the citation rates of their previous\npublications. Given that innovations must outcompete the rich-gets-richer\neffect for scientific citations, it turns out that they can make their way only\nthrough citation cascades. A quantitative analysis reveals how and why they\nhappen. Science appears to behave like a self-organized critical system, in\nwhich citation cascades of all sizes occur, from continuous scientific progress\nall the way up to scientific revolutions, which change the way we see our\nworld. Measuring the \"boosting effect\" of landmark papers, our analysis reveals\nhow new ideas and new players can make their way and finally triumph in a world\ndominated by established paradigms. The underlying \"boost factor\" is also\nuseful to discover scientific breakthroughs and talents much earlier than\nthrough classical citation analysis, which by now has become a widespread\nmethod to measure scientific excellence, influencing scientific careers and the\ndistribution of research funds. Our findings reveal patterns of collective\nsocial behavior, which are also interesting from an attention economics\nperspective.
