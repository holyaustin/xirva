The aim of the PARSE.Insight project,\npartly financed by the European Commission under the Seventh Framework Program,\nis twofold: to provide an assessment of the current activities, trends and\nrisks in the field of digital preservation of scientific results, from primary\ndata to published articles; to inform the design of the preservation layer of\nan emerging e-Infrastructure for e-Science. CERN, as a partner of the\nPARSE.Insight consortium, is performing an in-depth case study on data\npreservation, re-use and (open) access within the High-Energy Physics (HEP)\ncommunity. The first results of this large-scale survey of the attitudes and\nconcerns of HEP scientists are presented. The survey reveals the widespread\nopinion that data preservation is \"very important\" to \"crucial\". At the same\ntime, it also highlights the chronic lack of resources and infrastructure to\ntackle this issue, as well as deeply-rooted concerns on the access to, and the\nunderstanding of, preserved data in future analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 13:55:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Holzner", "Andre", ""], ["Igo-Kemenes", "Peter", ""], ["Mele", "Salvatore", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.0867", "submitter": "Florentina Pintea", "authors": "Ramona Vasilescu", "title": "PDF/A standard for long term archiving", "comments": "8 pages, exposed on 5th International Conference \"Actualities and\n  Perspectives on Hardware and Software\" - APHS2009, Timisoara, Romania", "journal-ref": "Ann.

This\npaper aims at analyzing the prevalence and scientific impact of duplicate\npublications across all fields of research between 1980 and 2007, using a\ndefinition of duplicate papers based on their metadata. It shows that in all\nfields combined, the prevalence of duplicates is one out of two-thousand\npapers, but is higher in the natural and medical sciences than in the social\nsciences and humanities. A very high proportion (>85%) of these papers are\npublished the same year or one year apart, which suggest that most duplicate\npapers were submitted simultaneously. Furthermore, duplicate papers are\ngenerally published in journals with impact factors below the average of their\nfield and obtain a lower number of citations.

This is in particular the case with web search\nsystems, where it is known that users tend to minimise their effort to access\nrelevant information. It is, however, believed that the interaction between\nusers and a retrieval system, such as a web search engine, can be exploited to\nprovide better answers to users. Interactive Information Retrieval (IR)\nsystems, in which users access information through a series of interactions\nwith the search system, are concerned with building models for IR, where\ninteraction plays a central role. There are many possible interactions between\na user and a search system, ranging from query (re)formulation to relevance\nfeedback. However, capturing them within a single framework is difficult and\npreviously proposed approaches have mostly focused on relevance feedback. In\nthis paper, we propose a general framework for interactive IR that is able to\ncapture the full interaction process in a principled way. Our approach relies\nupon a generalisation of the probability framework of quantum physics, whose\nstrong geometric component can be a key towards a successful interactive IR\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jun 2009 16:17:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2009 09:11:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Piwowarski", "B.", ""], ["Lalmas", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.5418", "submitter": "Salvatore Mele", "authors": "Anne Gentil-Beccot, Salvatore Mele, Travis Brooks", "title": "Citing and Reading Behaviours in High-Energy Physics.
