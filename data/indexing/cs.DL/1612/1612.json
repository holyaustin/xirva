This tendency is especially\nreflected in the efforts to design composite indicators (e.g. the Altmetric\nattention score). We deem appropriate that not only the impact measurement\nusing citations is target-oriented (citations measure the impact of papers on\nscientists), but also the measurement of impact using altmetrics. Impact\nmeasurements only make sense, if the target group - the recipient of academic\npapers - is clearly defined. Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized\nreader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on\nMendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented\nfield-normalized impact indicator (e.g., MNRS_ED measures reader impact on the\nsector of educational donation, i.e., teaching). This indicator can show - as\ndemonstrated in empirical examples - the ability of journals, countries, and\nacademic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average\nimpact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g., the educational or\nteaching sector).

Some suggest that disciplines differ in their\ncollaborative tendencies, reflecting their epistemic culture. This study\nexamines collaborative patterns in six previously studied specialties to add\nnew data and conduct analyses over time. Our findings show that the global\nnetwork of collaboration continues to add new nations and new participants;\neach specialty has added many new nations to its lists of collaborating\npartners since 1990. We also find that the scope of international collaboration\nis positively related to impact. Network characteristics for the six\nspecialties are notable in that instead of reflecting underlying culture, they\ntend towards convergence. This observation suggests that the global level may\nrepresent next-order dynamics that feed back to the national and local levels\n(as subsystems) in a complex, networked hierarchy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2016 20:32:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Wagner", "Caroline S.", ""], ["Whetsell", "Travis", ""], ["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.07636", "submitter": "Alessio Cardillo", "authors": "Andrea Martini, Artem Lutov, Valerio Gemmetto, Andrii Magalich,\n  Alessio Cardillo, Alex Constantin, Vasyl Palchykov, Mourad Khayati, Philippe\n  Cudr\\'e-Mauroux, Alexey Boyarsky, Oleg Ruchayskiy, Diego Garlaschelli, Paolo\n  De Los Rios, Karl Aberer", "title": "ScienceWISE: Topic Modeling over Scientific Literature Networks", "comments": "6 pages; 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide an up-to-date view on the knowledge management system ScienceWISE\n(SW) and address issues related to the automatic assignment of articles to\nresearch topics. So far, SW has been proven to be an effective platform for\nmanaging large volumes of technical articles by means of ontological\nconcept-based browsing. However, as the publication of research articles\naccelerates, the expressivity and the richness of the SW ontology turns into a\ndouble-edged sword: a more fine-grained characterization of articles is\npossible, but at the cost of introducing more spurious relations among them. In\nthis context, the challenge of continuously recommending relevant articles to\nusers lies in tackling a network partitioning problem, where nodes represent\narticles and co-occurring concepts create edges between them. In this paper, we\ndiscuss the three research directions we have taken for solving this issue: i)\nthe identification of generic concepts to reinforce inter-article similarities;\nii) the adoption of a bipartite network representation to improve scalability;\niii) the design of a clustering algorithm to identify concepts for\ncross-disciplinary articles and obtain fine-grained topics for all articles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Dec 2016 15:11:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Martini", "Andrea", ""], ["Lutov", "Artem", ""], ["Gemmetto", "Valerio", ""], ["Magalich", "Andrii", ""], ["Cardillo", "Alessio", ""], ["Constantin", "Alex", ""], ["Palchykov", "Vasyl", ""], ["Khayati", "Mourad", ""], ["Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux", "Philippe", ""], ["Boyarsky", "Alexey", ""], ["Ruchayskiy", "Oleg", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""], ["Rios", "Paolo De Los", ""], ["Aberer", "Karl", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.07863", "submitter": "Hamed Alhoori", "authors": "Hamed Alhoori, Mohammed Samaka, Richard Furuta, Edward A.

Based on this analysis, the study identifies and describes new behavior\npatterns on the part of researchers as they engage in the information-seeking\nprocess. The analysis reveals that the use of academic social networks has\nnotable effects on various scholarly activities. Further, this study identifies\ndifferences between students and faculty members in regard to their use of\nacademic social networks, and it identifies differences between researchers\naccording to discipline.

Sixty years of studies on career\nproductivity patterns in a variety of fields suggest an intuitive and universal\npattern: productivity tends to rise rapidly to an early peak and then gradually\ndeclines. Here, we test the universality of this conventional narrative by\nanalyzing the structures of individual faculty productivity time series,\nconstructed from over 200,000 publications and matched with hiring data for\n2453 tenure-track faculty in all 205 Ph.D-granting computer science departments\nin the U.S. and Canada. Unlike prior studies, which considered only some\nfaculty or some institutions, or lacked common career reference points, here we\ncombine a large bibliographic dataset with comprehensive information on career\ntransitions that covers an entire field of study. We show that the conventional\nnarrative confidently describes only one fifth of faculty, regardless of\ndepartment prestige or researcher gender, and the remaining four fifths of\nfaculty exhibit a rich diversity of productivity patterns. To explain this\ndiversity, we introduce a simple model of productivity trajectories, and\nexplore correlations between its parameters and researcher covariates, showing\nthat departmental prestige predicts overall individual productivity and the\ntiming of the transition from first- to last-author publications. These results\ndemonstrate the unpredictability of productivity over time, and open the door\nfor new efforts to understand how environmental and individual factors shape\nscientific productivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Dec 2016 00:47:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 18:26:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Way", "Samuel F.", ""], ["Morgan", "Allison C.", ""], ["Clauset", "Aaron", ""], ["Larremore", "Daniel B.", ""]]}]
