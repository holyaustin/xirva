Usually sample\npoint estimates of the average and median h-index values for the various fields\nare reported that are highly variable and dependent of the specific samples and\nit would be useful to provide confidence intervals of prediction accuracy. In\nthis paper we apply the non-parametric bootstrap technique for constructing\nconfidence intervals for the h-index for different fields of research. In this\nway no specific assumptions about the distribution of the empirical hindex are\nrequired as well as no large samples since that the methodology is based on\nresampling from the initial sample. The results of the analysis showed\nimportant differences between the various fields. The performance of the\nbootstrap intervals for the mean and median h-index for most fields seems to be\nrather satisfactory as revealed by the performed simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 21:24:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Malesios", "C.", ""], ["Psarakis", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08063", "submitter": "Abhisek Ukil", "authors": "Abhisek Ukil", "title": "Carnot Efficiency of Publication", "comments": "2 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyzes publication efficiency in terms of Hirsch-index or\nh-index and total citations, with an analogy to the Carnot efficiency used in\nthermodynamics.
