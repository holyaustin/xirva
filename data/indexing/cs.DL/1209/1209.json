We enhance these algorithms\nwith a direction-awareness functionality to allow the users to reach either\nold, well-cited, well-known research papers or recent, less-known ones. We also\npropose a set of novel techniques for a better diversification of the results.\nAll the techniques considered are compared by performing a rigorous\nexperimentation. The results show that some of the proposed techniques are very\nsuccessful in practice while performing a search in a bibliographic database.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 01:46:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fcktun\u00e7", "Onur", ""], ["Saule", "Erik", ""], ["Kaya", "Kamer", ""], ["\u00c7ataly\u00fcrek", "\u00dcmit V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5850", "submitter": "Benjamin Zapilko", "authors": "Benjamin Zapilko, Johann Schaible, Philipp Mayr, Brigitte Mathiak", "title": "TheSoz: A SKOS Representation of the Thesaurus for the Social Sciences", "comments": "to appear in Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability,\n  Applicability (IOS Press)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3233/SW-2012-0081", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Thesaurus for the Social Sciences (TheSoz) is a Linked Dataset in SKOS\nformat, which serves as a crucial instrument for information retrieval based on\ne.g. document indexing or search term recommendation. Thesauri and similar\ncontrolled vocabularies build a linking bridge for other datasets from the\nLinked Open Data cloud - even between different domains. The information and\nknowledge, which is exposed by such links, can be processed by Semantic Web\napplications. In this article the conversion process of the TheSoz to SKOS is\ndescribed including the analysis of the original dataset and its structure, the\nmapping to adequate SKOS classes and properties, and the technical conversion.\nFurthermore mappings to other datasets and the appliance of the TheSoz are\npresented. Finally, limitations and modeling issues encountered during the\ncreation process are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 07:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zapilko", "Benjamin", ""], ["Schaible", "Johann", ""], ["Mayr", "Philipp", ""], ["Mathiak", "Brigitte", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5994", "submitter": "Maria Grazia Pia", "authors": "M.
