We attempt to answer four questions. First, how often are older\narticles cited and how has this changed over time. Second, how does the impact\nof older articles vary across different research fields. Third, is the change\nin the impact of older articles accelerating or slowing down. Fourth, are these\ntrends different for much older articles.\n  To answer these questions, we studied citations from articles published in\n1990-2013. We computed the fraction of citations to older articles from\narticles published each year as the measure of impact. We considered articles\nthat were published at least 10 years before the citing article as older\narticles. We computed these numbers for 261 subject categories and 9 broad\nareas of research. Finally, we repeated the computation for two other\ndefinitions of older articles, 15 years and older and 20 years and older.\n  There are three conclusions from our study. First, the impact of older\narticles has grown substantially over 1990-2013. In 2013, 36% of citations were\nto articles that are at least 10 years old; this fraction has grown 28% since\n1990. The fraction of older citations increased over 1990-2013 for 7 out of 9\nbroad areas and 231 out of 261 subject categories. Second, the increase over\nthe second half (2002-2013) was double the increase in the first half\n(1990-2001).\n  Third, the trend of a growing impact of older articles also holds for even\nolder articles. In 2013, 21% of citations were to articles >= 15 years old with\nan increase of 30% since 1990 and 13% of citations were to articles >= 20 years\nold with an increase of 36%.\n  Now that finding and reading relevant older articles is about as easy as\nfinding and reading recently published articles, significant advances aren't\ngetting lost on the shelves and are influencing work worldwide for years after.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Nov 2014 16:53:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Verstak", "Alex", ""], ["Acharya", "Anurag", ""], ["Suzuki", "Helder", ""], ["Henderson", "Sean", ""], ["Iakhiaev", "Mikhail", ""], ["Lin", "Cliff Chiung Yu", ""], ["Shetty", "Namit", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.0906", "submitter": "Loet Leydesdorff", "authors": "Loet Leydesdorff, Wouter de Nooy, and Lutz Bornmann", "title": "The \"Tournaments\" Metaphor in Citation Impact Studies: Power-Weakness\n  Ratios (PWR) as a Journal Indicator", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ramanujacharyulu's (1964) Power-Weakness Ratio (PWR) measures impact by\nrecursively multiplying the citation matrix by itself until convergence is\nreached in both the cited and citing dimensions; the quotient of these values\nis defined as PWR, whereby \"cited\" is considered as power and \"citing\" as\nweakness.

While most researchers\nare personally aware of the competition implicit in the publication process,\nlittle is known about the levels of inequality at the level of individual\nresearchers. We analyzed both productivity and impact measures for a large set\nof researchers publishing in high-impact journals. For each researcher cohort\nwe calculated Gini inequality coefficients, with average Gini values around\n0.48 for total publications and 0.73 for total citations. For perspective,\nthese observed values are well in excess of the inequality levels observed for\npersonal income in developing countries. Investigating possible sources of this\ninequality, we identify two potential mechanisms that act at the level of the\nindividual that may play defining roles in the emergence of the broad\nproductivity and impact distributions found in science. First, we show that the\naverage time interval between a researcher's successive publications in top\njournals decreases with each subsequent publication. Second, after controlling\nfor the time dependent features of citation distributions, we compare the\ncitation impact of subsequent publications within a researcher's publication\nrecord. We find that as researchers continue to publish in top journals, there\nis more likely to be a decreasing trend in the relative citation impact with\neach subsequent publication.

In this study, we propose the idea of\ncontinuous, dynamic and comprehensive article-level-evaluation based on\narticle-level-metrics. Different kinds of metrics are integrated into a\ncomprehensive indicator, which could quantify both the academic and societal\nimpact of the article. At different phases after the publication, the weights\nof different metrics are dynamically adjusted to mediate the long term and\nshort term impact of the paper. Using the sample data, we make empirical study\nof the article-level-evaluation method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2014 20:20:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xianwen", ""], ["Fang", "Zhichao", ""], ["Yang", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7357", "submitter": "Emilio Ferrara", "authors": "Jasleen Kaur, Emilio Ferrara, Filippo Menczer, Alessandro Flammini,\n  Filippo Radicchi", "title": "Quality versus quantity in scientific impact", "comments": "20 pages, 7 figures, and 1 table", "journal-ref": "Journal of Informetrics 9 (2015), pp. 800-808", "doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2015.07.008", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Citation metrics are becoming pervasive in the quantitative evaluation of\nscholars, journals and institutions. More then ever before, hiring, promotion,\nand funding decisions rely on a variety of impact metrics that cannot\ndisentangle quality from quantity of scientific output, and are biased by\nfactors such as discipline and academic age. Biases affecting the evaluation of\nsingle papers are compounded when one aggregates citation-based metrics across\nan entire publication record. It is not trivial to compare the quality of two\nscholars that during their careers have published at different rates in\ndifferent disciplines in different periods of time. We propose a novel solution\nbased on the generation of a statistical baseline specifically tailored on the\nacademic profile of each researcher. Our method can decouple the roles of\nquantity and quality of publications to explain how a certain level of impact\nis achieved. The method is flexible enough to allow for the evaluation of, and\nfair comparison among, arbitrary collections of papers --- scholar publication\nrecords, journals, and entire institutions; and can be extended to\nsimultaneously suppresses any source of bias. We show that our method can\ncapture the quality of the work of Nobel laureates irrespective of number of\npublications, academic age, and discipline, even when traditional metrics\nindicate low impact in absolute terms. We further apply our methodology to\nalmost a million scholars and over six thousand journals to measure the impact\nthat cannot be explained by the volume of publications alone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 20:13:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 20:48:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kaur", "Jasleen", ""], ["Ferrara", "Emilio", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Radicchi", "Filippo", ""]]}]
