Henceforth, a variety of assumptions about social\ntagging systems have emerged, yet testing them has been difficult due to the\nabsence of suitable data. In this work we thoroughly investigate three\navailable assumptions - e.g., is a tagging system really social? - by examining\nlive log data gathered from the real-world public social tagging system\nBibSonomy.

A pair-wise\npublication similarity metric, which is based on common co-authors,\nself-citations, shared references and citations, is established to perform a\ntwo-step agglomerative clustering that first connects individual papers and\nthen merges similar clusters. This parameterized model is optimized using an\nh-index based recall measure, favoring the correct assignment of well-cited\npublications, and a name-initials-based precision using WoS metadata and\ncross-referenced Google Scholar profiles. Despite the use of limited metadata,\nwe reach a recall of 87% and a precision of 88% with a preference for\nresearchers with high h-index values. 47 million articles of WoS can be\ndisambiguated on a single machine in less than a day.

The ISI web of science data suggests remarkably\nstrong inequality and universality ($g=0.70\\pm0.07$) across all the\nuniversities and institutions of the world, while for the journals we find\n$g=0.65\\pm0.15$ for any typical year. We define a new inequality measure,\nnamely the $k$-index, saying that the cumulative income or citations of ($1-k$)\nfraction of people or papers exceed those earned by the fraction ($k$) of the\npeople or publications respectively. We find, while the $k$-index value for\nincome ranges from $0.60$ to $0.75$ for income distributions across the world,\nit has a value around $0.75\\pm0.05$ for different universities and institutions\nacross the world and around $0.77\\pm0.10$ for the science journals.
