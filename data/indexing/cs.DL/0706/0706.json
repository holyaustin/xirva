It is based entirely on open-source\nstandard components and features a service-oriented architecture. The front-end\nconsists of Java Business Process Management (jBPM), Java Server Faces (JSF),\nand Java Server Pages (JSP). A Fedora Repository and a mySQL data base\nmanagement system serve as a back-end. The communication between front-end and\nback-end uses a SOAP minimal binding stub. We describe the design principles\nand the construction of the prototype and discuss the possibilities and\nlimitations of work ow creation by administrators. The code of the prototype is\nopen-source and can be retrieved in the project escipub at\nhttp://sourceforge.net\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jun 2007 19:37:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hense", "Andreas", ""], ["Mueller", "Johannes", ""]]}]
