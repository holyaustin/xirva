The coauthorship network was created from the\nbibliographic record of a multi-institution, interdisciplinary research group\nfocused on the study of sensor networks and wireless communication. Four\ndifferent community detection algorithms were employed to assign a structural\ncommunity to each scholar in the network: leading eigenvector, walktrap, edge\nbetweenness and spinglass. Socioacademic characteristics were gathered from the\nscholars and include such information as their academic department, academic\naffiliation, country of origin, and academic position. A Pearson's $\\chi^2$\ntest, with a simulated Monte Carlo, revealed that structural communities best\nrepresent groupings of individuals working in the same academic department and\nat the same institution. A generalization of this result suggests that, even in\ninterdisciplinary, multi-institutional research groups, coauthorship is\nprimarily driven by departmental and institutional affiliation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2008 17:26:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Apr 2008 23:09:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2008 15:54:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Pepe", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.3239", "submitter": "Andrij Rovenchak", "authors": "Solomiya Buk, Andrij Rovenchak", "title": "Online-concordance \"Perekhresni stezhky\" (\"The Cross-Paths\"), a novel by\n  Ivan Franko", "comments": "in Ukrainian", "journal-ref": "Ivan Franko: Spirit, Science, Thought, Will (Proceedings of the\n  International Scientific Congress dedicated to the 150th anniversary (Lviv,\n  27 September -- 1 October 2006, Lviv University Press, Vol. 2, pp. 203-211,\n  2010)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.DL", "license": null, "abstract": "  In the article, theoretical principles and practical realization for the\ncompilation of the concordance to \"Perekhresni stezhky\" (\"The Cross-Paths\"), a\nnovel by Ivan Franko, are described.
