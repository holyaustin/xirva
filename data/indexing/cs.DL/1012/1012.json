It is foreseen to use semantic-oriented technologies to\nease information modeling and connecting, according to international standards\nlike the ISO/IEC 11179. Complex information management systems, like GIIDA,\nwill take benefit from the use of terminological tools like thesauri that make\navailable a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information.\nWithin GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental\nApplications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based\nsoftware, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented\nto allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This\nservice is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other\nsystems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating to develop a\ncomprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined\nintegrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is\navailable in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be\ndone in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full\nsearch allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it\nand as well as allows to filter the results by themes. Within a collaborative\ninitiative with the CNR-Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information\nTechnology (IMATI) a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) version of\nEARTh was developed. This will ensure the possibility to support the use of the\nthesaurus within the framework of the Semantic Web in order to be used in\ndecentralized metadata applications\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 11:15:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Plini", "Paolo", ""], ["Di Franco", "Sabin", ""], ["De Santis", "Valentina", ""], ["Uricchio", "Vito F.", ""], ["De Carlo", "Dario", ""], ["D'Arpa", "Stefania", ""], ["De Martino", "Monica", ""], ["Albertoni", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0359", "submitter": "Ping Zhou", "authors": "Ping Zhou and Loet Leydesdorff", "title": "Fractional counting of citations in research evaluation: An option for\n  cross- and interdisciplinary assessments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the case of the scientometric evaluation of multi- or interdisciplinary\nunits one risks to compare apples with oranges: each paper has to assessed in\ncomparison to an appropriate reference set.

A major issue is\nthe definition of new frameworks for the exploration of the dynamics at play in\nreal dynamic networks. Here, we focus on scientific communities by analyzing\nthe \"social part\" of Science through a descriptive approach that aims at\nidentifying the social determinants (e.g. goals and potential interactions\namong individuals) behind the emergence and the resilience of scientific\ncommunities. We consider that scientific communities are at the same time\ncommunities of practice (through co-authorship) and that they exist also as\nrepresentations in the scientists' mind, since references to other scientists'\nworks is not merely an objective link to a relevant work, but it reveals social\nobjects that one manipulates and refers to. In this paper we identify the\npatterns about the evolution of a scientific field by analyzing a portion of\nthe arXiv repository covering a period of 10 years of publications in physics.\nAs a citation represents a deliberative selection related to the relevance of a\nwork in its scientific domain, our analysis approaches the co-existence between\nco-authorship and citation behaviors in a community by focusing on the most\nproficient and cited authors interactions patterns. We focus in turn, on how\nthese patterns are affected by the selection process of citations. Such a\nselection a) produces self-organization because it is played by a group of\nindividuals which act, compete and collaborate in a common environment in order\nto advance Science and b) determines the success (emergence) of both topics and\nscientists working on them.

In our scheme, weights\nare assigned in a linearly decreasing/increasing fashion depending upon the\nweight decrement/increment parameter. We call our scheme Arithmetic: Type-2\nscheme as the weights follow an arithmetic series. We analyze the proposed\nweight assignment scheme and compare it with the existing schemes such as\nequal, arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic.
