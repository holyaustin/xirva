Geographical analysis demonstrated that countries have different\npreference in terms of T/A and they reacted differently to research trend. The\ninteraction between two groups has been analyzed and shows that T extremely\nrelies on T and A heavily relies on A, however the situation is very stable for\nT but changed markedly for A.

We matched more than 6,000 preprint-publication\npairs across multiple fields and quantified the changes in their reference\nlists. We also quantified the change in references per full-text section for\n565 pairs from PLOS journals. In addition, we conducted manual checks of a\nrandomly chosen sample of 98 pairs to validate our results, and undertook a\nqualitative analysis based on the context of the reference to investigate the\npotential reasons for reference changes. We found 10 disciplines, mostly in the\nnatural sciences with high levels of removed references. Methods sections\nundergo the most relative change in the natural sciences, while in the medical\nand health sciences, the results and discussion sections underwent the most\nchanges. Our qualitative analysis identified issues with our results due to\nincomplete preprint reference lists. In addition, we deduced 10 themes for\nchanging references during peer review. This analysis suggested that\nmanuscripts in the natural and medical sciences undergo more extensive\nreframing of the literature used to situate and interpret the results of\nstudies than the social and agricultural sciences, which are further embedded\nin the existing literature through peer review.

Recently, several initiatives have proposed\nknowledge graphs (KG) for organising scientific information as a solution to\nmany of the current issues. The focus of these proposals is, however, usually\nrestricted to very specific use cases. In this paper, we aim to transcend this\nlimited perspective and present a comprehensive analysis of requirements for an\nOpen Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) by (a) collecting and reviewing daily core\ntasks of a scientist, (b) establishing their consequential requirements for a\nKG-based system, (c) identifying overlaps and specificities, and their coverage\nin current solutions.

While such visualisations are ubiquitous in grant\napplications, manuscript introductions, and review articles, they fail to\naccount for the rapid growth in scientific publications. As a result, any\nsearch term will likely show an increase in supposed \"academic interest\". One\nproposed solution is to normalise yearly publication rates by field size, but\nthis is arduous and difficult. Here, we propose an simpler index that\nnormalises keywords of interest by a ubiquitous and innocuous keyword, such as\n\"banana\". Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or\nhierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to\ncompute \"interest market share\". Using this approach, we uncovered plausible\ntrends in academic interest in examples from the medical literature. In\nneuroimaging, we found that not the supplementary motor area (as was previously\nclaimed), but the prefrontal cortex is the most interesting part of the brain.\nIn cancer research, we found a contemporary preference for cancers with high\nprevalence and clinical severity, and notable declines in interest for more\ntreatable or likely benign neoplasms. Finally, we found that interest in\nrespiratory viral infections spiked when strains showed potential for pandemic\ninvolvement, with SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic being the most extreme\nexample. In sum, the time is ripe for a quick and easy method to quantify\ntrends in academic interest for anecdotal purposes.

Our analysis proceeds in\nthree steps: First, we quantify the level of engagement with external links,\nfinding that, in one month, English Wikipedia generated 43M clicks to external\nwebsites, in roughly even parts via links in infoboxes, cited references, and\narticle bodies. Official links listed in infoboxes have by far the highest\nclick-through rate (CTR), 2.47% on average. In particular, official links\nassociated with articles about businesses, educational institutions, and\nwebsites have the highest CTR, whereas official links associated with articles\nabout geographical content, television, and music have the lowest CTR. Second,\nwe investigate patterns of engagement with external links, finding that\nWikipedia frequently serves as a stepping stone between search engines and\nthird-party websites, effectively fulfilling information needs that search\nengines do not meet. Third, we quantify the hypothetical economic value of the\nclicks received by external websites from English Wikipedia, by estimating that\nthe respective website owners would need to pay a total of $7--13 million per\nmonth to obtain the same volume of traffic via sponsored search.
