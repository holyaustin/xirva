Whence, on one hand, this\npaper very briefly examines bibliometric laws, like the $h$-index and\nsubsequent debate about co-authorship effects, but on the other hand, proposes\na measure of collaborative work through a new index. Based on data about the\npublication output of a specific research group, a new bibliometric law is\nfound.\n  Let a co-author $C$ have written $J$ (joint) publications with one or several\ncolleagues. Rank all the co-authors of that individual according to their\nnumber of joint publications, giving a rank $r$ to each co-author, starting\nwith $r=1$ for the most prolific.\n  It is empirically found that a very simple relationship holds between the\nnumber of joint publications $J$ by coauthors and their rank of importance,\ni.e. $J \\propto 1/r$. Thereafter, in the same spirit as for the Hirsch core,\none can define a \"co-author core\", and introduce indices operating on an\nauthor. It is emphasized that the new index has a quite different\n(philosophical) perspective that the $h$-index. In the present case, one\nfocusses on \"relevant\" persons rather than on \"relevant\" publications.\n  Although the numerical discussion is based on one case, there is little doubt\nthat the law can be verified in many other situations. Therefore, variants and\ngeneralizations could be later produced in order to quantify co-author roles,\nin a temporary or long lasting stable team(s), and lead to criteria about\nfunding, career measurements or even induce career strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2012 12:50:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jan 2013 17:11:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "Marcel", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.3420", "submitter": "Jonathan Bowen", "authors": "Jonathan P.

In this paper, we present a new\npublication model, which will be adopted for the ECML PKDD 2013 conference, and\naims to solve some of the problems of the traditional model.
