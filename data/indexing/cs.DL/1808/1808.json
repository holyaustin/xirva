This paper\ncontributes to efforts to develop such an account by estimating yearly rates of\nnew novel publication in the British Isles and Ireland between 1789 and 1919.\nThis period witnessed, in aggregate, the publication of between 40,000 and\n63,000 previously unpublished novels. The number of new novels published each\nyear counts as essential information for researchers interested in\nunderstanding the development of the text industry between 1789 and 1919.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2018 15:41:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:10:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Riddell", "Allen", ""], ["Betancourt", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.00525", "submitter": "Jinseok Kim", "authors": "Jinseok Kim and Jenna Kim", "title": "The impact of imbalanced training data on machine learning for author\n  name disambiguation", "comments": "17 pages, 3 figures, and 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Kim, J. & Kim, J.

It is not clear\nwhether there is also a citation imbalance, with some claiming that\nmale-authored research tends to be more cited. No previous study has assessed\ngender differences in the readers of academic research on a large scale,\nhowever. In response, this article assesses whether there are gender\ndifferences in the average citations and/or Mendeley readers of academic\npublications. Field normalised logged Scopus citations and Mendeley readers\nfrom mid-2018 for articles published in 2014 were investigated for articles\nwith first authors from India, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the USA in up to 251\nfields with at least 50 male and female authors. Although female-authored\nresearch is less cited in Turkey (-4.0%) and India (-3.6%), it is marginally\nmore cited in Spain (0.4%), the UK (0.4%), and the USA (0.2%). Female-authored\nresearch has fewer Mendeley readers in India (-1.1%) but more in Spain (1.4%),\nTurkey (1.1%), the UK (2.7%) and the USA (3.0%). Thus, whilst there may be\nlittle practical gender difference in citation impact in countries with mature\nscience systems, the higher female readership impact suggests a wider audience\nfor female-authored research. The results show that the conclusions from a\ngender analysis depend on the field normalisation method. A theoretically\ninformed decision must therefore be made about which normalisation to use. The\nresults also suggest that arithmetic mean-based field normalisation is\nfavourable to males.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2018 18:35:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Thelwall", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.03434", "submitter": "Remedios Melero", "authors": "Reme Melero, David Melero-Fuentes, and Josep-Manuel Rodriguez-Gairin", "title": "Monitoring compliance with governmental and institutional open access\n  policies across Spanish universities", "comments": "21 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, 1 appendix", "journal-ref": "El profesional de la informacion, 27(4), pp. 858-878 (2018)", "doi": "10.3145/epi.2018.jul.15", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Universities and research centers in Spain are subject to a national open\naccess (OA) mandate and to their own OA institutional policies, if any, but\ncompliance with these requirements has not been fully monitored yet.

This shows that there is\nconsiderable ambiguity in the discussion on agreement between metrics and peer\nreview. We provide clarity in this discussion by considering four important\npoints: (1) the level of aggregation of the analysis; (2) the use of either a\nsize-dependent or a size-independent perspective; (3) the suitability of\ndifferent measures of agreement; and (4) the uncertainty in peer review. In the\ncontext of the REF, we argue that agreement between metrics and peer review\nshould be assessed at the institutional level rather than at the publication\nlevel. Both a size-dependent and a size-independent perspective are relevant in\nthe REF. The interpretation of correlations may be problematic and as an\nalternative we therefore use measures of agreement that are based on the\nabsolute or relative differences between metrics and peer review. To get an\nidea of the uncertainty in peer review, we rely on a model to bootstrap peer\nreview outcomes. We conclude that particularly in Physics, Clinical Medicine,\nand Public Health, metrics agree quite well with peer review and may offer an\nalternative to peer review.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2018 11:30:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2019 16:37:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Traag", "Vincent", ""], ["Waltman", "Ludo", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.03730", "submitter": "Balazs Lengyel", "authors": "Gy\\\"orgy Csom\\'os, Bal\\'azs Lengyel", "title": "Mapping the efficiency of international scientific collaboration between\n  cities worldwide", "comments": "4 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  International scientific collaboration, a fundamental phenomenon of science,\nhas been studied from several perspectives for decades.

With digital publication\ntechnology markedly reducing cost, this enduring wall seems disproportionate\nand unjustified; moreover, it has sparked a topical exchange concerning how to\nmodernize academic publishing. This discussion, however, seems to focus on how\nto compensate major publishers for providing open access through a \"pay to\npublish\" model, in turn transferring financial burdens from libraries to\nauthors and their funders. Large publishing companies, including Elsevier,\nSpringer Nature, Wiley, PLoS, and Frontiers, continue to earn exorbitant\nrevenues each year, hundreds of millions of dollars of which now come from\nprocessing charges for open-access articles. A less expensive and equally\naccessible alternative exists: widespread self-archiving of peer-reviewed\narticles.

A publication usually reports a scientific result and tries to\nconvince the reader that it is valid.

Thus, here I propose a data citation format that allows for an automatic\nreproduction of all computations. A data citation consists of a descriptor that\nrefers to the functional program code and the input that generated the result.\nThe input itself may be a set of other data citations, such that all data\ntransformations, from the original data sources to the final result, are\ntransparently expressed by a directed graph. Functions can be implemented in a\nvariety of programming languages since data sources are expected to be stored\nin open and standardized text-based file formats.

First, despite a proliferation of diverse prizes over time\nand across the globe, prizes are more concentrated within a relatively small\ngroup of scientific elites, and ties within the elites are more clustered,\nsuggesting that a relatively constrained number of ideas and scholars lead\nscience. Second, we find that certain prizes are strongly interlocked within\nand between disciplines by scientists who win multiple prizes, revealing the\nkey pathways by which knowledge systematically gains credit and spreads through\nthe network.
