Additional concerns were related to the perceived poor quality of\nthe final evaluation reports. In this paper we assess the ASN in terms of\nappropriateness of the applied methodology, and the quality of the feedback\nprovided to the applicants. We argue that the ASN is not fully compliant with\nthe best practices for the use of bibliometric indicators for the evaluation of\nindividual researchers; moreover, the quality of final reports varies\nconsiderably across the panels, suggesting that measures should be put in place\nto prevent sloppy practices in future ASN rounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jul 2015 19:31:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2016 10:01:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Marzolla", "Moreno", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.04930", "submitter": "Gergely Tib\\'ely", "authors": "Gergely Tib\\'ely, P\\'eter Pollner, Gergely Palla", "title": "Comparing the hierarchy of author given tags and repository given tags\n  in a large document archive", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1140/epjst/e2015-50154-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Folksonomies - large databases arising from collaborative tagging of items by\nindependent users - are becoming an increasingly important way of categorizing\ninformation.

For this quantification, here I propose the $I$-index which is\ndefined as an author's percentage share in the total citations that his/her\npapers have attracted. It is argued that this $I$-index does not directly\ndepend on the most of the subjective issues like an author's influence,\naffiliation, seniority or career break. A simple application of the Central\nLimit Theorem shows that, the scheme of equidistribution of credit among the\ncoauthors of a paper will give us the most probable value of the $I$-index\n(with an associated small standard deviation which decreases with increasing\n$h$-index). I show that the total citations ($N_c$), the $h$-index and the\n$I$-index are three independent parameters (within their bounds), and together\nthey give a comprehensive idea of an author's overall research performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 19:43:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 16:39:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 16:49:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 13:46:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sahoo", "Shaon", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06369", "submitter": "Jaderick Pabico", "authors": "Jaderick P.

The frequency distribution of the number of authors per paper\nfollows a power-law with a power of $\\varphi=-2.04$ ($R^2=0.71$).
