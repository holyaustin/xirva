To\nunderstand these effects on the globalization of research, we conduct an\nin-depth study based on scholarly and patent publications covering STEM\nresearch from 218 countries/regions over the past four decades, covering more\nthan 55 million scholarly articles and 1.7 billion citations. Unique to this\ninvestigation is the simultaneous examination of both the research output and\nits impact in the same data set, using a novel machine learning based measure,\ncalled saliency, to mitigate the intrinsic biases in quantifying the research\nimpact. The results show that the two effects are in fact co-occurring: there\nare clear indications of convergence among the high income and upper middle\nincome countries across the STEM fields, but a widening gap is developing that\nsegregates the lower middle and low income regions from the higher income\nregions. Furthermore, the rate of convergence varies notably among the STEM\nsub-fields, with the highly strategic area of Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nsandwiched between fields such as Medicine and Materials Science that occupy\nthe opposite ends of the spectrum. The data support the argument that a leading\nexplanation of the Matthew effect, namely, the preferential attachment theory,\ncan actually foster the catch-up effect when organizations from lower income\ncountries forge substantial research collaborations with those already\ndominant.

Here we unpack the complex,\ntemporally evolving relationship between citation impact alongside novelty and\ndisruption, two emerging measures that capture the degree to which science not\nonly influences, but transforms later work. Novelty is measured at the point of\nproduction and captures how research draws upon unusual combinations of prior\nwork. Disruption is measured over time and captures how research comes to\neclipse or amplify the prior work on which it builds. We theorize that novel\npapers will exhibit disruptive impact over time, and demonstrate how they are\nmuch more likely than conventional papers to disrupt current literature. Novel\npapers do not do so immediately, but often become \"sleeping beauties\",\naccumulating surprising attention and citation impact over the long run. In\nsummary, new directions for science are created from a lack of consensus.\nFinally, we show how novelty can be reformulated as the combination of ideas\nacross knowledge space to reveal the combinatorial nature of advance. The\nevolution of knowledge space over time characterizes how yesterday's novelty\nforms today's scientific conventions, which condition the novelty-and\nsurprise-of tomorrow's breakthroughs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2021 00:25:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2021 04:04:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yiling", "", "University of Chicago, University of Pittsburgh"], ["Evans", "James Allen", "", "University of Chicago"], ["Wu", "Lingfei", "", "University of Pittsburgh"]]}, {"id": "2103.03738", "submitter": "Muneer Ahmad", "authors": "Muneer Ahmad, M Sadik Batcha", "title": "Lotka's Law and Authorship Distribution in Coronary Artery Disease\n  Research in South Africa", "comments": "10 pages, 1 figure. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:2102.09182; text overlap with arXiv:2102.11739, arXiv:2102.11983", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death and disability in\ndeveloped countries.

Indeed, the Italian\nNational Scientific Qualification (NSQ), i.e. the national assessment exercise\nwhich aims at deciding whether a scholar can apply to professorial academic\npositions as Associate Professor and Full Professor, adopts a quantitative and\nqualitative evaluation process: it makes use of bibliometrics followed by a\npeer-review process of candidates' CVs.

In this work, we aim at exploring\nwhether citation-based metrics, calculated only considering open bibliographic\nand citation data, can support the human peer-review of NDs and yield insights\non how it is conducted. To understand if and what citation-based (and,\npossibly, other) metrics provide relevant information, we created a series of\nmachine learning models to replicate the decisions of the NSQ committees.

This is\na complex exercise that requires characterising with a high precision the\ntopics of thousands of books and matching them with the interests of the\nrelevant communities. In Springer Nature, this task has been traditionally\nhandled manually by publishing editors. However, the rapid growth in the number\nof scientific publications and the dynamic nature of the Computer Science\nlandscape has made this solution increasingly inefficient. We have addressed\nthis issue by creating Smart Book Recommender (SBR), an ontology-based\nrecommender system developed by The Open University (OU) in collaboration with\nSpringer Nature, which supports their Computer Science editorial team in\nselecting the products to market at specific venues. SBR recommends books,\njournals, and conference proceedings relevant to a conference by taking\nadvantage of a semantically enhanced representation of about 27K editorial\nproducts. This is based on the Computer Science Ontology, a very large-scale,\nautomatically generated taxonomy of research areas. SBR also allows users to\ninvestigate why a certain publication was suggested by the system. It does so\nby means of an interactive graph view that displays the topic taxonomy of the\nrecommended editorial product and compares it with the topic-centric\ncharacterization of the input conference.

For this reason, Springer Nature, the\nworld's largest academic book publisher, has traditionally entrusted this task\nto their most expert editors. These editors manually analyse all new books,\npossibly including hundreds of chapters, and produce a list of the most\nrelevant topics. Hence, this process has traditionally been very expensive,\ntime-consuming, and confined to a few senior editors. For these reasons, back\nin 2016 we developed Smart Topic Miner (STM), an ontology-driven application\nthat assists the Springer Nature editorial team in annotating the volumes of\nall books covering conference proceedings in Computer Science. Since then STM\nhas been regularly used by editors in Germany, China, Brazil, India, and Japan,\nfor a total of about 800 volumes per year.
