Removal of strokes or\ndeformities in thinning is a difficult problem. In this paper, we have proposed\na medial axis based thinning strategy used for performing skeletonization of\nprinted and handwritten character images. In this method, we have used shape\ncharacteristics of text to get skeleton of nearly same as the true character\nshape. This approach helps to preserve the local features and true shape of the\ncharacter images. The proposed algorithm produces one pixel width thin\nskeleton. As a by-product of our thinning approach, the skeleton also gets\nsegmented into strokes in vector form. Hence further stroke segmentation is not\nrequired. Experiment is done on printed English and Bengali characters and we\nobtain less spurious branches comparing with other thinning methods without any\npost processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 17:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bag", "Soumen", ""], ["Harit", "Gaurav", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1482", "submitter": "Christoph Lange", "authors": "Christoph Lange, Michael Kohlhase, Catalin David, Deyan Ginev, Andrea\n  Kohlhase, Bogdan Matican, Stefan Mirea and Vyacheslav Zholudev", "title": "The Planetary System: Executable Science, Technology, Engineering and\n  Math Papers", "comments": "Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2011), Demo Track.

Based on our analysis of graphs of different sizes and\ntypes, and using various numerical and statistical tools; the ratio of the\naverage inverse path lengths of a connected graph of the same size as the sum\nof the size of the fragments of the disconnected graph can be used as a metric\nabout the damage of a graph by the removal of an edge or a node. This damage is\nreported in the range (0,1) where 0 means that the removal had no effect on the\ngraph's capability to perform its functions. A 1 means that the graph is\ntotally dysfunctional. We exercise our metric on a collection of sample graphs\nthat have been subjected to various attack profiles that focus on edge, node or\ndegree betweenness values. We believe that this metric can be used to quantify\nthe damage done to the graph by an attacker, and that it can be used in\nevaluating the positive effect of adding additional edges to an existing graph.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 01:33:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cartledge", "Charles L.", ""], ["Nelson", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3130", "submitter": "Kevin A.
