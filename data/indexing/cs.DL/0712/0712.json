We base\nrewrites on a historical click graph that records the ads that have been\nclicked on in response to past user queries. Given a query q, we first consider\nSimrank as a way to identify queries similar to q, i.e., queries whose ads a\nuser may be interested in. We argue that Simrank fails to properly identify\nquery similarities in our application, and we present two enhanced version of\nSimrank: one that exploits weights on click graph edges and another that\nexploits ``evidence.'' We experimentally evaluate our new schemes against\nSimrank, using actual click graphs and queries form Yahoo!, and using a variety\nof metrics. Our results show that the enhanced methods can yield more and\nbetter query rewrites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 12:43:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Antonellis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Garcia-Molina", "Hector", ""], ["Chang", "Chi-Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.1037", "submitter": "J\\\"org P.

Using\nthe SPIRES literature database we reconstruct the astro-ph listings from July\n2002 to December 2005 and determine citation counts for e-prints from their ADS\nentry. We use Zipf plots to analyze the citation distributions for each\nastro-ph position. We find that e-prints appearing at or near the top of the\nastro-ph mailings receive significantly more citations than those further down\nthe list. This difference is significant at the 7 sigma level and on average\namounts to two times more citations for papers at the top than those further\ndown the listing. We propose three possible non-exclusive explanations for this\npositional citation effect and try to test them. We conclude that\nself-promotion by authors plays a role in the observed effect but cannot\nexclude that increased visibility at the top of the daily listings contributes\nto higher citation counts as well. We can rule out that the positional\ndependence of citations is caused by the coincidence of the submission deadline\nwith the working hours of a geographically constrained set of intrinsically\nhigher cited authors. We discuss several ways of mitigating the observed\neffect, including splitting astro-ph into several subject classes, randomizing\nthe order of e-prints, and a novel approach to sorting entries by relevance to\nindividual readers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2007 21:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dietrich", "J.
