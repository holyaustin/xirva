Compared to previous models, LTAI differs in two main aspects. First,\nit explicitly models the generative process of the citations, rather than\ntreating the citations as given. Second, it models each author's influence on\ncitations of a paper based on the topics of the cited papers, as well as the\nciting papers. We fit LTAI to four academic corpora: CORA, Arxiv Physics, PNAS,\nand Citeseer. We compare the performance of LTAI against various baselines,\nstarting with the latent Dirichlet allocation, to the more advanced models\nincluding author-link topic model and dynamic author citation topic model. The\nresults show that LTAI achieves improved accuracy over other similar models\nwhen predicting words, citations and authors of publications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:52:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Jooyeon", ""], ["Kim", "Dongwoo", ""], ["Oh", "Alice", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00816", "submitter": "Philipp Mayr", "authors": "Philipp Mayr, Ameni Kacem", "title": "A Complete Year of User Retrieval Sessions in a Social Sciences Academic\n  Search Engine", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures, accepted short paper at the 21st International\n  Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries (TPDL 2017)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-67008-9_46", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present an open data set extracted from the transaction log\nof the social sciences academic search engine sowiport.

In order to probe the relevance\nof this two dimensional index, we have analysed the scientific production of a\npanel of physicists belonging to the same Department but with different\nresearch themes. The analysis of bibliometric data confirms that the two\nindices are uncorrelated and shows that while H reliably ranks the impact of\nresearchers, M accurately sorts multidisciplinary or readership aspects.

Keyword assignment is a broad topic of research which refers to\ntagging of document with keywords, key-phrases or topics. For text documents,\nthe keyword assignment techniques have been developed under two sub-topics:\nautomatic keyword extraction (AKE) and automatic key-phrase abstraction.\nHowever, the approaches developed in the literature for full text documents\ncannot be used to assign keywords to low text content documents like twitter\nfeeds, news clips, product reviews or even short scholarly text. In this work,\nwe point out several practical challenges encountered in tagging such low text\ncontent documents.

This paper aims to put\nforward the bearing of acknowledgements in the humanities to bring to the\nforeground contributions and interactions that, otherwise, would remain\ninvisible through traditional indicators of research performance.\n  Design/methodology/approach: The study provides a comprehensive framework to\nunderstanding acknowledgements as part of the reward system with a special\nfocus on its value in the humanities as a reflection of intellectual\nindebtedness. The distinctive features of research in the humanities are\noutlined and the role of acknowledgements as a source of contributorship\ninformation is reviewed to support these assumptions.\n  Findings: Peer interactive communication is the prevailing support thanked in\nthe acknowledgements of humanities, so the notion of acknowledgements as\nsuper-citations can make special sense in this area. Since single-authored\npapers still predominate as publishing pattern in this domain, the study of\nacknowledgements might help to understand social interactions and intellectual\ninfluences that lie behind a piece of research and are not visible through\nauthorship.\n  Originality/value: Previous works have proposed and explored the prevailing\nacknowledgement types by domain. This paper focuses on the humanities to show\nthe role of acknowledgements within the reward system and highlight publication\npatterns and inherent research features which make acknowledgements\nparticularly interesting in the area as reflection of the socio-cognitive\nstructure of research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 09:24:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jun 2017 17:06:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 10:16:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Diaz-Faes", "Adrian A.", ""], ["Bordons", "Maria", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.06410", "submitter": "Zeljko Carevic", "authors": "Zeljko Carevic, Maria Lusky, Wilko van Hoek and Philipp Mayr", "title": "Investigating Exploratory Search Activities based on the Stratagem Level\n  in Digital Libraries", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00799-017-0226-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.HC cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present the results of a user study on exploratory search\nactivities in a social science digital library.

Traditionally, citation metrics have been\nindependently measured at each level of the publication pyramid, namely at the\narticle-level, at the author-level, and at the journal-level. The most commonly\nused metrics have been focused on journal-level measurements, such as the\nImpact Factor and the Eigenfactor, as well as on researcher-level metrics like\nthe Hirsch index (h-index) and i10 index. On the other hand, reliable\narticle-level metrics are less widespread, and are often reserved to\nnon-standardized and non-scientific characteristics of individual articles,\nsuch as views, citations, downloads, and mentions in social and news media.\nThese characteristics are known as 'altmetrics'.

In this paper, we focus on one specific\nknowledge mobilization mechanism, the CASCON conference, the annual conference\nof the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies (CAS). The mandate of CAS when it was\nestablished in 1990 was to foster collaborative work between the IBM Toronto\nLab and university researchers from around the world. The first CAS Conference\n(CASCON) was held one year after CAS was formed in 1991. The focus of this\nannual conference was, and continues to be, bringing together academic\nresearchers, industry practitioners, and technology users in a forum for\nsharing ideas and showcasing the results of the CAS collaborative work. We\ncollected data about CASCON for the past 25 years including information about\npapers, technology showcase demos, workshops, and keynote presentations. The\nresulting dataset, called \"CASCONet\" is available for analysis and integration\nwith related datasets. Using CASCONet, we analyzed interactions between R&D\ntopics and changes in those topics over time. Results of our analysis show how\nthe domain of knowledge being mobilized through CAS had evolved over time. By\nmaking CASCONet available to others, we hope that the data can be used in\nadditional ways to understand knowledge mobilization and translation in this\nunique context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jun 2017 21:02:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Dixin", ""], ["Lyons", "Kelly", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10241", "submitter": "Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza", "authors": "Jorge Calvo-Zaragoza and Antonio-Javier Gallego", "title": "A selectional auto-encoder approach for document image binarization", "comments": "Published in Pattern Recognition", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.patcog.2018.08.011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.DL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Binarization plays a key role in the automatic information retrieval from\ndocument images. This process is usually performed in the first stages of\ndocuments analysis systems, and serves as a basis for subsequent steps. Hence\nit has to be robust in order to allow the full analysis workflow to be\nsuccessful. Several methods for document image binarization have been proposed\nso far, most of which are based on hand-crafted image processing strategies.\nRecently, Convolutional Neural Networks have shown an amazing performance in\nmany disparate duties related to computer vision. In this paper we discuss the\nuse of convolutional auto-encoders devoted to learning an end-to-end map from\nan input image to its selectional output, in which activations indicate the\nlikelihood of pixels to be either foreground or background. Once trained,\ndocuments can therefore be binarized by parsing them through the model and\napplying a threshold. This approach has proven to outperform existing\nbinarization strategies in a number of document domains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:35:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 13:18:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 09:32:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Calvo-Zaragoza", "Jorge", ""], ["Gallego", "Antonio-Javier", ""]]}]
