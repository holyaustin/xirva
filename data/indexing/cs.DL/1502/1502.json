Instead a framework is presented that\ndescribes acts leading to (online) events on which the metrics are based. These\nactivities occur in the context of social media, such as discussing on Twitter\nor saving to Mendeley, as well as downloading and citing. The framework groups\nvarious types of acts into three categories -- accessing, appraising, and\napplying -- and provides examples of actions that lead to visibility and\ntraceability online. To improve the understanding of the acts, which result in\nonline events from which metrics are collected, select citation and social\ntheories are used to interpret the phenomena being measured. Citation theories\nare used because the new metrics based on these events are supposed to replace\nor complement citations as indicators of impact.

Scientific literature is intellectually organized in\nterms of disciplines and specialties; these structures are reproduced and\nnetworked reflexively by making references to the authors, concepts and texts\nembedded in these literatures. The concept of a cognitive structure was\nintroduced in social network analysis (SNA) in 1987 by David Krackhardt, but\nthe focus in SNA has hitherto been on cognition as a psychological attribute of\nhuman agency. In bibliometrics, and in science and technology studies (STS)\nmore generally, socio-cognitive structures refer to intellectual organization\nat the supra-individual level. This intellectual organization emerges and is\nreproduced by the collectives of authors who are organized not only in terms of\ninter-personal relations, but also more abstractly in terms of codes of\ncommunication that are field-specific. Citations can serve as indicators of\nthis codification process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 10:40:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.08030", "submitter": "Hung Nghiep Tran", "authors": "Hung Nghiep Tran, Tin Huynh, Tien Do", "title": "Author Name Disambiguation by Using Deep Neural Network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Asian Conference on Intelligent Information and Database Systems\n  (ACIIDS 2014)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-05476-6_13", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CL cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Author name ambiguity decreases the quality and reliability of information\nretrieved from digital libraries.
