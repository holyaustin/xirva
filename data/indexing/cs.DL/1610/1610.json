In 2016,\nBioPortal represents one of the largest portals for exploration of semantic\nbiomedical vocabularies and terminologies, which is used by many researchers\nand practitioners. While usage of this portal is high, we know very little\nabout how exactly users search and explore ontologies and what kind of usage\npatterns or user groups exist in the first place. Deeper insights into user\nbehavior on such portals can provide valuable information to devise strategies\nfor a better support of users in exploring and finding existing ontologies, and\nthereby enable better ontology reuse. To that end, we study and group users\naccording to their browsing behavior on BioPortal using data mining techniques.\nAdditionally, we use the obtained groups to characterize and compare\nexploration strategies across ontologies. In particular, we were able to\nidentify seven distinct browsing-behavior types, which all make use of\ndifferent functionality provided by BioPortal. For example, Search Explorers\nmake extensive use of the search functionality while Ontology Tree Explorers\nmainly rely on the class hierarchy to explore ontologies.
