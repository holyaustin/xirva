Similarly, numerous noncommercial\nsocial bookmarking services have emerged for citation sharing. While these\nservices do provide some support, they lack an understanding of the various\nproblem-solving scenarios that researchers face daily. Example scenarios, to\nname a few, include when a scholar is in search of an article related to\nanother article of interest, when a scholar is in search of a potential\ncollaborator for a funding opportunity, when a scholar is in search of an\noptimal venue to which to submit their article, and when a scholar, in the role\nof an editor, is in search of referees to review an article. All of these\nexample scenarios can be represented as a problem in information filtering by\nmeans of context-sensitive recommendation.

Many\nusers maintain a blog and write posts to express their opinion, experience and\nknowledge about a product, an event and every subject of general or specific\ninterest. More users visit blogs to read these posts and comment them. This\n\"participatory journalism\" of blogs has such an impact upon the masses that\nKeller and Berry argued that through blogging \"one American in tens tells the\nother nine how to vote, where to eat and what to buy\" \\cite{keller1}.\nTherefore, a significant issue is how to identify such influential bloggers.\nThis problem is very new and the relevant literature lacks sophisticated\nsolutions, but most importantly these solutions have not taken into account\ntemporal aspects for identifying influential bloggers, even though the time is\nthe most critical aspect of the Blogosphere. This article investigates the\nissue of identifying influential bloggers by proposing two easily computed\nblogger ranking methods, which incorporate temporal aspects of the blogging\nactivity. Each method is based on a specific metric to score the blogger's\nposts. The first metric, termed MEIBI, takes into consideration the number of\nthe blog post's inlinks and its comments, along with the publication date of\nthe post. The second metric, MEIBIX, is used to score a blog post according to\nthe number and age of the blog post's inlinks and its comments. These methods\nare evaluated against the state-of-the-art influential blogger identification\nmethod utilizing data collected from a real-world community blog site. The\nobtained results attest that the new methods are able to better identify\nsignificant temporal patterns in the blogging behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2009 20:05:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Akritidis", "Leonidas", ""], ["Katsaros", "Dimitrios", ""], ["Bozanis", "Panayiotis", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2636", "submitter": "Lada A.
