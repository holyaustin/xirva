These templates are not consistent across users and over\ntime. Rule-based parsing of these templates is expensive to maintain and tends\nto fail as new documents are added. Statistical techniques based on frequent\noccurrences have the potential to identify automatically a large fraction of\nthe templates, thus reducing the burden on the programmers. We investigate the\ncase of the Project Gutenberg corpus, where most documents are in ASCII format\nwith preambles and epilogues that are often copied and pasted or manually\ntyped. We show that a statistical approach can solve most cases though some\ndocuments require knowledge of English. We also survey various technical\nsolutions that make our approach applicable to large data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2007 02:30:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 19:57:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 21:02:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kaser", "Owen", ""], ["Lemire", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.2886", "submitter": "Laurent Romary", "authors": "Laurent Romary (MPDL)", "title": "OA@MPS - a colourful view", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Zeitschrift f\\\"ur Bibliothekswesen und Bibliographie (15/08/2007)\n  7 pages", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": null, "abstract": "  The open access agenda of the Max Planck Society, initiator of the Berlin\nDeclaration, envisions the support of both the green way and the golden way to\nopen access.
