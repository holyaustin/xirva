Although computer programs for the visualization of social\nnetworks increasingly allow us to represent heterogeneity in a network using\ndifferent shapes and colors for the visualization, hitherto this possibility\nhas scarcely been exploited (Mogoutov et al., 2008). In this contribution to\nthe Festschrift, I study the question of what heterogeneity can add\nspecifically to the visualization of a network. How does an integrated network\nimprove on the one-dimensional ones (such as co-word and co-author maps)?

As already noted in the original work of Hirsch\nand as evidenced from data of a representative sample of physicists, sqrt{c}\nscales as h, where c is the total number citations to an individual. Thus\nsqrt{c} appears to be equivalent to the h index. As a further check of this\nequivalence, the distribution of the ratio s=sqrt{c}/2h for this sample is\nsharply peaked about 1. The outliers in this distribution reveal fundamentally\ndifferent types of individual publication records.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 01:56:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Redner", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2769", "submitter": "Loet Leydesdorff", "authors": "Tobias Opthof, Loet Leydesdorff", "title": "Caveats for the journal and field normalizations in the CWTS (\"Leiden\")\n  evaluations of research performance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Center for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University advocates\nthe use of specific normalizations for assessing research performance with\nreference to a world average.
