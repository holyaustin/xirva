If there is a deficiency in any one or more of these key aspects,\nthe family will be unhappy. In this paper we introduce the Anna Karenina\nprinciple as a concept that can explain success in science. Here we will refer\nto three central areas in modern science in which scarce resources will most\nusually lead to failure: (1) peer review of research grant proposals and\nmanuscripts (money and journal space as scarce resources), (2) citation of\npublications (reception as a scarce resource), and (3) new scientific\ndiscoveries (recognition as a scarce resource). If resources are scarce\n(journal space, funds, reception, and recognition), there can be success only\nwhen several key prerequisites for the allocation of the resources are\nfulfilled. If any one of these prerequisites is not fulfilled, the grant\nproposal, manuscript submission, the published paper, or the discovery will not\nbe successful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2011 10:48:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2011 08:31:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bornmann", "Lutz", ""], ["Marx", "Werner", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1184", "submitter": "Jill Lagerstrom", "authors": "Jill Lagerstrom, Uta Grothkopf", "title": "Astronomy Librarians - Quo Vadis?", "comments": "To appear in: Future Professional Communication in Astronomy II\n  (FPCA-II)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4419-8369-5_11", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  \"You don't look like a librarian\" is a phrase we often hear in the astronomy\ndepartment or observatory library.

A canvas painting paradigm, such as in PDF\nand SVG, was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between\nimage and page, and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text\nof a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. The model\nis implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC\nAnnotations, as the fundamental building blocks of emerging Linked Digital\nLibraries. The model and implementation are evaluated through prototypes of\nboth content providing and consuming applications.

Existing studies indicate that the promising way to model the\nhigh clustering is a copying strategy, i.e., a paper copies the references of\nits neighbour as its own references. However, the line of models highly\nunderestimates the number of abundant triangles observed in real citation\nnetworks and thus cannot well model the high clustering. In this paper, we\npoint out that the failure of existing models lies in that they do not capture\nthe connecting patterns among existing papers. By leveraging the knowledge\nindicated by such connecting patterns, we further propose a new model for the\nhigh clustering in citation networks. Experiments on two real world citation\nnetworks, respectively from a special research area and a multidisciplinary\nresearch area, demonstrate that our model can reproduce not only the power-law\ndegree distribution as traditional models but also the number of triangles, the\nhigh clustering coefficient and the size distribution of co-citation clusters\nas observed in these real networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2011 09:06:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 09:24:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "Fu-Xin", ""], ["Cheng", "Xue-Qi", ""], ["Shen", "Hua-Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4296", "submitter": "Massimo Franceschet", "authors": "Massimo Franceschet", "title": "Collaboration in computer science: a network science approach.
