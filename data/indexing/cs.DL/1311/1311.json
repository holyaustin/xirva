This is time consuming, making it infeasible for large scale studies.\nThis paper speeds up the classification of hyperlinks in UK academic websites\nby using a machine learning technique, decision tree induction, to group web\npages found in UK academic websites into one of eight categories and then infer\nthe motivation for the creation of a hyperlink in a webpage based on the\nlinking pattern of the category the webpage belongs to.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 12:10:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kenekayoro", "Patrick", ""], ["Buckley", "Kevan", ""], ["Thelwall", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.1426", "submitter": "Klaus Jaffe Dr", "authors": "Klaus Jaffe", "title": "Is modern science evolving in the wrong direction?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Archiv of Science 1: 106, 2017", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present politically correct consensus is that increased exchange of\nscientific insight, knowledge, practitioners and skills at the global level\nbrings significant benefits to all.
