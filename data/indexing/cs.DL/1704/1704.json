Using the APS publications data sets, we ask in this letter how new\nknowledge is built upon old knowledge. We do so by constructing year-to-year\nbibliographic coupling networks, and identify in them validated communities\nthat represent different research fields. We then visualize their evolutionary\nrelationships in the form of alluvial diagrams, and show how they remain intact\nthrough APS journal splits. Quantitatively, we see that most fields undergo\nweak Popperian mixing, and it is rare for a field to remain isolated/undergo\nstrong mixing. The sizes of fields obey a simple linear growth with\nrecombination. We can also reliably predict the merging between two fields, but\nnot for the considerably more complex splitting. Finally, we report a case\nstudy of two fields that underwent repeated merging and splitting around 1995,\nand how these Kuhnian events are correlated with breakthroughs on BEC, quantum\nteleportation, and slow light. This impact showed up quantitatively in the\ncitations of the BEC field as a larger proportion of references from during and\nshortly after these events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 05:28:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Wenyuan", ""], ["Nanetti", "Andrea", ""], ["Cheong", "Siew Ann", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.02211", "submitter": "Robin Haunschild", "authors": "Robin Haunschild and Lutz Bornmann", "title": "Normalization of zero-inflated data: An empirical analysis of a new\n  indicator family", "comments": "12 pages, 3 figures, and 1 table, accepted for oral presentation at\n  the ISSI 2017 conference as a full paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, two new indicators (Equalized Mean-based Normalized Proportion\nCited, EMNPC, and Mean-based Normalized Proportion Cited, MNPC) were proposed\nwhich are intended for sparse data.

Here we developed a new theoretical framework that not only allows us\nto connect the two approaches through precise mathematical relationships, it\nalso helps us reconcile the interplay between temporal decay of citations and\nthe growth of science, helping us uncover new functional forms characterizing\ncitation age distributions. We find retrospective distribution follows a\nlognormal distribution with exponential cutoff, while prospective distribution\nis governed by the interplay between a lognormal distribution and the growth in\nthe number of references. Most interestingly, the two approaches can be\nconnected once rescaled by the growth of publications and citations.

In this work, we study the evolution of scientific\ndevelopment over the past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million\ndigitalized papers published between 1900 and 2015. We find that science has\nbenefited from the shift from individual work to collaborative effort, with\nover 90% of the world-leading innovations generated by collaborations in this\ncentury, nearly four times higher than they were in the 1900s. We discover that\nrather than the frequent myopic- and self-referencing that was common in the\nearly 20th century, modern scientists instead tend to look for literature\nfurther back and farther around. Finally, we also observe the globalization of\nscientific development from 1900 to 2015, including 25-fold and 7-fold\nincreases in international collaborations and citations, respectively, as well\nas a dramatic decline in the dominant accumulation of citations by the US, the\nUK, and Germany, from ~95% to ~50% over the same period.
