In order to retain\nthe full potential for future improvements, the H1 Collaboration aims for level\n4 of the DPHEP recommendations, which requires the full simulation and\nreconstruction chain as well as the data to be preserved for future analysis. A\nmajor goal of the H1 project is therefore to provide secure, long-lived and\nvalidated access to the H1 data and analysis software, which is realised in\ncollaboration with DESY-IT using virtualisation techniques. By implementing\nsuch a system, it is hoped that the lifetime of the unique ep collision data\nfrom HERA will be extended, providing the possibility for novel analysis in the\nfuture. The preservation of the data and software is performed alongside a\nconsolidation programme of digital and non-digital documentation, some of which\ndates back to the early 1980s. A new organisational model of the H1\nCollaboration, reflecting the change to the long term phase, is to be adopted\nin July 2012.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jun 2012 16:41:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["South", "David M.", ""], ["Steder", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6273", "submitter": "Tariq Shahbaz", "authors": "Johan H.

It is also indispensable\nfor the semantic web, since it enables to weave the global graph, i.e., it\nallows different users to contribute to an identical referent. For example, an\nessential kind of referent is a geographic place, to which users may contribute\nobservations. We argue for a human-centric, operational approach towards\nreference, based on respective human competences. These competences encompass\nperceptual, cognitive as well as technical ones, and together they allow humans\nto inter-subjectively refer to a phenomenon in their environment. The\ntechnology stack of the semantic web should be extended by such operations.\nThis would allow establishing new kinds of observation-based reference systems\nthat help constrain and integrate the semantic web bottom-up.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 17:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Scheider", "Simon", ""], ["Janowicz", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Adams", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6352", "submitter": "Alberto Accomazzi", "authors": "Alberto Accomazzi (1), Edwin Henneken (1), Christopher Erdmann (1),\n  Arnold Rots (1) ((1) Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, MA,\n  USA)", "title": "Telescope Bibliographies: an Essential Component of Archival Data\n  Management and Operations", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, to appear in SPIE Astronomical Telescopes and\n  Instrumentation, SPIE Conference Series 8448", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1117/12.927262", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Assessing the impact of astronomical facilities rests upon an evaluation of\nthe scientific discoveries which their data have enabled.
