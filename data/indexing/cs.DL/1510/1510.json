This collection of complex\ninteractive born-digital artworks are used by students, faculty, and artists\nfrom various disciplines. Interactive digital assets are far more complex to\npreserve and manage than single uniform digital media files. The preservation\nmodel developed will apply not merely to new media artworks, but to other rich\ndigital media environments. This article describes the project's findings and\ndiscoveries, focusing on a user survey conducted with the aim of creating user\nprofiles and use cases for born-digital assets like those in the testbed\ncollection. The project's ultimate goal is to create a preservation and access\npractice grounded in thorough and practical understanding of the\ncharacteristics of digital objects and their access requirements, seen from the\nperspectives of collection curators and users alike. We discuss how the survey\nfindings informed the development of an artist questionnaire to support\ncreation of user-centric and cost-efficient preservation strategies.

In response, this article uses\nsimulations to systematically investigate the extent to which mixing years or\ndisciplines reduces correlations. The results show that mixing two sets of\narticles with different correlation strengths can reduce the correlation for\nthe combined set to substantially below the average of the two. Moreover, even\nmixing two sets of articles with the same correlation strength but different\nmean citation counts can substantially reduce the correlation for the combined\nset. The extent of the reduction in correlation also depends upon whether the\narticles assessed have been pre-selected for being high quality and whether the\nrelationship between the quality ratings and citation counts is linear or\nexponential. The results underline the importance of using homogeneous data\nsets but also help to interpret correlation coefficients when this is\nimpossible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 20:08:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Thelwall", "Mike", ""], ["Fairclough", "Ruth", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08874", "submitter": "Mike Thelwall", "authors": "Mike Thelwall, Ruth Fairclough", "title": "Geometric journal impact factors correcting for individual highly cited\n  articles", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Informetrics, 9(2), 263-272 (2015)", "doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2015.02.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Journal impact factors (JIFs) are widely used and promoted but have important\nlimitations.
