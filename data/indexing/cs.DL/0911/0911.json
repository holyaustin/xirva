The number of submissions is actually higher, as\neach manuscript is often reviewed several times before publication. To face the\ndeluge of submissions, top journals reject a considerable fraction of\nmanuscripts without review, potentially declining manuscripts with merit. The\nsituation is frustrating for authors, reviewers and editors alike. Recently,\nseveral editors wrote about the ``tragedy of the reviewer commons', advocating\nfor urgent corrections to the system. Almost every scientist has ideas on how\nto improve the system, but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform\nexperiments to test which measures would be most effective. Surprisingly,\nrelatively few attempts have been made to model peer review. Here I implement a\nsimulation framework in which ideas on peer review can be quantitatively\ntested. I incorporate authors, reviewers, manuscripts and journals into an\nagent-based model and a peer review system emerges from their interactions. As\na proof-of-concept, I contrast an implementation of the current system, in\nwhich authors decide the journal for their submissions, with a system in which\njournals bid on manuscripts for publication. I show that, all other things\nbeing equal, this latter system solves most of the problems currently\nassociated with the peer review process. Manuscripts' evaluation is faster,\nauthors publish more and in better journals, and reviewers' effort is optimally\nutilized. However, more work is required from editors. This modeling framework\ncan be used to test other solutions for peer review, leading the way for an\nimprovement of how science is disseminated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 18:49:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Allesina", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0486", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Dang Tuan Nguyen, Ha Quy-Tinh Luong, Tuyen Thi-Thanh Do", "title": "Building a Vietnamese Language Query Processing Framework for ELibrary\n  Searching Systems", "comments": "5 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 1, pp. 092-096, October 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the objective of building intelligent searching systems for Elibraries or\nonline bookstores, we have proposed a searching system model based on a\nVietnamese language query processing component.

Many resources have representations that change over\ntime, and many of those representations are lost forever. A lucky few manage to\nreappear as archived resources that carry their own URIs. For example, some\ncontent management systems maintain version pages that reflect a frozen prior\nstate of their changing resources. Archives recurrently crawl the web to obtain\nthe actual representation of resources, and subsequently make those available\nvia special-purpose archived resources. In both cases, the archival copies have\nURIs that are protocol-wise disconnected from the URI of the resource of which\nthey represent a prior state. Indeed, the lack of temporal capabilities in the\nmost common Web protocol, HTTP, prevents getting to an archived resource on the\nbasis of the URI of its original. This turns accessing archived resources into\na significant discovery challenge for both human and software agents, which\ntypically involves following a multitude of links from the original to the\narchival resource, or of searching archives for the original URI. This paper\nproposes the protocol-based Memento solution to address this problem, and\ndescribes a proof-of-concept experiment that includes major servers of archival\ncontent, including Wikipedia and the Internet Archive. The Memento solution is\nbased on existing HTTP capabilities applied in a novel way to add the temporal\ndimension.

A\njournal's subject field is defined as the set of papers citing that journal.\nSNIP is defined as the ratio of the journal's citation count per paper and the\ncitation potential in its subject field. It aims to allow direct comparison of\nsources in different subject fields. Citation potential is shown to vary not\nonly between journal subject categories - groupings of journals sharing a\nresearch field - or disciplines (e.g., journals in mathematics, engineering and\nsocial sciences tend to have lower values than titles in life sciences), but\nalso between journals within the same subject category.
