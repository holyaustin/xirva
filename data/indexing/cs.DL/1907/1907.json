In all of these areas, the searcher aims to enhance future performance\nby surveying enough of existing knowledge to orient themselves in the\ninformation space. Individuals can be viewed as conducting a cognitive search\nin which they must balance exploration of ideas that are novel to them against\nexploitation of knowledge in domains in which they are already expert.\n  In this dissertation, I present several case studies that demonstrate how\nreading and writing behaviors interact to construct personal knowledge bases.\nThese studies use LDA topic modeling to represent the information environment\nof the texts each author read and wrote. Three studies revolve around Charles\nDarwin. Darwin left detailed records of every book he read for 23 years, from\ndisembarking from the H.M.S. Beagle to just after publication of The Origin of\nSpecies. Additionally, he left copies of his drafts before publication. I\ncharacterize his reading behavior, then show how that reading behavior\ninteracted with the drafts and subsequent revisions of The Origin of Species,\nand expand the dataset to include later readings and writings. Then, through a\nstudy of Thomas Jefferson's correspondence, I expand the study to non-book\ndata. Finally, through an examination of neuroscience citation data, I move\nfrom individual behavior to collective behavior in constructing an information\nenvironment. Together, these studies reveal \"the interplay between individual\nand collective phenomena where innovation takes place\" (Tria et al. 2014).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 22:40:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Murdock", "Jaimie", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.01642", "submitter": "Moritz Schubotz", "authors": "Moritz Schubotz and Philipp Scharpf and Kaushal Dudhat and Yash Nagar\n  and Felix Hamborg and Bela Gipp", "title": "Introducing MathQA -- A Math-Aware Question Answering System", "comments": "Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Conference on Digital Libraries\n  (JCDL), Workshop on Knowledge Discovery (2018)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1108/IDD-06-2018-0022", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an open source math-aware Question Answering System based on Ask\nPlatypus.

Results: Of the 300\ntrials in our sample, 208 contained empirical data that could be assessed for\nreproducibility.

Funding from the\nEuropean Research Council (ERC) greatly improves performance both in GFIS and\nUKNCH, but ERC-GFIS publications are less cited than ERC-UKNCH publications. We\nconclude that research performance in GFIS and in other EU countries is\nintrinsically low even when it is generously funded. The technological and\neconomic future of the EU depends on improving research, which requires\nstructural changes in research policy within the EU, and in most EU countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Jul 2019 13:50:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Rodr\u00edguez-Navarro", "Alonso", ""], ["Brito", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.09854", "submitter": "Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran", "authors": "Muthu Kumar Chandrasekaran and Michihiro Yasunaga and Dragomir Radev\n  and Dayne Freitag and Min-Yen Kan", "title": "Overview and Results: CL-SciSumm Shared Task 2019", "comments": "In Proceedings of BIRNDL 2019 at SIGIR 2019, Paris", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The CL-SciSumm Shared Task is the first medium-scale shared task on\nscientific document summarization in the computational linguistics~(CL) domain.\nIn 2019, it comprised three tasks: (1A) identifying relationships between\nciting documents and the referred document, (1B) classifying the discourse\nfacets, and (2) generating the abstractive summary.

In this paper, we analyze the inter-coder agreement for historical TV\ndata of the former GDR for visual concept classification and person\nrecognition. The inter-coder agreement is evaluated for a group of expert as\nwell as non-expert annotators in order to determine differences in annotation\nhomogeneity. Furthermore, correlations between visual recognition performance\nand inter-annotator agreement are measured. In this context, information about\nimage quantity and agreement are used to predict average precision for concept\nclassification.

Quantifying trends in researchers' movements is key to understanding\nthe drivers of the mobility of talent, as well as the implications of these\npatterns for the global system of science, and for the competitive advantages\nof individual countries. Existing studies have investigated bilateral flows of\nresearchers. However, in order to understand migration systems, determining the\nextent to which researchers have worked in more than two countries is\nessential. This study focuses on the subgroup of highly mobile researchers whom\nwe refer to as peripatetic researchers or super-movers.\n  More specifically, our aim is to track the international movements of\nresearchers who have published in more than two countries through changes in\nthe main affiliation addresses of researchers in over 62 million publications\nindexed in the Web of Science database over the 1956-2016 period. Using this\napproach, we have established a longitudinal dataset on the international\nmovements of highly mobile researchers across all subject categories, and in\nall disciplines of scholarship. This article contributes to the literature by\noffering for the first time a snapshot of the key features of highly mobile\nresearchers, including their patterns of migration and return migration by\nacademic age, the relative frequency of their disciplines, and the relative\nfrequency of their countries of origin and destination.
