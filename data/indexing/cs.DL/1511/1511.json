Nevertheless,\nmost of the metrics for assessing the vitality of science or for making funding\nand policy decisions are based on productivity. Similarly, the increasing level\nof knowledge production by large science teams, whose results often enjoy\ngreater visibility, does not necessarily mean that \"big science\" leads to\ncognitive expansion. Here we present a novel, big-data method to quantify the\nextents of cognitive domains of different bodies of scientific literature\nindependently from publication volume, and apply it to 20 million articles\npublished over 60-130 years in physics, astronomy, and biomedicine. The method\nis based on the lexical diversity of titles of fixed quotas of research\narticles. Owing to large size of quotas, the method overcomes the inherent\nstochasticity of article titles to achieve <1% precision. We show that the\nperiods of cognitive growth do not necessarily coincide with the trends in\npublication volume. Furthermore, we show that the articles produced by larger\nteams cover significantly smaller cognitive territory than (the same quota of)\narticles from smaller teams. Our findings provide a new perspective on the role\nof small teams and individual researchers in expanding the cognitive boundaries\nof science. The proposed method of quantifying the extent of the cognitive\nterritory can also be applied to study many other aspects of \"science of\nscience.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 22:21:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 16:15:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Milojevi\u0107", "Sta\u0161a", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.00716", "submitter": "Jo\\~ao Moreira", "authors": "Jo\\~ao A.

Findings: While there\nare a wide variety of ranking factors applicable to library materials, todays\nlibrary systems use only some of them. When designing a ranking component for\nthe library catalogue, an individual weighting of applicable factors is\nnecessary. Research limitations/applications: While this article discusses\ndifferent factors, no particular ranking formula is given. However, this\narticle presents the argument that such a formula must always be individual to\na certain use case. Practical implications: The factors presented can be\nconsidered when designing a ranking component for a librarys search system or\nwhen discussing such a project with an ILS vendor. Originality/value: This\npaper is original in that it is the first to systematically discuss ranking of\nlibrary materials based on the main factors used by Web search engines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:36:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lewandowski", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.05808", "submitter": "Dirk Lewandowski", "authors": "Dirk Lewandowski", "title": "Using Search Engine Technology to Improve Library Catalogs", "comments": "Search engines, online catalogs, ranking, information seeking\n  behavior, query types", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This chapter outlines how search engine technology can be used in online\npublic access library catalogs (OPACs) to help improve users experiences, to\nidentify users intentions, and to indicate how it can be applied in the library\ncontext, along with how sophisticated ranking criteria can be applied to the\nonline library catalog. A review of the literature and current OPAC\ndevelopments form the basis of recommendations on how to improve OPACs.\nFindings were that the major shortcomings of current OPACs are that they are\nnot sufficiently user-centered and that their results presentations lack\nsophistication. Further, these shortcomings are not addressed in current 2.0\ndevelopments. It is argued that OPAC development should be made search-centered\nbefore additional features are applied. While the recommendations on ranking\nfunctionality and the use of user intentions are only conceptual and not yet\napplied to a library catalogue, practitioners will find recommendations for\ndeveloping better OPACs in this chapter.

Here we focus on\ncitation networks to cast light on the salience of homophily, namely the\nprinciple that similarity breeds connection, for knowledge transfer between\npapers. To this end, we assess the degree to which citations tend to occur\nbetween papers that are concerned with seemingly related topics or research\nproblems. Drawing on a large data set of articles published in the journals of\nthe American Physical Society between 1893 and 2009, we propose a novel method\nfor measuring the similarity between articles through the statistical\nvalidation of the overlap between their bibliographies. Results suggest that\nthe probability of a citation made by one article to another is indeed an\nincreasing function of the similarity between the two articles. Our study also\nenables us to uncover missing citations between pairs of highly related\narticles, and may thus help identify barriers to effective knowledge flows. By\nquantifying the proportion of missing citations, we conduct a comparative\nassessment of distinct journals and research sub-fields in terms of their\nability to facilitate or impede the dissemination of knowledge. Findings\nindicate that knowledge transfer seems to be more effectively facilitated by\njournals of wide visibility, such as Physical Review Letters, than by\nlower-impact ones. Our study has important implications for authors, editors\nand reviewers of scientific journals, as well as public preprint repositories,\nas it provides a procedure for recommending relevant yet missing references and\nproperly integrating bibliographies of papers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 10:57:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ciotti", "Valerio", ""], ["Bonaventura", "Moreno", ""], ["Nicosia", "Vincenzo", ""], ["Panzarasa", "Pietro", ""], ["Latora", "Vito", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08088", "submitter": "Lutz Bornmann Dr.", "authors": "Lutz Bornmann and Robin Haunschild", "title": "Relative Citation Ratio (RCR): An empirical attempt to study a new\n  field-normalized bibliometric indicator", "comments": "Accepted for publication in the Journal of the Association for\n  Information Science and Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1002/asi.23729", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hutchins, Yuan, M., and Santangelo (2015) proposed the Relative Citation\nRatio (RCR) as a new field-normalized impact indicator.

Curiously, in bibliometry, the opposite concern has often been\nraised: that a growing body of recent papers crowds out older papers, resulting\nin a collective amnesia in research communities, which potentially leads to\nreinventions, redundancies, and missed opportunities to connect ideas. A recent\npaper by Verstak et al. reported experiments on Google Scholar data, which\nseemed to refute the amnesia, or aging, hypothesis. They claimed that more\nrecently written papers have a larger fraction of outbound citations targeting\npapers that are older by a fixed number of years, indicating that ancient\npapers are alive and well-loved and increasingly easily found, thanks in part\nto Google Scholar. In this paper we show that the full picture is considerably\nmore nuanced. Specifically, the fate of a fixed sample of papers, as they age,\nis rather different from what Verstak et al.'s study suggests: there is clear\nand steady abandonment in favor of citations to newer papers. The two\napparently contradictory views are reconciled by the realization that, as time\npasses, the number of papers older than a fixed number of years grows rapidly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 07:52:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 06:00:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Mayank", ""], ["Sarkar", "Rajdeep", ""], ["Goyal", "Pawan", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Animesh", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "Soumen", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08367", "submitter": "Ralph Kenna", "authors": "Bertrand Berche, Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna and Olesya Mryglod", "title": "Academic research groups: evaluation of their quality and quality of\n  their evaluation", "comments": "Presented at the International Conference on Computer Simulation in\n  Physics and Beyond in Moscow, 2015.
