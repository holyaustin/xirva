Semantic Web technologies are also\nevaluated. AUTHORIS relies on Drupal and incorporates the protocols of Dublin\nCore, SIOC, SKOS and FOAF. The tool has also taken into account the\nobsolescence of MARC and its substitution by FRBR and RDA. Its effectiveness\nwas evaluated applying a learning test proposed by RDA. Over 80 percent of the\nactions were carried out correctly.\n  Findings: The use of learning rules and the facilities of linked data make it\neasier for information organizations to reutilize products for authority\ncontrol and distribute them in a fair and efficient manner.\n  Research limitations / implications: The ISAD-G records were the ones\npresenting most errors. EAD was found to be second in the number of errors\nproduced. The rest of the formats --MARC 21, Dublin Core, FRAD, RDF, OWL, XBRL\nand FOAF-- showed fewer than 20 errors in total.\n  Practical implications: AUTHORIS offers institutions the means of sharing\ndata with a high level of stability, helping to detect records that are\nduplicated and contributing to lexical disambiguation and data enrichment.\n  Originality / value: The software combines the facilities of linked data, the\npotency of the algorithms for converting bibliographic data, and the precision\nof learning rules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 02:33:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Leiva-Mederos", "Amed", ""], ["Senso", "Jose A.", ""], ["Dominguez-Velasco", "Sandor", ""], ["Hipola", "Pedro", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2695", "submitter": "Laura Deal", "authors": "Laura Deal", "title": "Visualizing Digital Collections", "comments": "30 pages, 4 figures.

However, there is a considerable empirical\ncontroversy on which statistical model fits the citation distributions best.\nThis paper is concerned with rigorous empirical detection of power-law\nbehaviour in the distribution of citations received by the most highly cited\nscientific papers. We have used a large, novel data set on citations to\nscientific papers published between 1998 and 2002 drawn from Scopus. The\npower-law model is compared with a number of alternative models using a\nlikelihood ratio test. We have found that the power-law hypothesis is rejected\nfor around half of the Scopus fields of science. For these fields of science,\nthe Yule, power-law with exponential cut-off and log-normal distributions seem\nto fit the data better than the pure power-law model. On the other hand, when\nthe power-law hypothesis is not rejected, it is usually empirically\nindistinguishable from most of the alternative models. The pure power-law model\nseems to be the best model only for the most highly cited papers in \"Physics\nand Astronomy\". Overall, our results seem to support theories implying that the\nmost highly cited scientific papers follow the Yule, power-law with exponential\ncut-off or log-normal distribution.
