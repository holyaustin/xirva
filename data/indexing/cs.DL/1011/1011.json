We\nuse various indices for bibliometric performance for a sample of NOVA\nastronomers to compare to samples of astronomers worldwide, and from the United\nStates. We give much weight to normalising bibliometric measures by number of\nauthors, and number of years since first publication. In particular we\ncalculate the `Hirsh-index' normalized to number of authors and for\nfirst-author papers. Secondly, we consider the results of the 'Nederlands\nObservatorium van Wetenschap en Technologie' (NOWT; Netherlands Observatory of\nScience and Technology), which regularly publishes a report 'Science and\nTechnology Indicators'. We reproduce those results using publication lists from\ninstitutions in the Netherlands, again using ADS, and examine and discuss the\nconclusions and indications in these reports. We find that the NOVA researchers\nperform much better in bibliometric measures than samples drawn from IAU or AAS\nmembership lists. A more suitable comparison is one with the (tenured) staff of\nthe top-15 US institutions and there the NOVA staff performs in these respects\nas good or almost as good as that of American top institutes. From a citation\nanalysis through the use of ADS we conclude that the impact ratio of Dutch\nastronomical publications is rising which is opposite to what is reported by\nNOWT. This difference is most likely caused by a better separation of astronomy\nand physics in ADS than in World of Knowledge. ADS probably finds more\ncitations in conference proceedings, while the inclusion of citations to\narticles with their pre-print identifier could also help explain the difference\n(especially since the citation windows in the reports are short).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 07:52:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kamphuis", "P.", ""], ["van der Kruit", "P.
