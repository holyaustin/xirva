This exponential growth of new data\nboth enables and challenges effective astronomical research, requiring new\napproaches. Thus far, astronomy has tended to address these challenges in an\ninformal and ad hoc manner, with the necessary special expertise being assigned\nto e-Science or survey science. However, we see an even wider scope and\ntherefore promote a broader vision of this data-driven revolution in\nastronomical research. For astronomy to effectively cope with and reap the\nmaximum scientific return from existing and future large sky surveys,\nfacilities, and data-producing projects, we need our own information science\nspecialists. We therefore recommend the formal creation, recognition, and\nsupport of a major new discipline, which we call Astroinformatics.\nAstroinformatics includes a set of naturally-related specialties including data\norganization, data description, astronomical classification taxonomies,\nastronomical concept ontologies, data mining, machine learning, visualization,\nand astrostatistics. By virtue of its new stature, we propose that astronomy\nnow needs to integrate Astroinformatics as a formal sub-discipline within\nagency funding plans, university departments, research programs, graduate\ntraining, and undergraduate education. Now is the time for the recognition of\nAstroinformatics as an essential methodology of astronomical research. The\nfuture of astronomy depends on it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 02:21:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Borne", "Kirk D.", "", "George Mason University"]]}, {"id": "0909.3895", "submitter": "Kirk D.

Digital\nlibraries such as the NASA Astrophysics Data System permit the easy\naccumulation of a new type of bibliometric measure, the number of electronic\naccesses (``reads'') of individual articles. We explore various aspects of this\nnew measure. We examine the obsolescence function as measured by actual reads,\nand show that it can be well fit by the sum of four exponentials with very\ndifferent time constants. We compare the obsolescence function as measured by\nreadership with the obsolescence function as measured by citations. We find\nthat the citation function is proportional to the sum of two of the components\nof the readership function. This proves that the normative theory of citation\nis true in the mean. We further examine in detail the similarities and\ndifferences between the citation rate, the readership rate and the total\ncitations for individual articles, and discuss some of the causes. Using the\nnumber of reads as a bibliometric measure for individuals, we introduce the\nread-cite diagram to provide a two-dimensional view of an individual's\nscientific productivity. We develop a simple model to account for an\nindividual's reads and cites and use it to show that the position of a person\nin the read-cite diagram is a function of age, innate productivity, and work\nhistory. We show the age biases of both reads and cites, and develop two new\nbibliometric measures which have substantially less age bias than citations\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 20:29:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kurtz", "Michael J.", ""], ["Eichhorn", "Guenther", ""], ["Accomazzi", "Alberto", ""], ["Grant", "Carolyn S.", ""], ["Demleitner", "Markus", ""], ["Murray", "Stephen S.", ""], ["Martimbeau", "Nathalie", ""], ["Elwell", "Barbara", ""]]}]
