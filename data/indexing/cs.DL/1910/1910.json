To this end, ESFRI established a working group,\nwhich has proposed 21 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor the progress\nof the Research Infrastructures (RIs) addressed towards their objectives. The\nRIs were then asked to assess their relevance for their institution. The paper\naims to identify the relevance of certain indicators for particular groups of\nRIs by using cluster and discriminant analysis. This could contribute to\ndevelopment of a monitoring system, tailored to particular RIs.\n  To obtain a typology of the RIs, we first performed cluster analysis of the\nRIs according to their properties, which revealed clusters of RIs with similar\ncharacteristics, based on to the domain of operation, such as food, environment\nor engineering. Then, discriminant analysis was used to study how the relevance\nof the KPIs differs among the obtained clusters. This analysis revealed that\nthe percentage of RIs correctly classified into five clusters, using the KPIs,\nis 80%. Such a high percentage indicates that there are significant differences\nin the relevance of certain indicators, depending on the ESFRI domain of the\nRI. The indicators therefore need to be adapted to the type of infrastructure.\nIt is therefore proposed that the Strategic Working Groups of ESFRI addressing\nspecific domains should be involved in the tailored development of the\nmonitoring of pan-European RIs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 11:13:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kolar", "Jana", ""], ["Cugmas", "Marjan", ""], ["Ferligoj", "Anu\u0161ka", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00789", "submitter": "Mike Thelwall Prof", "authors": "Mike Thelwall, Nabeil Maflahi", "title": "Academic collaboration rates and citation associations vary\n  substantially between countries and fields", "comments": "Thelwall, M. & Maflahi, N.
