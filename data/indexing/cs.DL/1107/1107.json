The\napproach aims at sharing scientific terms in the field of nature conservation\nwith the goal of assisting different user communities with metadata compilation\nand information discovery. A multi-thesauri solution is proposed, based on a\nCommon Thesaurus Framework for Nature Conservation, where different well-known\nKnowledge Organization Systems are assembled and shared. It has been designed\naccording to semantic web and W3C recommendations employing SKOS standard\nmodels and Linked Data to publish the thesauri as a whole in\nmachine-understandable format. The outcome is a powerful framework satisfying\nthe requirements of modularity and openness for further thesaurus extension and\nupdating, interlinking among thesauri, and exploitability from other systems.\nThe paper supports the employment of Linked Data to deal with terminologies in\ncomplex domains such as nature conservation and it proposes a hands-on recipe\nto publish thesauri in the framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 16:50:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["De Martino", "Monica", ""], ["Albertoni", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3209", "submitter": "Josef Urban", "authors": "Jesse Alama, Kasper Brink, Lionel Mamane and Josef Urban", "title": "Large Formal Wikis: Issues and Solutions", "comments": "To appear in The Conference of Intelligent Computer Mathematics: CICM\n  2011", "journal-ref": "Intelligent Computer Mathematics 2011, LNCS 6824, pp. 149-165", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-22673-1_11", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present several steps towards large formal mathematical wikis.

While the proportion of direct\nself-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is\nrelatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10%\nof citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for\ncitations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences\nbetween fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship\nwhich defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also\nin the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a\npropensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network.\nOverall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration\nnetwork, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references,\nwe characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of\nthe knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have\nimplications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of\ncitation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific\ndisciplines over the past 50 years.
