The conclusion is that the aggregation\nof unit performance is of limited use due to the low levels of internal\ndevelopment of the websites, and so its use is not recommended for the design\nof rankings. Despite this, the internal analysis enabled the detection of,\namongst other things, a low correlation between page count and visibility due\nto the widespread use of subdirectories and problems accessing certain content.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 06:56:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ordu\u00f1a-Malea", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.5815", "submitter": "Enrique Ordu\\~na-Malea", "authors": "Enrique Orduna-Malea and Jose-Antonio Ontalba-Ruiperez", "title": "Selective linking from social platforms to university websites: a case\n  study of the Spanish academic system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Scientometrics Vol. 95, Issue 2, pp. 594-614 (2013)", "doi": "10.1007/s11192-012-0851-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mention indicators have frequently been used in Webometric studies because\nthey provide a powerful tool for determining the degree of visibility and\nimpact of web resources.

For this purpose, 141 URLs belonging to 76\nSpanish universities were compiled in 2010 (before Yahoo! stopped their link\nservices), and the number of links from 13 selected social platforms to these\nuniversities were calculated. Results confirm a good correlation between total\nexternal links and links that come from social platforms, with the exception of\nsome applications (such as Digg and Technorati). For those universities with a\nhigher number of total external links, the high correlation is only maintained\non Delicious and Wikipedia, which can be utilized as substitutes of total\nexternal links in the context analyzed. Notwithstanding, the global percentage\nof links from social platforms constitute only a small fraction of total links,\nalthough a positive trend is detected, especially in services such as Twitter,\nYoutube, and Facebook.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 06:58:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Orduna-Malea", "Enrique", ""], ["Ontalba-Ruiperez", "Jose-Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.5816", "submitter": "Enrique Ordu\\~na-Malea", "authors": "Enrique Ordu\\~na-Malea and Jos\\'e-Antonio Ontalba-Ruip\\'erez", "title": "Proposal for a multilevel university cybermetric analysis model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Scientometrics, v. 95(3), pp.863-884", "doi": "10.1007/s11192-012-0868-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  University online seats have gradually become complex systems of dynamic\ninformation where all their institutions and services are linked and\npotentially accessible.
