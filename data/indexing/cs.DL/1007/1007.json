The purpose of this work is the evaluation of responsiveness\nwhen remote users communicate with a human-readable knowledge base (KB).\nResponsiveness [R(s)] is considered here as a measure of service quality.\nMethod. The preferred method is operational analysis, a variation of classical\nstochastic theory, which allows for the study of user-system interaction with\nminimal computational effort. Analysis. The analysis is based on well-known\nperformance metrics, such as service ability, elapsed time, and throughput:\nfrom these metrics estimates of R(s) are derived analytically. Results.\nCritical points indicating congestion are obtained: these are limits on the\nnumber of admissible requests and the number of connected users. Also obtained\nis a sufficient condition for achieving flow balance between the KB host and\nthe request-relaying servers. Conclusions. When R(s) is within normal limits,\nusers should appreciate the benefits from using the services offered by their\nKB host. When bottlenecks are formed, R(s) declines, and the whole\ncommunication system heads for saturation. Flow balancing procedures are\nnecessary for the elimination of bottlenecks, which leads to a better resource\nmanagement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 11:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pentzaropoulos", "G.

In those cases, fractional allocations\nare attributed to each co-author with a summation equal to one. These\nallocations are tailored on the basis of each author contribution. It is\ndenoted \"Tailor Based Allocations (TBA)\" for multiple authorship. Several\nprotocols to TBA are suggested. The choice of a specific TBA may vary from one\ndiscipline to another. In addition, TBA is applied to the number of citations\nof a multiple author paper to have also this number conserved. Each author gets\nonly a specific fraction of the total number of citations according to its\nfractional paper allocation. The equivalent of the h-index obtained by using\nTBA is denoted the gh-index. It yields values which differ drastically from\nthose given by the h-index. The gh-index departs also from the `h-index\nrecently proposed by Hirsh to account for multiple authorship. Contrary to the\nh-index, the gh-index is a function of the total number of citations of each\npaper. A highly cited paper allows a better allocation for all co-authors while\na less cited paper contributes essentially to one or two of the co-authors. The\nscheme produces a substantial redistribution of the ranking of scientists in\nterms of quantitative records.
