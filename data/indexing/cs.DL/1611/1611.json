Durability requires care and maintenance of individual\ncomponents and the links between them. Astronomy is an ideal domain in which to\nstudy knowledge infrastructures, due to its long history, transparency, and\naccumulation of observational data over a period of centuries. Research\nreported here draws upon a long-term study of scientific data practices to ask\nquestions about the durability and fragility of infrastructures for data in\nastronomy. Methods include interviews, ethnography, and document analysis. As\nastronomy has become a digital science, the community has invested in shared\ninstruments, data standards, digital archives, metadata and discovery services,\nand other relatively durable infrastructure components. Several features of\ndata practices in astronomy contribute to the fragility of that infrastructure.\nThese include different archiving practices between ground- and space-based\nmissions, between sky surveys and investigator-led projects, and between\nobservational and simulated data. Infrastructure components are tightly\ncoupled, based on international agreements. However, the durability of these\ninfrastructures relies on much invisible work - cataloging, metadata, and other\nlabor conducted by information professionals. Continual investments in care and\nmaintenance of the human and technical components of these infrastructures are\nnecessary for sustainability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:40:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Borgman", "Christine L.", ""], ["Darch", "Peter T.", ""], ["Sands", "Ashley E.", ""], ["Golshan", "Milena S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.00097", "submitter": "Gopal P.
