A sample of\narticles was evaluated by using both methods and agreement was analyzed by\nweighted Cohen's kappas. ANVUR presented results as indicating an overall\n'good' or 'more than adequate' agreement. This paper re-examines the experiment\nresults according to the available statistical guidelines for interpreting\nkappa values, by showing that the degree of agreement, always in the range\n0.09-0.42 has to be interpreted, for all research fields, as unacceptable, poor\nor, in a few cases, as, at most, fair. The only notable exception, confirmed\nalso by a statistical meta-analysis, was a moderate agreement for economics and\nstatistics (Area 13) and its sub-fields. We show that the experiment protocol\nadopted in Area 13 was substantially modified with respect to all the other\nresearch fields, to the point that results for economics and statistics have to\nbe considered as fatally flawed. The evidence of a poor agreement supports the\nconclusion that IR and bibliometrics do not produce similar results, and that\nthe adoption of both methods in the Italian research assessment possibly\nintroduced systematic and unknown biases in its final results. The conclusion\nreached by ANVUR must be reversed: the available evidence does not justify at\nall the joint use of IR and bibliometrics within the same research assessment\nexercise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 08:17:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 13:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Baccini", "Alberto", ""], ["De Nicolao", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.00755", "submitter": "Olegs Verhodubs", "authors": "Olegs Verhodubs", "title": "Towards the Ontology Web Search Engine", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The project of the Ontology Web Search Engine is presented in this paper.

This paper takes a scientometric approach to assessing the\nproduction, themes and theoretical influences of those papers over time. The\nmost productive authors, universities, and regions, as well as patterns of\nresearch collaboration, were analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the CIS\nlandscape. This study reveals that the general culture of the discipline\nremained constant throughout the period, none of its theoretical influences or\ntopics having gained significantly in popularity. However, certain limitations\nin the way research is conducted (lack of collaboration, inadequate academic\npolicies, etc.) hinder its potential for future growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 20:15:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Ziyun", ""]]}]
