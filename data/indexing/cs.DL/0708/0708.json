This has prompted the use of text\nmining tools to extract key biological information. Previous studies have\nreported extensive modification of existing generic text processors to process\nbiological text. However, this requirement for modification had not been\nexamined. In this study, we have constructed Muscorian, using MontyLingua, a\ngeneric text processor. It uses a two-layered generalization-specialization\nparadigm previously proposed where text was generically processed to a suitable\nintermediate format before domain-specific data extraction techniques are\napplied at the specialization layer. Evaluation using a corpus and experts\nindicated 86-90% precision and approximately 30% recall in extracting\nprotein-protein interactions, which was comparable to previous studies using\neither specialized biological text processing tools or modified existing tools.\nOur study had also demonstrated the flexibility of the two-layered\ngeneralization-specialization paradigm by using the same generalization layer\nfor two specialized information extraction tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2007 01:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Maurice HT", ""], ["Lefevre", "Christophe", ""], ["Nicholas", "Kevin R.", ""], ["Lin", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1150", "submitter": "Marko Antonio Rodriguez", "authors": "Marko A.
