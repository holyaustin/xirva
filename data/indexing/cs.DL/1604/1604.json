The case study is an\nanalysis of the first 25 years online of the University of Bologna. The focus\nof this work is primarily methodological: several different issues are\npresented, starting with the fact that the University of Bologna website has\nbeen excluded for thirteen years from the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine,\nand possible solutions are proposed and applied. The article is organised in\nthree parts: in the first one, some of the fundamental concepts on web archives\nand the preservation of born digital sources are introduced. Then the\nreconstruction of the University of Bologna web's past is presented. Finally\nthe future of this research is described, presenting a specific case study in\nwhich the historian's craft will be challenged by a completely different issue,\nnamely the large amount of data available in the university digital library.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Apr 2016 12:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Nanni", "Federico", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06053", "submitter": "Xin Guo", "authors": "Xin Guo, Hyunseok Park, Christopher L.

This paper presents three months of research on U.S.\npatents in the field of patent analysis. The methodology consists of using\nsearch terms to locate the most representative international and US patent\nclasses and determines the overlap of those classes to arrive at the final set\nof patents and using the prediction model developed by Benson and Magee to\ncalculate the technological improvement rate for the technological domains. My\nresearch focused on the Biochemical Pharmacology technological area and\nselecting relevant patents for technological domains and sub-domains within\nthis area. The goal is to better understand structure of technology domain and\nunderstand how fast the domains and their sub-domains progress. The method I\nused is developed by Benson and Magee which is called the Classification\nOverlap Method1, it provides a reliable and largely automated way to break the\npatent database into understandable technological domains where progress can be\nmeasured.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 07:04:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Xin", ""], ["Park", "Hyunseok", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06246", "submitter": "Mike Thelwall", "authors": "Mike Thelwall", "title": "Are there too many uncited articles?

One possible reason is that there\nmight be more uncited articles than would be predicted by any model if some\narticles are inherently uncitable. Using data from 23 different Scopus\ncategories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of\nuncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to\nhave much closer fits. It also introduces two new models, zero inflated\ndiscretised lognormal distribution and the zero inflated hooked power law\ndistribution and algorithms to fit them. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated\nversion of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the\nstandard version and in 15 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the\nhooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero\ninflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked\npower law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal\nmodels fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23\ntimes. Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of\nacademic-related magazines in Scopus categories. In conclusion, future citation\nanalysis and research indicators should take into account uncitable articles,\nand the best fitting distribution for sets of citation counts from a single\nsubject and year is either the zero inflated discretised lognormal or zero\ninflated hooked power law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 10:29:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Thelwall", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06685", "submitter": "John Mingers", "authors": "John Mingers and Liying Yang", "title": "Evaluating Journal Quality: A Review of Journal Citation Indicators and\n  Ranking in Business and Management", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evaluating the quality of academic journal is becoming increasing important\nwithin the context of research performance evaluation. Traditionally, journals\nhave been ranked by peer review lists such as that of the Association of\nBusiness Schools (UK) or though their journal impact factor (JIF). However,\nseveral new indicators have been developed, such as the h-index, SJR, SNIP and\nthe Eigenfactor which take into account different factors and therefore have\ntheir own particular biases. In this paper we evaluate these metrics both\ntheoretically and also through an empirical study of a large set of business\nand management journals. We show that even though the indicators appear highly\ncorrelated in fact they lead to large differences in journal rankings. We\ncontextualize our results in terms of the UK's large scale research assessment\nexercise (the RAE/REF) and particularly the ABS journal ranking list. We\nconclude that no one indicator is superior but that the h-index (which includes\nthe productivity of a journal) and SNIP (which aims to normalize for field\neffects) may be the most effective at the moment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 14:40:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 09:15:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Mingers", "John", ""], ["Yang", "Liying", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07997", "submitter": "Francisco  Couto", "authors": "Camila Ramos and Marco Louro and Miguel Santos and Francisco M.

These collections may reach huge sizes, but are formed mostly of\ndocuments that are near-copies of others. Traditional techniques for indexing\nthese collections fail to properly exploit their regularities in order to\nreduce space.\n  We introduce new techniques for compressing inverted indexes that exploit\nthis near-copy regularity. They are based on run-length, Lempel-Ziv, or grammar\ncompression of the differential inverted lists, instead of the usual practice\nof gap-encoding them. We show that, in this highly repetitive setting, our\ncompression methods significantly reduce the space obtained with classical\ntechniques, at the price of moderate slowdowns. Moreover, our best methods are\nuniversal, that is, they do not need to know the versioning structure of the\ncollection, nor that a clear versioning structure even exists.\n  We also introduce compressed self-indexes in the comparison. These are\ndesigned for general strings (not only natural language texts) and represent\nthe text collection plus the index structure (not an inverted index) in\nintegrated form. We show that these techniques can compress much further, using\na small fraction of the space required by our new inverted indexes. Yet, they\nare orders of magnitude slower.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 16:05:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 00:36:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Claude", "Francisco", ""], ["Fari\u00f1a", "Antonio", ""], ["Mart\u00ednez-Prieto", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Navarro", "Gonzalo", ""]]}]
