These systems give users the opportunity to\nadd data items and to attach their own metadata (or tags) to stored data. The\nresult is an effective content management tool for individual users. Recent\nstudies, however, suggest that, as tagging communities grow, the added content\nand the metadata become harder to manage due to an ease in content diversity.\nThus, mechanisms that cope with increase of diversity are fundamental to\nimprove the scalability and usability of collaborative tagging systems. This\npaper analyzes whether usage patterns can be harnessed to improve navigability\nin a growing knowledge space. To this end, it presents a characterization of\ntwo collaborative tagging communities that target scientific literature:\nCiteULike and Bibsonomy. We explore three main directions: First, we analyze\nthe tagging activity distribution across the user population. Second, we define\nnew metrics for similarity in user interest and use these metrics to uncover\nthe structure of the tagging communities we study. The structure we uncover\nsuggests a clear segmentation of interests into a large number of individuals\nwith unique preferences and a core set of users with interspersed interests.\nFinally, we offer preliminary results that demonstrate that the interest-based\nstructure of the tagging community can be used to facilitate content usage as\ncommunities scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2007 23:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2007 19:38:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2007 19:44:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2007 05:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Santos-Neto", "Elizeu", ""], ["Ripeanu", "Matei", ""], ["Iamnitchi", "Adriana", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.2106", "submitter": "Finn {\\AA}rup Nielsen", "authors": "Finn Aarup Nielsen", "title": "Scientific citations in Wikipedia", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "First Monday, 12(8), 2007 August", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The Internet-based encyclopaedia Wikipedia has grown to become one of the\nmost visited web-sites on the Internet.

However, given the field's\nhistory of preprints and eprints, it is well suited to a change to a fully Open\nAccess publishing model. Data shows that 90% of HEP published literature is\nfreely available online, meaning that HEP libraries have little need for\nexpensive journal subscriptions. As libraries begin to cancel journal\nsubscriptions, the peer review process will lose its primary source of funding.\nOpen Access publishing models can potentially address this issue. European\nphysicists and funding agencies are proposing a consortium, SCOAP3, that might\nsolve many of the objections to traditional Open Access publishing models in\nParticle Physics. These proposed changes should be viewed as a starting point\nfor a serious look at the field's publication model, and are at least worthy of\nattention, if not adoption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 May 2007 20:28:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Brooks", "Travis C.", ""]]}]
