However, reviewers may be biased by authors' prestige or other\ncharacteristics. Double-blind peer review, in which the authors' identities are\nmasked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer bias.\nAlthough intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review\nin reducing bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of\ndouble-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of\n5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning\nRepresentations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its\nreviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in\n2018. We find that after switching to double-blind review, the scores given to\nthe most prestigious authors significantly decreased. However, because many of\nthese papers were above the threshold for acceptance, the change did not affect\npaper acceptance decisions significantly. Nevertheless, we show that\ndouble-blind peer review may have improved the quality of the selections by\nlimiting other (non-author-prestige) biases. Specifically, papers rejected in\nthe single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the\ndouble-blind format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies\npoorer quality papers. Interestingly, an apparently unrelated change - the\nchange of rating scale from 10 to 4 points - likely reduced prestige bias\nsignificantly, to an extent that affected papers' acceptance. These results\nprovide some support for the effectiveness of double-blind review in reducing\nprestige bias, while opening new research directions on the impact of peer\nreview formats.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 18:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Mengyi", ""], ["Danfa", "Jainabou Barry", ""], ["Teplitskiy", "Misha", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.03069", "submitter": "Nicolas Robinson-Garcia", "authors": "Gabriela F.

Solo\nresearch is a special case of academic publishing where scientists compete\nindividually, sending clear signals about their research ability.

The highest share of solo research for\nboth genders is noted for middle-aged scientists working as associate\nprofessors rather than for young scientists as in previous studies.

We observe how self-attention focuses on words that are highly\nrelated to the domain of the article. Particularly, a small subset of\nvocabulary words tends to receive most of the attention. We compare and\nevaluate the subset of the most attended words with feature selection methods\nnormally used for text classification in order to characterize self-attention\nas a possible feature selection approach. Using ConceptNet as ground truth, we\nalso find that attended words are more related to the research fields of the\narticles. However, conventional feature selection methods are still a better\noption to learn classifiers from scratch. This result suggests that, while\nself-attention identifies domain-relevant terms, the discriminatory information\nin BERT is encoded in the contextualized outputs and the classification layer.\nIt also raises the question whether injecting feature selection methods in the\nself-attention mechanism could further optimize single sequence classification\nusing transformers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 13:22:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia-Silva", "Andres", ""], ["Gomez-Perez", "Jose Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.08293", "submitter": "Anastasios Nentidis", "authors": "Anastasios Nentidis, Anastasia Krithara, Grigorios Tsoumakas, Georgios\n  Paliouras", "title": "What is all this new MeSH about?

To this end, we propose a framework to categorize new descriptors\nbased on their current relation to older descriptors.

The results\nshow that only about 25% of new MeSH descriptors correspond to new emerging\nconcepts, whereas the rest were previously covered by one or more existing\ndescriptors, either implicitly or explicitly. Most of them were covered by a\nsingle existing descriptor and they usually end up as descendants of it in the\ncurrent hierarchy, gradually leading towards a more fine-grained MeSH\nvocabulary.

Therefore,\nscientific dissemination is affected in timeliness, quality, and fairness.\nHere, to solve this issue, we propose a blockchain-based incentive system that\nrewards scientists for peer-reviewing other scientists' work and that builds up\ntrust and reputation. We designed a privacy-oriented protocol of smart\ncontracts called Ants-Review that allows authors to issue a bounty for open\nanonymous peer-reviews on Ethereum.

We find that a paper's the first affiliation and\nthe corresponding affiliation are highly consistent at the country level, with\nover 98% of the match on average. However, the match at the institution level\nis much lower, which varies significantly with time and country. Hence, for\nstudies at the country level, using the first and corresponding affiliations\nare almost the same. But we may need to take more cautions to select\naffiliation when the institution is the focus of the investigation. In the\nmeanwhile, we find some evidence that the recorded corresponding information in\nthe WoS database has undergone some changes since 2013, which sheds light on\nfuture studies on the comparison of different databases or the affiliation\naccuracy of WoS. Our finding relies on the records of WoS, which may not be\nentirely accurate. Given the scale of the analysis, our findings can serve as a\nuseful reference for further studies when country allocation or institute\nallocation is needed. Existing studies on comparisons of straight counting\nmethods usually cover a limited number of papers, a particular research field\nor a limited range of time.
