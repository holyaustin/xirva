Whether the use of these advanced methods, which are often difficult\nto implement, is warranted depends on whether the accuracy of the most basic\ndisambiguation methods, which only use the author's last name and initials, is\nsufficient for a particular purpose. We derive realistic estimates for the\naccuracy of simple, initials-based methods using simulated bibliographic\ndatasets in which the true identities of authors are known. Based on the\nsimulations in five diverse disciplines we find that the first initial method\nalready correctly identifies 97% of authors. An alternative simple method,\nwhich takes all initials into account, is typically two times less accurate,\nexcept in certain datasets that can be identified by applying a simple\ncriterion. Finally, we introduce a new name-based method that combines the\nfeatures of first initial and all initials methods by implicitly taking into\naccount the last name frequency and the size of the dataset. This hybrid method\nreduces the fraction of incorrectly identified authors by 10-30% over the first\ninitial method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 21:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Milojevi\u0107", "Sta\u0161a", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.1166", "submitter": "Peter Gloor", "authors": "Tobias Futterer, Peter A.

This paper aims to provide systematic\nevidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the\nbiomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million\ndocuments covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between\n2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was\nanalyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and\nspecialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10%\nof PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The\nrelationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at\nthe level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior\nvaries between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and\ncitations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different\nfrom those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles\nand the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to\nfacilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light\non the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure\nresearch impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 13:09:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Haustein", "Stefanie", ""], ["Peters", "Isabella", ""], ["Sugimoto", "Cassidy R.", ""], ["Thelwall", "Mike", ""], ["Larivi\u00e8re", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.1946", "submitter": "Eric Medvet", "authors": "A.

Most biological databases contain significant\nquantities of textual annotation, which often contains the richest source of\nknowledge. Many databases reuse existing knowledge, during the curation process\nannotations are often propagated between entries. However, this is often not\nmade explicit. Therefore, it can be hard, potentially impossible, for a reader\nto identify where an annotation originated from. Within this work we attempt to\nidentify annotation provenance and track its subsequent propagation.\nSpecifically, we exploit annotation reuse within the UniProt Knowledgebase\n(UniProtKB), at the level of individual sentences. We describe a visualisation\napproach for the provenance and propagation of sentences in UniProtKB which\nenables a large-scale statistical analysis. Initially levels of sentence reuse\nwithin UniProtKB were analysed, showing that reuse is heavily prevalent, which\nenables the tracking of provenance and propagation. By analysing sentences\nthroughout UniProtKB, a number of interesting propagation patterns were\nidentified, covering over 100, 000 sentences. Over 8000 sentences remain in the\ndatabase after they have been removed from the entries where they originally\noccurred. Analysing a subset of these sentences suggest that approximately 30%\nare erroneous, whilst 35% appear to be inconsistent. These results suggest that\nbeing able to visualise sentence propagation and provenance can aid in the\ndetermination of the accuracy and quality of textual annotation.

R-Score has\nsome interesting properties: (a) it does not require access to the contents of\npublished material, (b) it can be curated to produce highly accurate results,\nand (c) it can be naturally used to compare publication output of research\ngroups (e.g., graduate programs) inside a same country, geographical area, or\nacross the world.
