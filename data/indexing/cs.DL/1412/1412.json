The ASN is peculiar since it makes use of bibliometric indicators\nwith associated thresholds as one of the parameters used to assess applicants.\nOverall, more than 59000 applications were submitted, and the results have been\nmade publicly available for a short period of time, including the values of the\nquantitative indicators for each applicant.

A widely used measure of scientific\nimpact is citations, with a growing body of literature focused on predicting\nthe number of citations obtained by any given publication. The effectiveness of\nsuch predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law\ndistribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are\nextremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare.\nGiven this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked\nby many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: \"Will\nthis paper increase my h-index?\" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7\nmillion authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from\nthe premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific\nimpact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to\nincrease the primary author's h-index. We find that the researcher's authority\non the publication topic and the venue in which the paper is published are\ncrucial factors to the increase of the primary author's h-index, while the\ntopic popularity and the co-authors' h-indices are of surprisingly little\nrelevance. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5%\npotential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's\nh-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a\nself-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that\nit will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current\nh-index in five years. We conclude that our findings on the quantification of\nscientific impact can help researchers to expand their influence and more\neffectively leverage their position of \"standing on the shoulders of giants.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2014 20:36:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Yuxiao", ""], ["Johnson", "Reid A.", ""], ["Chawla", "Nitesh V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5050", "submitter": "Michael Schreiber", "authors": "Michael Schreiber", "title": "Restricting the h-index to a citation time window: A case study of a\n  timed Hirsch index", "comments": "6 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Informetrics 9, 150-155 (2015)", "doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The h-index has been shown to increase in many cases mostly because of\ncitations to rather old publications.
