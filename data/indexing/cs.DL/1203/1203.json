Classification usually takes place at\nthe level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most\npopular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems\nhave two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and\nthey have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these\nlimitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification\nsystems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology,\npublications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The\nmethodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present\nan application in which a classification system is produced that includes\nalmost ten million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this\nclassification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the\nproposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative\nsimplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory\nrequirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance\non direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the\nmethodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types\nof relations, for instance based on bibliographic coupling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 17:45:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Waltman", "Ludo", ""], ["van Eck", "Nees Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.0788", "submitter": "Krzysztof Suchecki", "authors": "Krzysztof Suchecki, Alkim Almila Akdag Salah, Cheng Gao, Andrea\n  Scharnhorst", "title": "Evolution of Wikipedia's Category Structure", "comments": "Preprint of an article submitted for consideration in Advances in\n  Complex Systems (2012) http://www.worldscinet.com/acs/, 19 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wikipedia, as a social phenomenon of collaborative knowledge creating, has\nbeen studied extensively from various points of views.
