The proponents of the Web of Data envision much of\nthe world's data being interrelated and openly accessible to the general\npublic. This vision is analogous in many ways to the Web of Documents of common\nknowledge, but instead of making documents and media openly accessible, the\nfocus is on making data openly accessible. In providing data for public use,\nthere has been a stimulated interest in a movement dubbed Open Data. Open Data\nis analogous in many ways to the Open Source movement. However, instead of\nfocusing on software, Open Data is focused on the legal and licensing issues\naround publicly exposed data. Together, various technological and legal tools\nare laying the groundwork for the future of global-scale data management on the\nWeb. As of today, in its early form, the Web of Data hosts a variety of data\nsets that include encyclopedic facts, drug and protein data, metadata on music,\nbooks and scholarly articles, social network representations, geospatial\ninformation, and many other types of information. The size and diversity of the\nWeb of Data is a demonstration of the flexibility of the underlying standards\nand the overall feasibility of the project as a whole. The purpose of this\narticle is to provide a review of the technological underpinnings of the Web of\nData as well as some of the hurdles that need to be overcome if the Web of Data\nis to emerge as the defacto medium for data representation, distribution, and\nultimately, processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 01:59:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1776", "submitter": "Vincent Lariviere", "authors": "Vincent Lariviere, Yves Gingras", "title": "On the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

Using all the papers published in Web of Science\nin 2000, we define the degree of interdisciplinarity of a given paper as the\npercentage of its cited references made to journals of other disciplines. We\nshow that, although for all disciplines combined there is no clear correlation\nbetween the level of interdisciplinarity of papers and their citation rates,\nthere are nonetheless some disciplines in which a higher level of\ninterdisciplinarity is related to a higher citation rates. For other\ndisciplines, citations decline as interdisciplinarity grows. One characteristic\nis visible in all disciplines: highly disciplinary and highly interdisciplinary\npapers have a low scientific impact. This suggests that there might be an\noptimum of interdisciplinarity beyond which the research is too dispersed to\nfind its niche and under which it is too mainstream to have high impact.\nFinally, the relationship between interdisciplinarity and scientific impact is\nhighly determined by the citation characteristics of the disciplines involved:\npapers citing citation intensive disciplines are more likely to be cited by\nthose disciplines and, hence, obtain higher citation scores than papers citing\nnon citation intensive disciplines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2009 19:08:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lariviere", "Vincent", ""], ["Gingras", "Yves", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2615", "submitter": "Wu Zhi-Xi", "authors": "Zhi-Xi Wu and Petter Holme", "title": "Modeling scientific-citation patterns and other triangle-rich acyclic\n  networks", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.Rev.E 80, 037101 (2009).", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.80.037101", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a model of the evolution of the networks of scientific citations.\nThe model takes an out-degree distribution (distribution of number of\ncitations) and two parameters as input.

Merton's theory of cumulative advantage in\nscience (Matthew Effect), several empirical studies have tried to measure its\npresence at the level of papers, individual researchers, institutions or\ncountries. However, these studies seldom control for the intrinsic \"quality\" of\npapers or of researchers--\"better\" (however defined) papers or researchers\ncould receive higher citation rates because they are indeed of better quality.\nUsing an original method for controlling the intrinsic value of\npapers--identical duplicate papers published in different journals with\ndifferent impact factors--this paper shows that the journal in which papers are\npublished have a strong influence on their citation rates, as duplicate papers\npublished in high impact journals obtain, on average, twice as much citations\nas their identical counterparts published in journals with lower impact\nfactors. The intrinsic value of a paper is thus not the only reason a given\npaper gets cited or not; there is a specific Matthew effect attached to\njournals and this gives to paper published there an added value over and above\ntheir intrinsic quality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 17:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Lariviere", "Vincent", ""], ["Gingras", "Yves", ""]]}]
