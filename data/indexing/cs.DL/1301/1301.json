A word storm is a\ngroup of word clouds, in which each cloud represents a single document,\njuxtaposed to allow the viewer to compare and contrast the documents. We\npresent a novel algorithm that creates a coordinated word storm, in which words\nthat appear in multiple documents are placed in the same location, using the\nsame color and orientation, in all of the corresponding clouds. In this way,\nsimilar documents are represented by similar-looking word clouds, making them\neasier to compare and contrast visually. We evaluate the algorithm in two ways:\nfirst, an automatic evaluation based on document classification; and second, a\nuser study. The results confirm that unlike standard word clouds, a coordinated\nword storm better allows for visual comparison of documents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 17:02:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Castella", "Quim", ""], ["Sutton", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.0801", "submitter": "Loet Leydesdorff", "authors": "Loet Leydesdorff, Caroline Wagner, Han Woo Park, and Jonathan Adams", "title": "International Collaboration in Science: The Global Map and the Network", "comments": "El Profesional de la Informaci\\'on (2013, in press)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The network of international co-authorship relations has been dominated by\ncertain European nations and the USA, but this network is rapidly expanding at\nthe global level.

Since each of the dominant articles describes the use of an assay\nthat can find only one function or a small group of functions, this leads to\nsubstantial biases in what we know about the function of many proteins.\nMass-spectrometry, microscopy and RNAi experiments dominate high throughput\nexperiments. Consequently, the functional information derived from these\nexperiments is mostly of the subcellular location of proteins, and of the\nparticipation of proteins in embryonic developmental pathways. For some\norganisms, the information provided by different studies overlap by a large\namount. We also show that the information provided by high throughput\nexperiments is less specific than those provided by low throughput experiments.\nGiven the experimental techniques available, certain biases in protein function\nannotation due to high-throughput experiments are unavoidable.

This collaborative behavior and the\npool of user-generated metadata create opportunities to improve existing\nsystems and to design new mechanisms. However, to realize this potential, it is\nnecessary to understand the usage characteristics of current systems. This work\naddresses this issue characterizing three tagging systems (CiteULike, Connotea\nand del.icio.us) while focusing on three aspects: i) the patterns of\ninformation (tags and items) production; ii) the temporal dynamics of users'\ntag vocabularies; and, iii) the social aspects of tagging systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 23:31:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Santos-Neto", "Elizeu", ""], ["Condon", "David", ""], ["Andrade", "Nazareno", ""], ["Iamnitchi", "Adriana", ""], ["Ripeanu", "Matei", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.6591", "submitter": "Leon Abdillah", "authors": "Leon Andretti Abdillah", "title": "PDF articles metadata harvester", "comments": "6 Pages, 9 images, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Jurnal Komputer dan Informatika (JKI). 10 (2012) 1-7", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Scientific journals are very important in recording the finding from\nresearchers around the world.

Assuming that meaning\ncannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual\nredundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of\ninformation. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be\nprovided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is\nredundant because based on \"pure sets,\" that is, without subtraction of mutual\ninformation in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case (e.g.,\nof a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual\nredundancy is equal to mutual information (Rxyz = Txyz); but when the\ndimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement\nin N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Luhmann's\nsocial-systems theory and/or Giddens' structuration theory, mutual redundancy\ncan be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: different\nmeaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus\nof (\"absent\") options can then be generated that add to the redundancy.\nLuhmann's \"functional (sub)systems\" of expectations or Giddens' \"rule-resource\nsets\" are positioned mutually, but coupled operationally in events or\n\"instantiated\" in actions. Shannon-type information is generated by the\nmediation, but the \"structures\" are (re-)positioned towards one another as sets\nof (potentially counterfactual) expectations. The structural differences among\nthe coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in\nreflexive and anticipatory communications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 07:26:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 13:40:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2013 21:57:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""], ["Ivanova", "Inga A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7192", "submitter": "Michael Schreiber", "authors": "Michael Schreiber", "title": "Empirical Evidence for the Relevance of Fractional Scoring in the\n  Calculation of Percentile Rank Scores", "comments": "10 pages, 4 tables, accepted for publication in Journal of American\n  Society for Information Science and Technology", "journal-ref": "Journal of the American Society for Information Science and\n  Technology, 64(4), 861-867 (2013)", "doi": "10.1002/asi.22774", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Fractional scoring has been proposed to avoid inconsistencies in the\nattribution of publications to percentile rank classes.
