Bradfordizing is used\nfor generating core document sets for subject-specific questions and to reorder\nresult sets from distributed searches. The method will be applied and tested in\na controlled scenario of scientific literature databases from social and\npolitical sciences, economics, psychology and medical science (SOLIS, SoLit,\nUSB Koeln Opac, CSA Sociological Abstracts, World Affairs Online, Psyndex and\nMedline) and 164 standardized topics. An evaluation of the method and its\neffects is carried out in two laboratory-based information retrieval\nexperiments (CLEF and KoMoHe) using a controlled document corpus and human\nrelevance assessments. The results show that Bradfordizing is a very robust\nmethod for re-ranking the main document types (journal articles and monographs)\nin today's digital libraries (DL). The IR tests show that relevance\ndistributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if articles in\nthe core are compared with articles in the succeeding zones. The items in the\ncore are significantly more often assessed as relevant, than items in zone 2\n(z2) or zone 3 (z3). The improvements between the zones are statistically\nsignificant based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired T-Test.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Dec 2008 10:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mayr", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3563", "submitter": "Laurent Romary", "authors": "Laurent Romary (LORIA)", "title": "Questions & Answers for TEI Newcomers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Jahrbuch f\\\"ur Computerphilologie 10 (2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper provides an introduction to the Text Encoding Initia-tive (TEI),\nfocused at bringing in newcomers who have to deal with a digital document\nproject and are looking at the capacity that the TEI environment may have to\nfulfil his needs.

In this study, we test the results of two recently\navailable algorithms for the decomposition of large matrices against two\ncontent-based classifications of journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the\nfield/subfield classification of Glaenzel & Schubert (2003). The content-based\nschemes allow for the attribution of more than a single category to a journal,\nwhereas the algorithms maximize the ratio of within-category citations over\nbetween-category citations in the aggregated category-category citation matrix.\nBy adding categories, indexers generate between-category citations, which may\nenrich the database, for example, in the case of inter-disciplinary\ndevelopments. The consequent indexer effects are significant in sparse areas of\nthe matrix more than in denser ones. Algorithmic decompositions, on the other\nhand, are more heavily skewed towards a relatively small number of categories,\nwhile this is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of content-based\nclassifications. Because of the indexer effects, science policy studies and the\nsociology of science should be careful when using content-based\nclassifications, which are made for bibliographic disclosure, and not for the\npurpose of analyzing latent structures in scientific communications. Despite\nthe large differences among them, the four classification schemes enable us to\ngenerate surprisingly similar maps of science at the global level. Erroneous\nclassifications are cancelled as noise at the aggregate level, but may disturb\nthe evaluation locally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Dec 2008 03:45:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Rafols", "Ismael", ""], ["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}]
