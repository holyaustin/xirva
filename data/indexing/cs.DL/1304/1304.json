The 2-year journal impact factor (2-JIF) counts citations to one and two\nyear old articles, while the 5-year journal impact factor (5-JIF) counts\ncitations from one to five year old articles. Nevertheless, these indicators\nare not comparable among fields of science for two reasons: (i) each field has\na different impact maturity time, and (ii) because of systematic differences in\npublication and citation behaviour across disciplines. In fact, the 5-JIF\nfirstly appeared in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) in 2007 with the purpose\nof making more comparable impacts in fields in which impact matures slowly.\nHowever, there is not an optimal fixed impact maturity time valid for all the\nfields.

Therefore, there is a problem when comparing\na journal from a field in which impact matures slowly with a journal from a\nfield in which impact matures rapidly.

The Categories\nNormalized Impact Factor (CNIF) based on the JCR subject category list is\nproposed and compared with the IF. This normalization is achieved by\nconsidering all the indexing categories of each journal. An empirical\napplication, with one hundred journals in two or more subject categories of\neconomics and business, shows that the gap between rankings is reduced around\n32% in the journals analyzed. This gap is obtained as the maximum distance\namong the ranking percentiles from all categories where each journal is\nincluded.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 12:36:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dorta-Gonzalez", "Pablo", ""], ["Dorta-Gonzalez", "Maria Isabel", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.5110", "submitter": "Pablo Dorta-Gonzalez", "authors": "Pablo Dorta-Gonzalez and Maria Isabel Dorta-Gonzalez", "title": "Central indexes to the citation distribution: A complement to the\n  h-index", "comments": "23 pages, 3 tables and 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Scientometrics 88(3), 729-745 (2011)", "doi": "10.1007/s11192-011-0453-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The citation distribution of a researcher shows the impact of their\nproduction and determines the success of their scientific career.

This is true whether we are considering a data set, a\ncomputational workflow, a peer-reviewed publication or a simple scientific\nclaim with supportive evidence.

We identify the specific\nneed for identifying or distinguishing between the various roles assumed by\nagents manipulating digital artifacts, such as author, contributor and curator.\n  We present the Provenance, Authoring and Versioning ontology (PAV): a\nlightweight ontology for capturing just enough descriptions essential for\ntracking the provenance, authoring and versioning of web resources. We argue\nthat such descriptions are essential for digital scientific content. PAV\ndistinguishes between contributors, authors and curators of content and\ncreators of representations in addition to the provenance of originating\nresources that have been accessed, transformed and consumed. We explore five\nprojects (and communities) that have adopted PAV illustrating their usage\nthrough concrete examples. Moreover, we present mappings that show how PAV\nextends the PROV-O ontology to support broader interoperability.\n  The authors strived to keep PAV lightweight and compact by including only\nthose terms that have demonstrated to be pragmatically useful in existing\napplications, and by recommending terms from existing ontologies when\nplausible.\n  We analyze and compare PAV with related approaches, namely Provenance\nVocabulary, DC Terms and BIBFRAME. We identify similarities and analyze their\ndifferences with PAV, outlining strengths and weaknesses of our proposed model.\nWe specify SKOS mappings that align PAV with DC Terms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2013 16:48:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 16:18:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2013 15:34:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 09:31:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 22 Nov 2013 14:57:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 6 Dec 2013 23:53:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ciccarese", "Paolo", ""], ["Soiland-Reyes", "Stian", ""], ["Belhajjame", "Khalid", ""], ["Gray", "Alasdair J G", ""], ["Goble", "Carole", ""], ["Clark", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7300", "submitter": "Jason Priem", "authors": "Stefanie Haustein (1), Isabella Peters (2), Judit Bar-Ilan (3), Jason\n  Priem (4), Hadas Shema (3), Jens Terliesner (2) ((1) \\'Ecole de\n  biblioth\\'economie et des sciences de l'information, Universit\\'e de\n  Montr\\'eal, Montr\\'eal, (2) Department of Information Science,\n  Heinrich-Heine-University, (3) Department of Information Science, Bar-Ilan\n  University, (4) School of Information and Library Science, University of\n  North Carolina at Chapel Hill)", "title": "Coverage and adoption of altmetrics sources in the bibliometric\n  community", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures.

As\nexpected, coverage varied: 82% of articles published by sampled\nbibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28% were\nincluded in CiteULike.

Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools\nwere affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied\nwidely. 68% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu,\nMendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of\nthose responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and\nprofessionally.

In both networks, the l-index has poor\ncorrelation with betweenness but correlates with degree and Eigenvector. Being\na local measure, one can take advantage by using the l-index because it carries\nmore information about its neighbors when compared with degree centrality,\nindeed it requires less time to compute when compared with Eigenvector\ncentrality. Results suggests that l-index produces better results than degree\nand Eigenvector measures for ranking purposes, becoming suitable as a tool to\nperform this task.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 12:24:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 05:01:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 21:19:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 20:47:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Campiteli", "Monica G.", ""], ["Holanda", "Adriano J.", ""], ["Soares", "Leonardo D.

However, the possibility of universal patterns across timing events\nof researcher migration has barely been explored at global scale. Here, we show\nthat timing events of migration within different countries exhibit remarkable\nsimilarities. Specifically, we look at the distribution governing the data of\nresearcher migration inferred from the web. Compiling the data in itself\nrepresents a significant advance in the field of quantitative analysis of\nmigration patterns. Official and commercial records are often access\nrestricted, incompatible between countries, and especially not registered\nacross researchers. Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate\ngeographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of\n1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we\nare able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the\nmigration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can\nbe treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate\nfollowing a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That\nis, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not\n\"memoryless\" but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to\nmake k>1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that\nmigration at later career stages is \"memoryless\". This aligns well but actually\ngoes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case\nstudies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general\nregularities that should have major implications on strategies for education\nand research worldwide.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 13:17:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hadiji", "Fabian", ""], ["Kersting", "Kristian", ""], ["Bauckhage", "Christian", ""], ["Ahmadi", "Babak", ""]]}]
