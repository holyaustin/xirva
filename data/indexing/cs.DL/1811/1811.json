To address this question, we explore interdisciplinarity in the most\nprestigious award in science, the Nobel Prize.

The h-index gives a major\nbreakthrough in the research community to evaluate the scientific impact of an\nindividual. It got a lot of attention due to its simplicity and several other\nindicators were proposed to extend the properties of h-index as well as to\novercome shortcomings of h-index. In this literature review, we have discussed\nthe advantages and limitations of almost all Scientometrics as well as\nBibliometrics indicators which have been categorized into seven categories :(i)\nComplement of h-index, (ii) Based on total number of authors, (iii) Based on\npublication age, (iv) Combination of two indices, (v) Based on excess citation\ncount, (vi) Based on total publication count, (vii) Based on other variants.\nThe main objective of this article is to study all those indicators which have\nbeen proposed to evaluate the scientific impact of an individual researcher or\na group of researchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2018 08:11:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bihari", "Anand", ""], ["Tripathi", "Sudhakar", ""], ["Deepak", "Akshay", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.03346", "submitter": "Leonid Kostenko", "authors": "Leonid Kostenko, Alexander Zhabin, Alexander Kuznetsov, Elizabeth\n  Kukharchuk, Tatiana Simonenko", "title": "System of Bibliometric Monitoring Sciences in Ukraine", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The origins of scientometrics (research metrics) were analysed and the lack\nof attention to elaboration of its methodology was emphasized.

They respond to two main needs: stimulating higher efficiency in\nresearch activities by public laboratories, and realizing better allocative\nefficiency in government funding of such institutions. However the peer review\napproach is typified by several limitations that raise doubts for the\nachievement of the ultimate objectives. In particular, subjectivity of\njudgment, which occurs during the step of selecting research outputs to be\nsubmitted for the evaluations, risks heavily distorting both the final ratings\nof the organizations evaluated and the ultimate funding they receive.

Importantly, we identify two major\nchallenges that hinder the application of sequence tagging models to the task:\n(1) the diversity of resource mention expression, and (2) long-range contextual\ndependencies. We address these challenges by incorporating character-level and\nthread context information into a LSTM-CRF model. First, we incorporate a\ncharacter encoder to address the out-of-vocabulary problem caused by the\ndiversity of mention expressions. Second, to address the context dependency\nchallenge, we encode thread contexts using an RNN-based context encoder, and\napply the attention mechanism to selectively leverage useful context\ninformation during sequence tagging.

The largest convex component of a graph that emerges after the\nremoval of the least number of edges is called a convex skeleton.

In this article the notions of convexity and convex skeletons in the\ncontext of scientific collaboration networks are discussed. More specifically,\nwe analyze the co-authorship networks of Slovenian researchers in computer\nscience, physics, sociology, mathematics, and economics and extract convex\nskeletons from them. We then compare these convex skeletons with the residual\ngraphs (remainders) in terms of collaboration frequency distributions by\nvarious parameters such as the publication year and type, co-authors' birth\nyear, status, gender, discipline, etc. We also show the top-ranked scientists\nby four basic centrality measures as calculated on the original networks and\ntheir skeletons and conclude that convex skeletons may help detect influential\nscholars that are hardly identifiable in the original collaboration network. As\ntheir inherent feature, convex skeletons retain the properties of collaboration\nnetworks. These include high-level structural properties but also the fact that\nthe same authors are highlighted by centrality measures.
