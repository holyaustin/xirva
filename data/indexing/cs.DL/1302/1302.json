This leads us to\nthe use of journal weights attached to the institution identifiers. Since a\njournal in which researchers from a large proportion of institutions published\ntheir papers may be a bad indicator of similarity between two academic\ninstitutions, it seems reasonable to weight it in accordance with how\nfrequently researchers from different institutions published their papers in\nthis journal. Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the academic\ninstitutions, and dendrograms can be provided to illustrate groups of\ninstitutions following agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

The most relevant factor was content\nsimilarity, while the other two - in-degree (i.e. citation counts) and {age of\npublication} had varying importance depending on the topic studied. This\ndependence indicates that additional factors could play a role. Indeed, by\nintuition one should expect the reputation (or visibility) of authors and/or\ninstitutions to affect the referencing pattern, and this is only indirectly\nconsidered via the in-degree that should correlate with such reputation.\nBecause information on reputation is not readily available, we simulated its\neffect on artificial citation networks considering two communities with\ndistinct fitness (visibility) parameters. One community was assumed to have\ntwice the fitness value of the other, which amounts to a double probability for\na paper being cited. While the h-index for authors in the community with larger\nfitness evolved with time with slightly higher values than for the control\nnetwork (no fitness considered), a drastic effect was noted for the community\nwith smaller fitness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2013 17:54:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Amancio", "Diego R.", ""], ["Oliveira", "Osvaldo N.", "Jr."], ["Costa", "Luciano da F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4384", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Cointet", "authors": "Michel Zitt and Jean-Philippe Cointet", "title": "Citation impacts revisited: how novel impact measures reflect\n  interdisciplinarity and structural change at the local and global level", "comments": "submitted to ISSI 2013, Vienna", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Citation networks have fed numerous works in scientific evaluation, science\nmapping (and more recently large-scale network studies) for decades. The\nvariety of citation behavior across scientific fields is both a research topic\nin sociology of science, and a problem in scientific evaluation. Normalization,\ntantamount to a particular weighting of links in the citation network, is\nnecessary for allowing across-field comparisons of citation scores and\ninterdisciplinary studies. In addition to classical normalization which\ndrastically reduces all variability factors altogether, two tracks of research\nhave emerged in the recent years. One is the revival of iterative \"influence\nmeasures\". The second is the \"citing-side\" normalization, whose only purpose is\nto control for the main factor of variability, the inequality in citing\npropensity, letting other aspects play: knowledge export/imports and growth.\nWhen all variables are defined at the same field-level, two propositions are\nestablished: (a) the gross impact measure identifies with the product of\nrelative growth rate, gross balance of citation exchanges, and relative number\nof references (b) the normalized impact identifies with the product of relative\ngrowth rate and normalized balance. At the science level, the variance of\ngrowth rate over domains is a proxy for change in the system, and the variance\nof balance a measure of inter-disciplinary dependences. This opens a new\nperspective, where the resulting variance of normalized impact, and a related\nmeasure, the sum of these variances proposed as a Change-Exchange Indicator,\nsummarize important aspects of science structure and dynamism.

High-risk strategies, which explore new chemical\nrelationships, are less prevalent in the literature, reflecting a growing focus\non established knowledge at the expense of new opportunities. Research\nfollowing a risky strategy is more likely to be ignored but also more likely to\nachieve high impact and recognition.
