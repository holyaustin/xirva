Apart from comparing the\noverall performance, we take a more detailed look at the role of the\nparametrization of the approaches and analyse the dependence of the results on\nthe complexity of the disambiguation task. It could be shown that all of the\nevaluated approaches produce better results than those that can be obtained by\nusing only author names. In the context of this study, the approach proposed by\nCaron and van Eck (2014) produced the best results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 14:36:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Tekles", "Alexander", ""], ["Bornmann", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12919", "submitter": "Mike Thelwall Prof", "authors": "Mike Thelwall", "title": "Female citation impact superiority 1996-2018 in six out of seven\n  English-speaking nations", "comments": "Thelwall, M.

The results\nshow that a small female citation advantage has been the norm over time for all\nthese countries except the USA, where there has been no practical difference.\nThe female citation advantage is largest, and statistically significant in most\nyears, for Australia and the UK. This suggests that any academic bias against\nciting female authored research cannot explain current employment inequalities.\nNevertheless, comparisons using recent citation data, or avoiding it\naltogether, during appointments or promotion may disadvantage females in some\ncountries by underestimating the likely impact of their work, especially in the\nlong term.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 19:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2019 06:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Thelwall", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12986", "submitter": "Elisa Claire Alem\\'an Carre\\'on", "authors": "Kensei Nakai, Hirofumi Nonaka, Asahi Hentona, Yuki Kanai, Takeshi\n  Sakumoto, Shotaro Kataoka, Elisa Claire Alem\\'an Carre\\'on and Toru Hiraoka", "title": "Community Detection and Growth Potential Prediction Using the Stochastic\n  Block Model and the Long Short-term Memory from Patent Citation Networks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1904.12040", "journal-ref": "In Proceedings of the 2018 IEEE International Conference on\n  Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management (IEEM2018). pp. 1884 -\n  1888.

However,\nconventional methods are based on static models and, thus, do not reflect the\ngrowth potential of the technology cluster of the patent. Because even if the\ncluster of a patent has no hope of growing, we recognize the patent is\nimportant if PageRank or other ranking score is high. Therefore, there arises a\nnecessity of developing citation network clustering and prediction of future\ncitations. In our research, clustering of patent citation networks by\nStochastic Block Model was done with the aim of enabling corporate managers and\ninvestors to evaluate the scale and life cycle of technology. As a result, we\nconfirmed nested SBM is appropriate for graph clustering of patent citation\nnetworks. Also, a high MAPE value was obtained and the direction accuracy\nachieved a value greater than 50% when predicting growth potential for each\ncluster by using LSTM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:50:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nakai", "Kensei", ""], ["Nonaka", "Hirofumi", ""], ["Hentona", "Asahi", ""], ["Kanai", "Yuki", ""], ["Sakumoto", "Takeshi", ""], ["Kataoka", "Shotaro", ""], ["Carre\u00f3n", "Elisa Claire Alem\u00e1n", ""], ["Hiraoka", "Toru", ""]]}]
