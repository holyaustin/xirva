Tracing\nthese origins and identifying scientific branches is crucial for research\ninspirations. In this paper, we use citation relations to identify the\ndescendant chart, i.e. the family tree of research papers. Unlike other\nspanning trees which focus on cost or distance minimization, we make use of the\nnature of citations and identify the most important parent for each\npublication, leading to a tree-like backbone of the citation network. Measures\nare introduced to validate the backbone as the descendant chart. We show that\ncitation backbones can well characterize the hierarchical and fractal structure\nof scientific development, and lead to accurate classification of fields and\nsub-fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Aug 2011 13:38:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gualdi", "S.", ""], ["Yeung", "C.

The categorical approach of the IFF provides a\nprincipled framework for the modular design of object-level ontologies. The IFF\nrepresents meta-logic, and as such operates at the structural level of\nontologies. In the IFF, there is a precise boundary between the metalevel and\nthe object level. The modular architecture of the IFF consists of metalevels,\nnamespaces and meta-ontologies. Each metalevel services the levels below by\nproviding a metalanguage used to declare and axiomatize those levels.\nCorresponding to the metalevels are nested metalanguages, where each\nmetalanguage axiomatization includes specialization of the one immediately\nabove. Within each metalevel, the terminology is partitioned into namespaces,\nand various namespaces are collected together into meaningful composites called\nmeta-ontologies. All of the various meta-ontologies in the IFF are anchored to\nthe IFF metastack. The IFF development is largely driven by the principles of\nconceptual warrant, categorical design and institutional logic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Aug 2011 17:43:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kent", "Robert E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4361", "submitter": "Alberto Pepe", "authors": "Alberto Pepe", "title": "The relationship between acquaintanceship and coauthorship in scientific\n  collaboration networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of the American Society for Information Science and\n  Technology 62(11): 2121--2132 (2011)", "doi": "10.1002/asi.21629", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.DL cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article examines the relationship between acquaintanceship and\ncoauthorship patterns in a multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional,\ngeographically distributed research center.
