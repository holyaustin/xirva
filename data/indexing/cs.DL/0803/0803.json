NCore was developed by the National\nScience Digital Library (NSDL) project, and it serves as the central technical\ninfrastructure for NSDL. NCore consists of a central Fedora-based digital\nrepository, a specific data model, an API, and a set of backend services and\nfrontend tools that create a new model for collaborative, contributory digital\nlibraries. This paper describes NCore, presents and analyzes its architecture,\ntools and services; and reports on the experience of NSDL in building and\noperating a major digital library on it over the past year and the experience\nof the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education in porting their existing\ndigital library and tools to the NCore platform.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Mar 2008 21:06:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Krafft", "Dean B.", ""], ["Birkland", "Aaron", ""], ["Cramer", "Ellen J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.4511", "submitter": "Herbert van de Sompel", "authors": "Herbert Van de Sompel, Ryan Chute, Patrick Hochstenbach", "title": "The aDORe Federation Architecture", "comments": "43 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  The need to federate repositories emerges in two distinctive scenarios. In\none scenario, scalability-related problems in the operation of a repository\nreach a point beyond which continued service requires parallelization and hence\nfederation of the repository infrastructure. In the other scenario, multiple\ndistributed repositories manage collections of interest to certain communities\nor applications, and federation is an approach to present a unified perspective\nacross these repositories. The high-level, 3-Tier aDORe federation architecture\ncan be used as a guideline to federate repositories in both cases. This paper\ndescribes the architecture, consisting of core interfaces for federated\nrepositories in Tier-1, two shared infrastructure components in Tier-2, and a\nsingle-point of access to the federation in Tier-3. The paper also illustrates\ntwo large-scale deployments of the aDORe federation architecture: the aDORe\nArchive repository (over 100,000,000 digital objects) at the Los Alamos\nNational Laboratory and the Ghent University Image Repository federation\n(multiple terabytes of image files).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2008 18:02:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Van de Sompel", "Herbert", ""], ["Chute", "Ryan", ""], ["Hochstenbach", "Patrick", ""]]}]
