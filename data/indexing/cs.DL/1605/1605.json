Within Wikipedia, the surprising answer is yes:\nnearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Wikipedia is the largest, most\nmeticulously indexed collection of human knowledge ever amassed. More than\ninformation about a topic, Wikipedia is a web of naturally emerging\nrelationships. By following the first link in each article, we algorithmically\nconstruct a directed network of all 4.7 million articles: Wikipedia's First\nLink Network. Here, we study the English edition of Wikipedia's First Link\nNetwork for insight into how the many articles on inventions, places, people,\nobjects, and events are related and organized.\n  By traversing every path, we measure the accumulation of first links, path\nlengths, groups of path-connected articles, and cycles. We also develop a new\nmethod, traversal funnels, to measure the influence each article exerts in\nshaping the network. Traversal funnels provides a new measure of influence for\ndirected networks without spill-over into cycles, in contrast to traditional\nnetwork centrality measures. Within Wikipedia's First Link Network, we find\nscale-free distributions describe path length, accumulation, and influence. Far\nfrom dispersed, first links disproportionately accumulate at a few\narticles---flowing from specific to general and culminating around fundamental\nnotions such as Community, State, and Science. Philosophy directs more paths\nthan any other article by two orders of magnitude. We also observe a\ngravitation towards topical articles such as Health Care and Fossil Fuel. These\nfindings enrich our view of the connections and structure of Wikipedia's ever\ngrowing store of knowledge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 May 2016 21:14:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 03:11:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ibrahim", "Mark", ""], ["Danforth", "Christopher M.", ""], ["Dodds", "Peter Sheridan", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.00509", "submitter": "Illes Farkas", "authors": "Katalin Orosz and Illes J.

Our main finding is that correlations are\nnon-linear and affect differently most-cited and typical papers. For instance,\nwe find that in most journals short titles correlate positively with citations\nonly for the most cited papers, for typical papers the correlation is in most\ncases negative. Our analysis of 6 different factors, calculated both at the\ntitle and abstract level of 4.3 million papers in over 1500 journals, reveals\nthe number of authors, and the length and complexity of the abstract, as having\nthe strongest (positive) influence on the number of citations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 14:02:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sienkiewicz", "Julian", ""], ["Altmann", "Eduardo G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.08185", "submitter": "Peter Wittek", "authors": "Peter Wittek, S\\'andor Dar\\'anyi, Gustaf Nelhans", "title": "Ruling Out Static Latent Homophily in Citation Networks", "comments": "14 pages, 1 figure, computational details are available at\n  https://github.com/peterwittek/ipython-notebooks/blob/master/Citation_Network_SDP.ipynb.\n  in Scientometrics, 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11192-016-2194-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Citation and coauthor networks offer an insight into the dynamics of\nscientific progress. We can also view them as representations of a causal\nstructure, a logical process captured in a graph. From a causal perspective, we\ncan ask questions such as whether authors form groups primarily due to their\nprior shared interest, or if their favourite topics are 'contagious' and spread\nthrough co-authorship. Such networks have been widely studied by the artificial\nintelligence community, and recently a connection has been made to nonlocal\ncorrelations produced by entangled particles in quantum physics -- the impact\nof latent hidden variables can be analyzed by the same algebraic geometric\nmethodology that relies on a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxations. Following this trail, we treat our sample coauthor network as a\ncausal graph and, using SDP relaxations, rule out latent homophily as a\nmanifestation of prior shared interest leading to the observed patternedness.\nBy introducing algebraic geometry to citation studies, we add a new tool to\nexisting methods for the analysis of content-related social influences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 May 2016 08:07:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 15:58:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wittek", "Peter", ""], ["Dar\u00e1nyi", "S\u00e1ndor", ""], ["Nelhans", "Gustaf", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.08888", "submitter": "Juste Raimbault", "authors": "Juste Raimbault", "title": "Models Coupling Urban Growth and Transportation Network Growth : An\n  Algorithmic Systematic Review Approach", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.
