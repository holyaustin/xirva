The objective of this paper is to provide criteria for the unique\nidentification of some important kinds of information objects, independent from\nthe kind of carrier or specific encoding. Our approach is based on the idea\nthat the substance of some kinds of information objects can completely be\ndescribed in terms of discrete arrangements of finite numbers of known kinds of\nsymbols, such as those implied by style guides for scientific journal\nsubmissions. Our theory is also useful for selecting or describing what has to\nbe preserved. This is a fundamental problem since curators and archivists would\nlike to formally record the decisions of what has to be preserved over time and\nto decide (or verify) whether a migration (transformation) preserves the\nintended information content. Furthermore, it is important for reasoning about\nthe authenticity of digital objects, as well as for reducing the cost of\ndigital preservation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Jan 2012 21:04:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 20:57:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Doerr", "Martin", ""], ["Tzitzikas", "Yannis", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0540", "submitter": "Steven Obua", "authors": "Steven Obua", "title": "ProofPeer - A Cloud-based Interactive Theorem Proving System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.DL cs.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  ProofPeer strives to be a system for cloud-based interactive theorem proving.\nAfter illustrating why such a system is needed, the paper presents some of the\ndesign challenges that ProofPeer needs to meet to succeed.

Here we\nreconstructed, using web search engines, a network representing the relatedness\nof researchers to their peers as well as to various research topics.\nRelatedness between researchers and research topics was characterized by\nvisibility boost-increase of a researcher's visibility by focusing on a\nparticular topic.

We calculated correlations between visibility boosts by research\ntopics and researchers' interdisciplinarity at individual level (diversity of\ntopics related to the researcher) and at social level (his/her centrality in\nthe researchers' network). We found that visibility boosts by certain research\ntopics were positively correlated with researchers' individual-level\ninterdisciplinarity despite their negative correlations with the general\npopularity of researchers.

Research topics' correlations with researchers'\nindividual- and social-level interdisciplinarities were found to be nearly\nindependent from each other.
