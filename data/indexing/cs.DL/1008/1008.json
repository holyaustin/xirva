One of the experiments\naddressing the issue directly is Citizendium. In seeking to harvest the\nstrengths (and avoiding the major pitfalls) of both user-generated wiki\nprojects and traditional expert-approved reference works, it is a wiki to which\nanybody can contribute using their real names, while those with specific\nexpertise are given a special role in assessing the quality of content. Upon\nfulfillment of a set of criteria like factual and linguistic accuracy, lack of\nbias, and readability by non-specialists, these entries are forked into two\nversions: a stable (and thus citable) approved \"cluster\" (an article with\nsubpages providing supplementary information) and a draft version, the latter\nto allow for further development and updates. We provide an overview of how\nCitizendium is structured and what it offers to the open knowledge communities,\nparticularly to those engaged in education and research. Special attention will\nbe paid to the structures and processes put in place to provide for transparent\ngovernance, to encourage collaboration, to resolve disputes in a civil manner\nand by taking into account expert opinions, and to facilitate navigation of the\nsite and contextualization of its contents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Aug 2010 07:50:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Morris", "Tom", ""], ["Mietchen", "Daniel", ""]]}]
