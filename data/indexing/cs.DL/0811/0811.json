These are objects that aggregate\nmultiple sources of content including text, images, data, visualization tools,\nand the like. These aggregations are an essential product of eScience, and will\nbecome increasingly common in the age of data-driven scholarship. The OAI-ORE\nspecifications conform to the core concepts of the Web architecture and the\nsemantic Web, ensuring that applications that use them will integrate well into\nthe general Web environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 19:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lagoze", "Carl", ""], ["Van de Sompel", "Herbert", ""], ["Nelson", "Michael", ""], ["Warner", "Simeon", ""], ["Sanderson", "Robert", ""], ["Johnston", "Pete", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0717", "submitter": "Patricia Gautier", "authors": "Eric San Juan (INIST), Ivana Roche (INIST)", "title": "Visualization of association graphs for assisting the interpretation of\n  classifications", "comments": "International workshop on Webometrics, informetrics and\n  scientometrics.
