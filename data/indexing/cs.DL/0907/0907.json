In this paper a new methodology for the general\nanalysis of the ageing and durability of scientific papers is presented. This\nmethodology classifies documents into three general types: Delayed documents,\nwhich receive the main part of their citations later than normal documents;\nFlash in the pans, which receive citations immediately after their publication\nbut they are not cited in the long term; and Normal documents, documents with a\ntypical distribution of citations over time. These three types of durability\nhave been analyzed considering the whole population of documents in the Web of\nScience with at least 5 external citations (i.e. not considering\nself-citations). Several patterns related to the three types of durability have\nbeen found and the potential for further research of the developed methodology\nis discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2009 08:52:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Costas", "Rodrigo", ""], ["van Leeuwen", "Thed N.", ""], ["van Raan", "Anthony F.
