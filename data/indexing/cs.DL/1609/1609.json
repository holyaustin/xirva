First, MA does not provide the document type\nof a publication. Second, the 'fields of study' are dynamic, too specific and\nfield hierarchies are incoherent. Third, some publications are assigned to\nincorrect years. Fourth, the metadata of some publications did not include all\nauthors. Nevertheless, we show that an average-based indicator (i.e. the\njournal normalized citation score; JNCS) as well as a distribution-based\nindicator (i.e. percentile rank classes; PR classes) can be calculated with\nrelative ease using MA. Hence, normalization of citation counts is feasible\nwith MA. The citation analyses in MA and Scopus yield uniform results. The JNCS\nand the PR classes are similar in both databases, and, as a consequence, the\nevaluation of the researchers' publication impact is congruent in MA and\nScopus.

Unfortunately, such a phenomenon induces bias to existing\nmetrics employed to evaluate the productivity and success of researchers.

Furthermore, we found that the rank of authors and their roles in\npapers follows three general patterns according to the nature of their\ncontributions, such as writing, data analysis, and the conduction of\nexperiments. This was accomplished by collecting and analyzing the data\nretrieved from PLoS ONE and by devising an entropy-based measurement to\nquantify the effective number of authors in a paper according to their\ncontributions. The analysis of such patterns confirms that some aspects of the\nauthor ranking are in accordance with the expected convention, such as the fact\nthat the first and last authors are more likely to contribute more in a\nscientific work. Conversely, such analysis also revealed that authors in the\nintermediary positions of the rank contribute more in certain specific roles,\nsuch as the task of collecting data.

We analyze a diverse set of scientific articles\nwritten in English language to understand generic writing patterns and\nformulate rules to develop this hybrid framework. Extensive evaluations show\nthat the proposed framework outperforms the existing state-of-the-art tools\nwith huge margin in structural information extraction along with improved\nperformance in metadata and bibliography extraction tasks, both in terms of\naccuracy (around 50% improvement) and processing time (around 52% improvement).\nA user experience study conducted with the help of 30 researchers reveals that\nthe researchers found this system to be very helpful. As an additional\nobjective, we discuss two novel use cases including automatically extracting\nlinks to public datasets from the proceedings, which would further accelerate\nthe advancement in digital libraries.

Case studies\nillustrate the details of applying it for supporting SLR steps.

Most\nof the work done on the dynamics of social networks focuses on well-established\ncommunities. Work examining emerging social networks is rarer, simply because\ndata is difficult to obtain in real time. In this paper, we use thirty years of\ndata from an emerging scientific community to look at that crucial early stage\nin the development of a social network. We show that when the field was very\nyoung, islands of individual researchers labored in relative isolation, and the\ncoauthorship network was disconnected. Thirty years later, rather than a\ncluster of individuals, we find a true collaborative community, bound together\nby a robust collaboration network. However, this change did not take place\ngradually\\textemdash the network remained a loose assortment of isolated\nindividuals until the mid-2000s, when those smaller parts suddenly knit\nthemselves together into a single whole. In the rest of this paper, we consider\nthe role of three factors in these observed structural changes: growth, changes\nin social norms, and the introduction of institutions such as field-specific\nconferences and journals. We have data from the very earliest years of the\nfield, a period which includes the introduction of two different institutions:\nthe first field-specific conference, and the first field-specific journals. We\nalso identify two relevant behavioral shifts: a discrete increase in\ncoauthorship coincident with the first conference, and a shift among\nestablished authors away from collaborating with outsiders, towards\ncollaborating with each other. The interaction of these factors gives us\ninsight into the formation of collaboration networks more broadly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 15:47:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 17:05:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 00:46:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 23:45:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Anderson", "Katharine A", ""], ["Crespi", "Matthew", ""], ["Sayre", "Eleanor C", ""]]}]
