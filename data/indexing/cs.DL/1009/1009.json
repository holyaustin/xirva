The model\ninvolves a dual mechanism: in the direct mechanism, the author of a new paper\nfinds an old paper A and cites it. In the indirect mechanism, the author of a\nnew paper finds an old paper A only via the reference list of a newer\nintermediary paper B, which has previously cited A. By comparison to citation\ndatabases, we find that papers having few citations are cited mainly by the\ndirect mechanism. Papers already having many citations ('classics') are cited\nmainly by the indirect mechanism. The indirect mechanism gives a power-law\ntail. The 'tipping point' at which a paper becomes a classic is about 21\ncitations for papers published in the Institute for Scientific Information\n(ISI) Web of Science database in 1981, 29 for Physical Review D papers\npublished from 1975-1994, and 39 for all publications from a list of high\nh-index chemists assembled in 2007. The power-law exponent is not universal.\nIndividuals who are highly cited have a systematically smaller exponent than\nindividuals who are less cited.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Sep 2010 03:02:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Dec 2010 22:16:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Mar 2011 20:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Peterson", "G.

In this paper we present a visualization\nframework which presents the collection as a set of entities and relations (on\nthe data level). Using rating functions, we divide large relation networks into\nsmall graphs which resemble ego-centered networks. These graphs are connected\nso the user can browse from one to another. To further assist the user, we\npresent two views which embed information on the evolution of the relations\ninto the graphs. Each view emphasizes another aspect of temporal development.\nThe framework can be adapted to any repository by a flexible data interface and\na graph configuration file.
