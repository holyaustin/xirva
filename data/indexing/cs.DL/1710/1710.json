We analyze the choices people\nmake about what information to propagate on the citation networks of Physical\nReview journals, US patents and legal opinions. We observe regularities in\nbehavior consistent with human bounded rationality: rather than evaluate all\navailable choices, people rely on simply cognitive heuristics to decide what\ninformation to attend to.

Due to\nthe rarity of complete large-scale scholarly data, earlier studies target this\nproblem based on manual topic extraction from a limited number of domains, with\ntheir focus solely on a single feature such as coauthorship, citation\nrelations, and etc. Given the compromised effectiveness of such predictions, in\nthis paper we use a real scholarly dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph, which\nprovides more than 12000 topics in the field of Computer Science (CS),\nincluding 1200 venues, 14.4 million authors, 30 million papers and their\ncitation relations over the period of 1950 till now. Aiming to find the topics\nthat will trend in CS area, we innovatively formalize a hot topic prediction\nproblem where, with joint consideration of both inter- and intra-topical\ninfluence, 17 different scientific features are extracted for comprehensive\ndescription of topic status. By leveraging all those 17 features, we observe\ngood accuracy of topic scale forecasting after 5 and 10 years with R2 values of\n0.9893 and 0.9646, respectively. Interestingly, our prediction suggests that\nthe maximum value matters in finding hot topics in scholarly fields, primarily\nfrom three aspects: (1) the maximum value of each factor, such as authors'\nmaximum h-index and largest citation number, provides three times the amount of\ninformation than the average value in prediction; (2) the mutual influence\nbetween the most correlated topics serve as the most telling factor in\nlong-term topic trend prediction, interpreting that those currently exhibiting\nthe maximum growth rates will drive the correlated topics to be hot in the\nfuture; (3) we predict in the next 5 years the top 100 fastest growing (maximum\ngrowth rate) topics that will potentially get the major attention in CS area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 09:26:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Jinghao", ""], ["Wu", "Hao", ""], ["Deng", "Fengyu", ""], ["Bao", "Wentian", ""], ["Tang", "Wencheng", ""], ["Fu", "Luoyi", ""], ["Wang", "Xinbing", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.08327", "submitter": "Chaomei Chen", "authors": "Chaomei Chen, Ming Song, Go Eun Heo", "title": "A Scalable and Adaptive Method for Finding Semantically Equivalent Cue\n  Words of Uncertainty", "comments": "29 pages, 9 figures, 11 tables", "journal-ref": "Journal of Informetrics, 12(1), 158-180 (2018)", "doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2017.12.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Scientific knowledge is constantly subject to a variety of changes due to new\ndiscoveries, alternative interpretations, and fresh perspectives.

The\napproach being proposed simultaneously examines the growth processes of the\nco-authorship and citation networks by analyzing the evolutions of the rich get\nricher and the fit get richer phenomena. In particular, the preferential\nattachment function and author fitnesses, which govern the two phenomena, are\nestimated non-parametrically in each network. The approach is applied to the\nco-authorship and citation networks of the flagship journal of the strategic\nmanagement scientific community, namely the Strategic Management Journal. The\nresults suggest that the abovementioned phenomena have been consistently\ngoverning both temporal networks. The average of the attachment exponents in\nthe co-authorship network is 0.30 while it is 0.29 in the citation network.\nThis suggests that the rich get richer phenomenon has been weak in both\nnetworks. The right tails of the distributions of author fitness in both\nnetworks are heavy, which imply that the intrinsic scientific quality of each\nauthor has been playing a crucial role in getting new citations and new\nco-authorships. Since the total competitiveness in each temporal network is\nfounded to be rising with time, it is getting harder to receive a new citation\nor to develop a new collaboration. Analyzing the average competency, it was\nfound that on average, while the veterans tend to be more competent at\ndeveloping new collaborations, the newcomers are likely better at acquiring new\ncitations. Furthermore, the author fitness in both networks has been consistent\nwith the history of the strategic management scientific community.

Given similar\ninstitutional incentives, isomorphism within each eco-system of universities\nshould not be underestimated. Our results suggest that networks based on\noverlapping stability intervals can provide a first impression of the relevant\ngroupings among universities.

We welcome contributions elaborating on dedicated IR\nsystems, as well as studies revealing original characteristics on how\nscientific knowledge is created, communicated, and used.
