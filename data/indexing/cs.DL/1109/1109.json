We investigate the extent to\nwhich different models of production of economic or social value can be\nexpressed in different forms of licensing in the context of open archives.\nThrough this process, we assess the extent to which the digital archive is\nmoving towards providing access that is deeper (meaning, that offers more\naccess rights) and wider (in the sense that most of the information given is in\nopen content licensing) or face a gradual stratification and polarization of\nthe content. Such stratification entails the emergence of two types of content:\ncontent to which access is extremely limited and content to which access\nremains completely open. This differentiation between classes of content is the\nresult of multiple factors: from purely legislative, administrative and\ncontractual restrictions (e.g. data protection and confidentiality\nrestrictions) to information economics (e.g. peer production) or social\n(minimum universal access).\n  We claim that with respect to the access management model, most of the\ncurrent archiving processes include elements of openness. Usually, this is the\nresult of economic necessity expressed in licensing instruments or\norganisational arrangements. The viability and the socio-economic importance of\nthe digital archives also contributes to the use of open archiving practices.\nIn such a context, although pure forms of open digital archives may remain an\nideal, the reality of hybrid open digital archives is a necessity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Sep 2011 07:07:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tsiavos", "Prodromos", "", "London School of Economics, UK"], ["Stefaneas", "Petros", "", "National Technical University of Athens, Greece"]]}, {"id": "1109.0983", "submitter": "Robert Kent", "authors": "Robert E.

The content, form\nand experience of the IFF could contribute to the development of a standard\nontology for category theory. The foundational aspect of the IFF helps to\nexplain the relationship between the fundamental concepts of set theory and\ncategory theory. The development of the IFF follows two design principles:\nconceptual warrant and categorical design. Both are limitations of the logical\nexpression. Conceptual warrant limits the content of logical expression, by\nrequiring us to justify the introduction of new terminology (and attendant\naxiomatizations). Categorical design limits the form of logical expression (of\nall mathematical concepts and constraints) to atomic expressions: declarations,\nequations or relational expressions. The IFF is a descriptive category\nmetatheory.

One of\nthe most popular retrieval services is to find a set of papers similar to the\npaper under consideration, which requires a measure that computes similarities\nbetween papers. Scientific literature databases exhibit two interesting\ncharacteristics that are different from general databases. First, the papers\ncited by old papers are often not included in the database due to technical and\neconomic reasons. Second, since a paper references the papers published before\nit, few papers cite recently-published papers. These two characteristics cause\nall existing similarity measures to fail in at least one of the following\ncases: (1) measuring the similarity between old, but similar papers, (2)\nmeasuring the similarity between recent, but similar papers, and (3) measuring\nthe similarity between two similar papers: one old, the other recent. In this\npaper, we propose a new link-based similarity measure called C-Rank, which uses\nboth in-link and out-link by disregarding the direction of references. In\naddition, we discuss the most suitable normalization method for scientific\nliterature databases and propose an evaluation method for measuring the\naccuracy of similarity measures. We have used a database with real-world papers\nfrom DBLP and their reference information crawled from Libra for experiments\nand compared the performance of C-Rank with those of existing similarity\nmeasures.
