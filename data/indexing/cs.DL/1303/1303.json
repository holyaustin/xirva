Standard web search is\nby far the most common interface for such information. It is therefore of\ninterest to find out how well web search engines work for diagnostic queries\nand what factors contribute to successes and failures. Among diseases, rare (or\norphan) diseases represent an especially challenging and thus interesting class\nto diagnose as each is rare, diverse in symptoms and usually has scattered\nresources associated with it. Methods: We use an evaluation approach for web\nsearch engines for rare disease diagnosis which includes 56 real life\ndiagnostic cases, state-of-the-art evaluation measures, and curated information\nresources. In addition, we introduce FindZebra, a specialized (vertical) rare\ndisease search engine. FindZebra is powered by open source search technology\nand uses curated freely available online medical information. Results:\nFindZebra outperforms Google Search in both default setup and customised to the\nresources used by FindZebra. We extend FindZebra with specialized\nfunctionalities exploiting medical ontological information and UMLS medical\nconcepts to demonstrate different ways of displaying the retrieved results to\nmedical experts. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a specialized search\nengine can improve the diagnostic quality without compromising the ease of use\nof the currently widely popular web search engines. The proposed evaluation\napproach can be valuable for future development and benchmarking.

Only papers following the trajectory\nof a \"sticky knowledge claim\" can be expected to have a sustained impact.

Because\naggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns,\n5th-order polynomials (with four bending points) are needed to capture citation\ncurves precisely.

However, the relation between\nreputation and career growth of an individual remains poorly understood,\ndespite recent proliferation of quantitative research evaluation methods. Here\nwe develop an original framework for measuring how a publication's citation\nrate $\\Delta c$ depends on the reputation of its central author $i$, in\naddition to its net citation count $c$. To estimate the strength of the\nreputation effect, we perform a longitudinal analysis on the careers of 450\nhighly-cited scientists, using the total citations $C_{i}$ of each scientist as\nhis/her reputation measure. We find a citation crossover $c_{\\times}$ which\ndistinguishes the strength of the reputation effect. For publications with $c <\nc_{\\times}$, the author's reputation is found to dominate the annual citation\nrate. Hence, a new publication may gain a significant early advantage\ncorresponding to roughly a 66% increase in the citation rate for each tenfold\nincrease in $C_{i}$. However, the reputation effect becomes negligible for\nhighly cited publications meaning that for $c\\geq c_{\\times}$ the citation rate\nmeasures scientific impact more transparently. In addition we have developed a\nstochastic reputation model, which is found to reproduce numerous statistical\nobservations for real careers, thus providing insight into the microscopic\nmechanisms underlying cumulative advantage in science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 00:35:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2013 04:11:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 17:32:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2014 17:28:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Fortunato", "Santo", ""], ["Pan", "Raj K.", ""], ["Kaski", "Kimmo", ""], ["Penner", "Orion", ""], ["Rungi", "Armando", ""], ["Riccaboni", "Massimo", ""], ["Stanley", "H.
