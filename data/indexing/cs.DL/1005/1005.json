Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With\nregard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential.

This implies that\nrepositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated\nservices supporting the production of new knowledge.

In this paper we describe the movie data\nstructure and we discuss a proto- type implementation of the camera and\nproviola based on the ProofWeb system. ProofWeb uncouples the interaction with\na PA via a web- interface (the client) from the actual PA that resides on the\nserver. Our camera films a movie by \"listening\" to the ProofWeb communication.\nThe first reason for developing movies is to uncouple the reviewing of a formal\nproof from the PA used to develop it: the movie concept enables users to\ndiscuss small code fragments without the need to install the PA or to load a\nwhole library into it. Other advantages include the possibility to develop a\nseparate com- mentary track to discuss or explain the PA interaction. We assert\nthat a combined camera+proviola provides a generic layer between a client\n(user) and a server (PA). Finally we claim that movies are the right type of\ndata to be stored in an encyclopedia of formalized mathematics, based on our\nexperience in filming the Coq standard library.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 May 2010 12:54:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Tankink", "Carst", ""], ["Geuvers", "Herman", ""], ["McKinna", "James", ""], ["Wiedijk", "Freek", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3063", "submitter": "Diego  Amancio Raphael", "authors": "D.R.
