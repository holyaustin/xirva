Garfield (1979)\nemphasizes that bare citation counts from different fields cannot be compared\nfor evaluative purposes, because the \"citation potential\" can vary\nsignificantly between the fields. Garfield (1979) suggests that \"the most\naccurate measure of citation potential is the average number of references per\npaper published in a given field\". Based on this suggestion, the new indicator\nis basically defined as follows: the citation count of a focal paper is divided\nby the mean number of cited references in a field to normalize citations. The\nnew indicator is called citation score normalized by cited references (CSNCR).\nThe theoretical analysis of the CSNCR shows that it has the properties of\nconsistency and homogeneous normalization. The close relation of the new\nindicator to the MNCS is discussed. The empirical comparison of the CSNCR with\nother field-normalized indicators shows that it is slightly poorer able to\nfield-normalize citation counts than other cited-side normalized indicators\n(e.g. the MNCS), but its results are favorable compared to two citing-side\nindicator variants (SNCS indicators).

Combined these\ntrends correspond to a 12-year doubling period in the total supply of\nreferences, thereby challenging traditional methods of evaluating scientific\nproduction, from researchers to institutions. Against this background, we\nanalyzed a citation network comprised of 837 million references produced by\n32.6 million publications over the period 1965-2012, allowing for a temporal\nanalysis of the `attention economy' in science. Unlike previous studies, we\nanalyzed the entire probability distribution of reference ages - the time\ndifference between a citing and cited paper - thereby capturing previously\noverlooked trends. Over this half-century period we observe a narrowing range\nof attention - both classic and recent literature are being cited increasingly\nless, pointing to the important role of socio-technical processes. To better\nunderstand the impact of exponential growth on the underlying knowledge network\nwe develop a network-based model, featuring the redirection of scientific\nattention via publications' reference lists, and validate the model against\nseveral empirical benchmarks. We then use the model to test the causal impact\nof real paradigm shifts, thereby providing guidance for science policy\nanalysis. In particular, we show how perturbations to the growth rate of\nscientific output affects the reference age distribution and the functionality\nof the vast science citation network as an aid for the search & retrieval of\nknowledge. In order to account for the inflation of science, our study points\nto the need for a systemic overhaul of the counting methods used to evaluate\ncitation impact - especially in the case of evaluating science careers, which\ncan span several decades and thus several doubling periods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2016 14:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Raj K.", ""], ["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Pammolli", "Fabio", ""], ["Fortunato", "Santo", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05650", "submitter": "Shanta Phani", "authors": "Shanta Phani, Shibamouli Lahiri and Arindam Biswas", "title": "A Supervised Authorship Attribution Framework for Bengali Language", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors as the results need to\n  be changed", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Authorship Attribution is a long-standing problem in Natural Language\nProcessing.

Methodology: A combination of\ncitation network analysis; analysis of Medical heading Subject (MeSH) and Gene\nOntology (GO) terms, and quantitative content analysis for patents and\nscientific literature, aimed to map the organization of Ebola research was\ncarried out. Results: We found six putative research fronts (i.e. clusters of\nhigh interconnected papers). Three research fronts are basic research on Ebola\nvirus structural proteins: glycoprotein, VP40 and VP35, respectively. There is\na fourth research front of basic research papers on pathogenesis, which is the\norganizing hub of Ebola research. A fifth research front is pre-clinical\nresearch focused on vaccines and glycoproteins. Finally, a\nclinical-epidemiology research front related to the disease outbreaks was\nidentified. The network structure of patent families shows that the dominant\ndesign is the use of Ebola virus proteins as targets of vaccines and other\nimmunological treatments. Therefore, patents network organization resembles the\norganization of the scientific literature. Specifically, the knowledge on Ebola\nwould flow from higher (clinical-epidemiology) to intermediated\n(cellular-tissular pathogenesis) to lower (molecular interactions) levels of\norganization. Conclusion: Our results suggest a strong reductionist approach\nfor Ebola research probably influenced by the lethality of the disease. On the\nother hand, the ownership profile of the patent families network and the main\nresearches relationship with the United State Army suggest a strong involvement\nof this military institution in Ebola research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 05:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fajardo-Ortiz", "David", ""], ["Ortega-Sanchez-de-Tagle", "Josw", ""], ["Castano", "Victor-M", ""]]}]
