We\nargue that in prior network analyses of coauthorship networks, the information\non ordering has been insufficiently considered because ties between authors are\ntypically symmetrized. This is basically the same as assuming that each\nco-author has contributed equally to a paper. We introduce a solution to this\nproblem by adopting a coauthorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and\nDiesner (2014), which in its core conceptualizes co-authoring as a directed,\nweighted, and self-looped network. We test and validate our application of the\nadopted framework based on a sample data of 861 authors who have published in\nthe journal Psychometrika. Results suggest that this novel sociometric approach\ncan complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand\ninsights into coauthoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among\nscholars. As another form of validation, we also show how our approach\naccurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated\nwith the journal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 22:01:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Jinseok", ""], ["Diesner", "Jana", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00481", "submitter": "Benedikt Fecher", "authors": "Benedikt Fecher, Sascha Friesike, Marcel Hebing, Stephanie Linek and\n  Armin Sauermann", "title": "A Reputation Economy: Results from an Empirical Survey on Academic Data\n  Sharing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL stat.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Academic data sharing is a way for researchers to collaborate and thereby\nmeet the needs of an increasingly complex research landscape.

It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding\nagencies, journals, and researchers alike. We surveyed 2661 individual academic\nresearchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data, their\npublication practices, and motives for sharing or withholding research data.\nThe results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines\nrecognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for\nscientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation. An\nexplanation for this evidence could be an academic system that is not driven by\nmonetary incentives, nor the desire for scientific progress, but by individual\nreputation-expressed in (high ranked journal) publications. We label this\nsystem a Reputation Economy. This special economy explains our findings that\nshow that researchers have a nuanced idea how to provide adequate formal\nrecognition for making data available to others-namely data citations. We\nconclude that data sharing will only be widely adopted among research\nprofessionals if sharing pays in form of reputation. Thus, policy measures that\nintend to foster research collaboration need to understand academia as a\nreputation economy.

This observation has long\nbeen the underlying heuristic in determining major bibliometric factors such as\nthe quality of a publication, the growth of scientific communities, impact\nfactor of publication venues etc. In this paper, we gather and analyze a\nmassive dataset of scientific papers from the computer science domain and\nnotice that the citation count of the articles over the years follows a\nremarkably diverse set of patterns - a profile with an initial peak (PeakInit),\nwith distinct multiple peaks (PeakMul), with a peak late in time (PeakLate),\nthat is monotonically decreasing (MonDec), that is monotonically increasing\n(MonIncr) and that can not be categorized into any of the above (Oth). We\nconduct a thorough experiment to investigate several important characteristics\nof these categories such as how individual categories attract citations, how\nthe categorization is influenced by the year and the venue of publication of\npapers, how each category is affected by self-citations, the stability of the\ncategories over time, and how much each of these categories contribute to the\ncore of the network. Further, we show that the traditional preferential\nattachment models fail to explain these citation profiles. Therefore, we\npropose a novel dynamic growth model that takes both the preferential\nattachment and the aging factor into account in order to replicate the\nreal-world behavior of various citation profiles. We believe that this paper\nopens the scope for a serious re-investigation of the existing bibliometric\nindices for scientific research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Mar 2015 06:03:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Tanmoy", ""], ["Kumar", "Suhansanu", ""], ["Goyal", "Pawan", ""], ["Ganguly", "Niloy", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Animesh", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.06584", "submitter": "Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "authors": "Chuan Wen Loe, Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "title": "Citation Analysis with Mark-and-Recapture", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mark-and-Recapture is a methodology from Population Biology to estimate the\nnumber of a species without counting every individual.
