However, the expressing power of these\n\"single-example\" queries fails when the user's delicate query intent is not\navailable as a single example. Recently, the well-known skyline operator was\nreused in metric similarity search as a \"multi-example\" query type. When\napplied on a multi-dimensional database (i.e., on a multi-attribute table), the\ntraditional skyline operator selects all database objects that are not\ndominated by other objects. The metric skyline query adopts the skyline\noperator such that the multiple attributes are represented by distances\n(similarities) to multiple query examples. Hence, we can view the metric\nskyline as a set of representative database objects which are as similar to all\nthe examples as possible and, simultaneously, are semantically distinct. In\nthis paper we propose a technique of processing the metric skyline query by use\nof PM-tree, while we show that our technique significantly outperforms the\noriginal M-tree based implementation in both time and space costs. In\nexperiments we also evaluate the partial metric skyline processing, where only\na controlled number of skyline objects is retrieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:09:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Skopal", "Tomas", ""], ["Lokoc", "Jakub", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.2626", "submitter": "Arijit  Laha Ph.D.", "authors": "Arijit Laha", "title": "On challenges and opportunities of designing integrated IT platforms for\n  supporting knowledge works in organizations", "comments": "39 pages, Sibmitted to journal Vikalpa", "journal-ref": "Vikalpa: The Journal for Decision Makers, Volume 36, No 3, pp 35 -\n  60, Jul - Sep 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Designing and implementing comprehensive IT-based support environments for KM\nin organizations is fraught with many problems. Solving them requires intimate\nknowledge about the information usage in knowledge works and the scopes of\ntechnology intervention. In this paper, the Task-oriented Organizational\nKnowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated IT\nplatforms for supporting organizational KM, is proposed. TOKM brings together\ntwo apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, the\ntask-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developing\nthe design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of an\ninformation usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model is\nextended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate them\nin form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm,\na set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a design\nmethod, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, the\nKnowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order to\nmeet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform for\nbuilding and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work Support\nSystems (KWSS) on a common sharable platform. Each KWSS, for the task-type\nsupported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticated\nsupport to individual as well as group of knowledge workers in performing their\nrespective knowledge work instances\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 13:55:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Laha", "Arijit", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.2632", "submitter": "Laurent Romary", "authors": "Laurent Romary (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, IDSL)", "title": "Communication scientifique : Pour le meilleur et pour le PEER", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Hermes (2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper provides an overview (in French) of the European PEER project,\nfocusing on its origins, the actual objectives and the technical deployment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 14:28:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Romary", "Laurent", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, IDSL"]]}, {"id": "0910.2638", "submitter": "Arijit  Laha Ph.D.", "authors": "Arijit Laha", "title": "On building Information Warehouses", "comments": "11 pages 1st IIMA International Conference on Advanced Data Analysis,\n  Business Analytics and Intelligence (ICADABAI 2009), 6-7 June, Indian\n  Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the most important goals of information management (IM) is supporting\nthe knowledge workers in performing their works.
