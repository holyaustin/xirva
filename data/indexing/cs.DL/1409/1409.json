The number of retractions each year has also\nincreased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific\nmisconduct accounts for approximately more than half of those retractions. It\nis assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their\ncolleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical\nevidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors'\nresearch careers. Using data from the Web of Science (WOS), we measured the\nproductivity, impact and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted\narticles for a period of five years before and after the retraction. We found\nclear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues'\nmisconduct, and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a\nretraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these\nconsequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted\npaper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors,\nwhile the impact is less important for middle authors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2014 16:23:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Mongeon", "Philippe", ""], ["Lariviere", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0348", "submitter": "Peter Kraker", "authors": "Peter Kraker, Christian Schl\\\"ogl, Kris Jack, and Stefanie Lindstaedt", "title": "Visualization of Co-Readership Patterns from an Online Reference\n  Management System", "comments": "Accepted for publication in the Journal of Informetrics", "journal-ref": "Journal of Informetrics, Volume 9, Issue 1, January 2015, Pages\n  169-182", "doi": "10.1016/j.joi.2014.12.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we analyze the adequacy and applicability of readership\nstatistics recorded in social reference management systems for creating\nknowledge domain visualizations.

The present\ncase study investigates the usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader\nimpact of research. Methods: This case study is essentially based on a dataset\nwith papers obtained from F1000. The dataset was augmented with altmetrics\n(such as Twitter counts) which were provided by PLOS (the Public Library of\nScience). In total, the case study covers a total of 1,082 papers. Findings:\nThe F1000 dataset contains tags on papers which were assigned intellectually by\nexperts and which can characterise a paper. The most interesting tag for\naltmetric research is \"good for teaching\". This tag is assigned to papers which\ncould be of interest to a wider circle of readers than the peers in a\nspecialist area. Particularly on Facebook and Twitter, one could expect papers\nwith this tag to be mentioned more often than those without this tag. With\nrespect to the \"good for teaching\" tag, the results from regression models were\nable to confirm these expectations: Papers with this tag show significantly\nhigher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. This\nassociation could not be seen with Mendeley or Figshare counts (that is with\ncounts from platforms which are chiefly of interest in a scientific context).\nConclusions: The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and\nTwitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, can provide indications of papers which\nare of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a\nspecialist area), and seem therefore be useful for societal impact measurement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 08:05:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 08:43:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bornmann", "Lutz", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.3379", "submitter": "Michael Schreiber", "authors": "Michael Schreiber", "title": "A variant of the h-index to measure recent performance", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "JASIST 66(11), 2373-2380 (2015)", "doi": "10.1002/asi.23438", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  The predictive power of the h-index has been shown to depend for a long time\non citations to rather old publications.

The basic idea behind is to combine the most\ninformative relations available from various maps based on different\nbibliometric indicators, in order to produce a rich structrue for the study of\nknowledge dynamics, with special emphasis on causal-historical connections. As\na proof of concept, we deploy the proposed framework in an extensive case study\non a historical topic from the life sciences, namely, the debate on the species\nconcept in biosystematics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 14:05:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Soos", "Sandor", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.7316", "submitter": "Atilim Gunes Baydin", "authors": "Atilim Gunes Baydin, Barak A.

We find that\npapers in the journal are characterised by fast accumulations of downloads\nduring the first couple of months after publication, followed by slower rates\nthereafter, behaviour which can be represented by a model with predictive\npower. We also find that individual papers can be classified in various ways,\nallowing us to compare categories for open-access and non-open-access papers.\nFor example, for the latter publications, which comprise the bulk of EPL\npapers, a small proportion (2%) display intense bursts of download activity,\npossibly following an extended period of less remarkable behaviour. About 18%\nhave an especially high degree of attractiveness over and above what is typical\nfor the journal. One can also classify the ageing of attractiveness by\nexamining download half-lives. Approximately 18% have strong interest\ninitially, waning in time. A further 20% exhibit \"delayed recognition\" with\nrelatively late spurs in download activity. Although open-access papers enjoy\nmore downloads on average, the proportions falling into each category are\nsimilar.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Sep 2014 10:20:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 21:41:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mryglod", "Olesya", ""], ["Kenna", "Ralph", ""], ["Holovatch", "Yurij", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8029", "submitter": "Arnab Chatterjee", "authors": "Arnab Chatterjee, Asim Ghosh, Bikas K Chakrabarti", "title": "Universality of citation distributions for academic institutions and\n  journals", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figs + Supplementary information (8 pages, 7 fig, 6\n  tables).
