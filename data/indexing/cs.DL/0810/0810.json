Yet, due to increasing pressures of research and exponentially\ngrowing number of publications the task faced by the referees becomes ever more\ndifficult. We discuss here a few possible improvements that would enable more\nefficient review of the scientific literature, using the growing Internet\nconnectivity. In particular, a practical automated model for providing the\nreferees with references to papers that might have strong relationship with the\nwork under review, based on general network properties of citations is\nproposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Oct 2008 17:02:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sobkowicz", "Pawel", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4616", "submitter": "Claudine Brucks", "authors": "Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer", "title": "Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream", "comments": "12 pages, 8 Figures", "journal-ref": "Summary of the Master Thesis \"Actor-based Mind-map learning from\n  Text Streams\".

Putting this into\nsimulation by using an artificial mind-map is a challenge, which offers the\ngate for a wide field of applications like automatic text summarization or\npunctual retrieval. In this work we present a framework that is a first step\ntowards an automatic intellect. It aims at assembling a mind-map based on\nincoming text streams and on a subject-verb-object strategy, having the verb as\nan interconnection between the adjacent nouns. The mind-map's performance is\nenriched by a pronoun resolution engine that bases on the work of D. Klein, and\nC. D.

One of\nthe key characteristics of knowledge is its structured organization.

In this paper, we stand on the view point of granular computing\nand provide our understanding on multi-level and multi-view of knowledge\nthrough granular knowledge structures (GKS). Representation of granular\nknowledge structures, operations for building granular knowledge structures and\nhow to use them are investigated. As an illustration, we provide some examples\nthrough results from an analysis of proceeding papers. Results show that\ngranular knowledge structures could help users get better understanding of the\nknowledge source from set theoretical, logical and visual point of views. One\nmay consider using them to meet specific needs or solve certain kinds of\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Oct 2008 07:17:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zeng", "Yi", ""], ["Zhong", "Ning", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.5057", "submitter": "Patricia Gautier", "authors": "Claire Fran\\c{c}ois (INIST), Jean-Charles Lamirel (INRIA Lorraine -\n  LORIA), Shadi Al Shehabi (INRIA Lorraine - LORIA)", "title": "Combining Advanced Visualization and Automatized Reasoning for\n  Webometrics: A Test Study", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "COLLNET 2006, France (2006)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a first attempt at performing a precise and automatic\nidentification of the linking behaviour in a scientific domain through the\nanalysis of the communication of the related academic institutions on the web.\nThe proposed approach is based on the paradigm of multiple viewpoint data\nanalysis (MVDA) than can be fruitfully exploited to highlight relationships\nbetween data, like websites, carrying several kinds of description.
