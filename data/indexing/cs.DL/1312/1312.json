Three different indicators - based on the number of publications or\ncitations - are considered as response variables. The corresponding\ndistributions are highly skewed and display an excess of zero - valued\nobservations. In this setting, the goodness of fit of several Poisson mixture\nregression models are explored by assuming an extensive set of explanatory\nvariables. As to the personal observable characteristics of the researchers,\nthe results emphasize the age effect and the gender productivity gap, as\npreviously documented by existing studies. Analogously, the analysis confirm\nthat productivity is strongly affected by the publication and citation\npractices adopted in different scientific disciplines. The empirical evidence\non the connection between teaching and research activities suggests that no\nunivocal substitution or complementarity thesis can be claimed: a major\nteaching load does not affect the odds to be a non-active researcher and does\nnot significantly reduce the number of publications for active researchers. In\naddition, new evidence emerges on the effect of researchers administrative\ntasks, which seem to be negatively related with researcher's productivity, and\non the composition of departments. Researchers' productivity is apparently\nenhanced by operating in department filled with more administrative and\ntechnical staff, and it is not significantly affected by the composition of the\ndepartment in terms of senior or junior researchers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Nov 2013 10:20:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 14:30:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Baccini", "Alberto", ""], ["Barabesi", "Lucio", ""], ["Cioni", "Martina", ""], ["Pisani", "Caterina", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0465", "submitter": "Jennifer Warrender BSc MSc", "authors": "Jennifer D.

Design/Methodology/approach: We conduct a\ndescriptive study in which we examine coverage by discipline, publisher\ndistribution by field and country of publication, and publisher impact. For\nthis the Thomson Reuters' Subject Categories were aggregated into 15\ndisciplines. Findings: 30% of the total share of this database belongs to the\nfields of Humanities and Social Sciences. Most of the disciplines are covered\nby very few publishers mainly from the UK and USA (75.05% of the books), in\nfact 33 publishers concentrate 90% of the whole share. Regarding publisher\nimpact, 80.5% of the books and chapters remained uncited. Two serious errors\nwere found in this database. Firstly, the Book Citation Index does not retrieve\nall citations for books and chapters. Secondly, book citations do not include\ncitations to their chapters. Research limitations/implications: The Book\nCitation Index is still underdeveloped and has serious limitations which call\ninto caution when using it for bibliometric purposes. Practical implications:\nThe results obtained from this study warn against the use of this database for\nbibliometric purposes, but opens a new window of opportunities for covering\nlong neglected areas such as Humanities and Social Sciences. The target\naudience of this study is librarians, bibliometricians, researchers, scientific\npublishers, prospective authors and evaluation agencies.

All codes have been used to generate results published in or\nsubmitted to a refereed journal and are available either via a download site or\nfroman identified source. In addition to being the largest directory of\nscientist-written astrophysics programs available, the ASCL is also an active\nparticipant in the reproducible research movement with presentations at various\nconferences, numerous blog posts and a journal article.

Disentangling randomness\nfrom organizational principles is even more demanding when networks have a\nmultiplex nature. Multiplex networks are multilayer systems of $N$ nodes that\ncan be linked in multiple interacting and co-evolving layers. In these\nnetworks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were\nanalyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers\nfails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of\ncomplex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex\nco-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the\nAmerican Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly\ncorrelated with multiplex structure, and provide empirical evidence in favor of\nthe advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as\nmultistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio. Finally, we introduce a\ntheoretical framework based on the entropy of multiplex ensembles to quantify\nthe information stored in multiplex networks that would remain undetected if\nthe single layers were analyzed in isolation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 23:28:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Menichetti", "Giulia", ""], ["Remondini", "Daniel", ""], ["Panzarasa", "Pietro", ""], ["Mondrag\u00f3n", "Ra\u00fal J.", ""], ["Bianconi", "Ginestra", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.6935", "submitter": "Branko Malesevic", "authors": "Branko Malesevic, Ratko Obradovic, Bojan Banjac, Ivana Jovovic, Milica\n  Makragic", "title": "Application of polynomial texture mapping in process of digitalization\n  of cultural heritage", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present modern texture mapping techniques and several\napplications of polynomial texture mapping in cultural heritage programs.

The assessment of productivity is an instrument to select and\npromote personnel, assign research grants and measure the results of research\nprojects. One particular assessment approach is bibliometrics i.e., the\nquantitative analysis of scientific publications through citation and content\nanalysis. However, there is little consensus today on how research evaluation\nshould be performed, and it is commonly acknowledged that the quantitative\nmetrics available today are largely unsatisfactory. A number of different\nscientific data sources available on the Web (e.g., DBLP, Google Scholar) that\nare used for such analysis purposes. Taking data from these diverse sources,\nperforming the analysis and visualizing results in different ways is not a\ntrivial and straight forward task. Moreover, people involved in such evaluation\nprocesses are not always IT experts and hence not capable to crawl data\nsources, merge them and compute the needed evaluation procedures. The recent\nemergence of mashup tools has refueled research on end-user development, i.e.,\non enabling end-users without programming skills to produce their own\napplications. We believe that the heart of the problem is that it is\nimpractical to design tools that are generic enough to cover a wide range of\napplication domains, powerful enough to enable the specification of non-trivial\nlogic, and simple enough to be actually accessible to non-programmers. This\nthesis presents a novel approach for an effective end-user development,\nspecifically for non-programmers. That is, we introduce a domain-specific\napproach to mashups that \"speaks the language of users\"., i.e., that is aware\nof the terminology, concepts, rules, and conventions (the domain) the user is\ncomfortable with.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2013 11:19:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Jan 2014 18:11:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 6 Jan 2014 19:08:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Imran", "Muhammad", ""]]}]
