The networks\nof collaborators, termed 'epistemic communities', should thus have a\nspace-independent structure. This paper shows that such a notion of globalized\nscientific collaboration is not supported by empirical data. It introduces a\nnovel approach of analyzing distance-dependent probabilities of collaboration.\nThe results of the analysis of six distinct scientific fields reveal that\nintra-country collaboration is about 10-50 times more likely to occur than\ninternational collaboration. Moreover, strong dependencies exist between\ncollaboration activity (measured in co-authorships) and spatial distance when\nconfined to national borders. However, the fact that distance becomes\nirrelevant once collaboration is taken to the international scale suggests a\nglobalized science system that is strongly influenced by the gravity of local\nscience clusters. The similarity of the probability functions of the six\nscience fields analyzed suggests a universal mode of spatial governance that is\nindependent from the mode of knowledge creation in science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2011 15:38:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Hennemann", "Stefan", ""], ["Rybski", "Diego", ""], ["Liefner", "Ingo", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3271", "submitter": "Benjamin Kaube BSc", "authors": "T.
