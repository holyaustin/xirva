However, scientific activity has moved online over\nthe past decade. To better capture scientific impact in the digital era, a\nvariety of new impact measures has been proposed on the basis of social network\nanalysis and usage log data. Here we investigate how these new measures relate\nto each other, and how accurately and completely they express scientific\nimpact. We performed a principal component analysis of the rankings produced by\n39 existing and proposed measures of scholarly impact that were calculated on\nthe basis of both citation and usage log data. Our results indicate that the\nnotion of scientific impact is a multi-dimensional construct that can not be\nadequately measured by any single indicator, although some measures are more\nsuitable than others. The commonly used citation Impact Factor is not\npositioned at the core of this construct, but at its periphery, and should thus\nbe used with caution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2009 18:31:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2009 19:18:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bollen", "Johan", ""], ["Van de Sompel", "Herbert", ""], ["Hagberg", "Aric", ""], ["Chute", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2953", "submitter": "Artem Chebotko", "authors": "Shiyong Lu, Rong Huang, Artem Chebotko, Yu Deng, Farshad Fotouhi", "title": "ImageSpace: An Environment for Image Ontology Management", "comments": "Appeared in the International Journal of Information Theories and\n  Applications (IJITA), 11(2), pp. 127-134, 2004", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Information Theories and Applications\n  (IJITA), 11(2), pp. 127-134, 2004", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.DB cs.MM cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  More and more researchers have realized that ontologies will play a critical\nrole in the development of the Semantic Web, the next generation Web in which\ncontent is not only consumable by humans, but also by software agents.
