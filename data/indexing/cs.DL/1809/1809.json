At\nthe core of this movement, research objects contain and describe scientific\ninformation and resources in a way compliant with the FAIR principles and\nsustain the development of key infrastructure and tools. This paper provides an\naccount of the challenges, experiences and solutions involved in the adoption\nof FAIR around research objects over several Earth Science disciplines. During\nthis journey, our work has been comprehensive, with outcomes including: an\nextended research object model adapted to the needs of earth scientists; the\nprovisioning of digital object identifiers (DOI) to enable persistent\nidentification and to give due credit to authors; the generation of\ncontent-based, semantically rich, research object metadata through natural\nlanguage processing, enhancing visibility and reuse through recommendation\nsystems and third-party search engines; and various types of checklists that\nprovide a compact representation of research object quality as a key enabler of\nscientific reuse. All these results have been integrated in ROHub, a platform\nthat provides research object management functionality to a wealth of\napplications and interfaces across different scientific communities. To monitor\nand quantify the community uptake of research objects, we have defined\nindicators and obtained measures via ROHub that are also discussed herein.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2018 16:28:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia-Silva", "Andres", ""], ["Gomez-Perez", "Jose Manuel", ""], ["Palma", "Raul", ""], ["Krystek", "Marcin", ""], ["Mantovani", "Simone", ""], ["Foglini", "Federica", ""], ["Grande", "Valentina", ""], ["De Leo", "Francesco", ""], ["Salvi", "Stefano", ""], ["Trasati", "Elisa", ""], ["Romaniello", "Vito", ""], ["Albani", "Mirko", ""], ["Silvagni", "Cristiano", ""], ["Leone", "Rosemarie", ""], ["Marelli", "Fulvio", ""], ["Albani", "Sergio", ""], ["Lazzarini", "Michele", ""], ["Napier", "Hazel J.", ""], ["Glaves", "Helen M.", ""], ["Aldridge", "Timothy", ""], ["Meertens", "Charles", ""], ["Boler", "Fran", ""], ["Loescher", "Henry W.", ""], ["Laney", "Christine", ""], ["Genazzio", "Melissa A", ""], ["Crawl", "Daniel", ""], ["Altintas", "Ilkay", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10999", "submitter": "Ricardo Brito", "authors": "Ricardo Brito, Alonso Rodr\\'iguez-Navarro", "title": "Evaluating research and researchers by the journal impact factor: is it\n  better than coin flipping?", "comments": "24 pages, 1 figure and 4 tables in the main text, plus 1 table as\n  supplementary material.

The\nmethod assumes that all papers in a journal have the same scientific merit,\nwhich is measured by the JIF of the publishing journal. This implies that the\nnumber of citations measures scientific merits but the JIF does not evaluate\neach individual paper by its own number of citations. Therefore, in the\ncomparative evaluation of two papers, the use of the JIF implies a risk of\nfailure, which occurs when a paper in the journal with the lower JIF is\ncompared to another with fewer citations in the journal with the higher JIF. To\nquantify this risk of failure, this study calculates the failure probabilities,\ntaking advantage of the lognormal distribution of citations. In two journals\nwhose JIFs are ten-fold different, the failure probability is low. However, in\nmost cases when two papers are compared, the JIFs of the journals are not so\ndifferent. Then, the failure probability can be close to 0.5, which is\nequivalent to evaluating by coin flipping.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:55:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Oct 2018 10:25:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2019 08:52:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Brito", "Ricardo", ""], ["Rodr\u00edguez-Navarro", "Alonso", ""]]}]
