By linking 28254 publications\nin F1000 to citations in Scopus, we investigated the effect of research level\nand article type on the internal consistency of assessments based on citations\nand FFa scores. It turns out that research level has little impact, while\narticle type has big effect on the differences. These two measures are\nsignificantly different for two groups: non-primary research or evidence-based\nresearch publications are more highly cited rather than highly recommended,\nhowever, translational research or transformative research publications are\nmore highly recommended by faculty members but gather relatively lower\ncitations. This can be expected because citation activities are usually\npracticed by academic authors while the potential for scientific revolutions\nand the suitability for clinical practice of an article should be investigated\nfrom the practitioners' points of view. We conclude with a policy relevant\nrecommendation that the application of bibliometric approaches in research\nevaluation procedures should include the proportion of three types of\npublications: evidence-based research, transformative research, and\ntranslational research.
