This process can be influenced by strategic\nmotivations, as early career researchers are pursuers, whereas senior\nresearchers are typically attractors, of new collaborative opportunities.\nFocusing on the longitudinal aspects of scientific collaboration, we analyzed\n473 collaboration profiles using an ego-centric perspective which accounts for\nresearcher-specific characteristics and provides insight into a range of\ntopics, from career achievement and sustainability to team dynamics and\nefficiency. From more than 166,000 collaboration records, we quantify the\nfrequency distributions of collaboration duration and tie-strength, showing\nthat collaboration networks are dominated by weak ties characterized by high\nturnover rates. We use analytic extreme-value thresholds to identify a new\nclass of indispensable `super ties', the strongest of which commonly exhibit\n>50% publication overlap with the central scientist. The prevalence of super\nties suggests that they arise from career strategies based upon cost, risk, and\nreward sharing and complementary skill matching. We then use a combination of\ndescriptive and panel regression methods to compare the subset of publications\ncoauthored with a super tie to the subset without one, controlling for\npertinent features such as career age, prestige, team size, and prior group\nexperience. We find that super ties contribute to above-average productivity\nand a 17% citation increase per publication, thus identifying these\npartnerships - the analog of life partners - as a major factor in science\ncareer development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Sep 2015 12:58:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.02207", "submitter": "Fredrik Nyg{\\aa}rd Carlsen", "authors": "Fredrik Nyg{\\aa}rd Carlsen", "title": "Personalized Search", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "CERN-IT-Note-2015-007", "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As the volume of electronically available information grows, relevant items\nbecome harder to find.

To study this decision-making\nprocess, we examine the reading choices made by one of the most celebrated\nscientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the full-text of books\nlisted in his chronologically-organized reading journals, we generate topic\nmodels to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global (text-to-past) reading\ndecisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a cognitively-validated,\ninformation-theoretic measure of relative surprise. Rather than a pattern of\nsurprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure exploitation strategy, Darwin's\nbehavior shifts from early exploitation to later exploration, seeking unusually\nhigh levels of cognitive surprise relative to previous eras. These shifts,\ndetected by an unsupervised Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual\nepochs of his career as identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin's\nown self-commentary. Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts\nwith their publication order. We find Darwin's consumption more exploratory\nthan the culture's production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal\nchanges are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our\nquantitative methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework\nfor testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between\nshort- and long-term consumption choices.

The technology network's structure can\nreveal properties of technologies and of human behavior, if it can be mapped\naccurately. Technology networks have been made from patent data, using several\nmeasures of proximity. These measures, however, are influenced by factors of\nthe patenting system that do not reflect technologies or their proximity. We\nintroduce a method to precisely normalize out multiple impinging factors in\npatent data and extract the true signal of technological proximity, by\ncomparing the empirical proximity measures with what they would be in random\nsituations that remove the impinging factors. With this method, we created\ntechnology networks, using data from 3.9 million patents. After normalization,\ndifferent measures of proximity became more correlated with each other,\napproaching a single dimension of technological proximity. The normalized\ntechnology networks were sparse, with few pairs of technology domains being\nsignificantly related. The normalized network corresponded with human behavior:\nwe analyzed the patenting histories of 2.8 million inventors and found they\nwere more likely to invent in two different technology domains if the pair was\nclosely related in the technology network. We also analyzed 250 thousand firms'\npatents and found that, in contrast, firms' inventive activities were only\nmodestly associated with the technology network; firms' portfolios combined\npairs of technology domains about twice as often as inventors. These results\nsuggest that controlling for impinging factors provides meaningful measures of\ntechnological proximity for patent-based mapping of the technology space, and\nthat this map can be used to aid in technology innovation planning and\nmanagement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 09:34:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 19:48:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 10:40:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Alstott", "Jeff", ""], ["Triulzi", "Giorgio", ""], ["Yan", "Bowen", ""], ["Luo", "Jianxi", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07313", "submitter": "Soumya Banerjee", "authors": "Soumya Banerjee", "title": "Analysis of a Planetary Scale Scientific Collaboration Dataset Reveals\n  Novel Patterns", "comments": "Proceedings of the Complex Systems Digital Campus 2015 World\n  eConference Conference on Complex Systems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Scientific collaboration networks are an important component of scientific\noutput and contribute significantly to expanding our knowledge and to the\neconomy and gross domestic product of nations.

A concept of fractional\nauthorship (the claiming of credit for authorship by more than one individual)\nhelps to clarify this issue by providing a more complete picture of research\nactivities. In the present work, nuclear physics fractional and total\nauthorships have been investigated using nuclear data mining techniques.\nHistoric total and fractional authorship averages have been extracted from the\nNuclear Science References (NSR) database, and the current range of fractional\ncontributions has been deduced.
