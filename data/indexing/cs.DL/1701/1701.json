Following Husserl's idea of a\nhorizon of meaning in intersubjective communication, we propose a way in which,\nusing Shannon's equations, the generation and selection of meanings from a\nhorizon of possibilities can be considered probabilistically. The\ninformation-theoretical dynamics we articulate considers a process of meaning\ngeneration within cultural evolution: information is imbued with meaning, and\nthrough this process, the number of options for the selection of meaning in\ndiscourse proliferates. The redundancy of possible meanings contributes to a\ncodification of expectations within the discourse. Unlike hard-wired DNA, the\ncodes of non-biological systems can co-evolve with the variations. Spanning\nhorizons of meaning, the codes structure the communications as selection\nenvironments that shape discourses. Discursive knowledge can be considered as\nmeta-coded communication which enables us to translate among differently coded\ncommunications. The dynamics of discursive knowledge production can thus infuse\nthe historical dynamics with a cultural evolution by adding options, that is,\nby increasing redundancy. A calculus of redundancy is presented as an indicator\nwhereby these dynamics of discourse and meaning may be explored empirically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 07:27:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2018 20:48:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""], ["Johnson", "Mark W.", ""], ["Ivanova", "Inga", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02461", "submitter": "Karen Shashok", "authors": "Karen Shashok", "title": "Can scientists and their institutions become their own open access\n  publishers?", "comments": "23 pages, 2 tabes, 58 references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CY", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  This article offers a personal perspective on the current state of academic\npublishing, and posits that the scientific community is beset with journals\nthat contribute little valuable knowledge, overload the community's capacity\nfor high-quality peer review, and waste resources.

We observe remarkably high levels of power\ninequality among the PLOS ONE editors, with the top-10 editors responsible for\n3,366 articles -- corresponding to 2.4% of the 141,986 articles we analyzed.\nSuch high inequality levels suggest the presence of unintended incentives,\nwhich may reinforce unethical behavior in the form of decision-level biases at\nthe editorial level. Our results indicate that editors may become apathetic in\njudging the quality of articles and susceptible to modes of power-driven\nmisconduct. We used the longitudinal dimension of editor activity to develop\ntwo panel regression models which test and verify the presence of editor-level\nbias. In the first model we analyzed the citation impact of articles, and in\nthe second model we modeled the decision time between an article being\nsubmitted and ultimately accepted by the editor. We focused on two variables\nthat represent social factors that capture potential conflicts-of-interest: (i)\nwe accounted for the social ties between editors and authors by developing a\nmeasure of repeat authorship among an editor's article set, and (ii) we\naccounted for the rate of citations directed towards the editor's own\npublications in the reference list of each article he/she oversaw. Our results\nindicate that these two factors play a significant role in the editorial\ndecision process.

The method introduced in Reffle (2013) computes\nsuch a profile, combining lexica, pattern sets and advanced matching techniques\nin a specialized Expectation Maximization (EM) procedure. Here we improve this\nmethod in three respects: First, the method in Reffle (2013) is not adaptive:\nuser feedback obtained by actual postcorrection steps cannot be used to compute\nrefined profiles. We introduce a variant of the method that is open for\nadaptivity, taking correction steps of the user into account. This leads to\nhigher precision with respect to recognition of erroneous OCR tokens. Second,\nduring postcorrection often new historical patterns are found. We show that\nadding new historical patterns to the linguistic background resources leads to\na second kind of improvement, enabling even higher precision by telling\nhistorical spellings apart from OCR errors. Third, the method in Reffle (2013)\ndoes not make any active use of tokens that cannot be interpreted in the\nunderlying channel model. We show that adding these uninterpretable tokens to\nthe set of conjectured errors leads to a significant improvement of the recall\nfor error detection, at the same time improving precision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jan 2017 11:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Fink", "Florian", ""], ["Schulz", "Klaus-U.", ""], ["Springmann", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08008", "submitter": "Michael Taylor Dr", "authors": "Micha\\\"el Bon, Michael Taylor, Gary S.
