It is therefore\nimportant for the future of scientific practice to reflect upon the individual\nscientist's ethical responsibilities within teams. To facilitate this\nreflection we show labor force trends in the US revealing a skewed growth in\nacademic ranks and increased levels of competition for promotion within the\nsystem; we analyze teaming trends across disciplines and national borders\ndemonstrating why it is becoming difficult to distribute credit and to avoid\nconflicts of interest; and we use more than a century of Nobel prize data to\nshow how science is outgrowing its old institutions of singleton awards. Of\nparticular concern within the large team environment is the weakening of the\nmentor-mentee relation, which undermines the cultivation of virtue ethics\nacross scientific generations. These trends and emerging organizational\ncomplexities call for a universal set of behavioral norms that transcend team\nheterogeneity and hierarchy. To this end, our expository analysis provides a\nsurvey of ethical issues in team settings to inform science ethics education\nand science policy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 10:43:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 09:43:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Pavlidis", "Ioannis", ""], ["Semendeferi", "Ioanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.0359", "submitter": "Lutz Bornmann Dr.", "authors": "Lutz Bornmann", "title": "Inter-rater reliability and convergent validity of F1000Prime peer\n  review", "comments": "Accepted for publication in the Journal of the Association for\n  Information Science and Technology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Peer review is the backbone of modern science.

In this paper, we expose the origin\nof this incompleteness and then also propose a method of completing the\ndefinition of $h$ in a way which remains close to its original guiding\nprinciple.

Additionally, selfelaborated data is offered, which are intended to\nprovide current evidence about the popularity of these tools on the Web, by\nmeasuring the number of rich files PDF, PPT and DOC in which these tools are\nmentioned, the amount of external links that both products receive, and the\nsearch queries frequency from Google Trends. The poor results obtained by MAS\nled us to an unexpected and unnoticed discovery: Microsoft Academic Search is\noutdated since 2013. Therefore, the second part of the working paper aims at\nadvancing some data demonstrating this lack of update. For this purpose we\ngathered the number of total records indexed by Microsoft Academic Search since\n2000. The data shows an abrupt drop in the number of documents indexed from\n2,346,228 in 2010 to 8,147 in 2013 and 802 in 2014. This decrease is offered\naccording to 15 thematic areas as well. In view of these problems it seems\nlogical not only that Microsoft Academic Searchwas poorly used to search for\narticles by academics and students, who mostly use Google or Google Scholar,\nbut virtually ignored by bibliometricians\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 16:28:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2014 12:07:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2014 18:47:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Orduna-Malea", "Enrique", ""], ["Ayllon", "Juan Manuel", ""], ["Martin-Martin", "Alberto", ""], ["Lopez-Cozar", "Emilio Delgado", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7099", "submitter": "Philipp Mayr", "authors": "Philipp Mayr, Philipp Schaer, Andrea Scharnhorst, Peter Mutschke", "title": "Editorial for the Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval Workshop\n  at ECIR 2014", "comments": "4 pages, Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval Workshop at ECIR\n  2014, Amsterdam, NL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This first \"Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval\" (BIR 2014) workshop\naims to engage with the IR community about possible links to bibliometrics and\nscholarly communication.
