We apply the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to IFs to understand\ntheir scale-dependent behavior. For a journal of $n$ randomly selected papers\nfrom a population of all papers, we expect from the CLT that its IF fluctuates\naround the population average $\\mu$, and spans a range of values proportional\nto $\\sigma/\\sqrt[]{n}$, where $\\sigma^2$ is the variance of the population's\ncitation distribution. The $1/\\sqrt[]{n}$ dependence has profound implications\nfor IF rankings: The larger a journal, the narrower the range around $\\mu$\nwhere its IF lies. IF rankings therefore allocate an unfair advantage to\nsmaller journals in the high IF ranks, and to larger journals in the low IF\nranks. We expect a scale-dependent stratification of journals in IF rankings,\nwhereby small journals occupy top, middle, and bottom ranks; mid-sized journals\noccupy middle ranks; and very large journals have IFs that asymptotically\napproach $\\mu$. We confirm these predictions by analyzing (i) 166,498 IF \\&\njournal-size data pairs in the 1997--2016 Journal Citation Reports of Clarivate\nAnalytics, (ii) the top-cited portion of 276,000 physics papers published in\n2014--2015, and (iii) the citation distributions of an arbitrarily sampled list\nof physics journals. We conclude that the CLT is a good predictor of the IF\nrange of actual journals, while sustained deviations from its predictions are a\nmark of true, non-random, citation impact. IF rankings are thus misleading\nunless one compares like-sized journals or adjusts for these effects. We\npropose the $\\Phi$ index, a rescaled IF adjusted for size, which can be\ngeneralized to account also for different citation practices across research\nfields.

In the last few years, different types of\nUniversity Rankings have been proposed to quantify the excellence of different\nresearch institutions in the world. Albeit met with criticism in some cases,\nthe relevance of university rankings is being increasingly acknowledged:\nindeed, rankings are having a major impact on the design of research policies,\nboth at the institutional and governmental level. Yet, the debate on what\nrankings are {\\em exactly} measuring is enduring. Here, we address the issue by\nmeasuring a quantitive and reliable proxy of the academic reputation of a given\ninstitution and by evaluating its correlation with different university\nrankings. Specifically, we study citation patterns among universities in five\ndifferent Web of Science Subject Categories and use the \\pr~algorithm on the\nfive resulting citation networks. The rationale behind our work is that\nscientific citations are driven by the reputation of the reference so that the\nPageRank algorithm is expected to yield a rank which reflects the reputation of\nan academic institution in a specific field. Our results allow to quantifying\nthe prestige of a set of institutions in a certain research field based only on\nhard bibliometric data. Given the volume of the data analysed, our findings are\nstatistically robust and less prone to bias, at odds with ad--hoc surveys often\nemployed by ranking bodies in order to attain similar results. Because our\nfindings are found to correlate extremely well with the ARWU Subject rankings,\nthe approach we propose in our paper may open the door to new, Academic Ranking\nmethodologies that go beyond current methods by reconciling the qualitative\nevaluation of Academic Prestige with its quantitative measurements via\npublication impact.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2018 13:11:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2019 11:50:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Massucci", "Francesco Alessandro", ""], ["Docampo", "Domingo", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.09317", "submitter": "Loet Leydesdorff", "authors": "Loet Leydesdorff", "title": "Diversity and Interdisciplinarity: How Can One Distinguish and Recombine\n  Disparity, Variety, and Balance?", "comments": "Scientometrics, accepted June 7, 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The dilemma which remained unsolved using Rao-Stirling diversity, namely of\nhow variety and balance can be combined into \"dual concept diversity\"\n(Stirling, 1998, pp. 48f.) can be clarified by using Nijssen et al.'s (1998)\nargument that the Gini coefficient is a perfect indicator of balance.

This is true in general for all phases of a literature\nreview, and in particular for the paper screening phase, where authors lter a\nset of potentially in-scope papers based on a number of exclusion criteria. To\naddress the problem, in recent years the research community has began to\nexplore the use of the crowd to allow for a faster, accurate, cheaper and\nunbiased screening of papers. Initial results show that crowdsourcing can be\neffective, even for relatively complex reviews. In this paper we derive and\nanalyze a set of strategies for crowd-based screening, and show that an\nadaptive strategy, that continuously re-assesses the statistical properties of\nthe problem to minimize the number of votes needed to take decisions for each\npaper, significantly outperforms a number of non-adaptive approaches in terms\nof cost and accuracy.
