We show that the\nprobability that an article is cited $c$ times has large variations between\ndifferent disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a universal curve\nwhen the relative indicator $c_f=c/c_0$ is considered, where $c_0$ is the\naverage number of citations per article for the discipline. In addition we show\nthat the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles\npublished in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These\nfindings provide a strong validation of $c_f$ as an unbiased indicator for\ncitation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we\nintroduce a generalization of the h-index suitable for comparing scientists\nworking in different fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2008 13:55:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Oct 2008 15:18:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Radicchi", "Filippo", ""], ["Fortunato", "Santo", ""], ["Castellano", "Claudio", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.1246", "submitter": "Rodrigo Torrens", "authors": "Rodrigo Torrens, Luis A.
