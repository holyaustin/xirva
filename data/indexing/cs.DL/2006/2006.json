To do this, a set of 100 Turkish universities were selected as a\ncase study. The productivity in Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and GS (2000 to\n2013) were captured in two different measurement iterations (2014 and 2018). In\naddition, a total of 18,174 documents published by a subset of 14\nresearch-focused universities were retrieved from WoS, verifying their presence\nin GS within the official university web domain. Findings suggest that the\nretroactive growth in GS is unpredictable and dependent on each university,\nmaking this parameter hard to evaluate at the institutional level. Otherwise,\nthe correlation of productivity between GS (url-based method) and WoS and\nScopus (selected sources) is moderately positive, even though it varies\ndepending on the university, the year of publication, and the year of\nmeasurement. Finally, only 16% out of 18,174 articles analyzed were indexed in\nthe official university website, although up to 84% were indexed in other GS\nsources. This work proves that the url-based method to calculate institutional\nproductivity in GS is not a good proxy for the total number of publications\nindexed in WoS and Scopus, at least in the national context analyzed.

In this paper, we propose\nto use aspect-based sentiment analysis of scientific reviews to be able to\nextract useful information, which correlates well with the accept/reject\ndecision.\n  While working on a dataset of close to 8k reviews from ICLR, one of the top\nconferences in the field of machine learning, we use an active learning\nframework to build a training dataset for aspect prediction, which is further\nused to obtain the aspects and sentiments for the entire dataset. We show that\nthe distribution of aspect-based sentiments obtained from a review is\nsignificantly different for accepted and rejected papers. We use the aspect\nsentiments from these reviews to make an intriguing observation, certain\naspects present in a paper and discussed in the review strongly determine the\nfinal recommendation. As a second objective, we quantify the extent of\ndisagreement among the reviewers refereeing a paper. We also investigate the\nextent of disagreement between the reviewers and the chair and find that the\ninter-reviewer disagreement may have a link to the disagreement with the chair.\nOne of the most interesting observations from this study is that reviews, where\nthe reviewer score and the aspect sentiments extracted from the review text\nwritten by the reviewer are consistent, are also more likely to be concurrent\nwith the chair's decision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2020 07:06:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Souvic", ""], ["Goyal", "Pawan", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Animesh", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.03358", "submitter": "Henk Moed", "authors": "Felix de Moya-Anegon, Carmen Lopez-Illescas, Vicente Guerrero-Bote,\n  Henk F.

Therefore, the minimum values of the\nindicators, required to be fulfilled if one is applying for a DSc title, do not\nadequately reflect the actual discipline-specific performance of researchers.\nThis problem may generate tension between researchers during the evaluation\nprocess. The main goal of this paper is to recalibrate the minimum values of\nfour major performance indicators by taking the actual discipline-specific\ndistance ratios into account. In addition, each minimum value will be defined\nby employing integer and fractional counting methods as well. The research\noutcome of this study can provide impetus for the Section of Earth Sciences to\noptimize the minimum values of the DSc title performance indicators by taking\nthe specifics of each discipline into account. Because academic performance\nindicators are also employed in other Eastern European countries in the\nevaluation of individuals' research performance, the methods used in that paper\ncan be placed into a wider geographical context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2020 20:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Csomos", "Gyorgy", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13438", "submitter": "Diego Chialva", "authors": "Diego Chialva, Alexis-Michel Mugabushaka", "title": "DINGO: an ontology for projects and grants linked data", "comments": "Accepted for the SKG2020 Workshop co-located with TPDL 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.AI cs.CY cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present DINGO (Data INtegration for Grants Ontology), an ontology that\nprovides a machine readable extensible framework to model data for\nsemantically-enabled applications relative to projects, funding, actors, and,\nnotably, funding policies in the research landscape.

(2) The COVID-19\npolicy frontier disproportionately draws on the latest, peer-reviewed, and\nhigh-impact scientific insights.

One reason for this is the lack\nof a complete and updated database containing the electronic addresses (web\ndomain names) of the municipal governments having a website. Due to diverse\ncauses, not all the Mexican municipalities have one, and a number of those\nhaving it do not present information corresponding to the current governments\nbut, instead, to other previous ones. The scarce official lists of municipal\nwebsites are not updated with the sufficient frequency, and manually\ndetermining which municipalities have an operating and valid website in a given\nmoment is a time-consuming process. Besides, website contents do not always\ncomply with legal requirements and are considerably heterogeneous. In turn, the\nevolution development level of municipal websites is valuable information that\ncan be harnessed for diverse theoretical and practical purposes in the public\nadministration field. Obtaining all these pieces of information requires\nwebsite content analysis. Therefore, this article investigates the need for and\nthe feasibility to automate implementation and updating of a digital repository\nto perform diverse analyses of these websites. Its technological feasibility is\naddressed by means of a literature review about web scraping and by proposing a\npreliminary manual methodology. This takes into account known, proven,\ntechniques and software tools for web crawling and scraping. No new techniques\nfor crawling or scraping are proposed because the existing ones satisfy the\ncurrent needs.

We measure the degree\nof interdisciplinarity of a paper using three popular indicators, namely\nvariety, balance, and disparity, and track how it gets cited by patented\ntechnologies over time. Drawing on a large sample of biomedical papers\npublished in 18 years, we find that papers that cites more fields (variety) and\nwhose distributions over those cited fields are more even (balance) are more\nlikely to receive patent citations, but both effects can be offset if papers\ndraw upon more distant fields (disparity). Those associations are consistent\nacross different citation-window lengths. Additional analysis that focuses on\nthe subset of papers with at least one patent citation reveals that the\nintensity of their technological impact, as measured as the number of patent\ncitations, increases with balance and disparity.
