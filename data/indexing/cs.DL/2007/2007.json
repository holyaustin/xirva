Then we develop a strong double-blind mechanism to protect the\nidentities of authors and reviewers. With this strong double-blind mechanism,\nauthors can choose to submit papers anonymously, and validators distribute\npapers anonymously to reviewers on the blockchain according to their research\ninterests. This process is publicly recorded and traceable on the blockchain so\nas to realize transparent peer preview. To evaluate its efficiency, we\nimplement Open-Pub based on Ethereum and conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate its performance, including computation cost and processing delay.

The results showed that the first CR in the field can be dated back\nto 1882 and written in English; but the majority (64.2%) of the CR in the field\nwere Chinese publications. 17 peaks referring to 18 seminal works (13 in\nEnglish and 5 in Chinese) were located during the period from 1900 to 2017. The\nfield shared the same roots with that in the English world but has its own\ncharacteristics, and it was then shaped by contributions from both the English\nworld and China. The five Chinese works have played irreplaceable and positive\nroles in the historical evolutionary path of the field, which should not be\nignored, especially for the evolution of the field.

Multiple laboratories across the United States are\ncollecting tissue specimens from different organs of donors who vary in sex,\nage, and body size. Integrating and harmonizing the data derived from these\nsamples and 'mapping' them into a common three-dimensional (3D) space is a\nmajor challenge. The key to making this possible is a 'Common Coordinate\nFramework' (CCF), which provides a semantically annotated, 3D reference system\nfor the entire body. The CCF enables contributors to HuBMAP to 'register'\nspecimens and datasets within a common spatial reference system, and it\nsupports a standardized way to query and 'explore' data in a spatially and\nsemantically explicit manner. [...] This paper describes the construction and\nusage of a CCF for the human body and its reference implementation in HuBMAP.\nThe CCF consists of (1) a CCF Clinical Ontology, which provides metadata about\nthe specimen and donor (the 'who'); (2) a CCF Semantic Ontology, which\ndescribes 'what' part of the body a sample came from and details anatomical\nstructures, cell types, and biomarkers (ASCT+B); and (3) a CCF Spatial\nOntology, which indicates 'where' a tissue sample is located in a 3D coordinate\nsystem. An initial version of all three CCF ontologies has been implemented for\nthe first HuBMAP Portal release. It was successfully used by Tissue Mapping\nCenters to semantically annotate and spatially register 48 kidney and spleen\ntissue blocks. The blocks can be queried and explored in their clinical,\nsemantic, and spatial context via the CCF user interface in the HuBMAP Portal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2020 20:35:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00f6rner", "Katy", ""], ["Quardokus", "Ellen M.", ""], ["Herr", "Bruce W.", "II"], ["Cross", "Leonard E.", ""], ["Record", "Elizabeth G.", ""], ["Ju", "Yingnan", ""], ["Bueckle", "Andreas D.", ""], ["Sluka", "James P.", ""], ["Silverstein", "Jonathan C.", ""], ["Browne", "Kristen M.", ""], ["Jain", "Sanjay", ""], ["Wasserfall", "Clive H.", ""], ["Jorgensen", "Marda L.", ""], ["Spraggins", "Jeffrey M.", ""], ["Patterson", "Nathan H.", ""], ["Musen", "Mark A.", ""], ["Weber", "Griffin M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.14771", "submitter": "Konstantinos Demertzis", "authors": "Vasiliki Demertzi and Konstantinos Demertzis", "title": "A Hybrid Adaptive Educational eLearning Project based on Ontologies\n  Matching and Recommendation System", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The implementation of teaching interventions in learning needs has received\nconsiderable attention, as the provision of the same educational conditions to\nall students, is pedagogically ineffective.
