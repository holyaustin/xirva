The era was characterized by thinkers who\npromoted progressive social reforms that opposed the long-established\naristocracies and monarchies of the time. Prominent examples of such reforms\ninclude the establishment of inalienable human rights, self-governing\nrepublics, and market capitalism. Twenty-first century democratic nations can\nbenefit from revisiting the systems developed during the Enlightenment and\nreframing them within the techno-social context of the Information Age. This\narticle explores the application of social algorithms that make use of Thomas\nPaine's (English: 1737--1809) representatives, Adam Smith's (Scottish:\n1723--1790) self-interested actors, and Marquis de Condorcet's (French:\n1743--1794) optimal decision making groups. It is posited that\ntechnology-enabled social algorithms can better realize the ideals articulated\nduring the Enlightenment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Jan 2009 22:50:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2009 23:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "Marko A.", ""], ["Watkins", "Jennifer H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3939", "submitter": "Qingzhao Tan", "authors": "Qingzhao Tan, Prasenjit Mitra, C.

Users want to search for historical maps to determine recorded\nhistory of the political geography of regions at different eras, to find out\nwhere exactly archaeological artifacts were discovered, etc. Currently, they\nhave to use a generic search engine and add the term map along with other\nkeywords to search for maps. This crude method will generate a significant\nnumber of false positives that the user will need to cull through to get the\ndesired results. To reduce their manual effort, we propose an automatic map\nidentification, indexing, and retrieval system that enables users to search and\nretrieve maps appearing in a large corpus of digital documents using simple\nkeyword queries. We identify features that can help in distinguishing maps from\nother figures in digital documents and show how a Support-Vector-Machine-based\nclassifier can be used to identify maps. We propose map-level-metadata e.g.,\ncaptions, references to the maps in text, etc. and document-level metadata,\ne.g., title, abstract, citations, how recent the publication is, etc. and show\nhow they can be automatically extracted and indexed. Our novel ranking\nalgorithm weights different metadata fields differently and also uses the\ndocument-level metadata to help rank retrieved maps. Empirical evaluations show\nwhich features should be selected and which metadata fields should be weighted\nmore. We also demonstrate improved retrieval results in comparison to\nadaptations of existing methods for map retrieval. Our map search engine has\nbeen deployed in an online map-search system that is part of the Blind-Review\ndigital library system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 02:14:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Qingzhao", ""], ["Mitra", "Prasenjit", ""], ["Giles", "C.
