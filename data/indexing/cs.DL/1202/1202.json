In this paper we argue that software maintenance and reverse\nengineering have an opportunity to contribute to open data and to shape its\nfuture development. From the perspective of reverse engineering research, open\ndata is a new artifact that serves as input for reverse engineering techniques\nand processes. Specific challenges of open data are document scraping, image\nprocessing, and structure/schema recognition.

The mechanisms used to\nsupport preservation across different hosts can be used for automatic link\ngeneration and support preservation activities by moving data preservation from\nan archive centric perspective to a data centric preservation. Based on\nsimulations of small-world graphs of DOs created using the Unsupervised\nSmall-World algorithm, we report quantitative and qualitative results for\ngraphs ranging in size from 10 to 5000 DOs. Our results show that a Most\naggressive preservation policy makes the best use of distributed host resources\nwhile using one half of the number of messages of a Moderately aggressive\npreservation policy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Feb 2012 21:03:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cartledge", "Charles L.", ""], ["Nelson", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.4646", "submitter": "Edwin Henneken", "authors": "Edwin A.
