The use of an arithmetic average, however, remains\nunfortunate in the case of scientometric distributions because these can be\nextremely skewed (Seglen, 1992 and 1997). The new indicator cannot (or hardly)\nbe reproduced independently when used for evaluation purposes, and remains in\nthis sense opaque from the perspective of evaluated units and scholars.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 08:42:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Aug 2013 17:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.3783", "submitter": "Andrea Scharnhorst", "authors": "Richard Smiraglia, Andrea Scharnhorst, Almila Akdag Salah and Cheng\n  Gao", "title": "UDC in Action", "comments": "Accepted for the UDCC seminar 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) is not only a classification\nlanguage with a long history; it also presents a complex cognitive system\nworthy of the attention of complexity theory. The elements of the UDC: classes,\nauxiliaries, and operations are combined into symbolic strings, which in\nessence represent a complex networks of concepts. This network forms a backbone\nof ordering of knowledge and at the same time allows expression of different\nperspectives on various products of human knowledge production. In this paper\nwe look at UDC strings derived from the holdings of libraries. In particular we\nanalyse the subject headings of holdings of the university library in Leuven,\nand an extraction of UDC numbers from the OCLC WorldCat. Comparing those sets\nwith the Master Reference File, we look into the length of strings, the\noccurrence of different auxiliary signs, and the resulting connections between\nUDC classes. We apply methods and representations from complexity theory.\nMapping out basic statistics on UDC classes as used in libraries from a point\nof view of complexity theory bears different benefits. Deploying its structure\ncould serve as an overview and basic information for users among the nature and\nfocus of specific collections. A closer view into combined UDC numbers reveals\nthe complex nature of the UDC as an example for a knowledge ordering system,\nwhich deserves future exploration from a complexity theoretical perspective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 09:18:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Smiraglia", "Richard", ""], ["Scharnhorst", "Andrea", ""], ["Salah", "Almila Akdag", ""], ["Gao", "Cheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.4066", "submitter": "Tom Z.

In this paper, we study a\nparticular problem of this sort - estimating the missing year information\nassociated with publications (and hence authors' years of active publication).\nWe first propose a simple algorithm that only makes use of the \"direct\"\ninformation, such as paper citation/reference relationships or paper-author\nrelationships. The result of this simple algorithm is used as a benchmark for\ncomparison. Our goal is to develop algorithms that increase both the coverage\n(the percentage of missing year papers recovered) and accuracy (mean absolute\nerror of the estimated year to the real year). We propose some advanced\nalgorithms that extend inference by information propagation. For each\nalgorithm, we propose three versions according to the given academic social\nnetwork type: a) Homogeneous (only contains paper citation links), b) Bipartite\n(only contains paper-author relations), and, c) Heterogeneous (both paper\ncitation and paper-author relations). We carry out experiments on the three\npublic data sets (MSR Libra, DBLP and APS), and evaluated by applying the\nK-fold cross validation method. We show that the advanced algorithms can\nimprove both coverage and accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Jun 2013 04:45:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 18:47:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 20:03:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 22 Jul 2014 16:48:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Tom Z.

Percentiles are based on an ordered set of citation counts in\na reference set, whereby the fraction of papers at or below the citation counts\nof a focal paper is used as an indicator for its relative citation impact in\nthe set. In this study, we pursue two related objectives: (1) although\ndifferent percentile-based approaches have been developed, an approach is\nhitherto missing that satisfies a number of criteria such as scaling of the\npercentile ranks from zero (all other papers perform better) to 100 (all other\npapers perform worse), and solving the problem with tied citation ranks\nunambiguously. We introduce a new citation-rank approach having these\nproperties, namely P100. (2) We compare the reliability of P100 empirically\nwith other percentile-based approaches, such as the approaches developed by the\nSCImago group, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS), and\nThomson Reuters (InCites), using all papers published in 1980 in Thomson\nReuters Web of Science (WoS). How accurately can the different approaches\npredict the long-term citation impact in 2010 (in year 31) using citation\nimpact measured in previous time windows (years 1 to 30)? The comparison of the\napproaches shows that the method used by InCites overestimates citation impact\n(because of using the highest percentile rank when papers are assigned to more\nthan a single subject category) whereas the SCImago indicator shows higher\npower in predicting the long-term citation impact on the basis of citation\nrates in early years.

We go beyond traditional metrics such as paper counts, citations\nand h-index. Specifically, we define metrics such as influence, connections and\nexposure for authors. An author gains influence by receiving more citations,\nbut also citations from influential authors. An author increases his/her\nconnections by co-authoring with other authors, and specially from other\nauthors with high connections. An author receives exposure by publishing in\nselective venues where publications received high citations in the past, and\nthe selectivity of these venues also depends on the influence of the authors\nwho publish there. We discuss the computation aspects of these metrics, and\nsimilarity between different metrics.
