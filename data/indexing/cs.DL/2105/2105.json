While science is\nheavily supported by public funding, common depictions suggest that scientific\nresearch remains an isolated or 'ivory tower' activity, with weak connectivity\nto public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its\npublic use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its\npublic use. This paper introduces a measurement framework to examine public\ngood features of science, allowing us to study public uses of science, the\npublic funding of science, and how use and funding relate. Specifically, we\nintegrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all\nscientific fields to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses\nacross three public domains - government documents, the news media, and\nmarketplace invention. We find that the public uses of science are extremely\ndiverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively across scientific\nfields. Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the\ninterface between science and society. First, despite concerns that the public\ndoes not engage high-quality science, we find universal alignment, in each\nscientific field and public domain, between what the public consumes and what\nis highly impactful within science. Second, despite myriad factors underpinning\nthe public funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields presents\na striking alignment with the field's collective public use. Overall, public\nuses of science present a rich landscape of specialized consumption, yet\ncollectively science and society interface with remarkable, quantifiable\nalignment between scientific use, public use, and funding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 May 2021 03:02:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Yian", ""], ["Dong", "Yuxiao", ""], ["Wang", "Kuansan", ""], ["Wang", "Dashun", ""], ["Jones", "Benjamin F.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.00706", "submitter": "Feng Xia", "authors": "Feng Xia, Jiaying Liu, Jing Ren, Wei Wang, Xiangjie Kong", "title": "Turing Number: How Far Are You to A.

A key question for ranking universities is whether or not\nto allocate the publication output of affiliated hospitals to universities.\nHospital nomenclatures vary worldwide to denote some form of collaboration with\na university: academic hospitals, teaching hospitals, university hospitals, and\nacademic medical centres do not correspond to universally standard definitions.\nThus, rather than seeking a normative definition of academic hospitals, we are\nproposing a workflow that aligns the university-hospital relationship with one\nof three general models: full integration of the hospital and the medical\nfaculty into a single organization; health science centres in which hospitals\nand medical faculty remain separate entities albeit within the same governance\nstructure; and structures in which universities and hospitals are separate\nentities which collaborate with one another. This classification system\nprovides a standard by which we can allocate publications which note\naffiliations with academic hospitals. Our three-step workflow effectively\ntranslates the three above-mentioned models into two types of instrumental\nrelationships for the assignation of publications: \"associate\" and \"component\".\nWhen a hospital and a medical faculty are fully integrated or when a hospital\nis part of a health science centre, the relationship is classified as\ncomponent. When a hospital follows the model of collaboration and support, the\nrelationship is classified as associate. The compilation of data following\nthese standards allows for a more uniform comparison between worldwide\neducational and research systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2021 12:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Elizondo", "Andrea Reyes", ""], ["Calero-Medina", "Clara", ""], ["Visser", "Martijn S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14186", "submitter": "Florentin Smarandache", "authors": "Florentin Smarandache", "title": "Improved, Extended, and Total Impact Factor of a Journal", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this short paper we recall the (Garfield) Impact Factor of a Journal, we\nimprove and extend it, and eventually we present the Total Impact Factor that\nreflects the most accurate impact factor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 00:11:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Smarandache", "Florentin", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14473", "submitter": "Isabelle Augenstein", "authors": "Isabelle Augenstein", "title": "Determining the Credibility of Science Communication", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "In Proceedings of the Second Workshop on Scholarly Document\n  Processing (SDP at NAACL 2021)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most work on scholarly document processing assumes that the information\nprocessed is trustworthy and factually correct.

In\nComputer Science, for instance, almost two out of three papers published on\nScopus are conference papers. Objective/Purpose: The main goal of this paper is\nto investigate a novel research question: is there any correlation between the\nimpact of a scientific conference and the venue where it took place? Approach:\nIn order to measure the impact of conferences we conducted a large scale\nanalysis on the bibliographic data extracted from 3,838 Computer Science\nconference series and over 2.5 million papers spanning more than 30 years of\nresearch. To quantify the \"touristicity\" of a venue we exploited some\nindicators such as the size of the Wikipedia page for the city hosting the\nvenue and other indexes from reports of the World Economic Forum.\nResults/Findings: We found out that the two aspects are related, and the\ncorrelation with conference impact is stronger when considering country-wide\ntouristic indicators, such as the Travel&Tourism Competitiveness Index.\nMore-over the almost linear correlation with the Tourist Service Infrastructure\nindex attests the specific importance of tourist/accommodation facilities in a\ngiven country. Conclusions: This is the first attempt to focus on the\nrelationship of venue characteristics to conference papers. The results open up\nnew possibilities, such as allowing conference organizers and authors to\nestimate in advance the impact of conferences, thus supporting them in their\ndecisions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 09:51:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bedogni", "Luca", ""], ["Cabri", "Giacomo", ""], ["Martoglia", "Riccardo", ""], ["Poggi", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14918", "submitter": "Sandro Reia", "authors": "Sandro M.
