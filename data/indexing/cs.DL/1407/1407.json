The analysis\ncombines two different bibliometric approaches. The first approach to analyze\nthe 'EPS-HLS interface' is based on term map visualizations of HLS research\nfields. We consider 16 clinical fields and five life science fields. On the\nbasis of expert judgment, EPS research in these fields is studied by\nidentifying EPS-related terms in the term maps. In the second approach, a\nlarge-scale citation-based network analysis is applied to publications from all\nfields of science. We work with about 22,000 clusters of publications, each\nrepresenting a topic in the scientific literature. Citation relations are used\nto identify topics at the EPS-HLS interface. The two approaches complement each\nother. The advantages of working with textual data compensate for the\nlimitations of working with citation relations and the other way around. An\nimportant advantage of working with textual data is in the in-depth qualitative\ninsights it provides. Working with citation relations, on the other hand,\nyields many relevant quantitative statistics. We find that EPS research\ncontributes to HLS developments mainly in the following five ways: new\nmaterials and their properties; chemical methods for analysis and molecular\nsynthesis; imaging of parts of the body as well as of biomaterial surfaces;\nmedical engineering mainly related to imaging, radiation therapy, signal\nprocessing technology, and other medical instrumentation; mathematical and\nstatistical methods for data analysis.

To this end, various\nstandards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations,\ndata or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute\nvarious separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific\nresult.\n  Results: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with\nthe use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology\nNetwork (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that\nsupports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and\nsimulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes\na manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file\nadding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing\nthe model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in\nCOMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined\nby an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are\navailable, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.\n  Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and\nsimulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in\none file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in\nbuilding activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive\nwill become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger,\nmore complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital\norganisms, and bioengineering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2014 13:41:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:38:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bergmann", "Frank T.", ""], ["Adams", "Richard", ""], ["Moodie", "Stuart", ""], ["Cooper", "Jonathan", ""], ["Glont", "Mihai", ""], ["Golebiewski", "Martin", ""], ["Hucka", "Michael", ""], ["Laibe", "Camille", ""], ["Miller", "Andrew K.", ""], ["Nickerson", "David P.", ""], ["Olivier", "Brett G.", ""], ["Rodriguez", "Nicolas", ""], ["Sauro", "Herbert M.", ""], ["Scharm", "Martin", ""], ["Soiland-Reyes", "Stian", ""], ["Waltemath", "Dagmar", ""], ["Yvon", "Florent", ""], ["Nov\u00e8re", "Nicolas Le", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5117", "submitter": "Daniel S.
