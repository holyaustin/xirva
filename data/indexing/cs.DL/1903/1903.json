Network theory\noffers the opportunity to use a mathematical formalism to model both the esteem\nassociated with an academic and the relationships between academic colleagues.\nEarly attempts using this line of reasoning have focused on intellectual\ngenealogy as constituted by supervisor student networks. The process of\nexamination is critical in many areas of study but has not played a part in\nexisting models. A network theoretical \"social\" model is proposed as a tool to\nexplore and understand the dynamics of esteem in the academic hierarchy. It is\nobserved that such a model naturally gives rise to the idea that the esteem\nassociated with a node in the graph (the esteem of an individual academic) can\nbe viewed as a dynamic quantity that evolves with time based on both local and\nnon-local changes in the properties in the network. The toy model studied here\nincludes both supervisor-student and examiner-student relationships. This gives\nan insight into some of the key features of academic genealogies and naturally\nleads to a proposed model for \"esteem propagation\" on academic networks. This\npropagation is not solely directed forward in time (from teacher to progeny)\nbut sometimes also flows in the other direction. As collaborators do well, this\nreflects well on those with whom they choose to collaborate and those that\ntaught them. Furthermore, esteem as a quantity continues to be dynamic even\nafter the end of a relationship or career. In other words, esteem can be\nthought of as flowing both forward and backward in time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 09:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zeitlyn", "David", ""], ["Hook", "Daniel W", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.01406", "submitter": "Peter Snyder", "authors": "Panagiotis Papadopoulos and Peter Snyder and Dimitrios Athanasakis and\n  Benjamin Livshits", "title": "Keeping out the Masses: Understanding the Popularity and Implications of\n  Internet Paywalls", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.CR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Funding the production of quality online content is a pressing problem for\ncontent producers. The most common funding method, online advertising, is rife\nwith well-known performance and privacy harms, and an intractable subject-agent\nconflict: many users do not want to see advertisements, depriving the site of\nneeded funding.\n  Because of these negative aspects of advertisement-based funding, paywalls\nare an increasingly popular alternative for websites. This shift to a\n\"pay-for-access\" web is one that has potentially huge implications for the web\nand society. Instead of a system where information (nominally) flows freely,\npaywalls create a web where high quality information is available to fewer and\nfewer people, leaving the rest of the web users with less information, that\nmight be also less accurate and of lower quality. Despite the potential\nsignificance of a move from an \"advertising-but-open\" web to a \"paywalled\" web,\nwe find this issue understudied.\n  This work addresses this gap in our understanding by measuring how widely\npaywalls have been adopted, what kinds of sites use paywalls, and the\ndistribution of policies enforced by paywalls. A partial list of our findings\ninclude that (i) paywall use is accelerating (2x more paywalls every 6 months),\n(ii) paywall adoption differs by country (e.g. 18.75% in US, 12.69% in\nAustralia), (iii) paywalls change how users interact with sites (e.g. higher\nbounce rates, less incoming links), (iv) the median cost of an annual paywall\naccess is $108 per site, and (v) paywalls are in general trivial to circumvent.\n  Finally, we present the design of a novel, automated system for detecting\nwhether a site uses a paywall, through the combination of runtime browser\ninstrumentation and repeated programmatic interactions with the site. We intend\nthis classifier to augment future, longitudinal measurements of paywall use and\nbehavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Feb 2019 22:04:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Feb 2020 16:23:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 19:13:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2020 15:14:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Papadopoulos", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Snyder", "Peter", ""], ["Athanasakis", "Dimitrios", ""], ["Livshits", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.01517", "submitter": "Waleed Iqbal", "authors": "Waleed Iqbal, Junaid Qadir, Gareth Tyson, Adnan Noor Mian, Saeed Ul\n  Hassan, and Jon Crowcroft", "title": "A Bibliometric Analysis of Publications in Computer Networking Research", "comments": "36 Pages, Currently submitted to Springer Scientometrics Journal 2019", "journal-ref": "Scientometrics 2019", "doi": "10.1007/s11192-019-03086-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study uses the article content and metadata of four important computer\nnetworking periodicals-IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials (COMST),\nIEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking (TON), ACM Special Interest Group on Data\nCommunications (SIGCOMM), and IEEE International Conference on Computer\nCommunications (INFOCOM)-obtained using ACM, IEEE Xplore, Scopus and CrossRef,\nfor an 18-year period (2000-2017) to address important bibliometrics questions.\nAll of the venues are prestigious, yet they publish quite different research.\nThe first two of these periodicals (COMST and TON) are highly reputed journals\nof the fields while SIGCOMM and INFOCOM are considered top conferences of the\nfield.

Here, building on the rich literature on innovation, human dynamics\nand learning, we develop a simple one-parameter model that mimics how\nsuccessful future attempts build on those past. Analytically solving this model\nreveals a phase transition that separates dynamics of failure into regions of\nstagnation or progression, predicting that near the critical threshold, agents\nwho share similar characteristics and learning strategies may experience\nfundamentally different outcomes following failures. Below the critical point,\nwe see those who explore disjoint opportunities without a pattern of\nimprovement, and above it, those who exploit incremental refinements to\nsystematically advance toward success. The model makes several empirically\ntestable predictions, demonstrating that those who eventually succeed and those\nwho do not may be initially similar, yet are characterized by fundamentally\ndistinct failure dynamics in terms of the efficiency and quality of each\nsubsequent attempt. We collected large-scale data from three disparate domains,\ntracing repeated attempts by (i) NIH investigators to fund their research, (ii)\ninnovators to successfully exit their startup ventures, and (iii) terrorist\norganizations to post casualties in violent attacks, finding broadly consistent\nempirical support across all three domains. Together, our findings unveil\nidentifiable yet previously unknown early signals that allow us to identify\nfailure dynamics that will lead to ultimate victory or defeat. Given the\nubiquitous nature of failures and the paucity of quantitative approaches to\nunderstand them, these results represent a crucial step toward deeper\nunderstanding of the complex dynamics beneath failures, the essential\nprerequisites for success.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2019 16:54:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Yian", ""], ["Wang", "Yang", ""], ["Evans", "James A.", ""], ["Wang", "Dashun", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.08004", "submitter": "Daniela Giorgi", "authors": "Mario Salinas and Daniela Giorgi and Paolo Cignoni", "title": "ReviewerNet: Visualizing Citation and Authorship Relations for Finding\n  Reviewers", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.GR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose ReviewerNet, an online, interactive visualization system aimed to\nimprove the reviewer selection process in the academic domain.

The probability that a random university's paper reaches a certain top\npercentile in the global distribution of papers is a power of the ep index,\nwhich can be calculated from the citation-based distribution of university's\npapers in global top percentiles.
