There seems to be a consensus in the\nliterature that the concept of interdisciplinarity is multifaceted and\nambiguous. Unsurprisingly, various different measures of interdisciplinarity\nhave been proposed. However, few studies have thoroughly examined the validity\nand relations between these measures. In this study, we present a systematic\nreview of these interdisciplinarity measures and explore their inherent\nrelations. We examine these measures in relation to the Web of Science journal\nsubject categories. Our results corroborate recent claims that the current\nmeasurements of interdisciplinarity in science studies are both confusing and\nunsatisfying. We find surprisingly deviant results when comparing measures that\nsupposedly should capture similar features or dimensions of the concept of\ninterdisciplinarity. We therefore argue that the current measurements of\ninterdisciplinarity should be interpreted with much caution in science and\nevaluation studies, or in relation to science policies. We also question the\nvalidity of current measures and argue that we do not need more of the same,\nbut rather something very different in order to be able to measure the\nmultidimensional and complex construct of interdisciplinarity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2018 08:31:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2019 15:16:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qi", ""], ["Schneider", "Jesper Wiborg", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.01605", "submitter": "J.

However, despite the\nincreasing number of web archives worldwide, the absence of efficient and\nmeaningful exploration methods still remains a major hurdle in the way of\nturning them into a usable and useful information source. In this paper, we\nfocus on this problem and propose an RDF/S model and a distributed framework\nfor building semantic profiles (\"layers\") that describe semantic information\nabout the contents of web archives. A semantic layer allows describing metadata\ninformation about the archived documents, annotating them with useful semantic\ninformation (like entities, concepts and events), and publishing all this data\non the Web as Linked Data. Such structured repositories offer advanced query\nand integration capabilities, and make web archives directly exploitable by\nother systems and tools. To demonstrate their query capabilities, we build and\nquery semantic layers for three different types of web archives. An\nexperimental evaluation showed that a semantic layer can answer information\nneeds that existing keyword-based systems are not able to sufficiently satisfy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:32:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Fafalios", "Pavlos", ""], ["Holzmann", "Helge", ""], ["Kasturia", "Vaibhav", ""], ["Nejdl", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10497", "submitter": "Frank Havemann", "authors": "Frank Havemann, Jochen Gl\\\"aser, and Michael Heinz", "title": "Communities as Well Separated Subgraphs With Cohesive Cores:\n  Identification of Core-Periphery Structures in Link Communities", "comments": "12 pages, 2 figures, submitted version of a paper accepted for the\n  7th International Conference on Complex Networks and Their Applications,\n  December 11-13, 2018, Cambridge, UK; revised version at\n  http://141.20.126.227/~qm/papers/", "journal-ref": "Complex Networks and Their Applications VII, Studies in\n  Computational Intelligence, pp. 219-230.

Here we ask whether the\norganization of language in written text displays the fractal hierarchical\narchitecture common in systems optimized for efficient information\ntransmission. We test the hypothesis that the expositional structure of\nscientific research articles displays Rentian scaling, and that the exponent of\nthe scaling law changes as the article's information transmission capacity\nchanges. Using 32 scientific manuscripts - each containing between three and 26\niterations of revision - we construct semantic networks in which nodes\nrepresented unique words in each manuscript, and edges connect nodes if two\nwords appeared within the same 5-word window. We show that these semantic\nnetworks display clear Rentian scaling, and that the Rent exponent varies over\nthe publication life cycle, from the first draft to the final revision.\nFurthermore, we observe that manuscripts fell into three clusters in terms of\nhow the scaling exponents changed across drafts: exponents rising over time,\nfalling over time, and remaining relatively stable over time. This change in\nexponent reflects the evolution in semantic network structure over the\nmanuscript revision process, highlighting a balance between network complexity,\nwhich increases the exponent, and network efficiency, which decreases the\nexponent. Lastly, the final value of the Rent exponent is negatively correlated\nwith the number of authors. Taken together, our results suggest that semantic\nnetworks reflecting the structure of exposition in scientific research articles\ndisplay striking hierarchical architecture that arbitrates tradeoffs between\ncompeting constraints on network organization, and that this arbitration is\nnavigated differently depending on the social environment characteristic of the\ncollaboration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2018 12:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Chai", "Lucy R.", ""], ["Bassett", "Danielle S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.11017", "submitter": "Pavlos Fafalios", "authors": "Pavlos Fafalios, Vasileios Iosifidis, Kostas Stefanidis, Eirini\n  Ntoutsi", "title": "Tracking the History and Evolution of Entities: Entity-centric Temporal\n  Analysis of Large Social Media Archives", "comments": "This is a preprint of an article accepted for publication in the\n  International Journal on Digital Libraries (2018)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00799-018-0257-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How did the popularity of the Greek Prime Minister evolve in 2015?
