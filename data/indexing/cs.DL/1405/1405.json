From submissions and\nsubscriptions to grants and hirings, researchers, policy makers, and funding\nagencies make important decisions with influence from journal rankings such as\nthe ISI journal impact factor. Typically, the rankings are derived from the\ncitation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this\nselection. However, little is known about how robust rankings are to the\nselection of included journals. Here we compare the robustness of three journal\nrankings based on network flows induced on citation networks. They model\npathways of researchers navigating scholarly literature, stepping between\njournals and remembering their previous steps to different degree: zero-step\nmemory as impact factor, one-step memory as Eigenfactor, and two-step memory,\ncorresponding to zero-, first-, and second-order Markov models of citation flow\nbetween journals. We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better\nand are more robust to the selection of journals. Whereas our analysis\nindicates that higher-order models perform better, the performance gain for the\nsecond-order Markov model comes at the cost of requiring more citation data\nover a longer time period.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 12:09:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 09:08:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bohlin", "Ludvig", ""], ["Esquivel", "Alcides Viamontes", ""], ["Lancichinetti", "Andrea", ""], ["Rosvall", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7857", "submitter": "Peter Mutschke", "authors": "Peter Mutschke, Andrea Scharnhorst, Christophe Gu\\'eret, Philipp Mayr,\n  Preben Hansen, Aida Slavic", "title": "Knowledge Maps and Information Retrieval (KMIR)", "comments": "6 pages, accepted workshop proposal for Digital Libraries 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL cs.HC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Information systems usually show as a particular point of failure the\nvagueness between user search terms and the knowledge orders of the information\nspace in question. Some kind of guided searching therefore becomes more and\nmore important in order to precisely discover information without knowing the\nright search terms. Knowledge maps of digital library collections are promising\nnavigation tools through knowledge spaces but still far away from being\napplicable for searching digital libraries. However, there is no continuous\nknowledge exchange between the \"map makers\" on the one hand and the Information\nRetrieval (IR) specialists on the other hand. Thus, there is also a lack of\nmodels that properly combine insights of the two strands. The proposed workshop\naims at bringing together these two communities: experts in IR reflecting on\nvisual enhanced search interfaces and experts in knowledge mapping reflecting\non visualizations of the content of a collection that might also present a\ncontext for a search term in a visual manner. The intention of the workshop is\nto raise awareness of the potential of interactive knowledge maps for\ninformation seeking purposes and to create a common ground for experiments\naiming at the incorporation of knowledge maps into IR models at the level of\nthe user interface.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 13:30:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mutschke", "Peter", ""], ["Scharnhorst", "Andrea", ""], ["Gu\u00e9ret", "Christophe", ""], ["Mayr", "Philipp", ""], ["Hansen", "Preben", ""], ["Slavic", "Aida", ""]]}]
