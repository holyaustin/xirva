The analysis is based on the NanoBank bibliographic database\nof 287,106 nano articles published between 1981 and 2004. We perform\nmultifaceted analyses of title words, focusing on 100 most frequent terms.\nHierarchical clustering of title terms reveals three distinct time periods of\ncognitive development of nano research: formative (1981-1990), early\n(1991-1998), and current (after 1998). Early period is characterized by the\nintroduction of thin film deposition techniques, while the current period is\ncharacterized by the increased focus on carbon nanotube and nanoparticle\nresearch. We introduce a method to identify disciplinary components of\nnanotechnology. It shows that the nano research is being carried out in a\nnumber of diverse parent disciplines. Currently only 5% of articles are\npublished in dedicated nano-only journals. We find that some 85% of nano\nresearch today is multidisciplinary. Hierarchical clustering of disciplinary\ncomponents reveals that the cognitive content of current nanoscience can be\ndivided into nine clusters. Some clusters account for a large fraction of nano\nresearch and are identified with such parent disciplines as the condensed\nmatter and applied physics, materials science, and analytical chemistry. Other\nclusters represent much smaller parts of nano research, but are as cognitively\ndistinct. In the decreasing order of size, these fields are: polymer science,\nbiotechnology, general chemistry, surface science, and pharmacology. Cognitive\ncontent of research published in nano-only journals is closest to nano research\npublished in condensed matter and applied physics journals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2012 19:52:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Milojevi\u0107", "Sta\u0161a", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0752", "submitter": "Alexander Petersen", "authors": "Alexander M.

Since knowledge spillovers, cumulative advantage,\ncompetition, and collaboration are distinctive features of the academic\nprofession, both the employment relationship and the procedures for assigning\nrecognition and allocating funding should be designed to account for these\nfactors. We study the annual production n_{i}(t) of a given scientist i by\nanalyzing longitudinal career data for 200 leading scientists and 100 assistant\nprofessors from the physics community. We compare our results with 21,156\nsports careers. Our empirical analysis of individual productivity dynamics\nshows that (i) there are increasing returns for the top individuals within the\ncompetitive cohort, and that (ii) the distribution of production growth is a\nleptokurtic \"tent-shaped\" distribution that is remarkably symmetric. Our\nmethodology is general, and we speculate that similar features appear in other\ndisciplines where academic publication is essential and collaboration is a key\nfeature. We introduce a model of proportional growth which reproduces these two\nobservations, and additionally accounts for the significantly right-skewed\ndistributions of career longevity and achievement in science. Using this\ntheoretical model, we show that short-term contracts can amplify the effects of\ncompetition and uncertainty making careers more vulnerable to early\ntermination, not necessarily due to lack of individual talent and persistence,\nbut because of random negative production shocks. We show that fluctuations in\nscientific production are quantitatively related to a scientist's collaboration\nradius and team efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2012 18:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Riccaboni", "Massimo", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

Categorization becomes more useful as the collection of resources\nincreases. Large collections of books, movies, and web pages, for instance, are\ncataloged in libraries, organized in databases and classified in directories,\nrespectively. However, the usual largeness of these collections requires a vast\nendeavor and an outrageous expense to organize manually.\n  Recent research is moving towards developing automated classifiers that\nreduce the increasing costs and effort of the task. Little work has been done\nanalyzing the appropriateness of and exploring how to harness the annotations\nprovided by users on social tagging systems as a data source. Users on these\nsystems save resources as bookmarks in a social environment by attaching\nannotations in the form of tags. It has been shown that these tags facilitate\nretrieval of resources not only for the annotators themselves but also for the\nwhole community. Likewise, these tags provide meaningful metadata that refers\nto the content of the resources.\n  In this thesis, we deal with the utilization of these user-provided tags in\nsearch of the most accurate classification of resources as compared to\nexpert-driven categorizations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nresearch work performing actual classification experiments utilizing social\ntags. By exploring the characteristics and nature of these systems and the\nunderlying folksonomies, this thesis sheds new light on the way of getting the\nmost out of social tags for the sake of automated resource classification\ntasks. Therefore, we believe that the contributions in this work are of utmost\ninterest for future researchers in the field, as well as for the scientific\ncommunity in order to better understand these systems and further utilize the\nknowledge garnered from social tags.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2012 21:11:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zubiaga", "Arkaitz", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6716", "submitter": "Chris Biemesderfer", "authors": "Chris Biemesderfer", "title": "Fully Digital: Policy and Process Implications for the AAS", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-1-4419-8369-5_9", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.IM cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Over the past two decades, every scholarly publisher has migrated at least\nthe mechanical aspects of their journal publishing so that they utilize digital\nmeans. The academy was comfortable with that for a while, but publishers are\nunder increasing pressure to adapt further. At the American Astronomical\nSociety (AAS), we think that means bringing our publishing program to the point\nof being fully digital, by establishing procedures and policies that regard the\ndigital objects of publication primarily. We have always thought about our\nelectronic journals as databases of digital articles, from which we can publish\nand syndicate articles one at a time, and we must now put flesh on those bones\nby developing practices that are consistent with the realities of article at a\ntime publication online. As a learned society that holds the long-term rights\nto the literature, we have actively taken responsibility for the preservation\nof the digital assets that constitute our journals, and in so doing we have not\nforsaken the legacy pre-digital assets. All of us who serve as the long-term\nstewards of scholarship must begin to evolve into fully digital publishers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 18:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Biemesderfer", "Chris", ""]]}]
