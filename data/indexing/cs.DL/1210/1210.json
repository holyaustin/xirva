However, different areas of\nmedical research may have considerably different citation practices, even\nwithin the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent\ncitation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between\nresearch units active in different areas of medical research.\n  Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals\ndifferences in citation practices between medical research areas. The\nmethodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection\nof publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical\nfield and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each\nother in their average citation impact.\n  Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on\njournal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses\non three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large\ndifferences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research\nareas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact\nresearch areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.\n  Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the\nimpact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between\nmedical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate\nbetween-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do\ncorrect for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field\nheterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of\nclinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in\ncomparison with basic and diagnostic research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2012 15:39:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Apr 2013 20:15:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["van Eck", "Nees Jan", ""], ["Waltman", "Ludo", ""], ["van Raan", "Anthony F.

In this study we investigate referencing (citing)\nbehavior in five diverse fields (astronomy, mathematics, robotics, ecology and\neconomics) based on 213,756 core journal articles. At the macro level we find:\n(a) a steady increase in the number of references per article over the period\nstudied (50 years), which in some fields is due to a higher rate of usage,\nwhile in others reflects longer articles and (b) an increase in all fields in\nthe fraction of older, foundational references since the 1980s, with no obvious\nchange in citing patterns associated with the introduction of the Internet. At\nthe meso level we explore current (2006-2010) referencing behavior of different\ncategories of authors (21,562 total) within each field, based on their academic\nage, productivity and collaborative practices. Contrary to some previous\nfindings and expectations we find that senior researchers use references at the\nsame rate as their junior colleagues, with similar rates of re-citation (use of\nsame references in multiple papers). High Modified Price Index (MPI, which\nmeasures the speed of the research front more accurately than the traditional\nPrice Index) of senior authors indicates that their research has the similar\ncutting-edge aspect as that of their younger colleagues. In all fields both the\nproductive researchers and especially those who collaborate more use a\nsignificantly lower fraction of foundational references and have much higher\nMPI and lower re-citation rates, i.e., they are the ones pushing the research\nfront regardless of researcher age.

The strongest mandates generate\ndeposit rates of 70%+ within 2 years of adoption, compared to the un-mandated\ndeposit rate of 20%. The effect is already detectable at the national level,\nwhere the UK, which has the largest proportion of Green OA mandates, has a\nnational OA rate of 35%, compared to the global baseline of 25%. The conclusion\nis that, contrary to the Finch Hypothesis, Green Open Access Mandates do have a\nmajor effect, and the stronger the mandate, the stronger the effect (the Liege\nID/OA mandate, linked to research performance evaluation, being the strongest\nmandate model). RCUK (as well as all universities, research institutions and\nresearch funders worldwide) would be well advised to adopt the strongest Green\nOA mandates and to integrate institutional and funder mandates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 21:22:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2012 21:44:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gargouri", "Yassine", ""], ["Lariviere", "Vincent", ""], ["Gingras", "Yves", ""], ["Brody", "Tim", ""], ["Carr", "Les", ""], ["Harnad", "Stevan", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.8181", "submitter": "Hendrik vom Lehn", "authors": "Jeroen van den Hoven, Dirk Helbing, Dino Pedreschi, Josep\n  Domingo-Ferrer, Fosca Gianotti, Markus Christen", "title": "FuturICT - The Road towards Ethical ICT", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1012.0178", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1140/epjst/e2012-01691-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The pervasive use of information and communication technology (ICT) in modern\nsocieties enables countless opportunities for individuals, institutions,\nbusinesses and scientists, but also raises difficult ethical and social\nproblems. In particular, ICT helped to make societies more complex and thus\nharder to understand, which impedes social and political interventions to avoid\nharm and to increase the common good. To overcome this obstacle, the\nlarge-scale EU flagship proposal FuturICT intends to create a platform for\naccessing global human knowledge as a public good and instruments to increase\nour understanding of the information society by making use of ICT-based\nresearch. In this contribution, we outline the ethical justification for such\nan endeavor. We argue that the ethical issues raised by FuturICT research\nprojects overlap substantially with many of the known ethical problems emerging\nfrom ICT use in general. By referring to the notion of Value Sensitive Design,\nwe show for the example of privacy how this core value of responsible ICT can\nbe protected in pursuing research in the framework of FuturICT. In addition, we\ndiscuss further ethical issues and outline the institutional design of FuturICT\nallowing to address them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 21:44:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hoven", "Jeroen van den", ""], ["Helbing", "Dirk", ""], ["Pedreschi", "Dino", ""], ["Domingo-Ferrer", "Josep", ""], ["Gianotti", "Fosca", ""], ["Christen", "Markus", ""]]}]
