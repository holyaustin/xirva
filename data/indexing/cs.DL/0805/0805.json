The format relies on the NetCDF binary input/output library,\nalready used in many different scientific communities, that provides\nflexibility as well as portability accross languages and platforms.

Using\nnew data we can now disentangle both effects. Based on their submission times\nwe separate articles into a self-promoted sample and a sample of articles that\nachieved a high rank on astro-ph by chance and compare their citation\ndistributions with those of articles on lower astro-ph positions.

The increasing popularity of these\nsystems as well as first insights into their emergent semantics have made them\nrelevant to disciplines like knowledge extraction and ontology learning. The\nproblem of devising methods to measure the semantic relatedness between tags\nand characterizing it semantically is still largely open. Here we analyze three\nmeasures of tag relatedness: tag co-occurrence, cosine similarity of\nco-occurrence distributions, and FolkRank, an adaptation of the PageRank\nalgorithm to folksonomies. Each measure is computed on tags from a large-scale\ndataset crawled from the social bookmarking system del.icio.us. To provide a\nsemantic grounding of our findings, a connection to WordNet (a semantic lexicon\nfor the English language) is established by mapping tags into synonym sets of\nWordNet, and applying there well-known metrics of semantic similarity. Our\nresults clearly expose different characteristics of the selected measures of\nrelatedness, making them applicable to different subtasks of knowledge\nextraction such as synonym detection or discovery of concept hierarchies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2008 14:10:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Benz", "Dominik", ""], ["Hotho", "Andreas", ""], ["Stumme", "Gerd", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2739", "submitter": "Salvatore Mele", "authors": "Rolf-Dieter Heuer, Annette Holtkamp, Salvatore Mele", "title": "Innovation in Scholarly Communication: Vision and Projects from\n  High-Energy Physics", "comments": "Based on a keynote talk of Rolf-Dieter Heuer at APE2008,\n  International Conference on \"Academic Publishing in Europe\", Berlin, January\n  22nd-23rd 2008", "journal-ref": "Inform.Serv.Use 28:83-96,2008", "doi": "10.3233/ISU-2008-0570", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Having always been at the forefront of information management and open\naccess, High-Energy Physics (HEP) proves to be an ideal test-bed for\ninnovations in scholarly communication including new information and\ncommunication technologies.
