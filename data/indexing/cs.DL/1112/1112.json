The issues\nspecifically discussed are the ritual practice of such tests, their dichotomous\napplication in decision making, the difference between statistical and\nsubstantive significance, the implausibility of most null hypotheses, the\ncrucial assumption of randomness, as well as the utility of standard errors and\nconfidence intervals for inferential purposes. We argue that applying\nstatistical significance tests and mechanically adhering to their results is\nhighly problematic and detrimental to critical thinking. We claim that the use\nof such tests do not provide any advantages in relation to citation indicators,\ninterpretations of them, or the decision making processes based upon them. On\nthe contrary their use may be harmful.
