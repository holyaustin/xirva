In this paper, we propose ConfAssist,\na novel assisting framework for conference categorization that aims to address\nthe limitations in the existing systems and portals for venue classification.\nWe start with the hypothesis that top-tier conferences are much more stable\nthan other conferences and the inherent dynamics of these groups differs to a\nvery large extent. We identify various features related to the stability of\nconferences that might help us separate a top-tier conference from the rest of\nthe lot. While there are many clear cases where expert agreement can be almost\nimmediately achieved as to whether a conference is a top-tier or not, there are\nequally many cases that can result in a conflict even among the experts.\nConfAssist tries to serve as an aid in such cases by increasing the confidence\nof the experts in their decision. An analysis of 110 conferences from 22\nsub-fields of computer science clearly favors our hypothesis as the top-tier\nconferences are found to exhibit much less fluctuations in the stability\nrelated features than the non top-tier ones. We evaluate our hypothesis using\nsystems based on conference categorization. For the evaluation, we conducted\nhuman judgment survey with 28 domain experts. The results are impressive with\n85.18% classification accuracy. We also compare the dynamics of the newly\nstarted conferences with the older conferences to identify the initial signals\nof popularity. The system is applicable to any conference with atleast 5 years\nof publication history.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 08:00:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Mayank", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Tanmoy", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Animesh", ""], ["Goyal", "Pawan", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02153", "submitter": "Uwe Springmann", "authors": "U.

Research and scholarship in this area has\naccelerated since the coining and subsequent advocacy for altmetrics -- that\nis, research indicators based on social media activity. This review provides an\nextensive account of the state-of-the art in both scholarly use of social media\nand altmetrics. The review consists of two main parts: the first examines the\nuse of social media in academia, examining the various functions these\nplatforms have in the scholarly communication process and the factors that\naffect this use. The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics,\ndiscussing the various interpretations of altmetrics, data collection and\nmethodological limitations, and differences according to platform. The review\nends with a critical discussion of the implications of this transformation in\nthe scholarly communication system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:45:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sugimoto", "Cassidy R.", ""], ["Work", "Sam", ""], ["Larivi\u00e8re", "Vincent", ""], ["Haustein", "Stefanie", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08180", "submitter": "Philipp Mayr", "authors": "Judit Bar-Ilan, Rob Koopman, Shenghui Wang, Andrea Scharnhorst, Marcus\n  John, Philipp Mayr, Dietmar Wolfram", "title": "Bibliometrics and Information Retrieval: Creating Knowledge through\n  Research Synergies", "comments": "4 pages, accepted at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Association for\n  Information Science and Technology (ASIST 2016) in Copenhagen", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This panel brings together experts in bibliometrics and information retrieval\nto discuss how each of these two important areas of information science can\nhelp to inform the research of the other.

Yet, a fundamental research question remains still open:\nto which extent do quantitative metrics capture the significance of scientific\nworks? We analyze the network of citations among the $449,935$ papers published\nby the American Physical Society (APS) journals between 1893 and 2009, and\nfocus on the comparison of metrics built on the citation count with\nnetwork-based metrics. We contrast five article-level metrics with respect to\nthe rankings that they assign to a set of fundamental papers, called Milestone\nLetters, carefully selected by the APS editors for \"making long-lived\ncontributions to physics, either by announcing significant discoveries, or by\ninitiating new areas of research\". A new metric, which combines PageRank\ncentrality with the explicit requirement that paper score is not biased by\npaper age, is the best-performing metric overall in identifying the Milestone\nLetters. The lack of time bias in the new metric makes it also possible to use\nit to compare papers of different age on the same scale. We find that\nnetwork-based metrics identify the Milestone Letters better than metrics based\non the citation count, which suggests that the structure of the citation\nnetwork contains information that can be used to improve the ranking of\nscientific publications. The methods and results presented here are relevant\nfor all evolving systems where network centrality metrics are applied, for\nexample the World Wide Web and online social networks. An interactive Web\nplatform where it is possible to view the ranking of the APS papers by rescaled\nPageRank is available at the address \\url{http://www.sciencenow.info}.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 12:11:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:40:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 15:57:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mariani", "Manuel Sebastian", ""], ["Medo", "Matus", ""], ["Zhang", "Yi-Cheng", ""]]}]
