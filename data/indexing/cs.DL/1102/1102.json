However, prior methods relied on computing\nthe lexical signature before the page was lost, or using cached or archived\nversions of the page to calculate a lexical signature. We demonstrate a system\nof constructing a lexical signature for a page from its link neighborhood, that\nis the \"backlinks\", or pages that link to the missing page. After testing\nvarious methods, we show that one can construct a lexical signature for a\nmissing web page using only ten backlink pages. Further, we show that only the\nfirst level of backlinks are useful in this effort. The text that the backlinks\nuse to point to the missing page is used as input for the creation of a\nfour-word lexical signature. That lexical signature is shown to successfully\nfind the target URI in over half of the test cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Feb 2011 14:50:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ware", "Jeb", ""], ["Klein", "Martin", ""], ["Nelson", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1064", "submitter": "Sherif Sakr", "authors": "Sherif Sakr and Mohammad Alomari", "title": "A Decade of Database Research Publications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.DB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the database research publications of four major core database\ntechnology conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, ICDE, EDBT), two main theoretical\ndatabase conferences (PODS, ICDT) and three database journals (TODS, VLDB\nJournal, TKDE) over a period of 10 years (2001 - 2010).
