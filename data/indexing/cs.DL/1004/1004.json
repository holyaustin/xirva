These mechanisms aim to\nnormalize citation counts for the field and the year in which a publication was\npublished. One mechanism is applied in the current so-called crown indicator of\nour institute. The other mechanism is applied in the new crown indicator that\nour institute is planning to adopt. We find that at high aggregation levels,\nsuch as at the level of large research institutions or at the level of\ncountries, the differences between the two mechanisms are very small. At lower\naggregation levels, such as at the level of research groups or at the level of\njournals, the differences between the two mechanisms are somewhat larger. We\npay special attention to the way in which recent publications are handled.\nThese publications typically have very low citation counts and should therefore\nbe handled with special care.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Apr 2010 19:49:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Sep 2010 14:57:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Waltman", "Ludo", ""], ["van Eck", "Nees Jan", ""], ["van Leeuwen", "Thed N.", ""], ["Visser", "Martijn S.", ""], ["van Raan", "Anthony F.

Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging\ncitation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are\ncharacteristic for both low and high impact papers.
