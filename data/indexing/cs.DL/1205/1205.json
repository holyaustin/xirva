The emerging field of Digital Rights Management (DRM)\nsystems addresses issues related to the intellectual property rights of digital\ncontent. In this paper, an object-oriented (OO) DRM system, called \"Imaging\nSystem with Watermarking and Attack Resilience\" (ISWAR), is presented that\ngenerates and authenticates color images with embedded mechanisms for\nprotection against infringement of ownership rights as well as security\nattacks. In addition to the methods, in the object-oriented sense, for\nperforming traditional encryption and decryption, the system implements methods\nfor visible and invisible watermarking. This paper presents one visible and one\ninvisible watermarking algorithm that have been integrated in the system. The\nqualitative and quantitative results obtained for these two watermarking\nalgorithms with several benchmark images indicate that high-quality watermarked\nimages are produced by the algorithms. With the help of experimental results it\nis demonstrated that the presented invisible watermarking techniques are\nresilient to the well known benchmark attacks and hence a fail-safe method for\nproviding constant protection to ownership rights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2012 05:25:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mohanty", "Saraju P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4667", "submitter": "David South", "authors": "Z.
