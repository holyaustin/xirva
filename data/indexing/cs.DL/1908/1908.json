In this study, we set\nout to estimate approximate costs and future prospects associated with the\ntransition of Belarus and Ukraine towards open access to scientific information\non the example of publications by researchers from these two countries in\nElsevier journals. To this end, we accessed the Scopus database and selected\nall papers affiliated with Belarus and Ukraine published by Elsevier journals\nin 2018. Subsequently, we established which of these articles indicated a\ncorresponding author from Ukraine or Belarus, as well as collected journal\ntitles, correspondence addresses, access types and the APC fee for each\narticle. In addition, funding sources were established for each open access\narticle. This allowed us to determine the total amount of money that Ukraine\nand Belarus would have needed to pay so that all the articles of their\nresearchers, which were published in Elsevier journals in 2018, were available\nin an open-access form. The obtained results show that Belarus and Ukraine are\ncurrently under-investing in the support of scientific publications and\nsubscription to scientific resources, which is necessary for making a\ntransition to the model of open access to scientific literature.

In this paper, we propose\naugmenting these binary responses with a model for selecting and ranking\nrecommended web pages in a Web archive. This is to enhance both HTTP 404\nresponses and HTTP 200 responses by surfacing web pages in the archive that the\nuser may not know existed. First, we check if the URI is already classified in\nDMOZ or Wikipedia. If the requested URI is not found, we use ML to classify the\nURI using DMOZ as our ontology and collect candidate URIs to recommended to the\nuser. Next, we filter the candidates based on if they are present in the\narchive. Finally, we rank candidates based on several features, such as\narchival quality, web page popularity, temporal similarity, and URI similarity.\nWe calculated the F1 score for different methods of classifying the requested\nweb page at the first level.

Results show that there is a stark increase in the\nconsumption of foreign language material within the Chinese social science\ncommunity, and English material accounts for the vast majority of this\nconsumption. Papers with foreign language references receive significantly more\ncitations than those without, and the citation advantage of these\ninternationalized work holds when we control for characteristics of the citing\npapers. However, the citation advantage has decreased from 1998 to 2008,\nlargely as an artifact of the increased number of papers citing foreign\nlanguage material. After 2008, the decline of the citation advantage subsided\nand became relatively stable, which suggests that incorporating foreign\nlanguage literature continues to increase scientific impact, even as the\nscientific community itself becomes increasingly international. However,\ninternationalization is not without concerns: the work closes with a discussion\nof the benefits and potential problems of the lack of linguistic diversity in\nscientific communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2019 19:22:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gong", "Kaile", ""], ["Xie", "Juan", ""], ["Cheng", "Ying", ""], ["Larivi\u00e8re", "Vincent", ""], ["Sugimoto", "Cassidy R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.07818", "submitter": "Shibamouli Lahiri", "authors": "Shibamouli Lahiri", "title": "Replication of the Keyword Extraction part of the paper \"'Without the\n  Clutter of Unimportant Words': Descriptive Keyphrases for Text Visualization\"", "comments": "36 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  \"Keyword Extraction\" refers to the task of automatically identifying the most\nrelevant and informative phrases in natural language text.

Second, we introduce self-influence and co-influence\nalgorithms to compute two types of collaboration relationship scores based on\nthe number of grants and the types of grants for institutions. We compute the\nself-influence scores to reflect the grant based research collaborations among\ninstitutions and compute multiple co-influence scores to model the various\ntypes of cross-institution collaboration relationships in terms of disciplines\nand subject areas. Third, we compute the overall scientific influence score for\nevery pair of institutions by introducing a weighted sum of the self-influence\nscore and the multiple co-influence scores and conduct an influence-based\nclustering analysis.

Three fields are\nconsidered: statistics, economics and information and library sciences.\nCo-citation networks (CC) represent the intellectual proximity among journals.\nThe academic communities around the journals are represented by considering the\nnetworks of journals generated by authors writing in more than one journal\n(interlocking authorship: IA), and the networks generated by scholars sitting\nin the editorial board of more than one journal (interlocking editorship: IE).\nFor comparing the whole structure of the networks, the dissimilarity matrices\nare considered. The CC, IE and IA networks appear to be correlated for the\nthree fields. The strongest correlations is between CC and IA for the three\nfields. Lower and similar correlations are obtained for CC and IE, and for IE\nand IA. The CC, IE and IA networks are then partitioned in communities.\nInformation and library sciences is the field where communities are more easily\ndetectable, while the most difficult field is economics. The degrees of\nassociation among the detected communities show that they are not independent.\nFor all the fields, the strongest association is between CC and IA networks;\nthe minimum level of association is between IE and CC. Overall, these results\nindicate that the intellectual proximity is also a proximity among authors and\namong editors of the journals.

We\nexamine various statistical properties of the time evolution, with a special\nfocus on the attachment and detachment mechanisms of the links, and find a few\ngeneral features that are characteristic for all MeSH hierarchies.

The diffusion model reveals a significant\nvariation in the rates at which different fields of research share knowledge.\nWe find that these rates have been increasing systematically for several\ndecades, which can be explained by the increase in the publication volumes.\nOverall, our results suggest that analyzing cumulative knowledge creation on a\nglobal scale can be useful in estimating the type and scale of scientific\ninfluence of individual publications and entire research areas as well as\nyielding insights which could not be discovered by using only the direct\ncitation counts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Aug 2019 08:20:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Parolo", "Pietro della Briotta", ""], ["Kujala", "Rainer", ""], ["Kaski", "Kimmo", ""], ["Kivel\u00e4", "Mikko", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.11153", "submitter": "Mariam Farda-Sarbas", "authors": "Mariam Farda-Sarbas and Claudia M\\\"uller-Birn", "title": "Wikidata from a Research Perspective -- A Systematic Mapping Study of\n  Wikidata", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DL cs.CY cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wikidata is one of the most edited knowledge bases which contains structured\ndata.
