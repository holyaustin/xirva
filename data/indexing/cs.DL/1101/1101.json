In\norder to address these concerns, we performed an online user study of 125\nindividuals from a variety of online and offline communities, such as the\nreddit social news user community and the graduate student body in our\ndepartment. From this study we were able to examine a user's needs for a system\nto manage their web-based distributed collections, how their current tools\naffect their ability to maintain their collections, and what the\ncharacteristics of their current practices and problems in maintaining their\nweb-based collections were.
