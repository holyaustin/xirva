Moreover papers are expected to retain this advantage\nin perpetuity -- they should receive more citations indefinitely, no matter how\nmany other papers are published after them. We test this conjecture against\ndata from a selection of fields and in several cases find a first-mover effect\nof a magnitude similar to that predicted by the theory. Were we wearing our\ncynical hat today, we might say that the scientist who wants to become famous\nis better off -- by a wide margin -- writing a modest paper in next year's\nhottest field than an outstanding paper in this year's. On the other hand,\nthere are some papers, albeit only a small fraction, that buck the trend and\nattract significantly more citations than theory predicts despite having\nrelatively late publication dates. We suggest that papers of this kind, though\nthey often receive comparatively few citations overall, are probably worthy of\nour attention.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2008 21:33:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Newman", "M.

I tested this expectation by selecting all (~30,000) refereed\npapers from A&A, AJ, ApJ and MNRAS published between 2000 and 2004. These\nparticular years were chosen so papers analyzed would not be too \"fresh\", but\nat the same time length of each article could be obtained via ADS. I find that\nindeed longer papers published in these four major astronomy journals are on\naverage cited more, with a median number of citations increasing from 6 for\narticles 2-3 pages long to about 50 for articles ~50 pages long. I do however\nobserve a significant \"Letters effect\", i.e. ApJ and A&A articles 4 pages long\nare cited more than articles 5-10 pages long. Also, the very few longest (>80\npages) papers are actually cited less than somewhat shorter papers. For\nindividual journals, median citations per paper increase from 11 for ~9,300 A&A\npapers to 14 for ~5,300 MNRAS papers, 16 for ~2,550 AJ papers, and 20 for\n~12,850 ApJ papers (including ApJ Letters and Supplement).

In this work, we focus on\nsocial communities inside the bibliographic database DBLP and characterize\ncommunities through a simple typifying description model. Generally, we\nunderstand a publication as a transaction between the associated authors. The\nidea therefore is to concern with directed associative relationships among\nthem, to decompose each pattern to its fundamental structure, and to describe\nthe communities by expressive attributes.
