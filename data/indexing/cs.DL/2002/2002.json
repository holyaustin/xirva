The\napproach leverages the arXiv corpus of scientific preprints, in which authors\nchoose subject tags for their papers from a set defined by editors. We compose\na functional definition of AI relevance by learning these subjects from paper\nmetadata, and then inferring the arXiv-subject labels of papers in larger\ncorpora: Clarivate Web of Science, Digital Science Dimensions, and Microsoft\nAcademic Graph. This yields predictive classification $F_1$ scores between .75\nand .86 for Natural Language Processing (cs.CL), Computer Vision (cs.CV), and\nRobotics (cs.RO). For a single model that learns these and four other\nAI-relevant subjects (cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML, and cs.MA), we see precision of\n.83 and recall of .85. We evaluate the out-of-domain performance of our\nclassifiers against other sources of topic information and predictions from\nalternative methods. We find that a supervised solution can generalize to\nidentify publications that belong to the high-level fields of study represented\non arXiv.

The study did not find solid evidence that journal\nimpact factors are good measures of journal internationality in terms of the\ngeographical distribution of publishing or citing authors, as the relationship\nbetween a journal's national orientation and its citation impact is found to be\ninverse U-shaped. In addition, journals publishing in English are not\nnecessarily internationally oriented in terms of the affiliations of publishing\nor citing authors; in social sciences and humanities also USA has their\nnationally oriented literatures. The paper examines the extent to which\nnationally oriented journals entering Scopus in earlier years, have become in\nrecent years more international.

However, the present\ncommon practice of depression diagnosis is based on interviews and clinical\nscales carried out by doctors, which is not only labor-consuming but also\ntime-consuming. One important reason is due to the lack of physiological\nindicators for mental disorders. With the rising of tools such as data mining\nand artificial intelligence, using physiological data to explore new possible\nphysiological indicators of mental disorder and creating new applications for\nmental disorder diagnosis has become a new research hot topic. However, good\nquality physiological data for mental disorder patients are hard to acquire. We\npresent a multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. The dataset\nincludes EEG and audio data from clinically depressed patients and matching\nnormal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by\nprofessional psychiatrists in hospitals. The EEG dataset includes not only data\ncollected using traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap, but also a\nnovel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications. The\n128-electrodes EEG signals of 53 subjects were recorded as both in resting\nstate and under stimulation; the 3-electrode EEG signals of 55 subjects were\nrecorded in resting state; the audio data of 52 subjects were recorded during\ninterviewing, reading, and picture description.

Existing AND methods can be divided into two categories: the models\nfocusing on content information to distinguish whether two papers are written\nby the same author, the models focusing on relation information to represent\ninformation as edges on the network and to quantify the similarity among\npapers. However, the former requires adequate labeled samples and informative\nnegative samples, and are also ineffective in measuring the high-order\nconnections among papers, while the latter needs complicated feature\nengineering or supervision to construct the network. We propose a novel\ngenerative adversarial framework to grow the two categories of models together:\n(i) the discriminative module distinguishes whether two papers are from the\nsame author, and (ii) the generative module selects possibly homogeneous papers\ndirectly from the heterogeneous information network, which eliminates the\ncomplicated feature engineering. In such a way, the discriminative module\nguides the generative module to select homogeneous papers, and the generative\nmodule generates high-quality negative samples to train the discriminative\nmodule to make it aware of high-order connections among papers. Furthermore, a\nself-training strategy for the discriminative module and a random walk based\ngenerating algorithm are designed to make the training stable and efficient.\nExtensive experiments on two real-world AND benchmarks demonstrate that our\nmodel provides significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Feb 2020 01:00:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Haiwen", ""], ["Wang", "Ruijie", ""], ["Wen", "Chuan", ""], ["Li", "Shuhao", ""], ["Jia", "Yuting", ""], ["Zhang", "Weinan", ""], ["Wang", "Xinbing", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.10138", "submitter": "Michael Golosovsky", "authors": "Michael Golosovsky", "title": "Universality of citation distributions and its explanation", "comments": "23 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.DL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Universality or near-universality of citation distributions was found\nempirically a decade ago but its theoretical justification has been lacking so\nfar.
