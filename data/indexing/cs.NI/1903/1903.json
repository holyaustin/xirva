Internet-connected vehicles are like\ndigital data because they can be targeted for malicious hacking. Unlike digital\ndata, however, Internet-connected vehicles are cyber-physical systems that\nphysically interact with each other and their environment. As such, the\nextension of cybersecurity concerns into the cyber-physical domain introduces\nnew possibilities for self-organized phenomena in traffic flow. Here, we study\na scenario envisioned by cybersecurity experts leading to a large number of\nInternet-connected vehicles being suddenly and simultaneously disabled.

To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement\nLearning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically\nlearn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs\namong the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem\nsince the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of\nthe others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the\nnetwork.

However, the human involvement in MCS results in a high\npossibility for unintentionally contributing corrupted and falsified data or\nintentionally spreading disinformation for malevolent purposes, consequently\nundermining IoT services. Therefore, recruiting trustworthy contributors plays\na crucial role in collecting high-quality data and providing better quality of\nservices while minimizing the vulnerabilities and risks to MCS systems. In this\narticle, a novel trust model called Experience-Reputation (E-R) is proposed for\nevaluating trust relationships between any two mobile device users in a MCS\nplatform. To enable the E-R model, virtual interactions among the users are\nmanipulated by considering an assessment of the quality of contributed data\nfrom such users. Based on these interactions, two indicators of trust called\nExperience and Reputation are calculated accordingly. By incorporating the\nExperience and Reputation trust indicators (TIs), trust relationships between\nthe users are established, evaluated and maintained. Based on these trust\nrelationships, a novel trust-based recruitment scheme is carried out for\nselecting the most trustworthy MCS users to contribute to data sensing tasks.\nIn order to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed\ntrust-based mechanism as well as the E-R trust model, we deploy several\nrecruitment schemes in a MCS testbed which consists of both normal and\nmalicious users.

Running\nDNNs on resource-constrained mobile devices often requires the help from edge\nservers via computation offloading. However, offloading through a\nbandwidth-limited wireless link is non-trivial due to the tight interplay\nbetween the computation resources on mobile devices and wireless resources.\nExisting studies have focused on cooperative inference where DNN models are\npartitioned at different neural network layers, and the two parts are executed\nat the mobile device and the edge server, respectively.

In this paper, we propose an efficient and\nflexible 2-step pruning framework for DNN partition between mobile devices and\nedge servers. In our framework, the DNN model only needs to be pruned once in\nthe training phase where unimportant convolutional filters are removed\niteratively. By limiting the pruning region, our framework can greatly reduce\neither the wireless transmission workload of the device or the total\ncomputation workload. A series of pruned models are generated in the training\nphase, from which the framework can automatically select to satisfy varying\nlatency and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, coding for the intermediate\ndata is added to provide extra transmission workload reduction.

The application plane executes network applications;\ncontrol plane regulates the rules for the entire network based on the requests\ngenerated by network applications; and based on the set rules, the controller\nconfigures the switches in the data plane. The role of the switch in the data\nplane is to simply forward packets based on the instructions given by the\ncontroller. By analyzing SDN-related research papers, it is observed that\nresearch, from the very beginning, is insufficiently focused on the data plane.\nTherefore, this paper gives a comprehensive overview of the data plane survey\nwith particular emphasis on the problem of programmability and flexibility.

RFLearn provides (i) a\ncomplete hardware/software architecture where the CPU, radio transceiver and\nlearning/actuation circuits are tightly connected for maximum performance; and\n(ii) a learning circuit design framework where the latency vs. hardware\nresource consumption trade-off can explored. We implement and evaluate the\nperformance of RFLearn on custom software-defined radio built on a\nsystem-on-chip (SoC) ZYNQ-7000 device mounting AD9361 radio transceivers and\nVERT2450 antennas. We showcase the capabilities of RFLearn by applying it to\nsolving the fundamental problems of modulation and OFDM parameter recognition.\nExperimental results reveal that RFLearn decreases latency and power by about\n17x and 15x with respect to a software-based solution, with a comparatively low\nhardware resource consumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2019 12:37:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Restuccia", "Francesco", ""], ["Melodia", "Tommaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.05728", "submitter": "Yuval Nezri", "authors": "Reuven Cohen, Yuval Nezri", "title": "Cardinality Estimation in a Virtualized Network Device Using Online\n  Machine Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cardinality estimation algorithms receive a stream of elements, with possible\nrepetitions, and return the number of distinct elements in the stream.

Because many vehicles should share their\nperceptual data to others within a short time frame in order to enlarge the\nareas that can be perceived based on shared perceptual data, an efficient\nscheduling for concurrent transmission that improves spatial reuse is required\nfor perceptual data sharing.

Device-to-Device (D2D) caching networks tackle this problem\nby exploiting user's behavior predictability and the possibility of sharing\ndata between them to alleviate the network congestion. However, capturing\nmobility statistics allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance their caching\nstrategies. In this work, we introduce a mobility-aware D2D caching network\nwhere SP harnesses user demand and mobility statistics to minimize the incurred\nservice cost through an optimal caching policy. We investigate two caching\nschemes: centralized and decentralized caching schemes. In the centralized\ncaching scheme, SP makes the caching decision towards its cost minimization to\nincrease its profit. However, the complexity of optimal caching policy grows\nexponentially with the number of users. Therefore, we discuss a greedy caching\nalgorithm which has a polynomial order complexity. We also use this greedy\nalgorithm to establish upper and lower bounds on the proactive service gain\nachieved by the optimal caching policy. In the decentralized caching scheme,\nusers take over and make their caching decisions, in a distributed fashion\naffected by the SP pricing policy, towards their payment minimization. We\nformulated the tension between the SP and users as a Stackelberg game. The Best\nresponse analysis was used to identify a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium\n(SPNE) between users.

The latest trend in\nradio access networks (RANs) is to pool the baseband units (BBUs) of multiple\nradio base stations and to install them in a centralized infrastructure, such\nas a cloud, for statistical multiplexing gains. The technology is known as\nCloud Radio Access Network (CRAN). Since cloud computing is gaining significant\ntraction and virtualized data centers are becoming popular as a cost-effective\ninfrastructure in the telecommunication industry, CRAN is being heralded as a\ncandidate technology to meet the expectations of radio access networks for 5G.\nIn CRANs, low energy base stations (BSs) are deployed over a small geographical\nlocation and are connected to a cloud via finite capacity backhaul links.\nBaseband processing unit (BBU) functions are implemented on the virtual\nmachines (VMs) in the cloud over commodity hardware. Such functions, built-in\nsoftware, are termed as virtual functions (VFs). The optimized placement of VFs\nis necessary to reduce the total delays and minimize the overall costs to\noperate CRANs. Our study considers the problem of optimal VF placement over\ndistributed virtual resources spread across multiple clouds, creating a\ncentralized BBU cloud. We propose a combinatorial optimization model and the\nuse of two heuristic approaches, which are, branch-and-bound (BnB) and\nsimulated annealing (SA) for the proposed optimal placement. In addition, we\npropose enhancements to the standard BnB heuristic and compare the results with\nstandard BnB and SA approaches. The proposed enhancements improve the quality\nof the solution in terms of latency and cost as well as reduce the execution\ncomplexity significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Feb 2019 23:43:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bhamare", "Deval", ""], ["Erbad", "Aiman", ""], ["Jain", "Raj", ""], ["Zolanvari", "Maede", ""], ["Samaka", "Mohammed", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.11996", "submitter": "Nasir Saeed", "authors": "Nasir Saeed, Mohamed-Slim Alouini, and Tareq Y.
