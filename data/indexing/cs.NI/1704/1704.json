Among technologies to provide the efficiency is full-duplex\nwireless communication. Full-duplex wireless enhances capacity by\nsimultaneously transmitting uplink and downlink data with limited frequency\nresources. Previous studies on full-duplex wireless mostly focuses on doubling\nthe network capacity, whereas in this paper we discuss that full-duplex\nwireless can also provide higher energy efficiency. We propose low power\ncommunication by wireless full-duplexing (LPFD), focusing on the fact that the\nfull-duplex communication duration becomes half of the halfduplex communication\nduration. In the LPFD, by using the sleep state in which the transceiver\nprovided in the wireless communication terminal is turned off, power\nconsumption of the wireless communication terminal is reduced and energy\nefficiency in wireless full duplex is improved. Simulation results show that\nthe energy efficiency achieved by LPFD is up to approximately 17.3 times higher\nthan the energy efficiency achieved by existing full-duplex medium access\nprotocol. Further, it is up to approximately 27.5 times higher than the energy\nefficiency using power saving mode of half-duplex communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 21:05:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kobayashi", "Makoto", ""], ["Murakami", "Ryo", ""], ["Saruwatari", "Shunsuke", ""], ["Watanabe", "Takashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.00323", "submitter": "Jose Moura", "authors": "Jose Moura and David Hutchison", "title": "Game Theory for Multi-Access Edge Computing: Survey, Use Cases, and\n  Future Trends", "comments": "Published in IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, 39 pages, 8\n  Tables, 11 figures, 278 references", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. 21, no. 1, pp.\n  260-288, Firstquarter 2019", "doi": "10.1109/COMST.2018.2863030", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Game Theory (GT) has been used with significant success to formulate, and\neither design or optimize, the operation of many representative communications\nand networking scenarios.

In this regard, the problem is\naddressed using a novel framework based on matching theory that is composed to\ntwo, highly inter-related stages: a multi-hop network formation stage and a\nresource management stage. One unique feature of this framework is that it\njointly accounts for both wireless channel characteristics and economic factors\nduring both network formation and resource management. The multi-hop network\nformation stage is formulated as a one-to-many matching game which is solved\nusing a novel algorithm, that builds on the so-called deferred acceptance\nalgorithm and is shown to yield a stable and Pareto optimal multi-hop mmW\nbackhaul network.

In\nthis paper, we study the spatio-temporal patterns of the hot spot score and\nuncover its regularities. Based on our observations, we then explore the\npossibility to use recent measurements' history to predict future hot spots. To\nthis end, we consider tree-based machine learning models, and study their\nperformance as a function of time, amount of past data, and prediction horizon.\nOur results indicate that, compared to the best baseline, tree-based models can\ndeliver up to 14% better forecasts for regular hot spots and 153% better\nforecasts for non-regular hot spots. The latter brings strong evidence that,\nfor moderate horizons, forecasts can be made even for sectors exhibiting\nisolated, non-regular behavior. Overall, our work provides insight into the\ndynamics of cellular sectors and their predictability. It also paves the way\nfor more proactive network operations with greater forecasting horizons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 09:34:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Serr\u00e0", "Joan", ""], ["Leontiadis", "Ilias", ""], ["Karatzoglou", "Alexandros", ""], ["Papagiannaki", "Konstantina", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.05250", "submitter": "Yanyan Wu", "authors": "Yanyan Wu", "title": "A Tractable Approach to Dynamic Network Dimensioning Based on the\n  Best-cell Configuration", "comments": "7 pages; 10 figures; submitted to Globecom2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spatial distributions of other cell interference (OCIF) and interference to\nown-cell power ratio (IOPR) with reference to the distance between a mobile and\nits serving base station (BS) are modeled for the down-link reception of\ncellular systems based on the best-cell configuration instead of the\nnearest-cell configuration.

However, providing such an illusion is challenging in\npractice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed\nto provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth\nreservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and\nunpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor.\n  The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its\noverhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In\nparticular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks\n(vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a\nvSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically\ncentralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we\ndeveloped a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes,\nenabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we\nidentify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and\noverhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as\nthe tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 14:37:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Basta", "Arsany", ""], ["Blenk", "Andreas", ""], ["Kellerer", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Schmid", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08977", "submitter": "Yasir Saleem", "authors": "Yasir Saleem, Noel Crespi, Mubashir Husain Rehmani, Rebecca Copeland", "title": "Internet of Things-aided Smart Grid: Technologies, Architectures,\n  Applications, Prototypes, and Future Research Directions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Access, 2019", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Traditional power grids are being transformed into Smart Grids (SGs) to\naddress the issues in existing power system due to uni-directional information\nflow, energy wastage, growing energy demand, reliability and security. SGs\noffer bi-directional energy flow between service providers and consumers,\ninvolving power generation, transmission, distribution and utilization systems.\nSGs employ various devices for the monitoring, analysis and control of the\ngrid, deployed at power plants, distribution centers and in consumers' premises\nin a very large number. Hence, an SG requires connectivity, automation and the\ntracking of such devices. This is achieved with the help of Internet of Things\n(IoT). IoT helps SG systems to support various network functions throughout the\ngeneration, transmission, distribution and consumption of energy by\nincorporating IoT devices (such as sensors, actuators and smart meters), as\nwell as by providing the connectivity, automation and tracking for such\ndevices. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on IoT-aided SG\nsystems, which includes the existing architectures, applications and prototypes\nof IoT-aided SG systems. This survey also highlights the open issues,\nchallenges and future research directions for IoT-aided SG systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 15:26:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2019 17:39:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Saleem", "Yasir", ""], ["Crespi", "Noel", ""], ["Rehmani", "Mubashir Husain", ""], ["Copeland", "Rebecca", ""]]}]
