With PNC,the destructive effect of interference in wireless networks is\neliminated and the capacity of networks can be boosted significantly. This\npaper addresses a key outstanding issue in PNC: synchronization among\ntransmitting nodes. We first investigate the impact of imperfect\nsynchronization (i.e., finite synchronization errors) in a 3-node network. It\nis shown that with QPSK modulation, PNC still yields significantly higher\ncapacity than straightforward network coding when there are synchronization\nerrors. Significantly, this remains to be so even in the extreme case when\nsynchronization is not performed at all. Moving beyond a 3-node network, we\npropose and investigate a synchronization scheme for PNC in a general chain\nnetwork. At last, numerical simulation verifies that PNC is robust to\nsynchronization errors. In particular, for the mutual information performance,\nthere is about 0.5dB loss without time synchronization and there is at most 2dB\nloss without phase synchronization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 02:23:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shengli", ""], ["Liew", "Soung-Chang", ""], ["Wang", "Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0831", "submitter": "Sana Ullah", "authors": "Sana Ullah, Pervez Khan, Niamat Ullah, Shahnaz Saleem, Henry Higgins,\n  Kyung Sup Kwak", "title": "A Review of Wireless Body Area Networks for Medical Applications", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures, and 3 tables.

Then, we\nput forth the concept of spectral outage probability (SOP), a new\ncharacterization of the aggregate radio-frequency emission generated by\ncommunicating nodes in a wireless network. We present some applications of the\nSOP, namely the establishment of spectral regulations and the design of covert\nmilitary networks. The proposed framework captures all the essential physical\nparameters that affect the aggregate network emission, yet is simple enough to\nprovide insights that may be of value in the design and deployment of wireless\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2010 00:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pinto", "Pedro C.", ""], ["Win", "Moe Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.4753", "submitter": "Shyam M", "authors": "Shyam M, Anurag Kumar", "title": "Obstacle Constrained Total Area Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with the accomplishment of total area coverage of an\narbitrary region using sensors with a finite sensing radius of rs. For a given\nregion, we aim to obtain a deterministic placement of sensors which, apart from\nensuring that the entire region comes under the purview of at least a single\nsensor, minimises the number of sensors utilised. We begin by considering\nregions devoid of obstacles and thus having every location amenable for\nplacement. Herein, we formalise the popular notion that sensors at the centres\nof the hexagons of a hexagonal tessellation provide the most optimal placement.\nWe then move on to regions which may comprise obstacles of arbitrary size at\narbitrary locations. We recognise two distinct classes of obstacles, namely\ntransparent and opaque obstacles, which are distinguished by their ability (or\nthe lack of it) to permit sensing radiation through them. In the real world,\ntransparent obstacles model lakes, ponds and swamps, while the opaque ones\nstand for, inter alia, hills, trees and walls.We propose a polynomial-time\nalgorithm for achieving optimal placement in the aforesaid scenarios and we\nprove its convergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2010 18:05:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["M", "Shyam", ""], ["Kumar", "Anurag", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5178", "submitter": "Maximilien Gadouleau", "authors": "Maximilien Gadouleau and Alban Goupil", "title": "A Matroid Framework for Noncoherent Random Network Communications", "comments": "31 pages, 3 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information\n  Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.CO math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Models for noncoherent error control in random linear network coding (RLNC)\nand store and forward (SAF) have been recently proposed. In this paper, we\nmodel different types of random network communications as the transmission of\nflats of matroids. This novel framework encompasses RLNC and SAF and allows us\nto introduce a novel protocol, referred to as random affine network coding\n(RANC), based on affine combinations of packets. Although the models previously\nproposed for RLNC and SAF only consider error control, using our framework, we\nfirst evaluate and compare the performance of different network protocols in\nthe error-free case. We define and determine the rate, average delay, and\nthroughput of such protocols, and we also investigate the possibilities of\npartial decoding before the entire message is received. We thus show that RANC\noutperforms RLNC in terms of data rate and throughput thanks to a more\nefficient encoding of messages into packets. Second, we model the possible\nalterations of a message by the network as an operator channel, which\ngeneralizes the channels proposed for RLNC and SAF. Error control is thus\nreduced to a coding-theoretic problem on flats of a matroid, where two distinct\nmetrics can be used for error correction. We study the maximum cardinality of\ncodes on flats in general, and codes for error correction in RANC in\nparticular. We finally design a class of nearly optimal codes for RANC based on\nrank metric codes for which we propose a low-complexity decoding algorithm. The\ngain of RANC over RLNC is thus preserved with no additional cost in terms of\ncomplexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 14:13:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2010 14:34:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:17:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gadouleau", "Maximilien", ""], ["Goupil", "Alban", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5194", "submitter": "Isabelle Guerin Lassous", "authors": "Emmanouil Dramitinos (NES), Isabelle Guerin Lassous (INRIA\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parall\\'elisme)", "title": "Auction-based Bandwidth Allocation Mechanisms for Wireless Future\n  Internet", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An important aspect of the Future Internet is the efficient utilization of\n(wireless) network resources. In order for the - demanding in terms of QoS -\nFuture Internet services to be provided, the current trend is evolving towards\nan \"integrated\" wireless network access model that enables users to enjoy\nmobility, seamless access and high quality of service in an all-IP network on\nan \"Anytime, Anywhere\" basis. The term \"integrated\" is used to denote that the\nFuture Internet wireless \"last mile\" is expected to comprise multiple\nheterogeneous geographically coexisting wireless networks, each having\ndifferent capacity and coverage radius. The efficient management of the\nwireless access network resources is crucial due to their scarcity that renders\nwireless access a potential bottleneck for the provision of high quality\nservices. In this paper we propose an auction mechanism for allocating the\nbandwidth of such a network so that efficiency is attained, i.e. social welfare\nis maximized. In particular, we propose an incentive-compatible, efficient\nauction-based mechanism of low computational complexity. We define a repeated\ngame to address user utilities and incentives issues. Subsequently, we extend\nthis mechanism so that it can also accommodate multicast sessions. We also\nanalyze the computational complexity and message overhead of the proposed\nmechanism. We then show how user bids can be replaced from weights generated by\nthe network and transform the auction to a cooperative mechanism capable of\nprioritizing certain classes of services and emulating DiffServ and time-of-day\npricing schemes.
