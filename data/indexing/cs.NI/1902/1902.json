In particular, throughput\nenhancement and latency reduction concepts like multi-connectivity, carrier\naggregation, downlink-uplink decoupled access and coordinated multi-point\nconnectivity are discussed. Moreover, novel design solutions exploiting these\nconcepts are proposed. Numerical evaluation of the introduced solutions\nindicates significant performance gains over state-of-the-art schemes; for\nexample, our proposed component carrier selection mechanism leads to a median\nthroughput gain of up to 100% by means of an implicit load balance. Therefore,\nthe proposed Multi-Channel Access solutions have the potential to be key\nmulti-service enablers for 5G New Radio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2019 12:54:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2019 10:26:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mahmood", "Nurul Huda", ""], ["Laselva", "Daniela", ""], ["Palacios", "David", ""], ["Emara", "Mustafa", ""], ["Filippou", "Miltiades C.", ""], ["Kim", "Dong Min", ""], ["de-la-Bandera", "Isabel", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01949", "submitter": "Aleksei Ponomarenko-Timofeev Mr.", "authors": "Vasilii Semkin, Aleksei Ponomarenko-Timofeev, Aki Karttunen, Olga\n  Galinina, Sergey Andreev, and Yevgeni Koucheryavy", "title": "Path Loss Characterization for Intra-Vehicle Wearable Deployments at 60\n  GHz", "comments": "4 pages, 8 figures, 1 table, accepted to EuCAP 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we present the results of a wideband measurement campaign at 60\nGHz conducted inside a Linkker electric city bus.

This will severely challenge the existing MM solutions and\nultimately render them ineffective as they will not be able to provide the\nrequired reliability, flexibility, and scalability. Consequently, to serve the\n5G and beyond 5G networks, a new perspective to MM is required. Hence, in this\narticle we present a novel discussion of the functional requirements from MM\nstrategies for these networks. We present a novel qualitative assessment of the\nstate-of-the-art mechanisms based on their ability to satisfy the reliability,\nflexibility and scalability criteria for future MM strategies. We then present\na study detailing the research challenges that exist in the design and\nimplementation of MM strategies for 5G and beyond networks. Further, we chart\nout the potential MM solutions and the associated capabilities they offer to\ntackle the persistent challenges. We conclude this paper with a vision for the\n5G and beyond MM mechanisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2019 15:22:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2019 12:27:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 15:00:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Akshay", ""], ["Lopez-Aguilera", "Elena", ""], ["Demirkol", "Ilker", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02850", "submitter": "Jernej Hribar Mr.", "authors": "Jernej Hribar, Andrei Marinescu, George A.

In this work, we identify that the manufacturing tolerances\nin the antenna arrays used in mmWave devices contribute to a beam pattern that\nis unique to each device, and to that end we propose a novel device\nfingerprinting scheme based on the unique beam patterns used by the mmWave\ndevices.

Because coexistence cannot avoid\ncoordination By mimicking the symbiotic relationships between heterogeneous\norganisms in a stable ecosystem, SHARE establishes an indirect coordination\nmechanism between heterogeneous CR networks via a mediator system, which avoids\nthe drawbacks of direct coordination. SHARE includes two spectrum sharing\nalgorithms whose designs were inspired by well-known models and theories from\ntheoretical ecology, viz, the interspecific competition model and the ideal\nfree distribution model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2019 03:49:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bian", "Kaigui", ""], ["Chen", "Lin", ""], ["Zhang", "Yuanxing", ""], ["Park", "Jung-Min Jerr", ""], ["Du", "Xiaojiang", ""], ["Li", "Xiaoming", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06121", "submitter": "Michele Polese", "authors": "Alvise De Biasio, Federico Chiariotti, Michele Polese, Andrea Zanella,\n  Michele Zorzi", "title": "A QUIC Implementation for ns-3", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures.

Most rendezvous algorithms in the\nliterature focused on constructing channel hopping (CH) sequences that\nguarantee finite maximum time-to-rendezvous (MTTR). However, these algorithms\nperform rather poorly in terms of the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) even\nwhen compared to the simple random algorithm. In this paper, we propose the\nquasi-random (QR) CH algorithm that has a comparable ETTR to the random\nalgorithm and a comparable MTTR to the best bound in the literature. Our QR\nalgorithm does not require the unique identifier (ID) assumption and it is very\nsimple to implement in the symmetric, asynchronous, and heterogeneous setting\nwith multiple radios. In a CRN with $N$ commonly labelled channels, the MTTR of\nthe QR algorithm is bounded above by $9 M \\lceil n_1/m_1 \\rceil \\cdot \\lceil\nn_2/m_2 \\rceil$ time slots, where $n_1$ (resp. $n_2$) is the number of\navailable channels to user $1$ (resp. 2), $m_1$ (resp. $m_2$) is the number of\nradios for user $1$ (resp. 2), and $M=\\lceil \\lceil \\log_2 N \\rceil /4 \\rceil\n*5+6$.

This\nresource pre-allocation is envisioned not only to improve network efficiency,\nbut also to increase user satisfaction. In this context, the present paper\ndesigns optimal caching schemes for \\textit{distributed caching} scenarios. In\nparticular, we look at networks where a central node (base station)\ncommunicates with a number of \"regular\" nodes (users or pico base stations)\nequipped with \\textit{local storage} infrastructure. Given the spatio-temporal\ndynamics of content popularities, and the decentralized nature of our setup,\nthe problem boils down to select what, when and \\textit{where} to cache. To\naddress this problem, we define fetching and caching prices that vary across\ncontents, time and space, and formulate a global optimization problem which\naggregates the costs across those three domains. The resultant optimization is\nsolved using decomposition and dynamic programming techniques, and a\nreduced-complexity algorithm is finally proposed. Preliminary simulations\nillustrating the behavior of our algorithm are finally presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2019 16:24:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sadeghi", "Alireza", ""], ["Marques", "Antonio G.", ""], ["Giannakis", "Georgios B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.07187", "submitter": "Anastasios Giovanidis", "authors": "Anastasios Giovanidis, Bruno Baynat, Antoine Vendeville", "title": "Performance Analysis of Online Social Platforms", "comments": "Preliminary version of accepted paper at INFOCOM 2019 (Paris, France)", "journal-ref": "INFOCOM 2019, Paris, France", "doi": "10.1109/INFOCOM.2019.8737539", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce an original mathematical model to analyze the diffusion of posts\nwithin a generic online social platform.

The server can dynamically choose which\npackets to download to clients, from among several packets which encode their\nvideos at different resolutions, as well as the power levels of their\ntransmissions. This allows it to control packet delivery probabilities, and\nthereby, for example, avert imminent video outages at clients. It must however\nrespect the access point's constraints on bandwidth and average transmission\npower. The goal is to maximize video \"Quality of Experience\" (QoE), which\ndepends on several factors such as (i) outage duration when the video playback\nbuffer is empty, (ii) number of outage periods, (iii) how many frames\ndownloaded are of lower resolution, (iv) temporal variations in resolution,\netc.\n  It is shown that there exists an optimal decentralized solution where the AP\nannounces the price of energy, and each client distributedly and dynamically\nmaximizes its own QoE subject to the cost of energy. A distributed iterative\nalgorithm to solve for optimal decentralized policy is also presented. Further,\nfor the client-level QoE optimization, the optimal choice of video-resolution\nand power-level of packet transmissions has a simple monotonicity and threshold\nstructure vis-a-vis video playback buffer level. When the number of orthogonal\nchannels is less than the number of clients, there is an index policy for\nprioritizing packet transmissions.

One of the main contributors to latency in cellular\nnetworks is the reservation-based access, which involves lengthy and\nresource-inefficient signaling exchanges. An alternative is to use grant-free\naccess, in which there is no resource reservation. A handful of recent works\ninvestigated how to fulfill reliability and latency requirements with different\nflavors of grant-free solutions. However, the resource efficiency, i.e., the\nthroughput, has been only the secondary focus. In this work, we formulate the\nthroughput of grant-free access under reliability-latency constraints, when the\nactual number of arrived users or only the arrival distribution are known. We\ninvestigate how these different levels of knowledge about the arrival process\ninfluence throughput performance of framed slotted ALOHA with $K$-multipacket\nreception, for the Poisson and Beta arrivals. We show that the throughput under\nreliability-latency requirements can be significantly improved for the higher\nexpected load of the access network, if the actual number of arrived users is\nknown. This insight motivates the use of techniques for the estimation of the\nnumber of arrived users, as this knowledge is not readily available in\ngrant-free access.

This\nproblem exposes a hard tradeoff between the computation and state complexity,\nwhich makes it particularly challenging. To navigate this tradeoff, existing\nsolutions rely on complex hand-tuned heuristics, which are brittle and hard to\noptimize. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach\nto solve the packet classification problem. There are several characteristics\nthat make this problem a good fit for Deep RL. First, many of the existing\nsolutions are iteratively building a decision tree by splitting nodes in the\ntree. Second, the effects of these actions (e.g., splitting nodes) can only be\nevaluated once we are done with building the tree. These two characteristics\nare naturally captured by the ability of RL to take actions that have sparse\nand delayed rewards. Third, it is computationally efficient to generate data\ntraces and evaluate decision trees, which alleviate the notoriously high sample\ncomplexity problem of Deep RL algorithms. Our solution, NeuroCuts, uses\nsuccinct representations to encode state and action space, and efficiently\nexplore candidate decision trees to optimize for a global objective. It\nproduces compact decision trees optimized for a specific set of rules and a\ngiven performance metric, such as classification time, memory footprint, or a\ncombination of the two.
