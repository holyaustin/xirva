Bottleneck routers update the feedback\nin packet headers to signal congestion, and access routers use it to police\nsenders' traffic. Targeted DoS victims can use the secure congestion policing\nfeedback as capability tokens to suppress unwanted traffic. When compromised\nsenders and receivers organize into pairs to congest a network link, NetFence\nprovably guarantees a legitimate sender its fair share of network resources\nwithout keeping per-host state at the congested link.

The joining criteria for the nodes, which lie at one hop\nfrom the elected cluster heads, to a particular cluster not only consider the\nreliability of their communication link with their cluster head but also other\nimportant attributes. The nodes that lie outside the communication range of\ncluster heads become cluster members transitively through existing cluster\nmembers utilizing the end-to-end notion of link reliability, between the nodes\nand the cluster heads, along with other important attributes. Similarly,\ninter-cluster communication paths are selected using a set of criteria that\nincludes the end-to-end communication link reliability with the sink node along\nwith other important node and network attributes.

While some WSN applications only require a lim- ited\namount of bandwidth, new emerging applications operate with a notice- ably\nlarge amount of data transfers. One way to deal with such applications is to\nmaximize the available capacity by utilizing the use of multiple wireless\nchannels. This work proposes DynaChannAl, a distributed dynamic wireless\nchannel algorithm with the goal of effectively distributing nodes on multiple\nwireless channels in WSN systems. Specifically, DynaChannAl targets applica-\ntions where mobile nodes connect to a pre-existing wireless backbone and takes\nthe expected end-to-end queuing delay as its core metric. We use the link qual-\nity indicator (LQI) values provided by IEEE 802.15.4 radios white-list\npotential links with good link quality and evaluate such links with the\naggregated packet transmission latency at each hop. Our approach is useful for\napplications that require minimal end-to-end delay (i.e., healthcare\napplications). DynaChannAl is a light weight and highly adoptable scheme that\ncan be easily incorporated with various pre-developed components and\npre-deployed applications.

A node in ad hoc network\nlearns routing information by overhearing or forwarding packets to other nodes\nand keep learned routes in its route cache. However, node movement results\nbroken links and therefore increases risk of cache pollution. Ensuring cache\nfreshness in on-demand routing protocols, therefore, presents a serious\nchallenge.

Given its\nimpact on quality of service, it is important to understand and characterize\ntemporal starvation. To this end, we develop a \"trap theory\" to analyze\ntemporal throughput fluctuation.

Second, we can develop analytical tools for computing the\n\"degrees of starvation\" for CSMA networks to aid network design. For example,\ngiven a CSMA network, we can determine whether it suffers from starvation, and\nif so, which links will starve. Furthermore, the likelihood and durations of\ntemporal starvation can also be computed.

We consider the scenario in which\nthe scheduler does not have full knowledge of the channel state information,\nbut instead estimates the channel state information by exploiting the memory\ninherent in the Markov channels along with ARQ-styled feedback from the\nscheduled users. Opportunistic scheduling is optimized in two stages: (1)\nChannel estimation and rate adaptation to maximize the expected immediate rate\nof the scheduled user; (2) User scheduling, based on the optimized immediate\nrate, to maximize the overall long term sum-throughput of the downlink. The\nscheduling problem is a partially observable Markov decision process with the\nclassic 'exploitation vs exploration' trade-off that is difficult to quantify.\nWe therefore study the problem in the framework of Restless Multi-armed Bandit\nProcesses (RMBP) and perform a Whittle's indexability analysis. Whittle's\nindexability is traditionally known to be hard to establish and the index\npolicy derived based on Whittle's indexability is known to have optimality\nproperties in various settings. We show that the problem of downlink scheduling\nunder imperfect channel state information is Whittle indexable and derive the\nWhittle's index policy in closed form.

The system scalability can be improved by distributing the load across\nmultiple servers which is proposed by replication. The large scale content\ndistribution systems were improved broadly using the replication techniques.\nThe demanded contents can be brought closer to the clients by multiplying the\nsource of information geographically, which in turn reduce both the access\nlatency and the network traffic.

Proactive routing is suitable for a\nnetwork with a fixed topology. On the other hand, reactive routing is more\nsuitable for a set of mobile nodes where routes are created on demand and there\nis not much time to evaluate the worthiness of a route, the prime concern being\nreachability due to constantly changing node positions. Sensor networks route\nevents of interest from source(s) to destination(s) where appropriate actions\ncould be taken. However, with mobile sensor nodes, it is not only important to\nknow the events but the location of the nodes generating the events. Most\nsensor nodes are not equipped with expensive GPS or accurate RSSI computation\nhardware to aid localization. Keeping these in view, we propose a modified\nreactive routing algorithm, with added support for localization, to localize\nmobile sensor nodes on the basis of information received from fixed sensor\nnodes during mutual exchange of routing control packets. The accuracy of\nlocalization depends on the ratio of the number of fixed nodes to the number of\nmobile nodes and the topology of the fixed nodes. A typical application\nscenario would be a mix of mobile nodes and fixed nodes, where fixed nodes know\ntheir absolute location and the location of mobile nodes is derived from the\nfixed nodes, in step with the reactive routing protocol in action. The modified\nalgorithm would be suitable for deployments where the approximate position of a\nmobile node (i.e. the event location) is required but there is no external\nsupport infrastructure available for localization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Sep 2010 17:30:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 14:28:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sarangi", "Sanat", ""], ["Kar", "Subrat", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.5012", "submitter": "Pradeepa  BK", "authors": "Pradeepa BK and Joy Kuri", "title": "Bulk File Download Throughput in a Single Station WLAN with Nonzero\n  Propagation Delay", "comments": "5 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze TCP-controlled bulk file transfers in a single station (STA) WLAN\nwith nonzero propagation delay between the file server and the WLAN.
