By assuming the distribution of base stations as a Poisson\npoint process, we derive the probability of finding a specific content within a\nthreshold distance and the optimal small cell base station density that\nachieves a given target cache hit probability.

In this paper, a novel connectivity-aware approximation algorithm for\nrelay node placement in WSNs is proposed to offer a major step forward in\nsaving system overhead. Specifically, a unique Local Search Approximation\nAlgorithm (LSAA) is introduced to solve the Relay Node Single Cover (RNSC)\nproblem. In this proposed LSAA approach, the sensor nodes are allocated into\ngroups and then a local Set Cover (SC) for each group is achieved by a local\nsearch algorithm. The union set of all local SCs constitutes a SC of the RNSC\nproblem. The approximation ratio and the time complexity of the LSAA are\nanalyzed by rigorous proof. Additionally, the LSAA approach has been extended\nto solve the relay node double cover problem. Then, a Relay Location Selection\nAlgorithm (RLSA) is proposed to utilize the resulting SC from LSAA in combining\nRLSA with the minimum spanning tree heuristic to build the high-tier\nconnectivity. As the RLSA searches for a nearest location to the sink node for\neach relay node, the high-tier network built by RLSA becomes denser than that\nby existing works. As a result, the number of added relay nodes for building\nthe connectivity of the high-tier WSN can be significantly saved.
