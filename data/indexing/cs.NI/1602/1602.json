Meanwhile, a secondary receiver needs to synchronize its clock with\nthe BS's clock to avoid broadcast failures caused by the possible clock drift\nbetween the CH sequences of the secondary receiver and the BS. In this paper,\nwe propose a CH-based broadcast protocol called SASS, which enables a BS to\nsuccessfully broadcast to secondary receivers over multiple broadcast channels\nvia channel hopping. Specifically, the CH sequences are constructed on basis of\na mathematical construct---the Self-Adaptive Skolem sequence. Moreover, each\nsecondary receiver under SASS is able to adaptively synchronize its clock with\nthat of the BS without any information exchanges, regardless of any amount of\nclock drift.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 03:04:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Lin", ""], ["Xiao", "Zhiping", ""], ["Bian", "Kaigui", ""], ["Shi", "Shuyu", ""], ["Li", "Rui", ""], ["Ji", "Yusheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.00097", "submitter": "Haisheng Tan", "authors": "Zhenhua Han and Haisheng Tan and Guihai Chen and Rui Wang and Yifan\n  Chen and Francis C.M.

Existing VM management algorithms fall into two\ncategories based on whether the VMs' resource demands are assumed to be static\nor dynamic. The former category fails to maximize the resource utilization as\nthey cannot adapt to the dynamic nature of VMs' resource demands. Most\napproaches in the latter category are heuristical and lack theoretical\nperformance guarantees. In this work, we formulate dynamic VM management as a\nlarge-scale Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and derive an optimal\nsolution. Our analysis of real-world data traces supports our choice of the\nmodeling approach. However, solving the large-scale MDP problem suffers from\nthe curse of dimensionality. Therefore, we further exploit the special\nstructure of the problem and propose an approximate MDP-based dynamic VM\nmanagement method, called MadVM. We prove the convergence of MadVM and analyze\nthe bound of its approximation error. Moreover, MadVM can be implemented in a\ndistributed system, which should suit the needs of real data centers. Extensive\nsimulations based on two real-world workload traces show that MadVM achieves\nsignificant performance gains over two existing baseline approaches in power\nconsumption, resource shortage and the number of VM migrations. Specifically,\nthe more intensely the resource demands fluctuate, the more MadVM outperforms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 09:57:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Zhenhua", ""], ["Tan", "Haisheng", ""], ["Chen", "Guihai", ""], ["Wang", "Rui", ""], ["Chen", "Yifan", ""], ["Lau", "Francis C.

However, service providers\nstruggle with many challenges to provide these services. Management complexity,\nequipment costs, and last but not least, scalability issues emerging as the\ncustomers increase in number, are just some of these problems. Software-defined\nnetworking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that can solve aforementioned issues\nusing a logically centralized controller for network devices. In this paper, we\npropose a SDN-based solution called SDxVPN which considerably lowers the\ncomplexity of VPN service definition and management. Our method eliminates\ncomplex and costly device interactions that used to be done through several\ncontrol plane protocols and enables customers to determine their service\nspecifications, define restriction policies and even interconnect with other\ncustomers automatically without operator's intervention. We describe our\nprototype implementation of SDxVPN and its scalability evaluations under\nseveral representative scenarios. The results indicate the effectiveness of the\nproposed solution for deployment to provide large scale VPN services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:46:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mirkhanzadeh", "Behzad", ""], ["Taheri", "Naeim", ""], ["Khorsandi", "Siyavash", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.03716", "submitter": "Mohammed Al-Maqri", "authors": "Mohammed A.

Caching popular videos in the\nstorage of small-cell base stations (SBS), namely, small-cell caching, is an\nefficient technology for reducing the transmission latency whilst mitigating\nthe redundant transmissions of popular videos over back-haul channels. In this\npaper, we consider a commercialized small-cell caching system consisting of a\nnetwork service provider (NSP), several video retailers (VR), and mobile users\n(MU). The NSP leases its SBSs to the VRs for the purpose of making profits, and\nthe VRs, after storing popular videos in the rented SBSs, can provide faster\nlocal video transmissions to the MUs, thereby gaining more profits. We conceive\nthis system within the framework of Stackelberg game by treating the SBSs as a\nspecific type of resources. We first model the MUs and SBSs as two independent\nPoisson point processes, and develop, via stochastic geometry theory, the\nprobability of the specific event that an MU obtains the video of its choice\ndirectly from the memory of an SBS. Then, based on the probability derived, we\nformulate a Stackelberg game to jointly maximize the average profit of both the\nNSP and the VRs. Also, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium by solving a\nnon-convex optimization problem. With the aid of this game theoretic framework,\nwe shed light on the relationship between four important factors: the optimal\npricing of leasing an SBS, the SBSs allocation among the VRs, the storage size\nof the SBSs, and the popularity distribution of the VRs.

Most prior studies of the configuration of carrier sensing\nthresholds are based on a simplified conflict graph model, whereas this paper\nconsiders a realistic signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio model. We provide\na comprehensive study for two effective wireless CSMA protocols:\nCumulative-interference-Power Carrier Sensing and\nIncremental-interference-Power Carrier Sensing, in two aspects: (1) static\napproach that sets a universal carrier sensing threshold to ensure\ninterference-safe transmissions regardless of network topology, and (2)\nadaptive approach that adjusts the carrier sensing thresholds dynamically based\non the feedback of nearby transmissions.
