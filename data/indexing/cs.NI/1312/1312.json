Congestion occurs when resources are in high\ndemand during the active period while the data processing and transmission\nspeeds lag behind the speed of the incoming traffic. This may disrupt normal\nnetwork operations by buffer overflow, packet loss, increased latency,\nexcessive energy consumption and even worse, a collapse of the entire\noperation. In this paper we propose a novel Trust Integrated Congestion-aware\nEnergy Efficient Routing algorithm (TCEER) in which the potential of a node is\ncomputed using its trust value, congestion status, residual energy, distance\nfrom the current packet-forwarding node and the distance from the base station\nusing a Fuzzy Logic Controller. The source node selects the node of highest\npotential in its one hop radio range for data transmission. Hop by hop data\nrouting from source to base station is obtained which is light-weight as well\nas energy-efficient. Finally, the merits of the proposed scheme are discussed\nby comparing it with the existing protocols and the study shows promising\nimprovements in network performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Dec 2013 17:49:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ganguly", "Srinjoy", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Arpita", ""], ["Naskar", "Mrinal Kanti", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.4077", "submitter": "Srinjoy Ganguly Mr.", "authors": "Arpita Chakraborty, Srinjoy Ganguly, Mrinal Kanti Naskar and Anupam\n  Karmakar", "title": "A Trust Based Congestion Aware Hybrid Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm\n  for Energy Efficient Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks (TC-ACO)", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures and 2 tables (Conference Paper)", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced\n  Computing (ICoAC)-2013, pp.XX-XX,Chennai, India, 18 - 20 December (2013)", "doi": "10.1109/ICoAC.2013.6921940", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Congestion is a problem of paramount importance in resource constrained\nWireless Sensor Networks, especially for large networks, where the traffic\nloads exceed the available capacity of the resources.

Many approaches have been proposed in\nliterature to solve this problem, where a node predicts pre-emptively the route\nfailure that occurs with the less received power. However, this approach\nencounters some difficulties, especially in scenario without mobility where\nroute failures may arise. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AODV\nprotocol called LO-PPAODV (Link Quality and MAC-Overhead aware Predictive\nPreemptive AODV). This protocol is based on new metric combine more routing\nmetrics (Link Quality, MAC Overhead) between each node and one hop neighbor.\nAlso we propose a cross-layer networking mechanism to distinguish between both\nsituations, failures due to congestion or mobility, and consequently avoiding\nunnecessary route repair process. The LO-PPAODV was implemented using NS-2. The\nsimulation results show that our approach improves the overall performance of\nthe network.
