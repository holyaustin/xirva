First, we show\nthat any scheduling policy that is unstable in the classical wireline\nadversarial model remains unstable in the multi-hop radio network model, even\nin scenarios free of inter- ferences.

In contrast, such scheduling policies turn out to be\nunstable when using a reactive hearing control. However, the scheduling policy\nLIS can be enforced to be universally stable provided ties are resolved in a\npermanent manner. Such a situation doesn't hold in the case of SIS, which\nremains unstable regardless of how ties are resolved.

In contrast to prior works on optimal caching,\nin this work we study the effect of retransmissions on the optimal cache\nplacement policy for both static and mobile user scenarios. With the popularity\nof files modeled as a Zipf distribution and a maximum n transmissions, i.e.,\nn-1 retransmissions, allowed to receive each file, we determine the optimal\ncaching probability of the files that maximizes the hit probability. Our\nclosed-form optimal solutions concretely demonstrate that the optimal caching\nprobabilities are very sensitive to the number of retransmissions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 14:36:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 16:47:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnan", "Shankar", ""], ["Afshang", "Mehrnaz", ""], ["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03986", "submitter": "Vincenzo Matta", "authors": "Vincenzo Matta, Mario Di Mauro, Maurizio Longo", "title": "DDoS Attacks with Randomized Traffic Innovation: Botnet Identification\n  Challenges and Strategies", "comments": "Submitted for publication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.CR cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are usually launched through the\n$botnet$, an \"army\" of compromised nodes hidden in the network.

We then propose to use silent periods (zero energy\ntransmission) for transmitting the 0's in the RBN encoded data thus obtained.\nThis is in contrast to most conventional communication strategies that utilize\nenergy based transmission (EbT) schemes, where energy expenditure occurs for\ntransmitting both 0 and 1 bit values. The binary to RBN conversion algorithm\npresented here offers a significant reduction in the number of non-zero bits in\nthe resulting RBN encoded data. As a result, it provides a highly\nenergy-efficient technique for data transmission with silent periods for\ntransmitting 0's. We simulated our proposed technique with ideal radio device\ncharacteristics and also with parameters of various commercially available\nradio devices. Experimental results on various benchmark suites show that with\nideal as well as some commercial device characteristics, our proposed\ntransmission scheme requires 69% less energy on an average, compared to the\nenergy based transmission schemes. This makes it very attractive for\napplication scenarios where the devices are highly energy constrained. Finally,\nbased on this transmission strategy, we have designed a MAC protocol that would\nsupport the communication of such RBN encoded data frames.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 19:50:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Koushik", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.04995", "submitter": "Tan Le Thanh", "authors": "Le Thanh Tan and Long Bao Le", "title": "Joint Data Compression and MAC Protocol Design for Smartgrids with\n  Renewable Energy", "comments": "https://arxiv.org/admin/q/1589135, Wireless Communications and Mobile\n  Computing, 2016. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1506.08318", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT math.OC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider the joint design of data compression and\n802.15.4-based medium access control (MAC) protocol for smartgrids with\nrenewable energy.

In this paper, the macrocell offloading\nproblem in femtocaching-assisted cellular networks is investigated. The\nobjective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base\nstation (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to\nsatisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS\noffloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and\nshow that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading\nscheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC)\nto minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph\nmodel to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in\nterms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover,\ndespite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case,\nwe prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for\nlarge number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell\noffloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the\nONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph\nor broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using\nthe minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual\ngraph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate\ngraph scheme.

Second, each\ntraversed router should decrement the TTL value. The combination of both offers\nhost and route fingerprinting options. We present the first work to investigate\nInternet-wide TTL behavior at carrier scale and evaluate its fit to detect\nanomalies, predominantly spoofed source IP addresses. Using purpose-built\nsoftware, we capture 2 weeks of raw TTL data at a 40 Gbit/s Internet uplink.\nFor further insight, we actively measure observed hosts and conduct large-scale\nhitlist-based measurements, which yields three complementary data sets for IPv4\nand IPv6. A majority (69% IPv4; 81% IPv6) of passively observed multi-packet\nhosts exhibit one stable TTL value. Active measurements on unstable hosts yield\na stable anchor TTL value for more than 85% of responsive hosts. We develop a\nstructure to further classify unstable hosts taking, for example, temporal\nstability into account. Correlation of TTL values with BGP data is clear, yet\nunpredictive. The results indicate that carrier-grade TTL anomaly detection can\nyield significant insights in the following categories: First, the method can\nflag anomalies based on TTL observations (yet likely at a difficult false\npositive/false negative trade-off). Second, the method can establish trust that\na packet originates from its acclaimed source.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 09:17:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Scheitle", "Quirin", ""], ["Gasser", "Oliver", ""], ["Emmerich", "Paul", ""], ["Carle", "Georg", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.07630", "submitter": "Cesar Bernardini", "authors": "C\\'esar Bernardini, Thomas Silverston, Athanasios Vasilakos", "title": "Caching Strategies for Information Centric Networking: Opportunities and\n  Challenges", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Internet usage has shifted from host-centric end-to-end communication to a\ncontent-centric approach mainly used for content delivery.

A\nmethod of predicting DNS server load is developed using that model. The\nprediction method is solely based on the unilateral measurements or\nobservations at authoritative servers. Without reliance on lots of multi-point\nmeasurements nor distributed measuring facilities, the method is best suited\nfor DNS authoritative operators. The proposed model and prediction method are\nvalidated through extensive simulations. Finally, global sensibility analysis\nis conducted to evaluate the impacts of measurement uncertainties or errors on\nthe predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 15:07:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zheng", ""]]}]
