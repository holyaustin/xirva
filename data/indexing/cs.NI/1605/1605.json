On one hand, massive\nnumber of devices sharing the limited wireless resources will render\ncentralized control mechanisms infeasible due to the excessive cost of\ninformation acquisition and computations. On the other hand, to reduce energy\nconsumption from fixed power grid and/or battery, many IoT devices may need to\ndepend on the energy harvested from the ambient environment (e.g., from RF\ntransmissions, environmental sources). However, due to the opportunistic nature\nof energy harvesting, this will introduce uncertainty in the network operation.\nIn this article, we study the distributed cell association problem for energy\nharvesting IoT devices in UD-SCNs. After reviewing the state-of-the-art\nresearch on the cell association problem in small cell networks, we outline the\nmajor challenges for distributed cell association in IoT-driven UD-SCNs where\nthe IoT devices will need to perform cell association in a distributed manner\nin presence of uncertainty (e.g., limited knowledge on channel/network) and\nlimited computational capabilities. To this end, we propose an approach based\non mean-field multi-armed bandit games to solve the uplink cell association\nproblem for energy harvesting IoT devices in a UD-SCN. This approach is\nparticularly suitable to analyze large multi-agent systems under uncertainty\nand lack of information.

A critical step in replicating the self-interference is the estimation\nof the multi-path channel through which the transmitted signal propagates to\nthe antenna. Since there is no prior model on the number of multipath\nreflections, current techniques assume a tap delay line filter (in the RF and\ndigital domain) with a large number of taps, and estimate the taps in the\nanalog and the digital domain. Assuming such a model leads to a large\nform-factor for the analog and RF circuits and increased complexity in the\ndigital domain.\n  In this paper, using a linearization technique, we show that the\nself-interference channel in an indoor environment can be effectively modelled\nas $H(f)=C_0 + C_1f$ in the frequency domain. Thus, the effective\nself-interference channel can be represented by two parameters $C_0$ and $C_1$,\nirrespective of the multipath environment.

In this paper we\nsystematically study the performance of different spectrum sharing schemes for\ninter-technology coexistence in a spectrum commons. Our contributions are\nthreefold.

While many attack vectors have already been uncovered,\none important vector has been left out though: attacking the currency via the\nInternet routing infrastructure itself. Indeed, by manipulating routing\nadvertisements (BGP hijacks) or by naturally intercepting traffic, Autonomous\nSystems (ASes) can intercept and manipulate a large fraction of Bitcoin\ntraffic.\n  This paper presents the first taxonomy of routing attacks and their impact on\nBitcoin, considering both small-scale attacks, targeting individual nodes, and\nlarge-scale attacks, targeting the network as a whole. While challenging, we\nshow that two key properties make routing attacks practical: (i) the efficiency\nof routing manipulation; and (ii) the significant centralization of Bitcoin in\nterms of mining and routing. Specifically, we find that any network attacker\ncan hijack few (<100) BGP prefixes to isolate ~50% of the mining power---even\nwhen considering that mining pools are heavily multi-homed. We also show that\non-path network attackers can considerably slow down block propagation by\ninterfering with few key Bitcoin messages.\n  We demonstrate the feasibility of each attack against the deployed Bitcoin\nsoftware. We also quantify their effectiveness on the current Bitcoin topology\nusing data collected from a Bitcoin supernode combined with BGP routing data.\n  The potential damage to Bitcoin is worrying. By isolating parts of the\nnetwork or delaying block propagation, attackers can cause a significant amount\nof mining power to be wasted, leading to revenue losses and enabling a wide\nrange of exploits such as double spending.
