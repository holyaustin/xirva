In the case of live\nstreaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency\nconstraints.

Content and client security are more intrinsic in the ICN\nparadigm versus the current host centric paradigm where they have been\ninstrumented as an after thought. By design, the ICN paradigm inherently\nsupports several security and privacy features, such as provenance and identity\nprivacy, which are still not effectively available in the host-centric\nparadigm. However, given its nascency, the ICN paradigm has several open\nsecurity and privacy concerns, some that existed in the old paradigm, and some\nnew and unique. In this article, we survey the existing literature in security\nand privacy research sub-space in ICN. More specifically, we explore three\nbroad areas: security threats, privacy risks, and access control enforcement\nmechanisms.\n  We present the underlying principle of the existing works, discuss the\ndrawbacks of the proposed approaches, and explore potential future research\ndirections. In the broad area of security, we review attack scenarios, such as\ndenial of service, cache pollution, and content poisoning. In the broad area of\nprivacy, we discuss user privacy and anonymity, name and signature privacy, and\ncontent privacy. ICN's feature of ubiquitous caching introduces a major\nchallenge for access control enforcement that requires special attention.

In Stage I, the database and the licensee negotiate regarding\nthe commission for the licensee to use the spectrum market platform. In Stage\nII, the database and the licensee compete for selling information or channels\nto unlicensed users. In Stage III, unlicensed users determine whether they\nshould buy exclusive usage right of licensed channels from the licensee or\ninformation regarding unlicensed channels from the database.

Then, in a multi-operator environment, VDSL2 may be unable to provide\nthe 100 Mbit/s speed required by the EC's policy target, unless vectoring is\nadopted along with a suitable Multi-Operator Vectoring (MOV) technique. Some\nvendors recently proposed enlarging the bandwidth up to 35.2~MHz (so-called\ne-VDSL) as one possible solution to increase the 100 Mbit/s coverage. However,\nas we show in the paper, the bandwidth advantage is illusory as an \"ideal MOV\"\nis not implementable with today's technology, and alien-FEXT practically\ndestroys the envisaged data-rate increase. Therefore, we introduce the Sub-band\nVectoring (SBV) technique, as one practical solution, which turns out to be\nnear optimal in terms of achievable data-rate, as well as incremental for those\nCountries where the NRA adopts sub-loop unbundling regulation. SBV adopts a\nnovel frequency division multiplexing approach, which imposes one fairness\ncondition to equalize data-rate values and overall bandwidth per operator at\ndifferent distances. The paper shows that e-VDSL with SBV is robust, as it can\ncope with relatively high values of vectoring impairments. It also shows that\nthe SBV allows up to three co-located operators with e-VDSL to coexist, without\nimposing any of the burdensome coordination limitations of the ideal MOV\narchitecture. Our results show that the SBV allows achieving up to 210 Mbit/s\nper user for e-VDSL and up to 620 Mbit/s per user for a bandwidth expanded up\nto 105.6 MHz, with two telecom operators.

Two constrained optimization problems are\nformulated; the first problem is maximizing the secondary user throughput while\nthe second problem is minimizing the secondary user average delay, subject to a\ncommon constraint on the primary user average delay. In spite of the complexity\nof the optimization problems, due to their non-convexity, we transform the\nfirst problem into a set of linear programs and the second problem into a set\nof quasiconvex optimization problems. We prove that both problems are\nequivalent with identical feasible sets and optimal solutions. We show, through\nnumerical results, that the proposed cooperation policy represents the best\ncompromise between enhancing the secondary users QoS and satisfying the primary\nusers QoS requirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 11:24:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Elmahdy", "Adel M.", ""], ["El-Keyi", "Amr", ""], ["ElBatt", "Tamer", ""], ["Seddik", "Karim G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09537", "submitter": "Junaid Qadir", "authors": "Oluwakayode Onireti, Muhammad Ali Imran, Junaid Qadir, Arjuna\n  Sathiaseelan", "title": "Will 5G See its Blind Side?

Mobile phones---the fastest growing\ntechnology in the world that now reaches around 80\\% of humanity---can enable\nuniversal Internet access if it can resolve coverage problems that have\nhistorically plagued previous cellular architectures (2G, 3G, and 4G). These\nconventional architectures have not been able to sustain universal service\nprovisioning since these architectures depend on having enough users per cell\nfor their economic viability and thus are not well suited to rural areas (which\nare by definition sparsely populated). The new generation of mobile cellular\ntechnology (5G), currently in a formative phase and expected to be finalized\naround 2020, is aimed at orders of magnitude performance enhancement. 5G offers\na clean slate to network designers and can be molded into an architecture also\namenable to universal Internet provisioning. Keeping in mind the great social\nbenefits of democratizing Internet and connectivity, we believe that the time\nis ripe for emphasizing universal Internet provisioning as an important goal on\nthe 5G research agenda. In this paper, we investigate the opportunities and\nchallenges in utilizing 5G for global access to the Internet for all (GAIA). We\nhave also identified the major technical issues involved in a 5G-based GAIA\nsolution and have set up a future research agenda by defining open research\nproblems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 11:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Onireti", "Oluwakayode", ""], ["Imran", "Muhammad Ali", ""], ["Qadir", "Junaid", ""], ["Sathiaseelan", "Arjuna", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09578", "submitter": "Prateek Kapadia", "authors": "Prateek Kapadia", "title": "Wireless Coverage Area Computation and Optimization", "comments": "Ph.D Thesis, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT\n  Bombay", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A wireless network's design must include the optimization of the area of\ncoverage of its wireless transmitters - mobile and base stations in cellular\nnetworks, wireless access points in WLANs, or nodes on a transmit schedule in a\nwireless ad-hoc network. Typically, the coverage optimization for the common\nchannels is solved by spatial multiplexing, i.e. keeping the access networks\nfar apart. However, with increasing densities of wireless network deployments\n(including the Internet-of-Things) and paucity of spectrum, and new\ndevelopments like whitespace devices and self-organizing, cognitive networks,\nthere is a need to manage interference and optimize coverage by efficient\nalgorithms that correctly set the transmit powers to ensure that transmissions\nonly use the power necessary.\n  In this work we study methods for computing and optimizing\ninterference-limited coverage maps of a set of transmitters. We progress\nsuccessively through increasingly realistic network scenarios. We begin with a\ndisk model with a fixed set of transmitters and present an optimal algorithm\nfor computing the coverage map. We then enhance the model to include updates to\nthe network, in the form of addition or deletion of one transmitter. In this\ndynamic setting, we present an optimal algorithm to maintain updates to the\ncoverage map. We then move to a more realistic interference model - the SINR\nmodel. For the SINR model we first show geometric bases for coverage maps. We\nthen present a method to approximate the measure of the coverage area. Finally,\nwe present an algorithm that uses this measure to optimize the coverage area\nwith minimum total transmit power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2015 13:47:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kapadia", "Prateek", ""]]}]
