This\nalgorithm requires a preprocessing phase before the sampling of nodes. In\nparticular, a minimum diameter spanning tree (MDST) is created in the network,\nand then nodes' weights are efficiently aggregated using the tree. The good\nnews are that the preprocessing is done only once, regardless of the number of\nsources and the number of samples taken from the network. After that, every\nsample is done with a RCW whose length is bounded by the network diameter.\n  Secondly, RCW algorithms that do not require preprocessing are proposed for\ngrids and networks with regular concentric connectivity, for the case when the\nprobability of selecting a node is a function of its distance to the source.\n  The key features of the RCW algorithms (unlike previous Markovian approaches)\nare that (1) they do not need to warm-up (stabilize), (2) the sampling always\nfinishes in a number of hops bounded by the network diameter, and (3) it\nselects a node with the exact probability distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2011 10:46:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 May 2012 04:10:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2012 17:39:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Sevilla", "Andr\u00e9s", ""], ["Mozo", "Alberto", ""], ["Anta", "Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1158", "submitter": "Anastasios Giovanidis", "authors": "Anastasios Giovanidis, Qi Liao, and Slawomir Stanczak", "title": "Measurement-Adaptive Cellular Random Access Protocols", "comments": "31 pages, 13 figures, 3 tables.

We perform probabilistic analysis and\nextensive simulation to show the robustness of our detection algorithm. We also\nanalyze the overhead of our detection algorithm and show that we can achieve\nsatisfactory security guarantee for reasonable communication overhead (5% of\nthe total available Tor bandwidth in the worst case). Real world experiments\nreveal that our detection algorithm provides good defense against selective DoS\nattack.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2011 23:35:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2012 01:09:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2012 21:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Anupam", ""], ["Borisov", "Nikita", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3879", "submitter": "Weiping Zhu", "authors": "Weiping Zhu", "title": "Fitting a Model to Data in Loss Tomography", "comments": "10 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Loss tomography has received considerable attention in recent years and a\nnumber of estimators have been proposed.

This reveals\na surprising fact: transmission reliability and user fairness are no longer\ncontradicting each other in relay-assisted systems. They can be both achieved\nby the simple TDMA schemes.

Our results\nhere may find applications in the design of next-generation wireless\ncommunication systems with relay architectures such as LTE-advanced and WiMAX.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 07:44:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bi", "Suzhi", "", "Angela"], ["Jun", "Ying", "", "Angela"], ["Zhang", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5468", "submitter": "Brad Zarikoff", "authors": "Brad W.

A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers\n(MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone\nthrough the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and\ncommunicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the\ninvolvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in\nWMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium,\nstringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to\nsupport real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust,\nreliable and efficient communication protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end\nlatency and packet drops. Design of a secure and efficient communication\nprotocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we\npropose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user\nanonymity while maintaining communication efficiency in a WMN. The security\nprotocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the\nbackbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is\nachieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature\nscheme. Simulation results demonstrate that while the protocols have minimal\nstorage and communication overhead, they are robust and provide high level of\nsecurity and privacy to the users of the network services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 17:01:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5559", "submitter": "Mahyar Salek", "authors": "Mahyar Salek, Shahin Shayandeh, David Kempe", "title": "You Share, I Share: Network Effects and Economic Incentives in P2P\n  File-Sharing Systems", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the interaction between network effects and external incentives on\nfile sharing behavior in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks. Many current or\nenvisioned P2P networks reward individuals for sharing files, via financial\nincentives or social recognition. Peers weigh this reward against the cost of\nsharing incurred when others download the shared file. As a result, if other\nnearby nodes share files as well, the cost to an individual node decreases.\nSuch positive network sharing effects can be expected to increase the rate of\npeers who share files.\n  In this paper, we formulate a natural model for the network effects of\nsharing behavior, which we term the \"demand model.\" We prove that the model has\ndesirable diminishing returns properties, meaning that the network benefit of\nincreasing payments decreases when the payments are already high. This result\nholds quite generally, for submodular objective functions on the part of the\nnetwork operator.\n  In fact, we show a stronger result: the demand model leads to a \"coverage\nprocess,\" meaning that there is a distribution over graphs such that\nreachability under this distribution exactly captures the joint distribution of\nnodes which end up sharing. The existence of such distributions has advantages\nin simulating and estimating the performance of the system. We establish this\nresult via a general theorem characterizing which types of models lead to\ncoverage processes, and also show that all coverage processes possess the\ndesirable submodular properties. We complement our theoretical results with\nexperiments on several real-world P2P topologies. We compare our model\nquantitatively against more na\\\"ive models ignoring network effects. A main\noutcome of the experiments is that a good incentive scheme should make the\nreward dependent on a node's degree in the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 18:46:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 17:19:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Salek", "Mahyar", ""], ["Shayandeh", "Shahin", ""], ["Kempe", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5778", "submitter": "K.

We seek a solution to this local\nproblem, the idea being that such a solution, if adopted by every node, could\nprovide a reasonable heuristic for the end-to-end forwarding problem. Towards\nthis end, we propose a relay selection problem comprising a forwarding node and\na collection of relay nodes, with the relays waking up sequentially at random\ntimes. At each relay wake-up instant the forwarder can choose to probe a relay\nto learn its reward value, based on which the forwarder can then decide whether\nto stop (and forward its packet to the chosen relay) or to continue to wait for\nfurther relays to wake-up. The forwarder's objective is to select a relay so as\nto minimize a combination of waiting-delay, reward and probing cost. Our\nproblem can be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem studied in\nthe operations research literature. We formulate our relay selection problem as\na Markov decision process (MDP) and obtain some interesting structural results\non the optimal policy (namely, the threshold and the stage-independence\nproperties). We also conduct simulation experiments and gain valuable insights\ninto the performance of our local forwarding-solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jul 2011 17:38:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 17:01:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Naveen", "K P", ""], ["Kumar", "Anurag", ""]]}]
