Clustering is an efficient technique to extend life time of sensor\nnetworks by reducing the energy consumption.

In this scenario, we provide a polynomial-time (in the number of users)\nalgorithm that finds the optimal coded packet. The proposed algorithm is\nevaluated using both simulation and real network traces of a real-time Android\napplication. Both results show that the proposed coding scheme significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art baselines: an optimal repetition code and a\nCOPE-like greedy scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 18:33:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 00:18:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 May 2014 22:13:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Le", "Anh", ""], ["Tehrani", "Arash S.", ""], ["Dimakis", "Alexandros G.", ""], ["Markopoulou", "Athina", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7467", "submitter": "Mike Freemon", "authors": "D.

Every 17 seconds, a 6.4\nGB image is transferred to Illinois for immediate processing. That transfer\nneeds to complete within approximately five seconds. LSST is provisioning an\ninternational WAN with a 10Gbps bandwidth guarantee for this and other\nproject-related data transfers. The stringent latency requirement drives a\nre-examination of TCP congestion control for this use case. Specifically, prior\nwork on dedicated Long Fat Networks (LFNs) does not go far enough in fully\nleveraging the opportunity provided by the bandwidth guarantee. This paper\npresents an approach for how optimal network throughput can be obtained for the\nLSST use case, and the conditions under which any project can achieve data\nthroughput rates on long-distance networks approaching wire speed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 19:36:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 21:25:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 21:45:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Freemon", "D.
