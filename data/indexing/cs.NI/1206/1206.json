The prominence of EB is primarily attributed to its asymptotic\nthroughput stability, which ensures a non-zero throughput even when the number\nof users in the network goes to infinity. Recent studies, however, show that EB\nis fundamentally unsuitable for applications that are sensitive to large delay\nand delay jitters, as it induces divergent second- and higher-order moments of\nmedium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law\ndistribution, a subclass of heavy-tailed distribution. To understand and\nalleviate the issue, this paper systematically analyzes the tail delay\ndistribution of general backoff functions, with EB being a special case. In\nparticular, we establish a tradeoff between the tail decaying rate of medium\naccess delay distribution and the stability of throughput. To be more specific,\nconvergent delay moments are attainable only when the backoff functions $g(k)$\ngrows slower than exponential functions, i.e., when $g(k)\\in o(r^k)$ for all\n$r>1$. On the other hand, non-zero asymptotic throughput is attainable only\nwhen backoff functions grow at least as fast as an exponential function, i.e.,\n$g(k)\\in\\Omega(r^k)$ for some $r>1$. This implies that bounded delay moments\nand stable throughput cannot be achieved at the same time. For practical\nimplementation, we show that polynomial backoff (PB), where $g(k)$ is a\npolynomial that grows slower than exponential functions, obtains finite delay\nmoments and good throughput performance at the same time within a practical\nrange of user population. This makes PB a better alternative than EB for\nmultimedia applications with stringent delay requirements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 15:01:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 12:30:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 07:56:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Bi", "Suzhi", ""], ["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0643", "submitter": "Kostas Stamatiou", "authors": "Kostas Stamatiou, Davide Chiarotto, Federico Librino, Michele Zorzi", "title": "Performance analysis of an opportunistic relay selection protocol for\n  multi-hop networks (Technical report)", "comments": "4 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this technical report, we analyze the performance of an interference-aware\nopportunistic relay selection protocol for multi-hop line networks which is\nbased on the following simple rule: a node always transmits if it has a packet,\nexcept when its successive node on the line is transmitting.

The proposed algorithm is outlined as follows - To resolve\na query, the mobile client searches its cache to check if its data is valid. If\nyes, then query is answered, otherwise the client queries the DTA (Dynamic\nTransmitting Agent) for latest updates and the query is answered. If DTA\ndoesn't have the latest updates, it gets it from the server. So, the main idea\nhere is that DTA will be multicasting updates to the clients and hence the\nclients need not uplink to the server individually, thus preserving the network\nbandwidth. The scenario of simulation is developed in Java.

Often, the common\nthinking among researchers and implementers is that compression is always a\ngood choice, because the major source of energy consumption in a sensor node\ncomes from the transmission of the data. Lossy compression is deemed a viable\nsolution as the imperfect reconstruction of the signal is often acceptable in\nWSN. In this paper, we thoroughly review a number of lossy compression methods\nfrom the literature, and analyze their performance in terms of compression\nefficiency, computational complexity and energy consumption. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios, namely, wireless and underwater communications, and show\nthat signal compression may or may not help in the reduction of the overall\nenergy consumption, depending on factors such as the compression algorithm, the\nsignal statistics and the hardware characteristics, i.e., micro-controller and\ntransmission technology. The lesson that we have learned, is that signal\ncompression may in fact provide some energy savings.

Recent studies on\nMAC scheduling have shown that carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) can be\ncontrolled to be achieve optimality in terms of throughput or utility. These\nresults imply that just a simple MAC algorithm without message passing is\npossible to achieve high performance guarantee. However, such studies are\nconducted only on the assumption that channel conditions are static. Noting\nthat the main drive for achieving optimality in optimal CSMA is to let it run a\ngood schedule for some time, formally referred to as the mixing time, it is\nunder-explored how such optimal CSMA performs for time-varying channel\nconditions. In this paper, under the practical constraint of restricted\nback-off rates (i.e., limited sensing speed), we consider two versions of\nCSMAs: (i) channel-unaware CSMA (U-CSMA) and (ii) channel-aware CSMA (A-CSMA),\neach of which is characterized as its ability of tracking channel conditions.\nWe first show that for fast channel variations, A-CSMA achieves almost zero\nthroughput, implying that incomplete tracking of channel conditions may\nseriously degrade performance, whereas U-CSMA, accessing the media without\nexplicit consideration of channel conditions, has positive worst-case guarantee\nin throughput, where the ratio of guarantee depends on network topology. On the\nother hand, for slow channel variations, we prove that A-CSMA is\nthroughput-optimal for any network topology.

Also, the proposed schemes\novercome random access without sensing scheme.\n  The theoretical and numerical results show that pairs of misdetection and\nfalse alarm probabilities may exist such that sensing the primary channel for\nvery small duration overcomes sensing it for large portion of the time slot. In\naddition, for certain average arrival rate to the primary queue pairs of\nmisdetection and false alarm probabilities may exist such that the random\naccess without sensing overcomes the random access with long sensing duration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 01:29:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Shafie", "Ahmed El", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6170", "submitter": "Hassan Keshavarz", "authors": "Hero Modares (corresponding author), Rosli Salleh, Amirhosein\n  Moravejosharieh, Hossein Malakootikhah", "title": "Securing Binding Update in Mobile IPv6 Using Private Key Base Binding\n  Update Protocol", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to wrong update.\n  please withdraw this article", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile IPv6 control signalling messages generally act as informants to the\nhome agent (HA) and the correspondent node (CN) regarding a mobile node's\n(MN's) new address when its network attachment point changes.

In the existing standard,\ncontrol signalling messages between HA and MN are frequently authenticated with\nIKEv2 and X.509 certificates via IPSec.

Therefore,\nthese networks require specific solutions and identify a novel research area,\ni.e., Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET).

In operated VSNs, providers tend to reduce the traffic\nload on their network, using the free-frequency communication medium (IEEE\n802.11p, for example).

One of the key\nprinciples in protecting privacy is data minimisation. This principle requires\nthat only the minimum amount of information necessary to accomplish a certain\ngoal is collected and processed. \"Privacy-enhancing\" communication protocols\nhave been proposed to guarantee data minimisation in a wide range of\napplications. However, currently there is no satisfactory way to assess and\ncompare the privacy they offer in a precise way: existing analyses are either\ntoo informal and high-level, or specific for one particular system. In this\nwork, we propose a general formal framework to analyse and compare\ncommunication protocols with respect to privacy by data minimisation. Privacy\nrequirements are formalised independent of a particular protocol in terms of\nthe knowledge of (coalitions of) actors in a three-layer model of personal\ninformation. These requirements are then verified automatically for particular\nprotocols by computing this knowledge from a description of their\ncommunication. We validate our framework in an identity management (IdM) case\nstudy. As IdM systems are used more and more to satisfy the increasing need for\nreliable on-line identification and authentication, privacy is becoming an\nincreasingly critical issue. We use our framework to analyse and compare four\nidentity management systems.
