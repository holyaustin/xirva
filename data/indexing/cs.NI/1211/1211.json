Similarly, the network operators entering or consolidating\nin the emerging markets can aim for substantial savings on capital and\noperating expenses. The present paper aims to investigate the current\ntechnological solutions and regulatory and the technical-economical dimensions\nin connection with the sharing of mobile telecommunication networks in emerging\ncountries. We analyze the estimated savings on capital and operating expenses,\nwhile assessing the technical constraints, applicability and benefits of the\nnetwork sharing solutions in an emerging market context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2012 22:51:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Meddour", "Djamal-Eddine", ""], ["Rasheed", "Tinku", ""], ["Gourhant", "Yvon", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7139", "submitter": "Jinho Choi", "authors": "June Hwang, Jinho Choi, Riku Jantti, Seong-Lyun Kim", "title": "On the Aggregate Interference in Random CSMA/CA Networks: A Stochastic\n  Geometry Approach", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some errors in\n  proof", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we investigate the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of\nthe aggregate interference in carrier sensing multiple access/collision\navoidance (CSMA/CA) networks measured at an arbitrary time and position.

To find the effective active node density we\nanalyze the distributed coordinate function (DCF) dynamics in a common sensing\narea and obtain the steady-state power distribution within a spatial disk of\nradius $R/2$, where $R$ is the effective carrier sensing distance.

Chipset manufacturers, original equipment\nmanufacturers (OEMs), and telecom companies are also assisting in this\ndevelopment. 60 GHz millimeter wave transmission will scale the speed of WLANs\nand WPANs to 6.75 Gbit/s over distances less than 10 meters. This technology is\nthe first of its kind and will eliminate the need for cable around personal\ncomputers, docking stations, and other consumer electronic devices.\nHigh-definition multimedia interface (HDMI), display port, USB 3.0, and\nperipheral component interconnect express (PCIe) 3.0 cables will all be\neliminated. Fast downloads and uploads, wireless sync, and\nmulti-gigabit-per-second WLANs will be possible over shorter distances. 60 GHz\nmillimeter wave supports fast session transfer (FST) protocol, which makes it\nbackward compatible with 5 GHz or 2.4 GHz WLAN so that end users experience the\nsame range as in today's WLANs. IEEE 802.11ad specifies the physical (PHY)\nsublayer and medium access control (MAC) sublayer of the protocol stack. The\nMAC protocol is based on time-division multiple access (TDMA), and the PHY\nlayer uses single carrier (SC) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) to simultaneously enable low-power, high-performance applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 19:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["N.", "Sai Shankar", ""], ["Dash", "Debashis", ""], ["Madi", "Hassan El", ""], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Guru", ""]]}]
