The BLESS system leverages the decentralized\narchitecture of the blockchain network, which not only allows grassroots\nindividuals to participate rating process of a social credit system (SCS), but\nalso provides tamper proof of transaction data in the trustless network\nenvironment. The anonymity in blockchain records also protects individuals from\nbeing targeted in the fight against powerful enterprises. Smart contract\nenabled authentication and authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized\nentity from accessing the credit system. The BLESS scheme is promising to offer\na secure, transparent and decentralized SCS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2018 14:58:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2018 15:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Ronghua", ""], ["Lin", "Xuheng", ""], ["Dong", "Qi", ""], ["Chen", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.01050", "submitter": "Zaid Allybokus", "authors": "Zaid Allybokus, Konstantin Avrachenkov, J\\'er\\'emie Leguay and Lorenzo\n  Maggi", "title": "Multi-Path Alpha-Fair Resource Allocation at Scale in Distributed\n  Software Defined Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2018.2871293", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The performance of computer networks relies on how bandwidth is shared among\ndifferent flows.

In this paper, we propose Bicomp, a bilayer scalable\nNakamoto consensus protocol, which is an approach based on high security and\npure decentralized Nakamoto consensus, and with a significant improvement on\nscalability.

A leader is elected at beginning of each round\nby using a macroblock header from proof-of-work. An elected leader then\nreceives and packages multiple microblocks mined by different nodes into one\nmacroblock during its tenure, which results in a bilayer block structure. Such\ndesign limits a leader's power and encourages as many nodes as possible to\nparticipate in the process of packaging transactions, which promotes the\nsharding nature of the system.

Whisper makes use of synchronous\ntransmissions, a technique first introduced by the Glossy flooding protocol. In\ncontrast to Glossy, Whisper does not let the radio switch from receive to\ntransmit mode between messages. Instead, it makes nodes continuously transmit\nidentical copies of the message and eliminates the gaps between subsequent\ntransmissions. To this end, Whisper embeds the message to be flooded into a\nsignaling packet that is composed of multiple packlets -- where a packlet is a\nportion of the message payload that mimics the structure of an actual packet. A\nnode must intercept only one of the packlets to detect that there is an ongoing\ntransmission and that it should start forwarding the message. This allows\nWhisper to speed up the propagation of the flood, and thus, to reduce the\noverall radio-on time of the nodes. Our evaluation on the FlockLab testbed\nshows that Whisper achieves comparable reliability but 2x lower radio-on time\nthan Glossy. We further show that by embedding Whisper in an existing data\ncollection application, we can more than double the lifetime of the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2018 06:56:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2021 14:09:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Brachmann", "Martina", ""], ["Landsiedel", "Olaf", ""], ["G\u00f6hringer", "Diana", ""], ["Santini", "Silvia", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.03724", "submitter": "Francesco Malandrino", "authors": "Senay Semu Tadesse and Carla Fabiana Chiasserini and Francesco\n  Malandrino", "title": "Characterizing the Power Cost of Virtualization Environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Virtualization is a key building block of next-generation mobile networks.

To make our solution scalable and amenable to future 5G application\nscenario with large-scale user devices, we further propose a distributed\napproximation scheme with greatly reduced time complexity, based on the\ntechnique of best response update.

The proposed uncoordinated SNC is a computationally efficient\nmethod, yet, it may be insufficient to exploit the synergy between drone-BSs\nand UIL.

However, the interpretation of\ntrustworthiness is contextual and varies according to the risk tolerance\nattitude of the concerned application and varying levels of uncertainty\nassociated with the evidence upon which trust models act. Hence, the data\nintegrity scoring mechanisms should have provisions to adapt to varying risk\nattitudes and uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian inference\nmodel and a prospect theoretic framework for data integrity scoring that\nquantify the trustworthiness of data collected from IoT devices in the presence\nof an adversaries who manipulate the data. We consider an imperfect anomaly\nmonitoring mechanism that monitors the data being sent from each device and\nclassifies the outcome as not compromised, compromised, and cannot be inferred.\nThese outcomes are conceptualized as a multinomial hypothesis of a Bayesian\ninference model with three parameters which are then used for calculating a\nutility value on how reliable the aggregate data is. We use a prospect theory\ninspired approach to quantify this data integrity score and evaluate the\ntrustworthiness of the aggregate data from the IoT framework. Furthermore, we\nalso model the system using the traditionally used expected utility theory and\ncompare the results with that obtained using prospect theory. As decisions are\nbased on how the data is fused, we propose two measuring models: one optimistic\nand another conservative. The proposed framework is validated using extensive\nsimulation experiments. We show how data integrity scores vary under a variety\nof system factors like attack intensity and inaccurate detection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 03:16:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 20:35:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 03:48:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2020 06:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Salimitari", "Mehrdad", ""], ["Bhattacharjee", "Shameek", ""], ["Chatterjee", "Mainak", ""], ["Fallah", "Yaser P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08325", "submitter": "Quirin Scheitle", "authors": "Quirin Scheitle, Oliver Gasser, Theodor Nolte, Johanna Amann, Lexi\n  Brent, Georg Carle, Ralph Holz, Thomas C.

Our cISP design augments the Internet's fiber with free-space\nwireless connectivity. cISP addresses the fundamental challenge of\nsimultaneously providing low latency and scalable bandwidth, while accounting\nfor numerous practical factors ranging from transmission tower availability to\npacket queuing. We show that instantiations of cISP across the contiguous\nUnited States and Europe would achieve mean latencies within 5% of that\nachievable using great-circle paths at the speed of light, over medium and long\ndistances.

To populate FIBs, clients and routers require some routing\ninformation. One method to obtain this information is that network nodes\nexchange routing information by each node advertising the available content\nobjects. Bloom Filter-based Routing approaches like BFR [1], use Bloom Filters\n(BFs) to advertise all provided content objects, which consumes valuable\nbandwidth and storage resources. This strategy is inefficient as clients\nrequest only a small number of the provided content objects and they do not\nneed the content advertisement information for all provided content objects. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel routing algorithm for NDN called pull-based BFR\nin which servers only advertise the demanded file names. We compare the\nperformance of pull-based BFR with original BFR and with a flooding-assisted\nrouting protocol. Our experimental evaluations show that pull-based BFR\noutperforms original BFR in terms of communication overhead needed for content\nadvertisements, average roundtrip delay, memory resources needed for storing\ncontent advertisements at clients and routers, and the impact of false positive\nreports on routing. The comparisons also show that pull-based BFR outperforms\nflooding-assisted routing in terms of average round-trip delay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 10:21:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Marandi", "Ali", ""], ["Braun", "Torsten", ""], ["Salamatian", "Kave", ""], ["Thomos", "Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10998", "submitter": "Vaneet Aggarwal", "authors": "Anis Elgabli and Muhamad Felemban and Vaneet Aggarwal", "title": "GroupCast: Preference-Aware Cooperative Video Streaming with Scalable\n  Video Coding", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a preference-aware cooperative video streaming\nsystem for videos encoded using Scalable Video Coding (SVC) where all the\ncollaborating users are interested in watching a video together on a shared\nscreen. However, each user's willingness to cooperate is subject to her own\nconstraints such as user data plans and/or energy consumption. Using SVC, each\nlayer of every chunk can be fetched through any of the cooperating users. We\nformulate the problem of finding the optimal quality decisions and fetching\npolicy of the SVC layers of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth,\nchunk deadlines, and cooperation willingness of the different users as an\noptimization problem. The objective is to optimize a QoE metric that maintains\na trade-off between maximizing the playback rate of every chunk while ensuring\nfairness among all chunks for the minimum skip/stall duration without violating\nany of the imposed constraints. We propose an offline algorithm to solve the\nnon-convex optimization problem when the bandwidth prediction is non-causally\nknown. This algorithm has a run-time complexity that is polynomial in the video\nlength and the number of cooperating users. Furthermore, we propose an online\nversion of the algorithm for more practical scenarios where erroneous bandwidth\nprediction for a short window is used. Real implementation with android devices\nusing SVC encoded video on public bandwidth traces' dataset reveals the\nrobustness and performance of the proposed algorithm and shows that the\nalgorithm significantly outperforms round robin based mechanisms in terms of\navoiding skips/stalls and fetching video chunks at their highest quality\npossible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 12:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Elgabli", "Anis", ""], ["Felemban", "Muhamad", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.11120", "submitter": "Shiva Iyer", "authors": "Shiva R.

The Mobile\nUrban Sensing, Inference and Control (MUSIC) framework is contextualized for\nscenarios where a distributed collection of static or mobile sensors\ncollectively achieve an urban sensing task. The MUSIC platform is designed for\nurban-centric sensing applications such as location sensing on mobile phones\nfor road traffic monitoring, air quality sensing and urban quality monitoring\nusing remote cameras. This programmable system, at a high level, consists of\nseveral small sensors placed throughout a city on mobile vehicles and a\ncentralized controller that makes decisions on sensing in order to achieve\ncertain well-defined objectives such as improving spatial coverage of sensing\nand detection of hotspots. The system is programmable in that our framework\nallows one to create custom smart systems by writing custom control logic for\nsensing. Our contributions are two-fold -- a backend software stack to enable\ncentralized control of distributed devices and programmability, and algorithms\nfor intelligent control in the presence of practical power and network\nconstraints.
