In this paper, we propose a new scheme called MIMO PNC (physical\nnetwork coding), in which the relay extracts the summation and difference of\nthe two end packets and then converts them to the network-coded form. MIMO PNC\nis a natural combination of the single-antenna PNC scheme and the linear MIMO\ndetection scheme. The advantages of MIMO PNC are many. First, it removes the\nstringent carrier-phase requirement in single-antenna PNC. Second, it is linear\nin complexity with respect to the constellation size and the number of\nsimultaneous data streams in MIMO.

Moreover, unlike existing congestion control\napproaches, which focus on maintaining throughput-based fairness among users,\nthe proposed media-TCP aims to achieve quality-based fairness among multimedia\nusers. We also derive sufficient conditions for multiple multimedia users to\nachieve quality-based fairness using media-TCP congestion control.
