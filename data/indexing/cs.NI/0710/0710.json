We first tackle the issue\nof stability for networks with arbitrary topologies. We prove that the max-min\nfair RCP fluid model is globally stable in the absence of propagation delays,\nand also derive a set of conditions for local stability when arbitrary\nheterogeneous propagation delays are present. The network delay stability\nresult assumes that, at equilibrium, there is only one bottleneck link along\neach route. Lastly, in the simpler setting of a single link, single delay\nmodel, we investigate the impact of the loss of local stability via a Hopf\nbifurcation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2007 10:44:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Voice", "Thomas", ""], ["Raina", "Gaurav", ""]]}]
