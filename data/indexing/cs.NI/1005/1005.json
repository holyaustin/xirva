For network planners\nwho are deploying VoIP over WLANs, one of the important issues is the VoIP\ncapacity. VoIP bandwidth consumption over a WAN is one of the most important\nfactors to consider when building a VoIP infrastructure. Failure to account for\nVoIP bandwidth requirements will severely limit the reliability of a VoIP\nsystem and place a huge burden on the WAN infrastructure. Less bandwidth\nutilization is the key reasons for reduced number of channel accesses in VOIP.\nBut in the QoS point of view the free bandwidth of atleast 1-5% will improve\nthe voice quality. This proposal utilizes the maximum bandwidth by leaving 1-5%\nfree bandwidth. A Bandwidth Data rate Moderation (BDM) algorithm has been\nproposed which correlates the data rate specified in IEEE802.11b with the free\nbandwidth. At each time BDM will calculate the bandwidth utilization before\nsending the packet to improve performance and voice quality of VoIP. The\nbandwidth calculation in BDM can be done by using Erlang and VOIP bandwidth\ncalculator.

A major\nchallenge lies in adapting multicast communication into such environments where\nmobility and link failures are inevitable. The purpose of this paper is to\nstudy impact of mobility models in performance of multicast routing protocols\nin MANET. In this work, three widely used mobility models such as Random Way\nPoint, Reference Point Group and Manhattan mobility models and three popular\nmulticast routing protocols such as On-Demand Multicast Routing Protocol,\nMulticast Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing protocol and Adaptive Demand\ndriven Multicast Routing protocol have been chosen and implemented in NS2.\nSeveral experiments have been carried out to study the relative strengths,\nweakness and applicability of multicast protocols to these mobility models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 08:10:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Manoharan", "R.", ""], ["Ilavarasan", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1749", "submitter": "Secretary Aircc Journal", "authors": "Abdelsalam Amer and Fayez Gebali, (University of Victoria, Canada)", "title": "General Model for Infrastructure Multi-channel Wireless LANs", "comments": "11 Pages, IJCNC", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications 2.3\n  (2010) 1-11", "doi": "10.5121/ijcnc.2010.2301", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we develop an integrated model for request mechanism and data\ntransmission in multi-channel wireless local area networks.

To this aim, a new technique\ncalled The HandOver Decision STAbility Technique (HODSTAT) is proposed for\nhorizontal handover in Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE\n802.11standard. HODSTAT is based on a hysteresis margin analysis that, combined\nwith a utilitybased function, evaluates the need for the handover and\ndetermines if the handover is needed or avoided. Indeed, if a Mobile Terminal\n(MT) only transiently hands over to a better network, the gain from using this\nnew network may be diminished by the handover overhead and short usage\nduration. The approach that we adopt throughout this article aims at reducing\nthe minimum handover occurrence that leads to the interruption of network\nconnectivity (this is due to the nature of handover in WLAN which is a break\nbefore make which causes additional delay and packet loss). To this end, MT\nrather performs a handover only if the connectivity of the current network is\nthreatened or if the performance of a neighboring network is really better\ncomparing the current one with a hysteresis margin. This hysteresis should make\na tradeoff between handover occurrence and the necessity to change the current\nnetwork of attachment. Our extensive simulation results show that our proposed\nalgorithm outperforms other decision stability approaches for handover decision\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 08:35:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Abid", "Meriem", ""], ["Yahiya", "Tara Ali", ""], ["Pujolle", "Guy", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1755", "submitter": "Secretary Aircc Journal", "authors": "Kiarash Mizanian, Mehdi Vasef and Morteza Analoui, (Iran University of\n  Science and Technology, Iran)", "title": "Bandwidth Modeling and Estimation in Peer to Peer Networks", "comments": "19 Pages, IJCNC", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications 2.3\n  (2010) 65-83", "doi": "10.5121/ijcnc.2010.2306", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Recent studies have shown that the majority of today's internet traffic is\nrelated to Peer to Peer (P2P) traffic.

This\nleads to new research challenges in the area of network architecture and\ntopology. In this paper, we present two different network architectures for 3D\nunderwater sensor networks. The first one is a hierarchical architecture that\nuses a relatively small number of robust backbone nodes to create the network\nwhere a large number of inexpensive sensors communicate with their nearest\nbackbone nodes, and packets from a backbone node to the sink is routed through\nother backbone nodes. This hierarchical approach allows creating a network of\nsmaller number of expensive backbone nodes while keeping the mobile sensors\nsimple and inexpensive. Along with network topology, we also study energy\nefficiency and frequency reuse issues for such 3D networks. The second approach\nis a nonhierarchical architecture which assumes that all nodes are identical\nand randomly deployed. It partitions the whole 3D network space into identical\ncells and keeps one node active in each cell such that sensing coverage and\nconnectivity are maintained while limiting the energy consumed. We also study\ncloseness to optimality of our proposed scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 May 2010 23:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "S.

We decouple the routing and scheduling components of the algorithm\nby designing a probabilistic routing table which is used to route packets to\nper-destination queues. The scheduling decisions in the case of wireless\nnetworks are made using counters called shadow queues.
