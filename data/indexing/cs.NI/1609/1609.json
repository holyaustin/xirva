These solutions are based on\nseparated packet and circuit planes which do not have the ability to utilize an\noptical circuit with flows that do not arrive from or delivered to switches\ndirectly connected to the circuit's end-points. Moreover, current SDN-based\nelephant flow rerouting methods require a forwarding rule for each flow, which\nraise scalability issues. In this paper, we present C-Share -- a practical,\nscalable SDN-based circuit sharing solution for data center networks. C-Share\ninherently enable elephant flows to share optical circuits by exploiting a flat\nupper tier network topology. C-Share is based on a scalable and decoupled\nSDN-based elephant flow rerouting method comprised of elephant flow detection,\ntagging and identification, which is utilized by using a prevalent network\nsampling method (e.g., sFlow). C-Share requires only a single OpenFlow rule for\neach optical circuit, and therefore significantly reduces the required OpenFlow\nrule entry footprint and setup rule rate.

Thus, the spectrum allocation techniques have major\nimpact on the performance of CCU and CEU. In this paper, the performance of\nCCUs and CEUs in a random two-tier network is studied for two spectrum\nallocation techniques namely: 1) co-channel (CSA), and 2) shared (SSA). For\nperformance analysis, the widely accepted conception of modeling the tiers of\nHetNet using independent homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP) is considered\nto accommodate the spatial randomness in location of BSs. To incorporate the\nspatial randomness in the arrival of service and to aid the load-aware\nanalysis, the cellular traffic is modeled using spatio-temporal PPP. Under this\nscenario, we have developed an analytical framework to evaluate the load-aware\nperformance, including coverage and blocking probabilities, of CCUs and CEUs\nunder both spectrum allocation techniques.

We propose to depart from the\nassumption of hard cache misses, common in most existing works, and consider\n\"soft\" cache misses, where if the original content is not available, an\nalternative content that is locally cached can be recommended. Given that\nInternet content consumption is increasingly entertainment-oriented, we believe\nthat a related content could often lead to complete or at least partial user\nsatisfaction, without the need to retrieve the original content over expensive\nlinks. In this paper, we formulate the problem of optimal edge caching with\nsoft cache hits, in the context of delayed access, and analyze the expected\ngains.
