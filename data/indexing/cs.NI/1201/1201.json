After certain rounds\nof transmissions, the pheromones adjustment is performed periodically, which\ncombines the advantages of both global and local pheromones adjustment for\nevaporating or depositing pheromones. Four different pheromones adjustment\nstrategies are designed to achieve the global optimal network lifetime, namely\nBasic-DAACA, ES-DAACA, MM-DAACA and ACS-DAACA. Compared with some other data\naggregation algorithms, DAACA shows higher superiority on average degree of\nnodes, energy efficiency, prolonging the network lifetime, computation\ncomplexity and success ratio of one hop transmission.

In this work, we develop joint\napproximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply\nmachine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete\ninformation.

Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based\non the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used\nfor next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two\nphases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are\nimplemented with a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph.

To enable scheduling based on packet delays, we design a novel\nmechanism for inferring the packet delays approximately from the buffer status\nreports (BSR) transmitted by the UEs; the BSR reports only contain queue length\ninformation. We then consider a constrained optimization problem with a concave\nobjective function - schedulers such as those based on utility maximization,\nmaximum weight scheduling, and recent results on iterative scheduling for small\nqueue/delay follow as special cases. In particular, the construction of the\nnon-differentiable objective function based on packet delays is novel. We model\nconstraints on bandwidth, peak transmit power at the UE, and the transmit power\nspectral density (PSD) at the UE due to fractional power control. When\nfrequency diversity doesn't exist or is not exploited at a fast time-scale, we\nuse subgradient analysis to construct an O(N log L) (per iteration with small\nnumber of iterations) algorithm to compute the optimal resource allocation for\nN users and L points of non-differentiability in the objective function. For a\nfrequency diversity scheduler with M sub-bands, the corre- sponding complexity\nper iteration is essentially O(N(M^2+L^2)).

The broadcast cycle -- a\nsequence of frames sorted by the keys and permuted by $k$-bit reversal -- is\ntransmitted in a round robin fashion by the broadcaster.

Ultimately the notion of channel quality\nshould include both the signal quality and the level of congestion, and a good\nmulti-channel access scheme should take both into account in deciding which\nchannel to use and when. Motivated by this, we focus on the congestion aspect\nand examine what type of dynamic channel switching schemes may result in the\nbest system throughput performance. Specifically we derive the stability region\nof a multi-user multi-channel WLAN system and determine the throughput optimal\nchannel switching scheme within a certain class of schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jan 2012 18:22:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qingsi", ""], ["Liu", "Mingyan", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6181", "submitter": "Tobias Jung", "authors": "Tobias Jung and Sylvain Martin and Damien Ernst and Guy Leduc", "title": "Contextual Multi-armed Bandits for the Prevention of Spam in VoIP\n  Networks", "comments": "Technical report, 19 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we argue that contextual multi-armed bandit algorithms could\nopen avenues for designing self-learning security modules for computer networks\nand related tasks.

In so doing, our work is largely different from related\nprevious work: our goal is to rigorously formalize the problem in terms of\nmathematical decision theory, find the optimal solution to the problem, and\nderive concrete bounds for its expected loss (number of mistakes the SPIT\nfilter will make in the worst case).\n  This goal is achieved by considering an abstracted scenario amenable to\ntheoretical analysis, namely SPIT detection in an outbound scenario with pure\nsources. Our methodology is to first define the cost of making an error (false\npositive and false negative), apply Wald's sequential probability ratio test to\nthe individual sources, and then determine analytically error probabilities\nsuch that the resulting expected loss is minimized.\n  The benefits of our approach are: (1) the method is optimal (in a sense\ndefined in the paper); (2) the method does not rely on manual tuning and\ntweaking of parameters but is completely self-contained and mathematically\njustified; (3) the method is computationally simple and scalable.

An OFDMA system takes advantage of\nboth frequency diversity (FD) gain and frequency-selective scheduling (FSS)\ngain. A FD gain is achieved by allocating a user the subcarriers distributed\nover the entire frequency band whereas a FSS gain is achieved by allocating a\nuser adjacent subcarriers located within a subband of a small bandwidth having\nthe most favorable channel conditions among other subbands in the entire\nfrequency band. Multi-User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is a\npromising technology to increase spectral efficiency. A well-known MU-MIMO mode\nis Space-Division Multiple Access (SDMA) which can be used in the downlink\ndirection to allow a group of spatially separable users to share the same\ntime/frequency resources. In this paper, we study the gain from FSS in\nSDMA-OFDMA systems using the example of WiMAX. Therefore, a complete SDMA-OFDMA\nMAC scheduling solution supporting both FD and FSS is proposed. The proposed\nsolution is analyzed in a typical urban macro-cell scenario by means of\nsystem-level packet-based simulations, with detailed MAC and physical layer\nabstractions. By explicitly simulating the MAC layer overhead (MAP) which is\nrequired to signal every packed data burst in the OFDMA frame we can present\nthe overall performance to be expected at the MAC layer. Our results show that\nin general the gain from FSS when applying SDMA is low. However, under specific\nconditions, small number of BS antennas or large channel bandwidth, a\nsignificant gain can be achieved from FSS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 17:11:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 10:02:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Zubow", "Anatolij", ""], ["Marotzke", "Johannes", ""]]}]
