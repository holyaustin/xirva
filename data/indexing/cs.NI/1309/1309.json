While\ncognitive radio networks (CRN) are envisioned as intelligent networks,\nrelatively little research has focused on the network level functionality of\nCRNs. Although various routing protocols, incorporating varying degrees of\nadaptiveness, have been proposed for CRNs, it is imperative for the long term\nsuccess of CRNs that the design of cognitive routing protocols be pursued by\nthe research community. Cognitive routing protocols are envisioned as routing\nprotocols that fully and seamless incorporate AI-based techniques into their\ndesign. In this paper, we provide a self-contained tutorial on various AI and\nmachine-learning techniques that have been, or can be, used for developing\ncognitive routing protocols. We also survey the application of various classes\nof AI techniques to CRNs in general, and to the problem of routing in\nparticular. We discuss various decision making techniques and learning\ntechniques from AI and document their current and potential applications to the\nproblem of routing in CRNs. We also highlight the various inference, reasoning,\nmodeling, and learning sub tasks that a cognitive routing protocol must solve.\nFinally, open research issues and future directions of work are identified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Aug 2013 09:34:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Qadir", "Junaid", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0186", "submitter": "K.

This connection allows us to\nanalytically demonstrate that predictive scheduling necessarily improves system\ndelay performance and can drive it to zero with increasing prediction power. We\nthen propose the \\textsf{Predictive Backpressure (PBP)} algorithm for achieving\noptimal utility performance in such predictive systems. \\textsf{PBP}\nefficiently incorporates prediction into stochastic system control and avoids\nthe great complication due to the exponential state space growth in the\nprediction window size. We show that \\textsf{PBP} can achieve a utility\nperformance that is within $O(\\epsilon)$ of the optimal, for any $\\epsilon>0$,\nwhile guaranteeing that the system delay distribution is a\n\\emph{shifted-to-the-left} version of that under the original Backpressure\nalgorithm. Hence, the average packet delay under \\textsf{PBP} is strictly\nbetter than that under Backpressure, and vanishes with increasing prediction\nwindow size. This implies that the resulting utility-delay tradeoff with\npredictive scheduling beats the known optimal $[O(\\epsilon),\nO(\\log(1/\\epsilon))]$ tradeoff for systems without prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 17:17:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Longbo", ""], ["Zhang", "Shaoquan", ""], ["Chen", "Minghua", ""], ["Liu", "Xin", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.1184", "submitter": "Puneet Kumar MONGIA", "authors": "Puneet Kumar Mongia and B.

No provable security or\nperformance guarantees can ever be provided.\n  We develop a system-theoretic approach to security that provides a complete\nprotocol suite with provable guarantees, as well as proof of min-max optimality\nwith respect to any given utility function of source-destination rates. Our\napproach is based on a model capturing the essential features of an adhoc\nwireless network that has been infiltrated with hostile nodes. We consider any\ncollection of nodes, some good and some bad, possessing specified capabilities\nvis-a-vis cryptography, wireless communication and clocks. The good nodes do\nnot know the bad nodes. The bad nodes can collaborate perfectly, and are\ncapable of any disruptive acts ranging from simply jamming to non-cooperation\nwith the protocols in any manner they please.\n  The protocol suite caters to the complete life-cycle, all the way from birth\nof nodes, through all phases of ad hoc network formation, leading to an\noptimized network carrying data reliably. It provably achieves the min-max of\nthe utility function, where the max is over all protocol suites published and\nfollowed by the good nodes, while the min is over all Byzantine behaviors of\nthe bad nodes. Under the protocol suite, the bad nodes do not benefit from any\nactions other than jamming or cooperating.\n  This approach supersedes much previous work that deals with several types of\nattacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2013 17:47:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ponniah", "Jonathan", ""], ["Hu", "Yih-Chun", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

By\n\"throughput optimality\" it is meant that if there exists a policy that fulfils\na set of clients with a given vector of delivery ratios and a vector of channel\nreliabilities, then the MDF policy will also fulfill them. The debt of a user\nis the difference between the number of packets that should have been delivered\nso as to meet the delivery ratio and the number of packets that have been\ndelivered for that client.

The downlink\nMulti-User Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MU-MIMO) technique, supported by the\nlatest IEEE amendment-802.11ac, is considered as one of the key enhancements\nleading WLANs to the Gigabit era. However, as cloud uploading services,\nPeer-to-Peer (P2P) and telepresence applications get popular, the need for a\nhigher uplink capacity becomes inevitable.\n  In this paper, a unified down/up-link Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol\ncalled Uni-MUMAC is proposed to enhance the performance of IEEE 802.11ac WLANs\nby exploring the multi-user spatial multiplexing technique. Specifically, in\nthe downlink, we implement an IEEE 802.11ac-compliant MU-MIMO transmission\nscheme to allow the AP to simultaneously send frames to a group of STAs. In the\nuplink, we extend the traditional one round channel access contention to two\nrounds, which coordinate multiple STAs to transmit frames to the AP\nsimultaneously. 2-nd round Contention Window (CW2nd), a parameter that makes\nthe length of the 2-nd contention round elastic according to the traffic\ncondition, is introduced. Uni-MUMAC is evaluated through simulations in\nsaturated and non-saturated conditions when both downlink and uplink traffic\nare present in the system. We also propose an analytic saturation model to\nvalidate the simulation results. By properly setting CW2nd and other\nparameters, Uni-MUMAC is compared to a prominent multi-user transmission scheme\nin the literature.

In cellular networks, however, the unreliable wireless channel leads\nto two major problems. Poor channel states degrade video quality and interrupt\nthe playback when a user cannot sufficiently fill its local playout buffer:\nbuffer underruns occur. In contrast to that, good channel conditions cause\ncommon greedy buffering schemes to pile up very long buffers. Such\nover-buffering wastes expensive wireless channel capacity.\n  To keep buffering in balance, we employ a novel approach. Assuming that we\ncan predict data rates, we plan the quality and download time of the video\nsegments ahead. This anticipatory scheduling avoids buffer underruns by\ndownloading a large number of segments before a channel outage occurs, without\nwasting wireless capacity by excessive buffering.

Therefore, in order to\nachieve the potential gain, it is imperative to cancel these echoes. As these\nhigh power echoes can saturate low noise amplifier (LNA) and also digital\ndomain echo cancellation requires unrealistically high resolution\nanalog-to-digital converter (ADC), the echoes should be cancelled or suppressed\nsufficiently before LNA. In this paper we present a closed-loop echo\ncancellation technique which can be implemented purely in analogue domain. The\nadvantages of our method are multiple-fold: it is robust to phase noise, does\nnot require additional set of antennas, can be applied to wideband signals and\nthe performance is irrelevant to radio frequency (RF) impairments in transmit\nchain. Next, we study a few protocols for STR systems in carrier sense multiple\naccess (CSMA) network and investigate MAC level throughput with realistic\nassumptions in both single cell and multiple cells. We show that STR can reduce\nhidden node problem in CSMA network and produce gains of up to 279% in maximum\nthroughput in such networks. Finally, we investigate the application of STR in\ncellular systems and study two new unique interferences introduced to the\nsystem due to STR, namely BS-BS interference and UE-UE interference. We show\nthat these two new interferences will hugely degrade system performance if not\ntreated appropriately.

Our aim is to\nfind a routing policy that minimizes the regret (the cumulative difference of\nexpected delay) between the path chosen by the policy and the unknown optimal\npath. We formulate the problem as a combinatorial bandit optimization problem\nand consider several scenarios that differ in where routing decisions are made\nand in the information available when making the decisions.
