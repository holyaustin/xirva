Further, measurements are useful across points of view---from end hosts\nto enterprise networks and data centers to the wide area Internet. We observe\nthat many measurements are decoupled from the protocols and applications they\nare designed to illuminate. Worse, current measurement practice often involves\nthe exploitation of side-effects and unintended features of the network, or, in\nother words, the artful piling of hacks atop one another. This state of affairs\nis a direct result of the relative paucity of diagnostic and measurement\ncapabilities built into today's network stack.\n  Given our modern dependence on ubiquitous measurement, we propose\nmeasurability as an explicit low-level goal of current protocol design, and\nargue that measurements should be available to all network protocols throughout\nthe stack. We seek to generalize the idea of measurement within protocols,\ne.g., the way in which TCP relies on measurement to drive its end-to-end\nbehavior. Rhetorically, we pose the question: what if the stack had been built\nwith measurability and diagnostic support in mind?

First, we\ncompare the impact of active and passive OpenFlow network state collection\nmethods on an SDN load-balancing application running at the controller using\nkey performance indicators that we define. We do this comparison through: (i) a\nsimulation of a mathematical model we derive for the SDN load-balancer, and\n(ii) an evaluation of a load-balancing application running on top of single and\ndistributed controllers.

The network is said to be naturally sparse if the number of\nnonempty-queue transmitters in a given frame is much smaller than the number of\nusers, which is the case when the arrival rates to the queues are very small\nand the number of users is large. If the network is not naturally sparse, we\ndesign the user requests to be sparse such that only few requests are sent to\nthe destination.

We propose an approximate formulation to simplify the problem and\nobtain a closed-form expression for the assigned time durations to the nodes.\nThe solution of the approximate optimization problem demonstrates that the time\nduration assigned to a node in the set of frame owners is the ratio of the\nsquare-root of the buffer occupancy of that node to the sum of the square-roots\nof each occupancy of all the frame owners. We then investigate the slotted-time\ndata transmission scenario, where the time durations assigned for data\ntransmission are slotted.

The video file meant for each client has been\nfragmented into several packets, and the server maintains multiple copies (each\nof different quality) of the same video file. Clients maintain individual\npacket buffers in order to mitigate the effect of uncertainty on video\niterruption.

In this\ncontext, three data-adaptive censoring strategies are introduced to\nconsiderably reduce the computation and communication overhead of decentralized\nrecursive least-squares (D-RLS) solvers. The first relies on alternating\nminimization and the stochastic Newton iteration to minimize a network-wide\ncost, which discards observations with small innovations. In the resultant\nalgorithm, each node performs local data-adaptive censoring to reduce\ncomputations, while exchanging its local estimate with neighbors so as to\nconsent on a network-wide solution. The communication cost is further reduced\nby the second strategy, which prevents a node from transmitting its local\nestimate to neighbors when the innovation it induces to incoming data is\nminimal. In the third strategy, not only transmitting, but also receiving\nestimates from neighbors is prohibited when data-adaptive censoring is in\neffect. For all strategies, a simple criterion is provided for selecting the\nthreshold of innovation to reach a prescribed average data reduction. The novel\ncensoring-based (C)D-RLS algorithms are proved convergent to the optimal\nargument in the mean-square deviation sense.

Due to the combinatorial nature of the network-wide UE-SN\nmatching, the problem is decomposed into a dynamic clustering problem in which\nSCBSs are grouped into disjoint clusters based on mutual interference.\nSubsequently, an UE-SN matching game is carried out per cluster. The game under\nconsideration is shown to belong to a class of matching games with\nexternalities arising from interference and peer effects due to users social\ndistance, enabling UEs and SNs to interact with one another until reaching a\nstable matching.
