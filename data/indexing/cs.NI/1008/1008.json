In\nparticular, the receivers in many wireless networks need to estimate the\nchannel gains by means of a training sequence. This paper studies the scaling\nlaw (on the network size) of the overhead for channel gain monitoring in\nwireless network. We first investigate the scenario in which a receiver needs\nto track the channel gains with respect to multiple transmitters. To be\nconcrete, suppose that there are n transmitters, and that in the current round\nof channel-gain estimation, no more than k channels suffer significant\nvariations since the last round. We proves that \"\\Theta(k\\log((n+1)/k)) time\nslots\" is the minimum number of time slots needed to catch up with the k varied\nchannels. At the same time, we propose a novel channel-gain monitoring scheme\nnamed ADMOT to achieve the overhead lower-bound. ADMOT leverages recent\nadvances in compressive sensing in signal processing and interference\nprocessing in wireless communication, to enable the receiver to estimate all n\nchannels in a reliable and computationally efficient manner within\nO(k\\log((n+1)/k)) time slots. To our best knowledge, all previous\nchannel-tracking schemes require \\Theta(n) time slots regardless of k.

These challenges equally face both providers and consumers of\ncloud services. The issue becomes even more challenging in virtualized\nenvironments that support mobile clouds. Cloud computing platforms such as\nAmazon EC2 provide customers with flexible, on demand resources at low cost.\nHowever, they fail to provide seamless infrastructure management and monitoring\ncapabilities that many customers may need. For instance, Amazon EC2 doesn't\nfully support cloud services automated discovery and it requires a private set\nof authentication credentials. Salesforce.com, on the other hand, do not\nprovide monitoring access to their underlying systems. Moreover, these systems\nfail to provide infrastructure monitoring of heterogenous and legacy systems\nthat don't support agents. In this work, we explore how to build a cloud\nmanagement system that combines heterogeneous management of virtual resources\nwith comprehensive management of physical devices. We propose an initial\nprototype for automated cloud management and monitoring framework. Our ultimate\ngoal is to develop a framework that have the capability of automatically\ntracking configuration and relationships while providing full event management,\nmeasuring performance and testing thresholds, and measuring availability\nconsistently. Armed with such a framework, operators can make better decisions\nquickly and more efficiently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Aug 2010 03:35:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmat", "Kamal A.", ""], ["Gobjuka", "Hassan", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.4904", "submitter": "Saeed Moghaddam", "authors": "Saeed Moghaddam, Ahmed Helmy", "title": "Spatio-Temporal Modeling of Wireless Users Internet Access Patterns\n  Using Self-Organizing Maps", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  User online behavior and interests will play a central role in future mobile\nnetworks.

First, the error-correcting capabilities of\nintra-session network coding make our scheme resilient to loss. Second,\nredundancy allows intermediate nodes to operate without knowledge of the\ndecoding buffers of their neighbors. Based only on the knowledge of the loss\nrates on the direct and overhearing links, intermediate nodes can make\ndecisions for both intra-session (i.e., how much redundancy to add in each\nflow) and inter-session (i.e., what percentage of flows to code together)\ncoding. Our approach is grounded on a network utility maximization (NUM)\nformulation of the problem. We propose two practical schemes, I2NC-state and\nI2NC-stateless, which mimic the structure of the NUM optimal solution. We also\naddress the interaction of our approach with the transport layer.

The problem is critical for\nsupporting high-quality video streaming in P2P systems, and is challenging due\nto its combinatorial nature. In this paper, we address this problem by\nproviding the first distributed solution that achieves near-optimal broadcast\nrate under arbitrary node degree bounds, and over arbitrary overlay graph. It\nruns on individual nodes and utilizes only the measurement from their one-hop\nneighbors, making the solution easy to implement and adaptable to peer churn\nand network dynamics. Our solution consists of two distributed algorithms\nproposed in this paper that can be of independent interests: a network-coding\nbased broadcasting algorithm that optimizes the broadcast rate given a\ntopology, and a Markov-chain guided topology hopping algorithm that optimizes\nthe topology. Our distributed broadcasting algorithm achieves the optimal\nbroadcast rate over arbitrary P2P topology, while previously proposed\ndistributed algorithms obtain optimality only for P2P complete graphs.
