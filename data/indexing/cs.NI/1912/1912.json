Since forwarding bandwidth-hungry elephant flows (EFs) and\ndelay-sensitive mice flows (MFs) on the same path can cause severe performance\ndegradation, the LightFDG optically grooms flows of each class into\nrack-to-rack (R2R) flows. Then, R2R-MF and R2R-EF flows are separately\nforwarded over lightpaths of separate MF and EF virtual topologies,\nrespectively. Lightpaths are provisioned by jointly determining the capacity\nand route based on flows' arrival rate, size, and completion time request. To\nprevent EFs from congesting the MF lightpaths, high speed and accurate\nflow-detection mechanisms are also necessary for classifying EFs as soon as\npossible. Therefore, a fast-lightweight-and-accurate flow detection framework\nis developed by leveraging the transmission control protocol (TCP) behaviors.\nThe proposed FD scheme has the flexibility of being implemented as in-network\nor centralized to classify flows of modifiable and unmodifiable hosts,\nrespectively. Since the centralized scheme incurs considerable overhead, the\nprocessing and communication overhead is also mitigated by proposed techniques.\nNumerical results show that LightFDG outperforms traditional load balancers by\nabout 3x for EFs and 10x for MFs. Along with the developed overhead mitigation\nmethods, the centralized scheme is shown to provide up to 62x lower overhead\nwith 100% accuracy and with about 224x higher detection speeds than the\nexisting centralized solutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Dec 2019 17:25:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["AlGhadhban", "Amer", ""], ["Celik", "Abdulkadir", ""], ["Shihada", "Basem", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.05590", "submitter": "Hang Guo", "authors": "Hang Guo, Xun Fan, Anh Cao, Geoff Outhred, John Heidemann", "title": "Peek Inside the Closed World: Evaluating Autoencoder-Based Detection of\n  DDoS to Cloud", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Machine-learning-based anomaly detection (ML-based AD) has been successful at\ndetecting DDoS events in the lab. However published evaluations of ML-based AD\nhave used only limited data and provided minimal insight into why it works. To\naddress limited evaluation against real-world data, we apply autoencoder, an\nexisting ML-AD model, to 57 DDoS attack events captured at 5 cloud IPs from a\nmajor cloud provider. We show that our models detect nearly all malicious flows\nfor 2 of the 4 cloud IPs under attack (at least 99.99%) and detect most\nmalicious flows (94.75% and 91.37%) for the remaining 2 IPs. Our models also\nmaintain near-zero false positives on benign flows to all 5 IPs. Our primary\ncontribution is to improve our understanding for why ML-based AD works on some\nmalicious flows but not others. We interpret our detection results with feature\nattribution and counterfactual explanation. We show that our models are better\nat detecting malicious flows with anomalies on allow-listed features (those\nwith only a few benign values) than flows with anomalies on deny-listed\nfeatures (those with mostly benign values) because our models are more likely\nto learn correct normality for allow-listed features. We then show that our\nmodels are better at detecting malicious flows with anomalies on unordered\nfeatures (that have no ordering among their values) than flows with anomalies\non ordered features because even with incomplete normality, our models could\nstill detect anomalies on unordered feature with high recall.

For instance, Stealthy Link Flooding Attack (SLFA) is a variant of\nDDoS attacks that strives to block access to a target area by flooding a small\nset of links, and it is shown that it can bypass traditional DDoS defense\nmechanisms. One potential solution to tackle such SLFAs is to apply Moving\nTarget Defense (MTD) techniques in which network settings are dynamically\nchanged to confuse/deceive attackers, thus making it highly expensive to launch\na successful attack.

The nodes part of FCS based on cross layered multi-metrics\nand fuzzy decision logic determines its priority level to compute Dynamic\nHolding Delay (DHD) for effective timer coordination. The differentiated back\noff implementation along with DHD enables the higher priority candidate that\nhad received data packet to forward the packet first and facilitates others to\ncancel its timer upon overhearing. The sender node switches to unicast mode for\nsuccessive transmissions to achieve energy efficiency till link-level\ntransmission error occur. Opportunistic mode is used as the first and last\nresort to increase the transmission reliability. Simulation results in NS2 show\nsignificant increase in Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), decrease in both average\nenergy consumption per node and Normalized Energy Consumption (NEC) per packet\nin comparison with existing protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Dec 2019 14:51:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Thyagarajan", "Jayavignesh", ""], ["K", "Suganthi", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.10531", "submitter": "Evgeniya Khasina", "authors": "Evgeniya Khasina", "title": "The CoCo-Beholder: Enabling Comprehensive Evaluation of Congestion\n  Control Algorithms", "comments": "Master's Thesis.

This thesis\naddresses those limitations and presents CoCo-Beholder, a human-friendly\nemulator providing the popular dumbbell topology of any size, each link of\nwhich may have individual rate, delay, and queue size. The central link of the\ntopology may also have a variable delay with optional jitter. Flows of\ndifferent schemes may run between the halves of the topology at once, and for\neach flow, the direction and starting time can be chosen. CoCo-Beholder's\nreliability is ensured by testing schemes in the dumbbell topology of size one\nand comparing the results against those of Pantheon emulator. With\nCoCo-Beholder, the thesis successfully reproduces experiments from a recent\npaper that evaluated the fairness and RTT-fairness of schemes using a real\nhardware dumbbell testbed.

This article brings out the substantive parts of the challenges and\nsolution approaches that were identified in the cyber resilience theme. In this\narticle, we put forward the substantial challenges in cyber resilience in a few\nrepresentative application domains and outline foundational solutions to\naddress these challenges. These solutions fall into two broad themes:\nresilience-by-design and resilience-by-reaction. We use examples of autonomous\nsystems as the application drivers motivating cyber resilience. We focus on\nsome autonomous systems in the near horizon (autonomous ground and aerial\nvehicles) and also a little more distant (autonomous rescue and relief).\n  For resilience-by-design, we focus on design methods in software that are\nneeded for our cyber systems to be resilient. In contrast, for\nresilience-by-reaction, we discuss how to make systems resilient by responding,\nreconfiguring, or recovering at runtime when failures happen.

In this\npaper, we consider a WPCN where two collaborating wireless devices (WDs) first\nharvest wireless energy from a hybrid access point (HAP) and then transmit\ntheir information to the HAP. The WD with the stronger WD-to-HAP channel helps\nrelay the message of the other weaker user. In particular, we exploit the use\nof ambient backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase,\nwhere the weaker user backscatters the received energy signal to transmit its\ninformation to the relay user in a passive manner. By doing so, the relay user\ncan reuse the energy signal for simultaneous energy harvesting and information\ndecoding (e.g., using an energy detector). Compared to active information\ntransmission in conventional WPCNs, the proposed method effectively saves the\nenergy and time consumed by the weaker user on information transmission during\ncooperation. With the proposed backscatter-assisted relaying scheme, we jointly\noptimize the time and power allocations on wireless energy and information\ntransmissions to maximize the common throughput. Specifically, we derive the\nsemi-closed-form expressions of the optimal solution and propose a\nlow-complexity optimal algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem.

Although beamforming can be\ndone in the digital and analog domains, both approaches are hindered by several\nconstraints when it comes to mmWave communications. For example, performing\nfully digital beamforming in mmWave systems involves using many radio frequency\n(RF) chains, which are expensive and consume high power. This necessitates\nfinding more efficient ways for using fewer RF chains while taking advantage of\nthe large antenna arrays. One way to overcome this challenge is to employ\n(partially or fully) analog beamforming through proper configuration of\nphase-shifters.

In this paper, we\npropose a beam design technique that reduces the search time and does not\nrequire CSI while guaranteeing a minimum beamforming gain. The key idea derives\nfrom observations drawn from real-life measurements. It was observed that for a\ngiven propagation environment (e.g., coverage area of a mmWave BS) the\nazimuthal angles of dominant signals could be more probable from certain angles\nthan others.

This is because the classifiers trained on the\nKDDCup99 dataset exhibited a bias towards the redundancies within it, allowing\nthem to achieve higher accuracies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 07:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sapre", "Suchet", ""], ["Ahmadi", "Pouyan", ""], ["Islam", "Khondkar", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13371", "submitter": "Pamela Zave", "authors": "Pamela Zave and Jennifer Rexford", "title": "Patterns and Interactions in Network Security", "comments": "63 pages, 28 figures, 56 references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Networks play a central role in cyber-security: networks deliver security\nattacks, suffer from them, defend against them, and sometimes even cause them.\nThis article is a concise tutorial on the large subject of networks and\nsecurity, written for all those interested in networking, whether their\nspecialty is security or not. To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and\norganization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, although\nmechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they are all instances\nof a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic classification of security\nattacks, the main sections of the tutorial cover the four patterns for\nproviding network security, of which the familiar three are cryptographic\nprotocols, packet filtering, and dynamic resource allocation. Although\ncryptographic protocols hide the data contents of packets, they cannot hide\npacket headers. When users need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which\nmay include the network from which they are receiving service, they must resort\nto the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective comes\nfrom the observation that security mechanisms interact in important ways, with\neach other and with other aspects of networking, so each pattern includes a\ndiscussion of its interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:00:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Jun 2020 16:11:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zave", "Pamela", ""], ["Rexford", "Jennifer", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.13379", "submitter": "Maede Zolanvari", "authors": "Maede Zolanvari, Raj Jain, Tara Salman", "title": "Potential Data Link Candidates for Civilian Unmanned Aircraft Systems: A\n  Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "in IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials, vol. 22, no. 1, pp.\n  292-319, Firstquarter 2020", "doi": "10.1109/COMST.2019.2960366", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This survey studies the potential data link candidates for unmanned aircraft\nvehicles (UAVs).

The contribution of this survey is to\nhighlight the strength and weakness of the current data link options and their\nsuitability to satisfy the UAVs communication requirements. Satellite links,\ncellular technologies, Wi-Fi and several similar wireless technologies are\nstudied thoroughly in this paper.

We\ndetermine the age-optimal policies for the update request times at the receiver\nand the update processing times at the transmitter subject to a minimum\nrequired quality (maximum allowed distortion) constraint on the updates.
