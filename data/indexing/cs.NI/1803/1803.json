First, unlike\ntraditional TV broadcasts, content is now streamed over the Internet enabling\nit to reach a wider audience. Second, due to various user-generated content\nplatforms it has become possible for anyone to get involved, streaming their\nown content to the world. This emerging trend of going live usually happens via\nsocial platforms, where users perform live social broadcasts predominantly from\ntheir mobile devices, allowing their friends (and the general public) to engage\nwith the stream in real-time. With the growing popularity of such platforms,\nthe burden on the current Internet infrastructure is therefore expected to\nmultiply. With this in mind, we explore one such prominent platform - Facebook\nLive. We gather 3TB of data, representing one month of global activity and\nexplore the characteristics of live social broadcast. From this, we derive\nsimple yet effective principles which can decrease the network burden. We then\ndissect global and hyper-local properties of the video while on-air, by\ncapturing the geography of the broadcasters or the users who produce the video\nand the viewers or the users who interact with it. Finally, we study the social\nengagement while the video is live and distinguish the key aspects when the\nsame video goes on-demand. A common theme throughout the paper is that, despite\nits name, many attributes of Facebook Live deviate from both the concepts of\nlive and broadcast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 18:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Raman", "Aravindh", ""], ["Tyson", "Gareth", ""], ["Sastry", "Nishanth", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.02816", "submitter": "Saad Saleh", "authors": "Saad Saleh, Junaid Qadir, Muhammad U.

Many existing studies on cache-enabled DSCNs attempt to\nimprove user experience by optimizing end-to-end file delivery delay. However,\nunder practical scenarios where files (e.g., video files) have diverse quality\nof service requirements, energy consumption at SBSs should also be concerned\nfrom the network perspective. In this paper,we attempt to optimize these two\ncritical metrics in cache-enabled DSCNs. Firstly, we formulate the energy-delay\noptimization problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem, where file\nplacement, user association and power control are jointly considered. To model\nthe tradeoff relationship between energy consumption and end-to-end file\ndelivery delay, a utility function linearly combining these two metrics is used\nas an objective function of the optimization problem. Then, we solve the\nproblem in two stages, i.e. caching stage and delivery stage, based on the\nobservation that caching is performed during off-peak time. At the caching\nstage, a local popular file placement policy is proposed by estimating user\npreference at each SBS. At the delivery stage, with given caching status at\nSBSs, the MIP problem is further decomposed by Benders' decomposition method.\nAn efficient algorithm is proposed to approach the optimal association and\npower solution by iteratively shrinking the gap of the upper and lower bounds.\nFinally, extension simulations are performed to validate our analytical and\nalgorithmic work.

These algorithms based on coloring are\nnot optimal when links are not activated with the same rate. Soft coloring,\nintroduced in this paper, solves this problem and provide optimal solution for\nany requested link usage rate. To define the game model for optimum scheduling,\nfirst all possible components of the graph are identified. Components are\ndefined as sets of the wireless links can be activated simultaneously without\nsuffering from mutual interference. Then by switching between components with\nappropriate frequencies (usage rate) optimum scheduling is achieved. We call\nthis kind of scheduling as soft coloring because any links can be member of\nmore than one partial topology, in different time segments. To simplify this\nproblem, we model relationship between link rates and components selection\nfrequencies by a matrix game which provides a simple and helpful tool to\nsimplify and solve the problem.

Recently, the research community has\nshowed an increased tendency to benefit from the recent advancements in the\nartificial intelligence (AI) field to provide learning abilities and better\ndecision making in SDN. In this study, we provide a detailed overview of the\nrecent efforts to include AI in SDN. Our study showed that the research efforts\nfocused on three main sub-fields of AI namely: machine learning,\nmeta-heuristics and fuzzy inference systems. Accordingly, in this work we\ninvestigate their different application areas and potential use, as well as the\nimprovements achieved by including AI-based techniques in the SDN paradigm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 07:05:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2018 12:16:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2018 17:00:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Latah", "Majd", ""], ["Toker", "Levent", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.06854", "submitter": "Sebastian Meiling", "authors": "Sebastian Meiling, Dorothea Purnomo, Julia-Ann Shiraishi, Michael\n  Fischer, and Thomas C.

These challenges range from climate change,\npollution, transportation, and citizen engagement, to urban planning, and\nsecurity threats. The primary goal of a Smart City is to counteract these\nproblems and mitigate their effects by means of modern ICT to improve urban\nadministration and infrastructure. Key ideas are to utilise network\ncommunication to inter-connect public authorities; but also to deploy and\nintegrate numerous sensors and actuators throughout the city infrastructure -\nwhich is also widely known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

As\na result, the number of devices accessing the Internet through WLANs such as\nlaptops, smartphones, or wearables, is increasing drastically at the same time\nthat applications' throughput requirements do. To cope with these challenges,\nchannel bonding (CB) techniques are used for enabling higher data rates by\ntransmitting in wider channels, thus increasing spectrum efficiency. However,\nimportant issues like higher potential co-channel and adjacent channel\ninterference arise when bonding channels. This may harm the performance of the\ncarrier sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol because of recurrent backoff\nfreezing while making nodes more sensitive to hidden node effects.

First, we highlight key aspects of DCB in toy scenarios through a\ncontinuous time Markov network (CTMN) model. Then, by means of extensive\nsimulations covering a wide range of traffic loads and access point (AP)\ndensities, we show that dynamic channel bonding (DCB) - which adapts the\nchannel bandwidth on a per-packet transmission - significantly outperforms\ntraditional single-channel on average. Nevertheless, results also corroborate\nthat DCB is more prone to generate unfair situations where WLANs may starve.\nContrary to most of the current thoughts pushing towards non-overlapping\nchannels in HD deployments, we highlight the benefits of allocating channels as\nwider as possible to WLANs altogether with implementing adaptive access\npolicies to cope with the unfairness situations that may appear.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2018 13:49:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2018 14:37:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 00:21:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Barrachina-Mu\u00f1oz", "Sergio", ""], ["Wilhelmi", "Francesc", ""], ["Bellalta", "Boris", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.09145", "submitter": "Qizhen Li", "authors": "Qizhen Li, Jie Gao, Jinming Wen, Xiaohu Tang, Lian Zhao, and Limin Sun", "title": "SMDP-based Downlink Packet Scheduling Scheme for Solar Energy Assisted\n  Heterogeneous Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Renewable energy assisted heterogeneous networks can improve system capacity\nand reduce conventional energy consumption.
