However, ensuring UAV\ncommunication and networking for the purpose of a specific application is still\nchallenging. Indeed, due to the mobility of a UAV in a vast area, permanent\nconnectivity over the back-haul is very sporadic and might be lost. In this\npaper, we consider an aerial mesh network where each UAV can serve as a flying\nbase station to boost terrestrial base station in case of damaged\ninfrastructure case for example, or/and provide connectivity for uncovered or\npoorly covered nodes, and behaves as a relay to establish communication between\ntwo components owing to a lack of reliable direct communication link between\nthem. We then detail a case study where a UAV-fleet are used to collect data\nfrom the ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices and forward it to cloud for\nfurther processing passing by a remote gateway.\n  We aim here to build a queueing framework including network layer, MAC layer,\nand physical layer and investigate both uplink and downlink communication\nlinks.

These protocols are very convenient for e.g.\nreal time data transmission. But when the reliability of the transmitted data\nis critical, other protocols termed as connection-oriented, allow for full\ncontrol of the data transmission process, assuring that the received data is an\nexact copy of the transmitted data, e.g. the case of the Transmission Control\nProtocol (TCP). To sustain the increased functionality and features of the\nconnection-oriented protocol, a set of mechanisms is implemented based on some\nspecific fields of the segment header. These mechanisms result in a significant\noverhead in terms of the increased number of transmitted packets. This may\nfurther translate into significant delays, because of the additional number of\nswitching and routing tasks, and eventually, because of more complex\ncommunications procedures, such as e.g. transmission window resizing, and of\ncourse, acknowledgement and sequence numbers updating. The two extremes of\nthese communication modalities, one that has no control at all, and the other\none that allows for full control, have resulted in the creation of an\nintermediate protocol that allows for a limited degree of knowledge on how\nsuccessful a transmission was, and even for an eventual reordering of the\nsegments that arrive out of sequence.

Specifically, the BS is able to\nadaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the downlink transmission to\noptimize the information freshness of the network, characterized by the Age of\nInformation (AoI) metric. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only serve one client\nwithin each time slot and should decide which client to serve; if the BS\nchooses NOMA, it can serve more than one client at the same time and needs to\ndecide the power allocated to the served clients. For the simple two-client\ncase, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and develop the\noptimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for each\ndownlink transmission based on the instantaneous AoI of both clients. The\noptimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious decision\nswitching boundaries. A near-optimal policy with lower computation complexity\nis also devised. For the more general multi-client scenario, inspired by the\nproposed near-optimal policy, we formulate a nonlinear optimization problem to\ndetermine the optimal power allocated to each client by maximizing the expected\nAoI drop of the network in each time slot. We resolve the formulated problem by\napproximating it as a convex optimization problem. We also derive the upper\nbound of the gap between the approximate convex problem and the original\nnonlinear, nonconvex problem. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of\nthe adopted approximation. The performance of the adaptive NOMA/OMA scheme by\nsolving the convex optimization is shown to be close to that of max-weight\npolicy solved by exhaustive search...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:26:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qian", ""], ["Chen", "He", ""], ["Zhao", "Changhong", ""], ["Li", "Yonghui", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""], ["Vucetic", "Branka", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.04125", "submitter": "Peter Hillmann", "authors": "Matthias Schopp, Peter Hillmann", "title": "Agile Approach for IT Forensics Management", "comments": "Journal of Internet Technology and Secured Transactions (JITST) 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.IR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The forensic investigation of cyber attacks and IT incidents is becoming\nincreasingly difficult due to increasing complexity and intensify networking.\nEspecially with Advanced Attacks (AT) like the increasing Advanced Persistent\nThreats an agile approach is indispensable.

This problem is\nconsidered for wireless networks where each communication link has a minimum\nbandwidth quality-of-service (QoS) requirement. Links in the same vicinity\ncontend for the shared wireless medium. The conflict graph captures which pairs\nof links interfere with each other and depends on the MAC protocol. In IEEE\n802.11 MAC protocol-based networks, when communication between nodes $i$ and\n$j$ takes place, the neighbors of both $i$ and $j$ remain silent. This model of\ninterference is called the $2$-hop interference model because the distance in\nthe network graph between any two links that can be simultaneously active is at\nleast $2$. In the admission control problem, the objective is to determine,\nusing only localized information, whether a given set of flow rates is\nfeasible.\n  In the present work, a distributed algorithm is proposed for this problem,\nwhere each node has information only about its $1$-hop neighborhood.

Since this problem belongs to the class of\nnon-linear integer programming problems, to solve it efficiently, we present a\nmodified Viterbi algorithm (MVA) based on multi-stage graph modeling and a\nmodified Dijkstra's algorithm. We simulate this algorithm for a number of\nnetwork scenarios with different fractions of NFV and SDN nodes, and evaluate\nhow much energy can be saved through such transition. Simulation results\nconfirm the expected performance of the algorithm which saves up to 70% energy\ncompared to network where all nodes are always on. Interestingly, the amount of\nenergy saved by the proposed algorithm in the case of hybrid NFV and partial\nSDN networks can reach up to 60-90% of the saved energy in full NFV/SDN\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2020 22:18:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2020 04:58:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 18 Oct 2020 03:46:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Moosavi", "Reza", ""], ["Parsaeefard", "Saeedeh", ""], ["Maddah-Ali", "Mohammad Ali", ""], ["Shah-Mansouri", "Vahid", ""], ["Khalaj", "Babak Hossein", ""], ["Bennis", "Mehdi", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.13436", "submitter": "Pietro Tedeschi", "authors": "Pietro Boccadoro, Vitanio Daniele, Pietro Di Gennaro, Domenico Lof\\`u,\n  Pietro Tedeschi", "title": "Water Quality Prediction on a Sigfox-compliant IoT Device: The Road\n  Ahead of WaterS", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Water pollution is a critical issue that can affects humans' health and the\nentire ecosystem thus inducing economical and social concerns.

TCP SACK and TCP New Reno, on the other\nhand, tend to continuously increase the sender window size, thus potentially\nallowing higher packet loss and causing undesired delays for the game traffic.\nIn terms of buffer size, we have established that smaller buffers are better\nfor MMORPG applications, while larger buffers contribute to a higher overall\ndelay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:03:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Saldana", "Jose", ""], ["Suznjevic", "Mirko", ""], ["Sequeira", "Luis", ""], ["Fernandez-Navajas", "Julian", ""], ["Matijasevic", "Maja", ""], ["Ruiz-Mas", "Jose", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.16071", "submitter": "Luis Sequeira Dr", "authors": "Jose Saldana, Juan Luis de la Cruz, Luis Sequeira, Julian\n  Fernandez-Navajas, Jose Ruiz-Mas", "title": "Can a Wi-Fi WLAN Support a First Person Shooter?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "NetGames 2015, Zagreb, Croatia, December 3-4, 2015.

Concurrently, an adversary transmits adversarial\nperturbations using its multiple antennas to fool the classifier into\nmisclassifying the received signals. From the adversarial machine learning\nperspective, we show how to utilize multiple antennas at the adversary to\nimprove the adversarial (evasion) attack performance. Two main points are\nconsidered while exploiting the multiple antennas at the adversary, namely the\npower allocation among antennas and the utilization of channel diversity.\nFirst, we show that multiple independent adversaries, each with a single\nantenna cannot improve the attack performance compared to a single adversary\nwith multiple antennas using the same total power. Then, we consider various\nways to allocate power among multiple antennas at a single adversary such as\nallocating power to only one antenna, and proportional or inversely\nproportional to the channel gain. By utilizing channel diversity, we introduce\nan attack to transmit the adversarial perturbation through the channel with the\nlargest channel gain at the symbol level. We show that this attack reduces the\nclassifier accuracy significantly compared to other attacks under different\nchannel conditions in terms of channel variance and channel correlation across\nantennas. Also, we show that the attack success improves significantly as the\nnumber of antennas increases at the adversary that can better utilize channel\ndiversity to craft adversarial attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:56:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Brian", ""], ["Sagduyu", "Yalin E.", ""], ["Erpek", "Tugba", ""], ["Davaslioglu", "Kemal", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""]]}]
