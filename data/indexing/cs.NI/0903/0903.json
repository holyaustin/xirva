Our model applies if the cell radius, $R$, is\nmuch smaller than the carrier sensing range, $R_{cs}$. We argue that, the\ncondition $R_{cs} >> R$ is likely to hold in a dense deployment of Access\nPoints (APs) where, for every client or station (STA), there is an AP very\nclose to the STA such that the STA can associate with the AP at a high physical\nrate. We develop a scalable cell level model for such WLANs with saturated AP\nand STA queues as well as for TCP-controlled long file downloads. The accuracy\nof our model is demonstrated by comparison with ns-2 simulations. We also\ndemonstrate how our analytical model could be applied in conjunction with a\nLearning Automata (LA) algorithm for optimal channel assignment. Based on the\ninsights provided by our analytical model, we propose a simple decentralized\nalgorithm which provides static channel assignments that are Nash equilibria in\npure strategies for the objective of maximizing normalized network throughput.\nOur channel assignment algorithm requires neither any explicit knowledge of the\ntopology nor any message passing, and provides assignments in only as many\nsteps as there are channels. In contrast to prior work, our approach to channel\nassignment is based on the throughput metric.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Mar 2009 02:29:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2009 17:31:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Panda", "Manoj K.", ""], ["Kumar", "Anurag", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0445", "submitter": "Salah A.

Peer-to-peer\nsystems for geographic or multidimensional range queries built on existing DHTs\nsuffer from the inaccuracy in linearization of the multidimensional space.\nOther overlay structures that are based on hierarchical partitioning of the\nsearch space are not scalable because they use special super-peers to represent\nthe nodes in the hierarchy.

These applications include continual\nprocessing on data streams originating from a network of sensors, composing a\nmultimedia stream through embedding several component streams originating from\ndifferent locations, etc. These data-flow computing applications require\nmultiple processing nodes interconnected according to the data-flow topology of\nthe application, for on-stream processing of the data. Since the applications\nusually sustain for a long period, it is important to optimally map the\ncomponent computations and communications on the nodes and links in the\nnetwork, fulfilling the capacity constraints and optimizing some quality metric\nsuch as end-to-end latency. The mapping problem is unfortunately NP-complete\nand heuristics have been previously proposed to compute the approximate\nsolution in a centralized way. However, because of the dynamicity of the\nnetwork, it is practically impossible to aggregate the correct state of the\nwhole network in a single node. In this paper, we present a distributed\nalgorithm for optimal mapping of the components of the data flow applications.\nWe propose several heuristics to minimize the message complexity of the\nalgorithm while maintaining the quality of the solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 16:32:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Asaduzzaman", "Shah", ""], ["Maheswaran", "Muthucumaru", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4959", "submitter": "Ioannis Koukoutsidis", "authors": "Ioannis Koukoutsidis", "title": "TCP over 3G links: Problems and Solutions", "comments": "A review paper prepared unofficially for the Institute of Informatics\n  and Telecommunications of NCSR Demokritos, in November 2005 (13 pages, 3\n  figures)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This review paper presents analytical information regarding the transfer of\nTCP data flows on paths towards interconnected wireless systems, with emphasis\non 3G cellular networks.

Geometrical greedy routing has been\namong the simplest and most common online routing schemes. A perfect\ngeometrical routing scheme is expected to deliver each packet to the point in\nthe network that is closest to the packet destination. However greedy routing\nfails to guarantee such delivery as the greedy forwarding decision sometimes\nleads the packets to localized minimums. This article investigates the\nnecessary and sufficient properties of the greedy supporting graphs that\nprovide the guaranteed delivery of packets when acting as a routing substrate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2009 12:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ghaffari", "M.", ""], ["Hariri", "B.", ""], ["Shirmohammadi", "S.", ""]]}]
