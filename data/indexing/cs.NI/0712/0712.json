A user chooses one channel to\nsense and access in each slot and collects a reward determined by the state of\nthe chosen channel. The problem is to design a sensing policy for channel\nselection to maximize the average reward, which can be formulated as a\nmulti-arm restless bandit process. In this paper, we study the structure,\noptimality, and performance of the myopic sensing policy. We show that the\nmyopic sensing policy has a simple robust structure that reduces channel\nselection to a round-robin procedure and obviates the need for knowing the\nchannel transition probabilities. The optimality of this simple policy is\nestablished for the two-channel case and conjectured for the general case based\non numerical results. The performance of the myopic sensing policy is analyzed,\nwhich, based on the optimality of myopic sensing, characterizes the maximum\nthroughput of a multi-channel opportunistic communication system and its\nscaling behavior with respect to the number of channels. These results apply to\ncognitive radio networks, opportunistic transmission in fading environments,\nand resource-constrained jamming and anti-jamming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2007 01:10:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 00:02:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 01:53:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Qing", ""], ["Krishnamachari", "Bhaskar", ""], ["Liu", "Keqin", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.1662", "submitter": "Ashutosh Gore", "authors": "N.

BoE beats prior methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.\nWhile the computation procedure of BoE is simple, explaining why it works is by\nno means trivial. Indeed the majority of our investigative efforts have been\ndevoted to the construction of a theory to explain BoE. This paper models an\nideal CSMA network as a set of interacting on-off telegraph processes. In\ndeveloping the theory, we discovered a number of analytical techniques and\nobservations that have eluded prior research, such as that the carrier-sensing\ninteractions among links in an ideal CSMA network result in a system state\nevolution that is time-reversible; and that the probability distribution of the\nsystem state is insensitive to the distributions of the \"on\" and \"off\"\ndurations given their means, and is a Markov random field. We believe these\ntheoretical frameworks are useful not just for explaining BoE, but could also\nbe a foundation for a fundamental understanding of how links in CSMA networks\ninteract.
