In particular, we consider the cloud-cache in the\ncloud processing unit (CPU) as a new layer in the RAN cache hierarchy, bridging\nthe capacity-performance gap between the traditional edge-based and core-based\ncaching schemes. A delay cost model is introduced to characterize and formulate\nthe cache placement optimization problem, which is shown to be NP-complete. As\nsuch, a low complexity, heuristic cache management strategy is proposed,\nconstituting of a proactive cache distribution algorithm and a reactive cache\nreplacement algorithm. Extensive numerical simulations are carried out using\nboth real-world YouTube video requests and synthetic content requests.

However, in a heterogeneous WPT network with\ndistributed ENs and WDs, some WDs may quickly deplete their batteries due to\nthe lack of timely wireless power supply by the ENs, thus resulting in short\nnetwork operating lifetime. In this paper, we exploit frequency diversity in a\nbroadband WPT network and study the distributed charging control by ENs to\nmaximize network lifetime. In particular, we propose a practical voting-based\ndistributed charging control framework where each WD simply estimates the\nbroadband channel, casts its vote(s) for some strong sub-channel(s) and sends\nto the ENs along with its battery state information, based on which the ENs\nindependently allocate their transmit power over the sub-channels without the\nneed of centralized control. Under this framework, we aim to design\nlifetime-maximizing power allocation and efficient voting-based feedback\nmethods. Towards this end, we first derive the general expression of the\nexpected lifetime of a WPT network and draw the general design principles for\nlifetime-maximizing charging control. Based on the analysis, we then propose a\ndistributed charging control protocol with voting-based feedback, where the\npower allocated to sub-channels at each EN is a function of the weighted sum\nvote received from all WDs. Besides, the number of votes cast by a WD and the\nweight of each vote are related to its current battery state. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed distributed charging control protocol could\nsignificantly increase the network lifetime under stringent transmit power\nconstraint in a broadband WPT network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 02:44:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bi", "Suzhi", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04579", "submitter": "Ralph Holz", "authors": "Dario Banfi and Olivier Mehani and Guillaume Jourjon and Lukas\n  Schwaighofer and Ralph Holz", "title": "Endpoint-transparent Multipath Transport with Software-defined Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multipath forwarding consists of using multiple paths simultaneously to\ntransport data over the network.

To achieve higher\nsystem efficiency, massive antenna deployment with tight coordination is one\npotential strategy for designing 5G systems, but has two types of associated\nsystem overhead. First is the synchronization overhead, which can be reduced by\nimplementing a cloud radio access network (CRAN)-based architecture design,\nthat separates the baseband processing and radio access functionality to\nachieve better system synchronization. Second is the overhead for acquiring\nchannel state information (CSI) of the users present in the system, which,\nhowever, increases tremendously when instantaneous CSI is used to serve\nhigh-mobility users. To serve a large number of users, a CRAN system with a\ndense deployment of remote radio heads (RRHs) is considered, such that each\nuser has a line-of-sight (LOS) link with the corresponding RRH. Since, the\ntrajectory of movement for high-mobility users is predictable; therefore,\nfairly accurate position estimates for those users can be obtained, and can be\nused for resource allocation to serve the considered users.

To obtain enough spectrum resources\nto meet its customer demands, the virtual operator can either sense for the\ntemporarily unused spectrum in a licensed band, or lease spectrum from a\nspectrum owner. Sensing is usually cheaper than leasing, but the amount of\navailable spectrum obtained by sensing is uncertain due to the primary users'\nactivities in the licensed band. Previous studies on spectrum investment\nproblems mainly considered the expected profit maximization problem of a\nrisk-neutral operator based on the expected utility theory (EUT). In reality,\nhowever, an operator's decision is influenced by not only the consideration of\nexpected profit maximization, but also the level of its risk preference. To\ncapture this tradeoff between these two considerations, we analyze the\noperator's optimal decision problem using the prospect theory from behavioral\neconomics, which includes EUT as a special case. The sensing and leasing\noptimal problem under prospect theory is non-convex and challenging to solve.\nNevertheless, by exploiting the unimodal structure of the problem, we are able\nto compute the unique global optimal solution. We show that comparing to an EUT\noperator, both the risk-averse and risk-seeking operator achieve a smaller\nexpected profit. On the other hand, a risk-averse operator can guarantee a\nlarger minimum possible profit, while a risk-seeking operator can achieve a\nlarger maximum possible profit. Furthermore, the tradeoff between the expected\nprofit and the minimum possible profit for a risk-averse operator is better\nwhen the sensing cost increases, while the tradeoff between the expected profit\nand the maximum possible profit for a risk-seeking operator is better when the\nsensing cost decreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 13:25:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Junlin", ""], ["Cheung", "Man Hon", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08261", "submitter": "Pradipta Ghosh", "authors": "Pradipta Ghosh and Bhaskar Krishnamachari", "title": "Interference Power Bound Analysis of a Network of Wireless Robots", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a fundamental problem concerning the deployment of a wireless\nrobotic network: to fulfill various end-to-end performance requirements, a\n\"sufficient\" number of robotic relays must be deployed to ensure that links are\nof acceptable quality.

This paper presents WNetKAT, the first network programming language\naccounting for the fact that networks are inherently weighted, and\ncommunications subject to capacity constraints (e.g., in terms of bandwidth)\nand costs (e.g., latency or monetary costs). WNetKAT is based on a syntactic\nand semantic extension of the NetKAT algebra.

These applications do not only\napply to classic, splittable and unsplittable (s; t)-flows, but also generalize\nto more complex network functions and service chains. For example, WNetKAT\nallows to model flows which need to traverse certain waypoint functions, which\nmay change the traffic rate. This paper also shows the relation between the\nequivalence problem of WNetKAT and the equivalence problem of the weighted\nfinite automata, which implies undecidability of the former.

Indeed, while the traditional approach aims at\nproviding full (100\\%) protection against network failures through disjoint\npaths, it was realized that this requirement is too restrictive in practice.\nTunable survivability provides a quantitative measure for specifying the\ndesired level (0\\%-100\\%) of survivability and offers flexibility in the choice\nof the routing paths.
