First of all,\nthey have a large number of heterogeneous components. Secondly, their\nconnectivity is extremely dynamic. Nodes can come and go, links can be removed\nand added over time. Traditional modeling and simulation techniques amalgamate\nor ignore such dynamics and therefore, are unable to represent them. Complex\ncommunication networks are therefore better modeled as mathematical structures\ncalled graphs. Modeling as graphs allows for the application of complex\ntechniques such as various network based analysis techniques. While this is a\nvery important and much needed skill for communication networks researchers and\nengineers, to the best of our knowledge, currently there is no resource\ndescribing these details. In this paper, we give a concise but comprehensive\nreview of modeling complex communication networks as graphs.

This research is mainly\nfocused on the study of the threats, attacks and reasons for malicious behavior\nof nodes in the network for reactive routing protocols in MANETS. DSR and AODV\nare the two reactive routing protocols that were considered for the study to\npropose a second chance strategy to be given to the nodes considering the\nreason for malicious behavior to improve the packet delivery ratio and reduce\nthe routing overhead in the network. A simulative study has been conducted\nusing Ad hoc Simulator (ASIM) considering the DSR and AODV routing protocols in\nthe presence of malicious nodes and in the absence of malicious nodes which\nshowed that the packet delivery ratio is low and routing overhead is high in\nthe absence of malicious nodes. The second chance strategy proposed considers\nthe reasons for malicious behavior and helps the node to get reintegrated in\nthe network to improve the packet delivery ratio and reduce the routing\noverhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 14:33:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Belgaum", "Mohammad Riyaz", ""], ["Soomro", "Safeeullah", ""], ["Alansari", "Zainab", ""], ["Alam", "Muhammad", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.01664", "submitter": "Jaber Kakar", "authors": "Jaber Kakar, Vuk Marojevic", "title": "Waveform and Spectrum Management for Unmanned Aerial Systems Beyond 2025", "comments": "5 pages, PIMRC 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The application domains of civilian unmanned aerial systems (UASs) include\nagriculture, exploration, transportation, and entertainment.

One effective approach to this end is network\nvirtualization, whereby each service is mapped to a virtual subnetwork\nproviding dedicated on-demand support to network users. In practice, each\nservice consists of a prespecified sequence of functions, called a service\nfunction chain (SFC), while each service function in a SFC can only be provided\nby some given network nodes.
