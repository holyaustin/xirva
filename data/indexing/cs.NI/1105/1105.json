In this case, the optimal\nstrategy is significantly different, and lacks an elegant characterization.\nHowever, for the special case of the parity function, we show that the greedy\nstrategy is optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2011 08:28:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kowshik", "Hemant", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

With beamforming and linear detection,\nthe MIMO switch controls which stations are connected to which other stations.\nEach beamforming matrix realizes a permutation pattern among the stations. We\nrefer to the corresponding permutation matrix as a switch matrix. By scheduling\na set of different switch matrices, full connectivity among the stations can be\nestablished.

The\nmain motivation is to address the yet poorly understood size variation-induced\neffect on power-aware buffering schemes. Our theoretical analysis elucidates\nthe fundamental differences between the fixed-size and fixed-interval buffering\nschemes in the presence of data size variation. It shows that data size\nvariation has detrimental effects on the power expenditure of the fixed-size\nbuffering in general, and reveals that the size variation induced effects can\nbe either mitigated by a positive skewness or promoted by a negative skewness\nin size distribution. By contrast, the fixed-interval buffering scheme has an\nobvious advantage of being eminently immune to the data-size variation.

A second\nimportant issue is how to integrate channel coding with PNC to achieve reliable\ncommunication.

The framework can effectively\ndeal with symbol and phase asynchronies while incorporating channel coding at\nthe same time. 2) For unchannel-coded PNC, we show that for BPSK and QPSK\nmodulations, our BP method can significantly reduce the asynchrony penalties\ncompared with prior methods. 3) For unchannel-coded PNC, with half symbol\noffset between the transmitters, our BP method can drastically reduce the\nperformance penalty due to phase asynchrony, from more than 6 dB to no more\nthan 1 dB. 4) For channel-coded PNC, with our BP method, both symbol and phase\nasynchronies actually improve the system performance compared with the\nperfectly synchronous case. Furthermore, the performance spread due to\ndifferent combinations of symbol and phase offsets between the transmitters in\nchannel-coded PNC is only around 1 dB.

The advantage of ANC is that\nit is simple to implement; the disadvantage, on the other hand, is that the\nrelay amplifies the noise along with the signal before forwarding the signal.\nPNC systems in which the relay performs XOR or other denoising PNC mappings of\nthe received signal have the potential for significantly better performance.\nHowever, the implementation of such PNC systems poses many challenges. For\nexample, the relay must be able to deal with symbol and carrier-phase\nasynchronies of the simultaneous signals received from the two end nodes, and\nthe relay must perform channel estimation before detecting the signals. We\ninvestigate a PNC implementation in the frequency domain, referred to as FPNC,\nto tackle these challenges. FPNC is based on OFDM. In FPNC, XOR mapping is\nperformed on the OFDM samples in each subcarrier rather than on the samples in\nthe time domain. We implement FPNC on the universal soft radio peripheral\n(USRP) platform.

The proposed cache replacement\nalgorithm outperforms well-known replacement algorithms, and achieves 90% of\nthe optimal performance using only 15% of memory. The throughput of a\npayload-based identification system, L7-filter [1], is increased by up to 5.1\ntimes by using our traffic classifier design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 May 2011 06:23:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Fei", ""], ["Xiang", "Fan", ""], ["Xue", "Yibo", ""], ["Li", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6024", "submitter": "Premkumar Karumbu", "authors": "Premkumar Karumbu, Anurag Kumar", "title": "Optimum Sleep-Wake Scheduling of Sensors for Quickest Event Detection in\n  Small Extent Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, Feb. 01, 2011.

The sensor nodes in the sleep state do\nnot sample or communicate any information to the fusion centre (FC), thereby\nconserving energy. At each time slot, the FC, after having received the samples\nfrom the sensor nodes in the wake state, makes a decision to stop (and thus\ndeclare that the event has occurred) or to continue observing. If it decides to\ncontinue, the FC also makes the decision of choosing the number of sensor nodes\nto be in the wake state in the next time slot. We consider three alternative\napproaches to the problem of choosing the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nwake state in time slot k+1, based on the information available at time slot k,\nnamely, 1. optimal control of M_{k+1}, the number of sensor nodes to be in the\nawake state in time slot k+1, 2. optimal control of q_{k+1}, the probability of\na sensor node to be in the awake state in time slot k+1, and 3. optimal\nprobability q that a sensor node is in the awake state in any time slot. In\neach case, we formulate the problem as a sequential decision process. We show\nthat a sufficient statistic for the decision at time k is the a posteriori\nprobability of change Pi_k. Also, we show that the optimal stopping rule is a\nthreshold rule on Pi_k. The optimal policy for M_{k+1} can keep very few\nsensors wake during the prechange phase and then quickly increase the number of\nsensors in the wake state when a change is \"suspected\". Among the three\nsleep-wake algorithms described, we observe that the total cost is minimum for\nthe optimum control of M_{k+1} and is maximum for the optimum control on q.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 16:09:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Karumbu", "Premkumar", ""], ["Kumar", "Anurag", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6061", "submitter": "Premkumar Karumbu", "authors": "Premkumar Karumbu, Anurag Kumar, Joy Kuri", "title": "Distributed Detection/Isolation Procedures for Quickest Event Detection\n  in Large Extent Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Mar. 10, 2011.\n  Revised on Jul. 17, 2011.

We consider a general sensing model\nin which the effect of the event at a sensor node depends on the distance\nbetween the event and the sensor node; in particular, in the Boolean sensing\nmodel, all sensors in a disk of a given radius around the event are equally\naffected.

We consider two\nprocedures at the fusion center to process the measurements. The Bayesian\nsetting is assumed; i.e., the fusion center has a prior distribution on the\nchange time. In the first procedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion\ncenter is \\emph{network-oblivious} and makes a decision only when a complete\nvector of measurements taken at a sampling instant is available. In the second\nprocedure, the decision algorithm at the fusion center is \\emph{network-aware}\nand processes measurements as they arrive, but in a time causal order. In this\ncase, the decision statistic depends on the network delays as well, whereas in\nthe network-oblivious case, the decision statistic does not depend on the\nnetwork delays. This yields a Bayesian change detection problem with a tradeoff\nbetween the random network delay and the decision delay; a higher sampling rate\nreduces the decision delay but increases the random access delay. Under\nperiodic sampling, in the network--oblivious case, the structure of the optimal\nstopping rule is the same as that without the network, and the optimal change\ndetection delay decouples into the network delay and the optimal decision delay\nwithout the network. In the network--aware case, the optimal stopping problem\nis analysed as a partially observable Markov decision process, in which the\nstates of the queues and delays in the network need to be maintained. A\nsufficient statistic for decision is found to be the network-state and the\nposterior probability of change having occurred given the measurements received\nand the state of the network. The optimal regimes are studied using simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 18:45:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Karumbu", "Premkumar", ""], ["M.", "Venkata K.
