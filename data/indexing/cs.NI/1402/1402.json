Given the non stationarity\ninduced by the fading process, an online solution for the formulated game would\nthen require an adaptive procedure capable of both convergence to and tracking\nstrategic equilibria as the environment changes. To this end, we deploy the\nstrategic and non stationary learning algorithm of regret tracking, the\ntemporally adaptive variant of the celebrated regret matching algorithm, to\nguarantee the emergence and active tracking of the correlated equilibria in the\ndynamic robust forwarding game. We also make provision for exploiting the\nchannel state information, when available, to enhance the convergence speed of\nthe learning algorithm by conducting an accurate transmission cost estimation.\nThis cost estimate can basically serve as a model which spares the algorithm\nfrom extra action exploration, thus rendering the learning process more sample\nefficient.

These systems are built by taking the driver reaction times into\naccount.

Therefore, many of the\nwarnings that are given turn out to be false alarms. A false alarm occurs\nwhenever a warning is sent, but it is not needed.

Then, we investigate how brake\nresponse times of individual drivers can be used in collision warning\nalgorithms to reduce false alarm rates while still maintaining a high level of\nsafety. This will yield a system that is overall more reliable and trustworthy\nfor drivers, which could lead to wider adoption and applicability for V2V/V2I\ncommunication systems. Moreover, we show how false alarm rate varies with\nrespect to probability of accident.

To the best of our knowledge, there are\nno publicly available reports regarding failure propagation in core transport\nnetworks. Furthermore, Software Defined Networking (SDN) is becoming more\nprevalent in our society and we can envision more SDN-controlled Backbone\nTransport Networks (BTNs) in the future. For this reason, we investigate the\nmain motivations that could lead to epidemic-like failures in BTNs and SDNTNs.\nTo do so, we enlist the expertise of several research groups with significant\nbackground in epidemics, network resiliency, and security. In addition, we\nconsider the experiences of three network providers. Our results illustrate\nthat Dynamic Transport Networks (DTNs) are prone to epidemic-like failures.\nMoreover, we propose different situations in which a failure can propagate in\nSDNTNs. We believe that the key findings will aid network engineers and the\nscientific community to predict this type of disastrous failure scenario and\nplan adequate survivability strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 21:57:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Manzano", "Marc", ""], ["Fagertun", "Anna Manolova", ""], ["Ruepp", "Sarah", ""], ["Calle", "Eusebi", ""], ["Scoglio", "Caterina", ""], ["Sydney", "Ali", ""], ["de la Oliva", "Antonio", ""], ["Mu\u00f1oz", "Alfonso", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.2963", "submitter": "William Bradley", "authors": "William F.

Named Data Networking (NDN) architecture is an\ninstance of ICN that is being developed as a candidate next-generation Internet\narchitecture. By opportunistically caching content within the network (in\nrouters), NDN appears to be well-suited for large-scale content distribution\nand for meeting the needs of increasingly mobile and bandwidth-hungry\napplications that dominate today's Internet.\n  One key feature of NDN is the requirement for each content object to be\ndigitally signed by its producer. Thus, NDN should be, in principle, immune to\ndistributing fake (aka \"poisoned\") content. However, in practice, this poses\ntwo challenges for detecting fake content in NDN routers: (1) overhead due to\nsignature verification and certificate chain traversal, and (2) lack of trust\ncontext, i.e., determining which public keys are trusted to verify which\ncontent. Because of these issues, NDN does not force routers to verify content\nsignatures, which makes the architecture susceptible to content poisoning\nattacks.\n  This paper explores root causes of, and some cures for, content poisoning\nattacks in NDN. In the process, it becomes apparent that meaningful mitigation\nof content poisoning is contingent upon a network-layer trust management\narchitecture, elements of which we construct while carefully justifying\nspecific design choices.

A good backoff protocol should,\narguably, satisfy three natural properties: (i) it should provide constant\nthroughput, wasting as little time as possible; (ii) it should require few\nfailed access attempts, minimizing the amount of wasted effort; and (iii) it\nshould be robust, continuing to work efficiently even if some of the access\nattempts fail for spurious reasons. Unfortunately, exponential backoff has some\nwell-known limitations in two of these areas: it provides poor (sub-constant)\nthroughput (in the worst case), and is not robust (to resource acquisition\nfailures).\n  The goal of this paper is to \"fix\" exponential backoff by making it scalable,\nparticularly focusing on the case where processes arrive in an on-line,\nworst-case fashion.

An $\\alpha$-ST of $P$ is a spanning tree of the\ncomplete Euclidean graph induced by $P$, with the additional property that for\neach point $p \\in P$, the smallest angle around $p$ containing all the edges\nadjacent to $p$ is at most $\\alpha$.

Previous work relied on simple suboptimal counting rules for\ndecision fusion in order to avoid the exhaustive numerical search required for\nobtaining the optimal thresholds. However, these simple rules are not globally\noptimal as they do not maximize the overall global detection probability by\njointly selecting local and global thresholds. Instead, they maximize the\ndetection probability for a specific global threshold. In this paper, a\nglobally optimal decision fusion rule for Primary User signal detection based\non the Neyman- Pearson (NP) criterion is derived. The algorithm is based on a\nnovel representation for the global performance metrics in terms of the\nregularized incomplete beta function. Based on this mathematical\nrepresentation, it is shown that the globally optimal NP hard decision fusion\ntest can be put in the form of a conventional one dimensional convex\noptimization problem. A binary search for the global threshold can be applied\nyielding a complexity of O(log2(N)), where N represents the number of\ncooperating users. The logarithmic complexity is appreciated because we are\nconcerned with dense networks, and thus N is expected to be large. The proposed\noptimal scheme outperforms conventional counting rules, such as the OR, AND,\nand MAJORITY rules.

We focus on STDMA (Spatial\nReuse TDMA)) scheduling, where a predefined cycle is repeated, and where each\nnode has fixed transmission opportunities during specific slots (defined by\ncolors). We assume a STDMA algorithm that takes advantage of the regularity of\ngrid topology to also provide a spatially periodic coloring (\"tiling\" of the\nsame color pattern). In this setting, the key challenges are: 1) minimizing the\naverage routing delay by ordering the slots in the cycle 2) being energy\nefficient. Our work follows two directions: first, the baseline performance is\nevaluated when nothing specific is done and the colors are randomly ordered in\nthe STDMA cycle. Then, we propose a solution, ORCHID that deliberately\nconstructs an efficient STDMA schedule. It proceeds in two steps. In the first\nstep, ORCHID starts form a colored grid and builds a hierarchical routing based\non these colors. In the second step, ORCHID builds a color ordering, by\nconsidering jointly both routing and scheduling so as to ensure that any node\nwill reach a sink in a single STDMA cycle. We study the performance of these\nsolutions by means of simulations and modeling. Results show the excellent\nperformance of ORCHID in terms of delays and energy compared to a shortest path\nrouting that uses the delay as a heuristic.
