Using tools\nfrom random walk theory, fixed point analysis and stochastic geometry, we\ncharacterize the set of K-tuples (\\rho_1, \\rho_2, ... \\rho_K), termed the\navailability region, that is achievable by general uncoordinated operational\nstrategies, where the decision to toggle the current ON/OFF state of a BS is\ntaken independently of the other BSs. If the availability vector corresponding\nto the optimal system performance, e.g., in terms of rate, lies in this\navailability region, there is no performance loss due to the presence of\nunreliable energy sources. As a part of our analysis, we model the temporal\ndynamics of the energy level at each BS as a birth-death process, derive the\nenergy utilization rate, and use hitting/stopping time analysis to prove that\nthere exists a fundamental limit on \\rho_k that cannot be surpassed by any\nuncoordinated strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2013 05:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Dhillon", "Harpreet S.", ""], ["Li", "Ying", ""], ["Nuggehalli", "Pavan", ""], ["Pi", "Zhouyue", ""], ["Andrews", "Jeffrey G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.1532", "submitter": "Alessandro Zocca MSc", "authors": "Alessandro Zocca, Sem C.

Packet\nloss still occurs even when multiple paths exist between source and destination\nbut these paths have not been utilized. To minimize the packet loss, when\nmultiple paths exist, multipath routing techniques are introduced. Multipath\nrouting techniques ensure the use of alternative paths on link failure. It\ncomputes set of paths which can be used when primary path is not available and\nit also provides a way to transit domains to have control over the traffic\nflow. This can be achieved by little modification to current BGP.

Under light workloads, TOFEC creates more smaller chunks and\nuses more parallel connections per file, minimizing service delay. Under heavy\nworkloads, TOFEC automatically reduces the level of chunking (fewer chunks with\nincreased size) and uses fewer parallel connections to reduce overhead,\nresulting in higher throughput and preventing queueing delay.
