Under\nthe proposed framework, the virtual network formed by unifying radio access\ninfrastructures of all operators is optimized for minimum energy consumption by\ndeactivating base stations (BSs) with low traffic loads. The users initially\nassociated to those BSs are off-loaded to neighboring active ones. A fairness\ncriterion for collaboration based on roaming prices is introduced to cover the\nadditional energy costs incurred by host operators. The framework also ensures\nthat any collaborating operator is not negatively affected by its participation\nin the proposed virtualization. A multi-objective linear programming problem is\nformulated to achieve energy and cost efficiency of the networks' operation by\nidentifying the set of inter-operator roaming prices. For the case when\ncollaboration among all operators is infeasible due to profitability, capacity,\nor power constraints, an iterative algorithm is proposed to determine the\ngroups of operators that can viably collaborate. Results show significant\nenergy savings using the proposed virtualization as compared to the standalone\ncase. Moreover, collaborative operators exploiting locally generated renewable\nenergy are rewarded more than traditional ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 21:57:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Farooq", "Muhammad Junaid", ""], ["Ghazzai", "Hakim", ""], ["Yaacoub", "Elias", ""], ["Kadri", "Abdullah", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00149", "submitter": "Chandan  Pradhan", "authors": "Chandan Pradhan, Garimella Rama Murthy", "title": "Analysis of Full-Duplex Downlink Using Diversity Gain", "comments": "Under review at Wireless Personal Communication", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper carries out performance analysis of a multiuser full-duplex (FD)\ncommunication system.

We propose a new compression solution,\ncalled DeepIoT, that makes two key contributions in that space. First, unlike\ncurrent solutions geared for compressing specific types of neural networks,\nDeepIoT presents a unified approach that compresses all commonly used deep\nlearning structures for sensing applications, including fully-connected,\nconvolutional, and recurrent neural networks, as well as their combinations.\nSecond, unlike solutions that either sparsify weight matrices or assume linear\nstructure within weight matrices, DeepIoT compresses neural network structures\ninto smaller dense matrices by finding the minimum number of non-redundant\nhidden elements, such as filters and dimensions required by each layer, while\nkeeping the performance of sensing applications the same.

It has been designed on the basis of network-based CMM protocol,\nwhich is known as Proxy Mobile IPv6(PMIPv6).However , it has been realized that\nthere can be significance difference among network based DDMM and PMIPv6 with\nrespect to handover latency and packet loss.Therefore , we have envisioned fast\nhandover for network-based DDMM (Dynamic Distributed Mobility management) which\nis based on fast handover for PMIPv6(PFMIPv6).However , it has been required to\ninclude modifications on PFMIPV6 to take on DDMM. We have designed some\nimportant additions to support this model, when MU hold IP flows and has many\ndifferent anchor entities.In addition we also derived analytical expressions to\ncheck and made comparison about the handover performance of the given DDMM\nschemes.It has been revealed that DDMM has outperformed in terms of handover\nlatency , session recovery and packet loss as compared with previous schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 03:04:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Memon", "Imran", ""], ["Arain", "Qasim Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.02479", "submitter": "Andra Voicu", "authors": "Andra M.

This paper proposes a simple\nand practical approach to enable STR mode in 802.11 networks with co-existing\nFD and HD STAs. The protocol explicitly accounts for the peculiarities of FD\nenvironments and backwards compatibility. Key aspects of the proposed solution\ninclude FD capability discovery, handshake mechanism for channel access, node\nselection for UFD transmission, adaptive acknowledgement (ACK) timeout for STAs\nengaged in BFD or UFD transmission, and mitigation of contention unfairness.\nPerformance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solution\nin realizing the gains of FD technology for next generation WLANs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 02:23:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Aijaz", "Adnan", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Parag", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07696", "submitter": "Pier Luigi Ventre", "authors": "Pier Luigi Ventre, Alberto Caponi, Giuseppe Siracusano, Davide\n  Palmisano, Stefano Salsano, Marco Bonola, Giuseppe Bianchi", "title": "D-STREAMON: from middlebox to distributed NFV framework for network\n  monitoring", "comments": "Short paper at IEEE LANMAN 2017. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1608.01377", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many reasons make NFV an attractive paradigm for IT security: lowers costs,\nagile operations and better isolation as well as fast security updates,\nimproved incident responses and better level of automation.

In this work we present our system HLOC, aiming to combine\nthe ease of database use with the accuracy of latency measurements. We evaluate\nHLOC on a comprehensive router data set of 1.4M IPv4 and 183k IPv6 routers.\nHLOC first extracts location hints from rDNS names, and then conducts\nmulti-tier latency measurements. Configuration complexity is minimized by using\npublicly available large-scale measurement frameworks such as RIPE Atlas. Using\nthis measurement, we can confirm or disprove the location hints found in domain\nnames.

To this end, we propose a randomized load\nbalancing scheme which simultaneously considers cache size limitation and\nproximity in the server redirection process.\n  In contrast to the classical power of two choices setup, since the memory\nlimitation and the proximity constraint cause correlation in the server\nselection process, we may not benefit from the power of two choices.

While telemetry healthcare services\nusing mobile networks may enable remote real-time monitoring of transported\npatients, physiologic measures and tracking are at least as important and\nrequires the existence of high-fidelity communication coverage. However, the\nwireless networks along the roads especially in rural areas can range from 4G\nto low-speed 2G, some parts with communication breakage. From a patient care\nperspective, transport during critical illness can make route selection patient\nstate dependent. Prompt decisions with the relative advantage of a longer more\nsecure bandwidth route versus a shorter, more rapid transport route but with\nless secure bandwidth must be made. The trade-off between route selection and\nthe quality of wireless communication is an important optimization problem\nwhich unfortunately has remained unaddressed by prior work.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel physiology-aware route scheduling approach\nfor emergency ambulance transport of rural patients with acute, high risk\ndiseases in need of continuous remote monitoring. We mathematically model the\nproblem into an NP-hard graph theory problem, and approximate a solution based\non a trade-off between communication coverage and shortest path. We profile\ncommunication along two major routes in a large rural hospital settings in\nIllinois, and use the traces to manifest the concept. Further, we design our\nalgorithms and run preliminary experiments for scalability analysis.
