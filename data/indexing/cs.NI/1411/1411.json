This paper presents\na novel system and mechanism for information dissemination based on virtual\ninfrastructure selection in combination with multiple communication\ntechnologies. The system has been evaluated using a simulation framework,\ninvolving network simulation in conjugation with realistic vehicular mobility\ntraces. The presented simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed\nmechanism to achieve maximum message penetration with reduced overhead.\nCompared with a cellular-based only solution, our mechanism shows that the\njudicious vehicle selection can lead to improved network utilization through\nthe offload of traffic to the short-range communication network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 10:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["d'Orey", "Pedro M.", ""], ["Maslekar", "Nitin", ""], ["de la Iglesia", "Idoia", ""], ["Zahariev", "Nikola K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2435", "submitter": "Yifan Zhou", "authors": "Yifan Zhou, Zhifeng Zhao, Qianlan Ying, Rongpeng Li, Xuan Zhou, Xianfu\n  Chen, and Honggang Zhang", "title": "Large-scale Spatial Distribution Identification of Base Stations in\n  Cellular Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The performance of cellular system significantly depends on its network\ntopology, where the spatial deployment of base stations (BSs) plays a key role\nin the downlink scenario.

Monitoring schemes comprise of monitoring components that work\ntogether to help schemes in meeting various security requirement parameters for\nthe networks. These security parameters are breached via various attacks by\nmanipulation of monitoring components of particular monitoring schemes to\nproduce faulty results and thereby reducing efficiency of networks, reliability\nand security. In this paper we have discussed these components of monitoring,\nmultiple monitoring schemes, their security parameters and various types of\nattacks possible on these monitoring components by manipulating assumptions of\nmonitoring schemes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 13:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Vaibhav", "Atul", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.5302", "submitter": "Arvind Merwaday", "authors": "Arvind Merwaday, Murat Yuksel, Thomas Quint, Ismail Guvenc, Walid\n  Saad, and Naim Kapucu", "title": "Incentivizing Spectrum Sharing via Subsidy Regulations", "comments": "Technical report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Traditional regulatory methods for spectrum licensing have been recently\nidentified as one of the causes for the under-utilization of the valuable radio\nspectrum.
