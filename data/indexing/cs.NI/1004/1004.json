If conveniently applied within an SDR context, classical concepts\nknown in computer science as space/time tradeoffs can be extremely helpful when\ntrying to mitigate this problem. Inspired by and building on those concepts,\nthis paper presents a novel SDR implementation technique which we call Memory\nAcceleration (MA) that makes extensive use of the memory resources available on\na general purpose computing system, in order to accelerate signal computation.\nMA can provide substantial acceleration factors when applied to conventional\nSDRs without reducing their peculiar flexibility. As a practical proof of this,\nan example of MA applied in the real world to the ETSI DVB-T Viterbi decoder is\nprovided. Actually MA is shown able to provide, when applied to such Viterbi\ndecoder, an acceleration factor of 10.4x, with no impact on error correction\nperformances of the decoder and by making no use of any other typical\nperformance enhancement techniques such as low level (Assembler) programming or\nparallel computation, which though remain compatible with MA.

Clustered hierarchy has been proposed in\nmany papers; in most cases, it provides the network with better performance\nthan other protocols. In our paper, first we discuss some of techniques,\nrelates to this protocol, that have been proposed for energy efficiency; some\nof them were proposed to provide the network with more security level. Our\nproposal then suggests some modifications to some of these techniques to\nprovide the network with more energy saving that should lead to high\nperformance; also we apply our technique on an existing one that proposed to\nincrease the security level of cluster sensor networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2010 09:06:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Abuhelaleh", "Mohammed", ""], ["Elleithy", "Khaled", ""], ["Mismar", "Thabet", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.0602", "submitter": "Secretary Aircc Journal", "authors": "N.Jaisankar(1), R.Saravanan(1), K.

Traditional computer misuse detection\ntechniques can identify known attacks efficiently, but perform very poorly in\nother cases. Anomaly detection has the potential to detect unknown attacks;\nhowever, it is a very challenging task since its aim is to detect unknown\nattacks without any priori knowledge about specific intrusions. This technology\nis still at its early stage. The objective of this paper is that the system can\ndetect anomalous user activity. Existing research in this area focuses either\non user activity or on program operation but not on both simultaneously. In\nthis paper, an attempt to look at both concurrently is presented. Based on an\nintrusion detection framework [1], a novel user anomaly detection system has\nbeen implemented and conducted several intrusion detection experiments in a\nsimulated environment by analyzing user activity and program operation\nactivities. The proposed framework is a layered framework, which is designed to\nsatisfy the core purpose of IDS, and allows detecting the intrusion as quickly\nas possible with available data using mobile agents. This framework was mainly\ndesigned to provide security for the network using mobile agent mechanisms to\nadd mobility features to monitor the user processes from different\ncomputational systems.

However, many of the proposed techniques or protocols have not been\nimplemented at all; while others are implemented and evaluated in a stand-alone\nmanner without being compared with other related work [1].

In most of them, the network is composed of a significant number of\nnodes deployed in an extensive area in which not all nodes are directly\nconnected. Then, the data exchange is supported by multihop communications.\nRouting protocols are in charge of discovering and maintaining the routes in\nthe network. However, the correctness of a particular routing protocol mainly\ndepends on the capabilities of the nodes and on the application requirements.\nThis paper presents a dynamic discover routing method for communication between\nsensor nodes and a base station in WSN. This method tolerates failures of\narbitrary individual nodes in the network (node failure) or a small part of the\nnetwork (area failure). Each node in the network does only local routing\npreservation, needs to record only its neighbor nodes' information, and incurs\nno extra routing overhead during failure free periods. It dynamically discovers\nnew routes when an intermediate node or a small part of the network in the path\nfrom a sensor node to a base station fails. In our planned method, every node\ndecides its path based only on local information, such as its parent node and\nneighbor nodes' routing information. So, it is possible to form a loop in the\nrouting path. We believe that the loop problem in sensor network routing is not\nas serious as that in the Internet routing or traditional mobile ad-hoc\nrouting. We are trying to find all possible loops and eliminate the loops as\nfar as possible in WSN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Apr 2010 03:57:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nanda", "Arabinda", ""], ["Rath", "Amiya Kumar", ""], ["Rout", "Saroj Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1683", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Sudhakar Sengan, S.Chenthur Pandian", "title": "Enhanced Authentication and Locality Aided - Destination Mobility in\n  Dynamic Routing Protocol for MANET", "comments": "IEEE Publication format, International Journal of Computer Science\n  and Information Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 7 No. 3, March 2010, USA.

OPNET Modeler\nsupports 802.15.4 standard and has been used to make a model of PAN. Iterations\nhave been performed by changing the Power of the transmitter and the throughput\nwill has been analyzed to arrive at optimal values.An energy-efficient wireless\nhome network based on IEEE 802.15.4, a novel architecture has been proposed. In\nthis architecture, all nodes are classified into stationary nodes and mobile\nnodes according to the functionality of each node. Mobile nodes are usually\nbattery-powered, and therefore need low-power operation. In order to improve\npower consumption of mobile nodes, effective handover sequence based on MAC\nbroadcast and transmission power control based on LQ (link quality) are\nemployed. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed\narchitecture, communication time and power consumption of mobile nodes can be\nreduced by 1.2 seconds and 42.8%, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 10:13:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Anantdeep", "Er.", ""], ["kaur", "Er.

We first consider the problem of computing\na function of two nodes with integer measurements. We allow for block\ncomputation to enhance data fusion efficiency, and determine the minimum\nworst-case total number of bits to be exchanged to perform the desired\ncomputation. We establish lower bounds using fooling sets, and provide a novel\nscheme which attains the lower bounds, using information theoretic tools. For a\nclass of functions called sum-threshold functions, this scheme is shown to be\noptimal. We then turn to tree networks and derive a lower bound for the number\nof bits exchanged on each link by viewing it as a two node problem. We show\nthat the protocol of recursive innetwork aggregation achieves this lower bound\nin the case of sumthreshold functions. Thus we have provided a communication\nand in-network computation strategy that is optimal for each link. All the\nresults can be extended to the case of non-binary alphabets. In the case of\ngeneral graphs, we present a cut-set lower bound, and an achievable scheme\nbased on aggregation along trees. For complete graphs, the complexity of this\nscheme is no more than twice that of the optimal scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 16:26:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kowshik", "Hemant", ""], ["Kumar", "P.

We solve the ordering problem for the class of Boolean\nthreshold functions. The optimal ordering is dynamic, i.e., it could\npotentially depend on the values of previously transmitted bits. Further, it\ndepends only on the ordering of the marginal probabilites, but not on their\nexact values. This provides an elegant structure for the optimal strategy.
