The introduction of broadband wireless mobile\nad hoc networks (MANETs) and cellular networks together with increased\ncomputational power have opened the door for a new breed of applications to be\ncreated, namely real-time multimedia applications. Delivering real-time\nmultimedia traffic over a complex network like the Internet is a particularly\nchallenging task since these applications have strict quality-of-service (QoS)\nrequirements on bandwidth, delay, and delay jitter. Traditional Internet\nprotocol (IP)-based best effort service is not able to meet these stringent\nrequirements. The time-varying nature of wireless channels and resource\nconstrained wireless devices make the problem even more difficult. To improve\nperceived media quality by end users over wireless Internet, QoS supports can\nbe addressed in different layers, including application layer, transport layer\nand link layer. Cross layer design is a well-known approach to achieve this\nadaptation. In cross-layer design, the challenges from the physical wireless\nmedium and the QoS-demands from the applications are taken into account so that\nthe rate, power, and coding at the physical (PHY) layer can adapted to meet the\nrequirements of the applications given the current channel and network\nconditions. A number of propositions for cross-layer designs exist in the\nliterature. In this chapter, an extensive review has been made on these\ncross-layer architectures that combine the application-layer, transport layer\nand the link layer controls.

Obtaining a good estimation of\nwhere wireless devices are located is crucial in wireless network applications\nincluding environment monitoring, geographic routing and topology control.

Such a priori\nknowledge is common in wireless relay networks. For example, a transmitting\nrelay could be relaying data that was previously transmitted by a node, in\nwhich case the interference received by the node now is actually self\ninformation. Besides the case of self information, the node could also have\noverheard or received the interference data in a prior transmission by another\nnode. Directly removing the known interference requires accurate estimate of\nthe interference channel, which may be difficult in many situations. In this\npaper, we propose a novel scheme, Blind Known Interference Cancellation (BKIC),\nto cancel known interference without interference channel information. BKIC\nconsists of two steps. The first step combines adjacent symbols to cancel the\ninterference, exploiting the fact that the channel coefficients are almost the\nsame between successive symbols. After such interference cancellation, however,\nthe signal of interest is also distorted. The second step recovers the signal\nof interest amidst the distortion. We propose two algorithms for the critical\nsecond steps. The first algorithm (BKIC-S) is based on the principle of\nsmoothing. It is simple and has near optimal performance in the slow fading\nscenario. The second algorithm (BKIC-RBP) is based on the principle of\nreal-valued belief propagation. It can achieve MAP-optimal performance with\nfast convergence, and has near optimal performance even in the fast fading\nscenario. Both BKIC schemes outperform the traditional self-interference\ncancellation schemes with perfect initial channel information by a large\nmargin, while having lower complexities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Oct 2011 13:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shengli", ""], ["Liew", "Soung-Chang", ""], ["Wang", "Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3197", "submitter": "Zhang Shengli", "authors": "Shengli Zhang, Soung-Chang Liew, Qingfeng Zhou, Lu Lu, Hui Wang", "title": "Non-memoryless Analog Network Coding in Two-Way Relay Channel", "comments": "ICC 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) can significantly improve the throughput\nof two-way relay channels.

We start with a simple\nmodel in which the smart wireless devices are assumed to predict the arrival of\nnew requests and submit them to the network T time slots in advance. Using\ntools from large deviation theory, we quantify the resulting prediction\ndiversity gain} to establish that the decay rate of the outage event\nprobabilities increases with the prediction duration T. This model is then\ngeneralized to incorporate the effect of the randomness in the prediction\nlook-ahead time T. Remarkably, we also show that, in the cognitive networking\nscenario, the appropriate use of proactive resource allocation by the primary\nusers improves the diversity gain of the secondary network at no cost in the\nprimary network diversity. We also shed lights on multicasting with predictable\ndemands and show that the proactive multicast networks can achieve a\nsignificantly higher diversity gain that scales super-linearly with T.
