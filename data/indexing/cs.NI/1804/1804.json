The dynamic nature of cloud data center network's traffic, as well as\nthe existence of big flows make it necessary to periodically reprogram the\nnetwork through the SDN controller. Therefore, it is critical for network\nresearchers to minimize the side-effects of network reconfiguration. In this\nway, the most challenging issue is the number of rerouted flows that affect the\nnetwork stability and QoS parameters. As a result, dynamic reconfiguration of\nthe network with minimum overhead (i.e. minimum flow rerouting) is an\ninteresting problem in SDN-based resource reallocation. In this paper, we\nmathematically formulated the resource reallocation problem as an optimization\nproblem with minimum network reconfiguration overhead subject to QoS\nrequirements of the applications flows. In order to reduce the time complexity\nof solving the optimization problem, a forwarding table compression technique\nis devised making the proposed scheme an efficient resource reallocation method\nwhich can be used as an application on top of the SDN controller. Our\nExperimental results show that the proposed scheme decreases the network\nreconfiguration overhead dramatically while meeting the QoS constraints. Since\nthe reconfiguration overhead of the proposed scheme is low, the controller can\nreallocate the resources more frequently based on the network condition. We\nalso studied the impact of the proposed network reconfiguration scheme on\npacket loss and delay in the network. The results show that the proposed\napproach outperform the conventional methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Mar 2018 12:19:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tajiki", "Mohammad Mahdi", ""], ["Akbari", "Behzad", ""], ["Mokari", "Nader", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.00294", "submitter": "Vishal Sharma", "authors": "Vishal Sharma and Kathiravan Srinivasan", "title": "QoS-Aware Routing in Wireless Networks Using Aerial Vehicles", "comments": "17 pages, 3 Tables, 12 Figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Internet Technology, vol. 19, no. 1, pp. 073-089, Jan.\n  2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The next generation wireless networks need efficient mechanisms for data\ndissemination that should support users with better Quality of Service (QoS).\nNevertheless, the existing solutions are unable to handle this demand and\nrequire either network redeployment or replanning.

Position-based routing protocols route\npackets towards the destination using greedy forwarding (i.e., an intermediate\nnode forwards packets to a neighbor that is closer to the destination than\nitself). Different position-based protocols use different strategies to pick\nthe neighbor to forward the packet. If a node has no neighbor that is closer to\nthe destination than itself, greedy forwarding fails. In this case, we say\nthere is void (no neighboring nodes) in the direction of the destination.\nDifferent position-based routing protocols use different methods for dealing\nwith voids. In this paper, we use a simple backtracking technique to deal with\nvoids and design a position-based routing protocol called \"Greedy Routing\nProtocol with Backtracking (GRB)\". We compare the performance of our protocol\nwith the well known Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) routing and the\nAd-Hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol as well as the Dynamic\nSource Routing (DSR) protocol.

The main challenge of the i.i.d. case\nis that the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown\nparameter which must be learned; one key theoretical result proves that the\nproposed algorithm for tracking an i.i.d. process with unknown parametric\ndistribution converges to local optima.

We\ninvestigate a discrete time model where the time axis is partitioned into\nframes. Each frame consists of a sensing phase, followed by a transmission\nphase. During the sensing phase, the user is able to sense a subset of channels\nsequentially before it decides to use one of them in the following transmission\nphase. We assume the channel states alternate between busy and idle according\nto independent Bernoulli random processes from frame to frame. To capture the\ninherent uncertainty in channel sensing, we assume the reward of each\ntransmission when the channel is idle is a random variable. We also associate\nrandom costs with sensing and transmission actions. Our objective is to\nunderstand how the costs and reward of the actions would affect the optimal\nbehavior of the user in both offline and online settings, and design the\ncorresponding opportunistic spectrum access strategies to maximize the expected\ncumulative net reward (i.e., reward-minus-cost). We start with an offline\nsetting where the statistics of the channel status, costs and reward are known\nbeforehand. We show that the the optimal policy exhibits a recursive double\nthreshold structure, and the user needs to compare the channel statistics with\nthose thresholds sequentially in order to decide its actions.

Toward\nthis future goal, this work aims to extend Federated Learning (FL), a\ndecentralized learning framework that enables privacy-preserving training of\nmodels, to work with heterogeneous clients in a practical cellular network. The\nFL protocol iteratively asks random clients to download a trainable model from\na server, update it with own data, and upload the updated model to the server,\nwhile asking the server to aggregate multiple client updates to further improve\nthe model. While clients in this protocol are free from disclosing own private\ndata, the overall training process can become inefficient when some clients are\nwith limited computational resources (i.e. requiring longer update time) or\nunder poor wireless channel conditions (longer upload time). Our new FL\nprotocol, which we refer to as FedCS, mitigates this problem and performs FL\nefficiently while actively managing clients based on their resource conditions.\nSpecifically, FedCS solves a client selection problem with resource\nconstraints, which allows the server to aggregate as many client updates as\npossible and to accelerate performance improvement in ML models.

For this setup, we characterize two performance\nmetrics: (i) energy coverage and (ii) joint signal-to-interference-plus-noise\n(SINR) and energy coverage.

The\nlevel of coupling can be controlled by tuning the fraction of total GWs that\nare deployed at the cluster centers.

We show that, under the optimal\nstrategy, an IDS needs to remain active 72.4%, 70%, 68.4% and 66.6% of the time\nto restrict the attacker's success rate to 8.5%, 6.4%, 7.2% and 8.3%\nrespectively for the aforementioned attacks, thus performing better than the\nstate-of-the-art approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 06:20:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Talukder", "Sajedul", ""], ["Sakib", "Md.

Unfortunately, the existing techniques have their own limitations. For\ninstance, the communication-based approach (e.g., transmission of GPS\ninformation) has high latency and low reliability while the reflection-based\napproach (e.g., RADAR) is incapable of detecting hidden vehicles (HVs) without\nline-of-sight. This is arguably the reason behind some recent fatal accidents\ninvolving autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, this paper presents a\nnovel HV-sensing technology that exploits multi-path transmission from a HV to\na sensing vehicle (SV). The powerful technology enables the SV to detect\nmultiple HV-state parameters including position, orientation of driving\ndirection, and size. Its implementation does not even require\ntransmitter-receiver synchronization like conventional mobile positioning\ntechniques. Our design approach leverages estimated information on multi-path\n(AoA/AoD/ToA) and their geometric relations. As a result, a complex system of\nequations or optimization problems, where the desired HV-state parameters are\nvariables, can be formulated for different channel-noise conditions. The\ndevelopment of intelligent solution methods ranging from least-square estimator\nto disk/box minimization yields a set of practical HV-sensing techniques. We\nstudy their feasibility conditions in terms of the required number of paths.\nFurthermore, practical solutions, including sequential path combining and\nrandom directional beamforming, are proposed to enable HV-sensing given\ninsufficient paths. Last, realistic simulation of driving in both highway and\nrural scenarios demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
