NS allows network operators\n(NOs) to divide the available network resources into multiple logical NSs for\nproviding dedicated virtual networks tailored to the specific service/business\nrequirements. MEC enables NOs to provide diverse ultra-low latency services for\nsupporting the needs of different industry verticals by moving computing\nfacilities to the network edge. NS can be constructed by instantiating a set of\nvirtual network functions (VNFs) on top of MEC cloud servers for provisioning\ndiverse latency-sensitive communication services (e.g., autonomous driving and\naugmented reality) on demand at a lesser cost and time. However, VNFs, MEC\ncloud servers, and communication links are subject to failures due to software\nbugs, misconfiguration, overloading, hardware faults, cyber attacks, power\noutage, and natural/man-made disaster. Failure of a critical network component\ndisrupts services abruptly and leads to users' dissatisfaction, which may\nresult in revenue loss for the NOs.

The service times of both types of\ncalls are phase-type (PH ) distributed with different service rates, and\ninter-failure & inter-repair times of channels are exponentially distributed.\nFor the prioritization of handoff calls, G channels are kept in reserve for\nhandoff calls.

To\nensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile\nusers and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint\n(CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are\nexploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the\nwireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a\nsequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users'\nfeeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption\nconstraints on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The\nproblem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users'\naccurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer\ncharacteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state\nnetwork (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by\ntraining fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs.\nWith the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based\noptimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we\nimplement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer\ndecision variables and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize\nthe integer decision variables.

This concept has been adopted by Time-Sensitive Networking\n(TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). An appealing property of\ninterleaved shaping is that, when an interleaved shaper is appended to a FIFO\nsystem, it does not increase the worst-case delay of the system. Based on this\n\"shaping-for-free\" property, an approach has been introduced to deliver bounded\nend-to-end latency. Specifically, at each output link of a node, class-based\naggregate scheduling is used together with one interleaved shaper per-input\nlink and per-class, and the interleaved shaper re-shapes every flow to its\ninitial traffic constraint. In this paper, we investigate other properties of\ninterleaved LRQ shapers, particularly as stand-alone elements. In addition,\nunder per-flow setting, we also investigate per-flow LRQ based flow aggregation\nand derive its properties. The analysis focuses directly on the timing of\noperations, such as shaping and scheduling, in the network. This timing based\nmethod can be found in the Guaranteed Rate (GR) server model and more generally\nthe max-plus branch of network calculus. With the derived properties, we not\nonly show that an improved end-to-end latency bound can be obtained for the\ncurrent approach, but also demonstrate with two examples that new approaches\nmay be devised. End-to-end delay bounds for the three approaches are derived\nand compared. As a highlight, the two new approaches do not require different\nnode architectures in allocating (shaping / scheduling) queues, which implies\nthat they can be readily adapted for use in TSN and DetNet. This together with\nthe derived properties of LRQ shed new insights on providing the TSN / DetNet\nqualities of service.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Jul 2021 10:58:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Yuming", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.05056", "submitter": "Ali Ramadhan A.

Information freshness\nis quantified by age of information (AoI), defined as the time elapsed since\nthe generation time of the latest received information update. PNC reduces\ncommunication latency of TWRNs by turning superimposed electromagnetic waves\ninto network-coded messages so that end users can send update packets to each\nother via the relay more frequently. Although sending update packets more\nfrequently is potential to reduce AoI, how to deal with packet corruption has\nnot been well investigated. Specifically, if old packets are corrupted in any\nhop of a TWRN, one needs to decide the old packets to be dropped or to be\nretransmitted, e.g., new packets have recent information, but may require more\ntime to be delivered. We study the average AoI with and without ARQ in\nPNC-enabled TWRNs. We first consider a non-ARQ scheme where old packets are\nalways dropped when corrupted, referred to once-lost-then-drop (OLTD), and a\nclassical ARQ scheme with no packet lost, referred to as reliable packet\ntransmission (RPT). Interestingly, our analysis shows that neither the non-ARQ\nscheme nor the pure ARQ scheme achieves good average AoI. We then put forth an\nuplink-lost-then-drop (ULTD) protocol that combines packet drop and ARQ.\nExperiments on software-defined radio indicate that ULTD significantly\noutperforms OLTD and RPT in terms of average AoI. Although this paper focuses\non TWRNs, we believe the insight of ULTD applies generally to other two-hop\nnetworks. Our insight is that to achieve high information freshness, when\npackets are corrupted in the first hop, new packets should be generated and\nsent (i.e., old packets are discarded); when packets are corrupted in the\nsecond hop, old packets should be retransmitted until successful reception.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Haoyuan", ""], ["Chan", "Tse-Tin", ""], ["Leung", "Victor C.

These\nrelationships are usually difficult to be inferred by existing algorithms\nbecause there is no discrimination on the designed features compared to the P2P\nor P2C relationships.\n  In this paper, we focus on the multi-classification of AS relationships for\nthe first time. We first summarize the differences between AS relationships\nunder the structural and attribute features, and the reasons why multiple\nrelationships are difficult to be inferred. We then introduce new features and\npropose a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) framework, AS-GCN, to solve this\nmulti-classification problem under complex scene. The framework takes into\naccount the global network structure and local link features concurrently. The\nexperiments on real Internet topological data validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod, i.e., AS-GCN achieves comparable results on the easy binary\nclassification task, and outperforms a series of baselines on the more\ndifficult multi-classification task, with the overall accuracy above 95%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 17:20:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Songtao", ""], ["Shu", "Xincheng", ""], ["Ruan", "Zhongyuan", ""], ["Huang", "Zegang", ""], ["Xuan", "Qi", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13665", "submitter": "Wei-Chang Yeh", "authors": "Wei-Chang Yeh", "title": "Novel Direct Algorithm for Computing Simultaneous All-Levels Reliability\n  of Multi-state Flow Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.NA cs.NI math.CO math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  All kind of networks, e.g., Internet of Things, social networks, wireless\nsensor networks, transportation networks, 4g/5G, etc., are around us to benefit\nand help our daily life.

The level d reliability, Rd, of the\nMFN is the success probability of sending at least d units of integer flow from\nthe source node to the sink node. The reliability Rd is a popular index for\ndesigning, managing, controlling, and evaluating MFNs.

Third, P4COM provides a cutting-payload\nmechanism to handle packet losses. We have built a P4COM prototype with a\nBarefoot Tofino switch and multiple commodity servers. Through a combination of\ntestbed experiments and large-scale simulations, we show that P4COM is able to\nachieve line-rate processing at 10Gbps links, and can increase the data\nshuffling throughput by 2-5 times for the MapReduce-style applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 01:12:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Ge", ""], ["Zeng", "Gaoxiong", ""], ["Chen", "Li", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13869", "submitter": "Ali Murat Demirtas", "authors": "Ali Murat Demirtas, Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu, Irem Bor-Yaliniz, Bulent\n  Tavli Halim Yanikomeroglu", "title": "Autonomous UAV Base Stations for Next Generation Wireless Networks: A\n  Deep Learning Approach", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To address the ever-growing connectivity demands of wireless communications,\nthe adoption of ingenious solutions, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as\nmobile Base Stations (BSs), is imperative.

For the device with AQM, most of the latency under load tests\nresulted in 15-30 milliseconds of latency. In comparison, the device without\nAQM averaged roughly 250 milliseconds of latency, between 8-16 times higher, a\nhighly significant difference to the end user quality of experience.
