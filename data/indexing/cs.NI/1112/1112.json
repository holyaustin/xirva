Those applications need reliability and respect of time constraints.\nThe underlying mechanisms such as MAC and routing must handle such\nrequirements. Our approach to the time constraint problem is to bound the\nhop-count between a node and the sink and the time it takes to do a hop so the\nend-to-end delay can be bounded and the communications are thus real-time. For\nreliability purpose we propose to select forwarder nodes depending on how they\nare connected in the direction of the sink. In order to be able to do so we\nneed a coordinate (or a metric) that gives information on hop-count, that\nallows to strongly differentiate nodes and gives information on the\nconnectivity of each node keeping in mind the intrinsic constraints of WSWs\nsuch as energy consumption, autonomy, etc. Due to the efficiency and\nscalability of greedy routing in WSNs and the financial cost of GPS chips,\nVirtual Coordinate Systems (VCSs) for WSNs have been proposed. A category of\nVCSs is based on the hop-count from the sink, this scheme leads to many nodes\nhaving the same coordinate. The main advantage of this system is that the hops\nnumber of a packet from a source to the sink is known. Nevertheless, it does\nnot allow to differentiate the nodes with the same hop-count. In this report we\npropose a novel hop-count-based VCS which aims at classifying the nodes having\nthe same hop-count depending on their connectivity and at differentiating nodes\nin a 2-hop neighborhood. Those properties make the coordinates, which also can\nbe viewed as a local identifier, a very powerful metric which can be used in\nWSNs mechanisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 07:37:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mouradian", "Alexandre", "", "CITI Insa Lyon / INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes"], ["Aug\u00e9-Blum", "Isabelle", "", "CITI Insa Lyon / INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes"]]}, {"id": "1112.0204", "submitter": "Gerard Briscoe Dr", "authors": "Gerard Briscoe and Suzanne Sadedin and Philippe De Wilde", "title": "Digital Ecosystems: Ecosystem-Oriented Architectures", "comments": "39 pages, 26 figures, journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11047-011-9254-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MA cs.NE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We view Digital Ecosystems to be the digital counterparts of biological\necosystems.

Novel design criteria are thus required to capture the\ntrade-offs between the potentially infinite network lifetime and the uncertain\nenergy availability. This paper addresses the analysis and design of WSNs with\nEH devices by focusing on conventional MAC protocols, namely TDMA, Framed-ALOHA\n(FA) and Dynamic-FA (DFA), and by accounting for the performance trade-offs and\ndesign issues arising due to EH. A novel metric, referred to as delivery\nprobability, is introduced to measure the capability of a MAC protocol to\ndeliver the measure of any sensor in the network to the intended destination\n(or fusion center, FC). The interplay between delivery efficiency and time\nefficiency (i.e., the data collection rate at the FC), is investigated\nanalytically using Markov models. Numerical results validate the analysis and\nemphasize the critical importance of accounting for both delivery probability\nand time efficiency in the design of EH-WSNs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Dec 2011 22:04:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Iannello", "Fabio", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""], ["Spagnolini", "Umberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.2410", "submitter": "Intisar Al-Mejibli Mrs", "authors": "Intisar Al-Mejibli, Martin Colley Salah Al-Majeed", "title": "Networks Utilization Improvements for Service Discovery Performance", "comments": "20 pages, 22 figures; International Journal on Cloud Computing:\n  Services and Architecture (IJCCSA),Vol.1, No.3, November 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Service discovery requests' messages have a vital role in sharing and\nlocating resources in many of service discovery protocols.

While contracts that\nsell connectivity on finer granularities improve market efficiency, they are\nalso more costly for ISPs to implement and more difficult for customers to\nunderstand.

Finally, the common ISP\npractice of structuring tiered contracts according to the cost of carrying the\ntraffic flows (e.g., offering a discount for traffic that is local) can be\nsuboptimal and that dividing contracts based on both traffic demand and the\ncost of carrying it into only three or four tiers yields near-optimal profit\nfor the ISP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Dec 2011 08:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Valancius", "Vytautas", ""], ["Lumezanu", "Cristian", ""], ["Feamster", "Nick", ""], ["Johari", "Ramesh", ""], ["Vazirani", "Vijay V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.3741", "submitter": "Manjesh Kumar Hanawal", "authors": "Manjesh Kumar Hanawal and Eitan Altman and Francois Baccelli", "title": "Stochastic Geometry based Medium Access Games in Mobile Ad hoc Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the performance of Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) when\nthe nodes, that form a Poisson point process, selfishly choose their Medium\nAccess Probability (MAP).
