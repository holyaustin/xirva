The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per\nstage can be used to optimize performance with respect to secondary user\nthroughput and the collision probability between primary and secondary users.\nSo far, the impact of multi-stage sensing on network throughput and collision\nprobability for a realistic network model is relatively unexplored. Therefore,\nwe present the first analytical framework which enables performance evaluation\nof different multi-channel multi-stage spectrum sensing algorithms for\nOpportunistic Spectrum Access networks. The contribution of our work lies in\nstudying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of\nsensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage,\nsingle and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels,\nprimary and secondary user traffic, buffering of incoming secondary user\ntraffic, as well as MAC layer sensing algorithms. Analyzed performance metrics\ninclude the average secondary user throughput and the average collision\nprobability between primary and secondary users. Our results show that when the\nprobability of primary user mis-detection is constrained, the performance of\nmulti-stage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single stage sensing\ncounterpart. Besides, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of\nsensing decreases the collision probability considerably, while keeping the\nthroughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic primary user traffic\nscenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between\nsecondary users throughput and collision probability while meeting successful\ndetection constraints subjected by Opportunistic Spectrum Access communication.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 00:45:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 20:36:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 23:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 08:37:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gabran", "Wesam", ""], ["Pawe\u0142czak", "Przemys\u0142aw", ""], ["\u010cabri\u0107", "Danijela", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0168", "submitter": "Mohammad Momani", "authors": "Mohammad Momani, Subhash Challa", "title": "Survey of trust models in different network domains", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces the security and trust concepts in wireless sensor\nnetworks and explains the difference between them, stating that even though\nboth terms are used interchangeably when defining a secure system, they are not\nthe same.

This paper makes two contributions on the guessing\nnumber. First, we introduce an undirected graph on all possible configurations\nof the digraph, referred to as the guessing graph, which encapsulates the\nessence of dependence amongst configurations. We prove that the guessing number\nof a digraph is equal to the logarithm of the independence number of its\nguessing graph. Therefore, network coding solvability is no more a problem on\nthe operations made by each node, but is simplified into a problem on the\nmessages that can transit through the network. By studying the guessing graph\nof a given digraph, and how to combine digraphs or alphabets, we are thus able\nto derive bounds on the guessing number of digraphs. Second, we construct\nspecific digraphs with high guessing numbers, yielding network coding instances\nwhere a large amount of information can transit. We first propose a\nconstruction of digraphs with finite parameters based on cyclic codes, with\nguessing number equal to the degree of the generator polynomial. We then\nconstruct an infinite class of digraphs with arbitrary girth for which the\nratio between the linear guessing number and the number of vertices tends to\none, despite these digraphs being arbitrarily sparse. These constructions yield\nsolvable network coding instances with a relatively small number of\nintermediate nodes for which the node operations are known and linear, although\nthese instances are sparse and the sources are arbitrarily far from their\ncorresponding sinks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Oct 2010 10:15:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 14:11:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gadouleau", "Maximilien", ""], ["Riis", "Soren", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2667", "submitter": "Dongning Guo", "authors": "Dongning Guo and Lei Zhang", "title": "Virtual Full-Duplex Wireless Communication via Rapid On-Off-Division\n  Duplex", "comments": "8 pages; Forty-Eighth Annual Allerton Conference on Communication,\n  Control, and Computing, 2010", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a novel paradigm for design- ing the physical and\nmedium access control (MAC) layers of mobile ad hoc or peer-to-peer networks\nformed by half-duplex radios.

Both\namplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying strategies are\nconsidered. Given fixed power allocation to the channels, we show that channel\npairing over multiple hops can be decomposed into independent pairing problems\nat each relay, and a sorted-SNR channel pairing strategy is sum-rate optimal,\nwhere each relay pairs its incoming and outgoing channels by their SNR order.\nFor the joint optimization of channel pairing and power allocation under both\ntotal and individual power constraints, we show that the problem can be\ndecoupled into two subproblems solved separately. This separation principle is\nestablished by observing the equivalence between sorting SNRs and sorting\nchannel gains in the jointly optimal solution. It significantly reduces the\ncomputational complexity in finding the jointly optimal solution. It follows\nthat the channel pairing problem in joint optimization can be again decomposed\ninto independent pairing problems at each relay based on sorted channel gains.\nThe solution for optimizing power allocation for DF relaying is also provided,\nas well as an asymptotically optimal solution for AF relaying. Numerical\nresults are provided to demonstrate substantial performance gain of the jointly\noptimal solution over some suboptimal alternatives.

There are many situations where these requirements are not\nfulfilled such as; developing nations, rural areas, natural disasters, and\nmilitary conflicts to name but a few. A practical solution is to use mobile\ndevices interconnected via a wireless medium to form a network, known as a\nMobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET), and provide the services normally found in wired\nnetworks. Security in MANETs is an issue of paramount importance due to the\nwireless nature of the communication links.

For the purposes of this article we have used the \"WMN test-bed\" to\nenable secure routing in MANETs. The use of cryptography is an efficient proven\nway of securing data in communications, but some cryptographic algorithms are\nnot as efficient as others and require more processing power, which is\ndetrimental to MANETs. In this article we have assessed different cryptographic\napproaches to securing the OLSR (Optimised Link State Routing) protocol to\nprovide a basis for research. We conclude the paper with a series of\nperformance evaluation results regarding different cryptographic and hashing\nschemes.
