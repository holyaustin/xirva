Clustering of nodes in wireless sensor\nnetworks which is used to prolong the life-time of networks is one of the\ndifficult tasks of clustering procedure. In order to perform nodes clustering,\na number of nodes are determined as cluster heads and other ones are joined to\none of these heads, based on different criteria e.g. Euclidean distance. So\nfar, different approaches have been proposed for this process, where swarm and\nevolutionary algorithms contribute in this regard. In this study, a novel\nalgorithm is proposed based on Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA) for\nclustering procedure. In the proposed method, the performance of the standard\nAFSA is improved by increasing balance between local and global searches.\nFurthermore, a new mechanism has been added to the base algorithm for improving\nconvergence speed in clustering problems.

The goal is to build a location-specific TVWS database, which\nprovides a look-up table service for any D2D link to determine its maximum\npermitted emission power (MPEP) in an unlicensed digital TV (DTV) band. To\nachieve this goal, the idea of mobile crowd sensing is firstly introduced to\ncollect active spectrum measurements from massive personal mobile devices.\nConsidering the incompleteness of crowd measurements, we formulate the problem\nof unknown measurements recovery as a matrix completion problem and apply a\npowerful fixed point continuation algorithm to reconstruct the unknown elements\nfrom the known elements. By joint exploitation of the big spectrum data in its\nvicinity, each cellular base station further implements a nonlinear support\nvector machine algorithm to perform irregular coverage boundary detection of a\nlicensed DTV transmitter. With the knowledge of the detected coverage boundary,\nan opportunistic spatial reuse algorithm is developed for each D2D link to\ndetermine its MPEP. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can\nsuccessfully enable D2D communications in TVWS while satisfying the\ninterference constraint from the licensed DTV services. In addition, to our\nbest knowledge, this is the first try to explore and exploit TVWS inside the\nDTV protection region resulted from the shadowing effect.

Our target is to fill this gap, proposing a novel\ncongestion control algorithm for delay-constrained communication over best\neffort packet switched networks. The proposed algorithm is able to maintain a\nbounded queueing delay when competing with other delay-based flows, and avoid\nstarvation when competing with loss-based flows. We adopt the well-known\nprice-based distributed mechanism as congestion control, but: 1) we introduce a\nnovel non-linear mapping between the experienced delay and the price function\nand 2) we combine both delay and loss information into a single price term\nbased on packet interarrival measurements. We then provide a stability analysis\nfor our novel algorithm and we show its performance in the simulation results\ncarried out in the NS3 framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the\nproposed algorithm is able to: achieve good intra-protocol fairness properties,\ncontrol efficiently the end-to-end delay, and finally, protect the flow from\nstarvation when other flows cause the queuing delay to grow excessively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 07:02:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 12:55:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 11:36:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["D'Aronco", "Stefano", ""], ["Toni", "Laura", ""], ["Mena", "Sergio", ""], ["Zhu", "Xiaoqing", ""], ["Frossard", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.02804", "submitter": "Douglas Leith", "authors": "Miguel B\\'aguena Albaladejo, Douglas J.

Traditional\ntechniques of routing are not well adapted. Indeed, their lack of reactivity\nwith respect to the variability of network changes makes them difficult to use.\nMoreover, conserving energy is a critical concern in the design of routing\nprotocols for ad hoc networks, because most mobile nodes operate with limited\nbattery capacity, and the energy depletion of a node affects not only the node\nitself but also the overall network lifetime. In all proposed single-path\nrouting schemes a new path-discovery process is required once a path failure is\ndetected, and this process causes delay and wastage of node resources. A\nmultipath routing scheme is an alternative to maximize the network lifetime. In\nthis paper, we propose an energy-efficient multipath routing protocol, called\nAOMR-LM (Ad hoc On-demand Multipath Routing with Lifetime Maximization), which\npreserves the residual energy of nodes and balances the consumed energy to\nincrease the network lifetime. To achieve this goal, we used the residual\nenergy of nodes for calculating the node energy level. The multipath selection\nmechanism uses this energy level to classify the paths. Two parameters are\nanalyzed: the energy threshold beta and the coefficient alpha. These parameters\nare required to classify the nodes and to ensure the preservation of node\nenergy. Our protocol improves the performance of mobile ad hoc networks by\nprolonging the lifetime of the network. This novel protocol has been compared\nwith other protocols: AOMDV and ZD-AOMDV.
