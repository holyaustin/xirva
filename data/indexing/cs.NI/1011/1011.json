In doing so, we consider a family of\ngeneric goodput-based utilities that facilitate, e.g., throughput-based\npricing, quality-of-service enforcement, and/or the treatment of practical\nmodulation-and-coding schemes (MCS). Since perfect knowledge of channel state\ninformation (CSI) may be difficult to maintain at the base-station, especially\nwhen the number of users and/or subchannels is large, we consider scheduling\nand resource allocation under imperfect CSI, where the channel state is\ndescribed by a generic probability distribution. First, we consider the\n\"continuous\" case where multiple users and/or code rates can time-share a\nsingle OFDMA subchannel and time slot. This yields a non-convex optimization\nproblem that we convert into a convex optimization problem and solve exactly\nusing a dual optimization approach. Second, we consider the \"discrete\" case\nwhere only a single user and code rate is allowed per OFDMA subchannel per time\nslot. For the mixed-integer optimization problem that arises, we discuss the\nconnections it has with the continuous case and show that it can solved exactly\nin some situations. For the other situations, we present a bound on the\noptimality gap. For both cases, we provide algorithmic implementations of the\nobtained solution. Finally, we study, numerically, the performance of the\nproposed algorithms under various degrees of CSI uncertainty, utilities, and\nOFDMA system configurations. In addition, we demonstrate advantages relative to\nexisting state-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:52:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 18:44:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 17:42:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Aggarwal", "Rohit", ""], ["Assaad", "Mohamad", ""], ["Koksal", "C.

However, regenerating codes possess in\naddition, the ability to repair a failed node by connecting to an arbitrary\nsubset of d nodes. It has been shown that for the case of functional-repair,\nthere is a tradeoff between the amount of data stored per node and the\nbandwidth required to repair a failed node. A special case of functional-repair\nis exact-repair where the replacement node is required to store data identical\nto that in the failed node. Exact-repair is of interest as it greatly\nsimplifies system implementation. The first result of the paper is an explicit,\nexact-repair code for the point on the storage-bandwidth tradeoff corresponding\nto the minimum possible repair bandwidth, for the case when d=n-1.

In this paper, we will analyze\ndelay in random access multi-hop networks and solve the delay-constrained\nutility maximization problem. We define the network utility as a combination of\nrate utility and energy cost functions and solve the following two problems:\n'optimal medium access control with link delay constraint' and, 'optimal\ncongestion and contention control with end-to-end delay constraint'. The\noptimal tradeoff between delay, rate, and energy is achieved for different\nvalues of delay constraint and the scaling factors between rate and energy.\nEventually linear and super-linear distributed optimization solutions are\nproposed for each problem and their performance are compared in terms of\nconvergence and complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 14:58:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Khodaian", "Amir M.", ""], ["Khalaj", "Babak H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5317", "submitter": "Mathieu Feuillet Mr", "authors": "Thomas Bonald and Mathieu Feuillet", "title": "Performance of CSMA in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the performance of CSMA in multi-channel wireless networks,\naccounting for the random nature of traffic.

Common usable timeslots for the\nsender-receiver pair are used for communication. But these will not ensure safe\npacket delivery since packets may be corrupted on the way during propagation\nfrom sender to receiver. Therefore, we also suggest a proximity based\nretransmission scheme where each machine in the LAN, buffers good packet and\nmachines close to the receiver retransmit on receiving a NACK.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 14:08:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Singha", "Chitta Ranjan", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6508", "submitter": "Binod Kumar Pattanayak", "authors": "Binod Kumar Pattanayak, Manoj Kumar Mishra, Alok Kumar Jagadev,\n  Manojranjan Nayak", "title": "Multi-Hop Bandwidth Management Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "comments": "20 pages,30 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Managing Information technology, November\n  2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An admission control scheme should play the role of a coordinator for flows\nin a data communication network, to provide the guarantees as the medium is\nshared. The nodes of a wired network can monitor the medium to know the\navailable bandwidth at any point of time. But, in wireless ad hoc networks, a\nnode must consume the bandwidth of neighboring nodes, during a communication.\nHence, the consumption of bandwidth by a flow and the availability of resources\nto any wireless node strictly depend upon the neighboring nodes within its\ntransmission range. We present a scalable and efficient admission control\nscheme, Multi-hop Bandwidth Management Protocol (MBMP), to support the QoS\nrequirements in multi-hop ad hoc networks. We simulate several options to\ndesign MBMP and compare the performances of these options through mathematical\nanalysis and simulation results, and compare its effectiveness with the\nexisting admission control schemes through extensive simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 10:03:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Dec 2010 08:55:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Pattanayak", "Binod Kumar", ""], ["Mishra", "Manoj Kumar", ""], ["Jagadev", "Alok Kumar", ""], ["Nayak", "Manojranjan", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6594", "submitter": "Stefan Schmid", "authors": "Dushyant Arora, Anja Feldmann, Gregor Schaffrath, Stefan Schmid", "title": "On the Benefit of Virtualization: Strategies for Flexible Server\n  Allocation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Virtualization technology facilitates a dynamic, demand-driven allocation and\nmigration of servers.

A generic use case is\nconsidered where both the overall demand issued for a certain service (for\nexample, an SAP application in the cloud, or a gaming application) as well as\nthe origins of the requests change over time (e.g., due to time zone effects or\ndue to user mobility), and we present online and optimal offline strategies to\ncompute the number and location of the servers implementing this service. These\nalgorithms also allow us to study the fundamental benefits of dynamic resource\nallocation compared to static systems.
