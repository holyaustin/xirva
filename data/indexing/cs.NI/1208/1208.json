Does a algorithm use local or\nglobal network state? This is the key question in adaptive routing. In many\ntraffic patterns, the ignorance of global network state, leading to routing\nselection based only on local congestion information, tends to violate global\nload balance. To attack the load balance issue in adapting routing, some global\nadaptive routing algorithms introduce a congestion propagation network to\nobtain global network status information, such as Regional Congestion Awareness\n(RCA) and Destination Based Adaptive Routing (DBAR).\n  However, the congestion propagation network leads to additional power and\narea consumption which cannot be ignored. From another view, if we just\nincrease the bandwidth between neighbor nodes with the wires used to build the\ncongestion propagation network, the network performance could be improved as\nwell. In this paper, we propose a global adaptive routing algorithm without\nemploying the additional congestion propagation network. Our algorithm obtains\nthe global network state in a novel way, and can offer significant improvement\nthan the base-line local adaptive routing algorithm (xy-adaptive algorithm\nwhich selects routing based on local congestion information in each hop) for\nboth medium and high injection rates.\n  In wormhole flow control, all the routing information (flit id, source node\nid, destination node id, vc id and address) is contained in head flit, and data\nis carried in body flits.

A specific such algorithm is Fisher\ndiscriminant analysis (FDA), the classification accuracy of which has been\npreviously studied in the context of wireless sensor networks. Previous work,\nhowever, does not take into account the communication protocol or battery\nlifetime of the sensor networks; in this paper we extend the existing studies\nby proposing a model that captures the relationship between battery lifetime\nand classification accuracy. In order to do so we combine the FDA with a model\nthat captures the dynamics of the Carrier-Sense Multiple-Access (CSMA)\nalgorithm, the random-access algorithm used to regulate communications in\nsensor networks. This allows us to study the interaction between the\nclassification accuracy, battery lifetime and effort put towards learning, as\nwell as the impact of the back-off rates of CSMA on the accuracy. We\ncharacterize the tradeoff between the length of the training stage and\naccuracy, and show that accuracy is non-monotone in the back-off rate due to\nchanges in the training sample size and overfitting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 20:18:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Varshney", "Kush R.", ""], ["van de Ven", "Peter M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.2314", "submitter": "Abdul Razaque", "authors": "Marwah Almasri, Khaled Elleithy, and Abdul Razaque", "title": "Analytical Study of Pre-congestion notification (PCN) techniques", "comments": "16 Pages, 16 figures; International Journal of Computer Networks &\n  Communications (IJCNC) July 2012, Volume 4, Number 4", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Maintaining the quality of service (QOS) and controlling the network\ncongestion are quite complicated tasks. They cause degrading the performance of\nthe network, and disturbing the continuous communication process. To overcome\nthese issues, one step towards this dilemma has been taken in form of\nPre-congestion notification (PCN) technique. PCN uses a packet marking\ntechnique within a PCN domain over IP networks. It is notified by egress node\nthat works as guard at entry point of network. Egress node gives feedback to\ncommunicating servers whether rate on the link is exceeded than configured\nadmissible threshold or within the limit. Based on this feedback, admission\ndecisions are taken to determine whether to allow/block new coming flows or\nterminate already accepted. The actual question is about selection of right\nalgorithm for PCN domain. In this paper, we investigate the analytical behavior\nof some known PCN algorithms. We make slide modifications in originality of PCN\nalgorithms without disquieting working process in order to employ those within\nsimilar types of scenarios. Our goal is to simulate them either in highly\ncongested or less congested realistic scenarios.

There is a need for monitoring of Health issues. Body Area Network\nconsists of wireless sensors attached on or inside human body for monitoring\nvital Health related problems e.g, Electro Cardiogram (ECG),\nElectroEncephalogram (EEG), ElectronyStagmography(ENG) etc. Data is recorded by\nsensors and is sent towards Health care center. Due to life threatening\nsituations, timely sending of data is essential. For data to reach Health care\ncenter, there must be a proper way of sending data through reliable connection\nand with minimum delay. In this paper transmission delay of different paths,\nthrough which data is sent from sensor to Health care center over heterogeneous\nmulti-hop wireless channel is analyzed. Data of medical related diseases is\nsent through three different paths. In all three paths, data from sensors first\nreaches ZigBee, which is the common link in all three paths. After ZigBee there\nare three available networks, through which data is sent. Wireless Local Area\nNetwork (WLAN), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX),\nUniversal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) are connected with ZigBee.\nEach network (WLAN, WiMAX, UMTS) is setup according to environmental\nconditions, suitability of device and availability of structure for that\ndevice.

Leveraging the\nlow intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies, a\nnovel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted\nleast-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting $\\ell_1$-norm\nof the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic matrix. After\nrecasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to online\noptimization, a real-time algorithm for dynamic anomalography is developed and\nits convergence established under simplifying technical assumptions. For\noperational conditions where computational complexity reductions are at a\npremium, a lightweight stochastic gradient algorithm based on Nesterov's\nacceleration technique is developed as well. Comprehensive numerical tests with\nboth synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the\nproposed online algorithms and their tracking capabilities, and demonstrate\nthat they outperform state-of-the-art approaches developed to diagnose traffic\nanomalies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2012 15:49:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mardani", "Morteza", ""], ["Mateos", "Gonzalo", ""], ["Giannakis", "Georgios B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.4192", "submitter": "Preetha K G", "authors": "K G Preetha, A Unnikrishnan, K Poulose Jacob", "title": "Performance improvement of multiple Connections in AODV with the concern\n  of Node bandwidth", "comments": "9 Pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal on AdHoc Networking Systems (IJANS) Vol. 2,\n  No. 3, July 2012", "doi": "10.5121/ijans.2012.23034", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETS) consists of a collection of mobile nodes\nwithout having a central coordination.

In this paper, we make the first known attempt\nto develop a distributed Newton's method, which is second-order and enjoys a\nquadratic convergence rate.

First, paths for\nanonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships\nbetween users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture relies\non a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we propose Pisces, a\ndecentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users'\nsocial links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an\napproach greatly improves the system's resilience to attackers.\n  A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to\ndiscover peers for use in a user's circuit. All existing solutions for secure\npeer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to\nunstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using\nrandom walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected\nnodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To\nsecure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if\nmalicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to\nimprove the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat\napproach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing\ntables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy,\nand use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.\n  Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network\ntopologies, we show that (a) the reciprocal neighbor policy mitigates active\nattacks that an adversary can perform, (b) our decentralized protocol to\nenforce this policy is secure and has low overhead, and (c) the overall\nanonymity provided by our system significantly outperforms existing approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 22:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mittal", "Prateek", ""], ["Wright", "Matthew", ""], ["Borisov", "Nikita", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6360", "submitter": "Qian Zhang", "authors": "Qian Zhang and Chenyang Yang", "title": "Transmission Mode Selection for Downlink Coordinated Multi-Point Systems", "comments": "7 pages, 6 figures, accepted as IEEE TVT correspondence", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission has been widely recognized as a\nspectrally efficient technique in future cellular systems.
