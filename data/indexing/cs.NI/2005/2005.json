Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial\nchallenges in wireless deep learning is to counteract the channel action, which\nmay significantly alter the waveform features. The problem is further\nexacerbated by the fact that deep learning algorithms are hardly re-trainable\nin real time due to their sheer size. This paper proposes DeepFIR, a framework\nto counteract the channel action in wireless deep learning algorithms without\nretraining the underlying deep learning model. The key intuition is that\nthrough the application of a carefully-optimized digital finite input response\nfilter (FIR) at the transmitter's side, we can apply tiny modifications to the\nwaveform to strengthen its features according to the current channel\nconditions. We mathematically formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP)\nas the problem of finding the optimum FIR to be used on a waveform to improve\nthe classifier's accuracy. We also propose a data-driven methodology to train\nthe FIRs directly with dataset inputs.

In FL, the central aggregator\naccumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model.\nHowever, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership\ninference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable\nparticipants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy\nleakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means\nof defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework\nto create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from\ninvolving in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and\nunreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend\nagainst poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy\ntechniques to prevent membership inference attacks.

The dynamics of bipartite\nentanglement is determined by the boundary of the bipartition; An operational\nwitness of multipartite entanglement, based on advantages in sensing tasks, is\nintroduced to characterize the multipartite entanglement growth.

To power backscattering-based and\nwireless-powered devices, the ISP has to contract with an energy service\nprovider (ESP). This article studies the strategic interactions between the ISP\nand its ESP and their implications on the joint optimal time scheduling and\nenergy trading for heterogeneous devices. To that end, we propose an economic\nframework using the Stackelberg game to maximize the network throughput and\nenergy efficiency of both the ISP and ESP. Specifically, the ISP leads the game\nby sending its optimal service time and energy price request (that maximizes\nits profit) to the ESP. The ESP then optimizes and supplies the transmission\npower which satisfies the ISP's request (while maximizing ESP's utility). To\nobtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply a backward induction\ntechnique which first derives a closed-form solution for the ESP. Then, to\ntackle the non-convex optimization problem for the ISP, we leverage the block\ncoordinate descent and convex-concave procedure techniques to design two\npartitioning schemes (i.e., partial adjustment (PA) and joint adjustment (JA))\nto find the optimal energy price and service time that constitute local SEs.\nNumerical results reveal that by jointly optimizing the energy trading and the\ntime allocation for heterogeneous IoT devices, one can achieve significant\nimprovements in terms of the ISP's profit compared with those of conventional\ntransmission methods. Different tradeoffs between the ESP's and ISP's profits\nand complexities of the PA/JA schemes can also be numerically tuned.\nSimulations also show that the obtained local SEs approach the socially optimal\nwelfare when the ISP's benefit per transmitted bit is higher than a given\nthreshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 13:51:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:00:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Ngoc-Tan", ""], ["Nguyen", "Diep N.", ""], ["Hoang", "Dinh Thai", ""], ["Van Huynh", "Nguyen", ""], ["Nguyen", "Nam-Hoang", ""], ["Nguyen", "Quoc-Tuan", ""], ["Dutkiewicz", "Eryk", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.14651", "submitter": "Muhammad Firdaus", "authors": "Muhammad Firdaus, Raditya Muhammad, Rifqy Hakimi", "title": "Implementation of Self-Organizing Network (SON) on Cellular Technology\n  base on Big Data Analytic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.13140/RG.2.2.22861.38880", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The development of cellular technology will be directly proportional to the\nincreasing requirement in various aspects, such as the speed of data\ntransmission (velocity), data variations (variety), and data storage media\n(volume).
