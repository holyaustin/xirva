In this paper, we propose to perform cross-layer\noptimization, based on an energy-aware rate adaptation scheme combined with a\nphysical layer that is able to properly adjust its processing effort to the\ndata rate and the channel conditions to minimize the energy consumption per\ninformation bit. This energy proportional behavior is enabled by extending the\nclassical system modes with additional configuration parameters at the various\nlayers. Fine grained models of the power consumption of the hardware are\ndeveloped to provide awareness of the physical layer capabilities to the medium\naccess control layer.

Then, a subset of these candidate deployment locations, which can\nguarantee the existence of paths connecting unconnected sensor nodes to the\nsink within delay constraint, is selected to deploy relay nodes based on the\nset covering method.

Since user association and resource\nallocation are tightly coupled not only on resource consumption of the base\nstations (BSs), but also in the constraints of their available energy and\nbackhaul, the closed-form solution is quite difficult to obtain. Thus, we solve\nthe problem distributively via employing some decomposition methods.\nSpecifically, at first, by adopting primal decomposition method, we decompose\nthe original problem into a lower-level resource allocation problem for each\nBS, and a higher-level user association problem. For the optimal resource\nallocation, we prove that a BS either assigns equal normalized resources or\nprovides equal long-term service rate to its served users. Then, the user\nassociation problem is solved by Lagrange dual decomposition method, and a\ncompletely distributed algorithm is developed. Moreover, applying results of\nthe subgradient method, we demonstrate the convergence of the proposed\ndistributed algorithm. Furthermore, in order to efficiently and reliably apply\nthe proposed algorithm to the future wireless networks with an extremely dense\nBS deployment, we design a virtual user association and resource allocation\nscheme based on the software-defined networking architecture.
