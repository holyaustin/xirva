For instance, a distributed storage system storing multiple replicas of\nthe data can serve a request from any of the multiple servers that store the\nrequested data, or a computational task may be performed in a compute-cluster\nby any one of multiple processors. In such systems, the latency of serving the\nrequests may potentially be reduced by sending \"redundant requests\": a request\nmay be sent to more servers than needed, and it is deemed served when the\nrequisite number of servers complete service. Such a mechanism trades off the\npossibility of faster execution of at least one copy of the request with the\nincrease in the delay due to an increased load on the system.

In MANETs,\nnodes have dual responsibilities of forwarding and routing, that's why it needs\nunison with nodes. To sort out non-cooperation a real life behavior should be\nimplemented, so that misbehavior is nullified. In this paper, we present the\n\"Mirror Model\" that strictly enforces cooperation due to its punishment\nstrategy. Node's behavior is watched by its neighbors in PON mode, to update\nthe NPF, NPRF values for a threshold time. After the expiry of the threshold\ntime each node calculates the PFR and broadcasts its neighbors. Similarly all\nneighbors broadcasted PFR is received and processed by the node to define the\n'G' and 'BP' values. The G value is used to isolate selfish nodes from the\nrouting paths and BP denotes the amount of packets to be dropped by an honest\nnode against a selfish node in spite of its misbehavior/packet drops.\nCooperation within the neighbors, certainly result in subsiding misbehavior of\nselfish nodes, therein enhancing cooperation of the whole MANET. This model\nensures honesty and reliability in MANET because it does not eliminate a node,\nbut it behaves in the same way as the node behaved. Therefore, it justifies its\nname, after all mirrors reflects the same.

The architecture should enable dynamic\nupdates when new IoT devices are incorporated into Internet, and changes are\nmade to the existing ones. Nowadays in Internet, the most used discovery\narchitecture is the Domain Name System (DNS). DNS offers a scalable solution\nthrough two distributed mechanisms: multicast DNS (mDNS) and DNS Service\nDirectory (DNS-SD). Both mechanisms have been applied to discover resources and\nservices in local IoT domains. However, a full architecture has not still been\ndesigned to support global discovery, local directories and a search engine for\nubiquitous IoT domains. Moreover, the architecture should provide other\ntransversal functionalities such as a common semantic for describing services\nand resources, and a service layer for interconnecting with M2M platforms and\nmobile clients. This paper presents an oriented-service architecture based on\nDNS to support a global discovery, local directories and a distributed search\nengine to enable a scalable looking-up of IoT resources and services. The\narchitecture provides two lightweight discovery mechanisms based on mDNS and\nDNS-SD that have been optimized for the constraints of IoT devices to allow\nautonomous registration.
