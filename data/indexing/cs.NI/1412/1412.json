RNMDP assumes each node is aware of its current location in the\nnetwork. The protocol works as follows: A RNM is broadcast in the neighborhood\nof the Risk Zone. A node receiving the RNM from another node waits for a\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time before deciding to rebroadcast the message. The\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time for a node is modeled based on the ratio of the distance\nbetween the node and the immediate sender of the RNM and the direction of\nmovement of the node. Priority for rebroadcast is given for nodes farthest away\nfrom the sender and traveling towards the Risk Zone. Nodes that are traveling\nin lanes in direction away from the Risk Zone are also considered for\nrebroadcast, albeit with a larger Rebroadcast-Wait-Time. During the\nRebroadcast-Wait-Time, if a node hears the same RNM again rebroadcast in the\nneighborhood, then the node stops from further broadcasting the message. If a\nnode does not hear the RNM in its neighborhood during the RebroadcastWait-Time,\nthe node broadcasts the message in its neighborhood. A RNM is considered to\nhave been delivered to all the vehicles in the road, if the message reaches the\nTarget Zone. The performance of RNMDP has been compared with that of the\ncommonly used flooding strategy through extensive simulations conducted for\nhighway networks with different number of lanes and lane density. Simulation\nresults indicate that with a slightly larger delay (i.e., no more than 35% of\nthe delay incurred for flooding), RNMDP can achieve the same message delivery\nratio attained by flooding, but at a relatively much lower energy loss compared\nto flooding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2014 22:08:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Meghanathan", "Natarajan", ""], ["Skelton", "Gordon", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.2181", "submitter": "Babatunji Omoniwa", "authors": "Omoniwa Babatunji and Riaz Hussain", "title": "Dwell Time Prediction Model for Minimizing Unnecessary Handovers in\n  Heterogenous Wireless Networks, Considering Amoebic Shaped Coverage Region", "comments": "Paper Submitted to Springer Journal of Mobile Networks and\n  Applications on 26th September, 2014.

For uplink under spectrum sharing, if all tiers\nhave the same target signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), distance-based user\nassociation is shown to be optimal under a variety of path loss and power\ncontrol settings. For both downlink and uplink, under orthogonal spectrum\npartition, it is shown that the optimal proportion of spectrum allocated to\neach tier should match the proportion of users associated with that tier.\nSimulations validate the analytical results. Under typical system parameters,\nsimulation results suggest that spectrum partition performs better for downlink\nin terms of utility, while spectrum sharing performs better for uplink with\npower control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 06:24:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yicheng", ""], ["Bao", "Wei", ""], ["Yu", "Wei", ""], ["Liang", "Ben", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5937", "submitter": "Xuangou Wu", "authors": "Xuangou Wu, Shaojie Tang, Panlong Yang", "title": "Low-Complexity Cloud Image Privacy Protection via Matrix Perturbation", "comments": "11 pages, 8 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cloud-assisted image services are widely used for various applications.

In\nthis paper, we consider a MIMO multicell system where multiple mobile users\n(MUs) ask for computation offloading to a common cloud server. We formulate the\noffloading problem as the joint optimization of the radio resources-the\ntransmit precoding matrices of the MUs-and the computational resources-the CPU\ncycles/second assigned by the cloud to each MU-in order to minimize the overall\nusers' energy consumption, while meeting latency constraints. The resulting\noptimization problem is nonconvex (in the objective function and constraints).\nNevertheless, in the single-user case, we are able to express the global\noptimal solution in closed form. In the more challenging multiuser scenario, we\npropose an iterative algorithm, based on a novel successive convex\napproximation technique, converging to a local optimal solution of the original\nnonconvex problem. Then, we reformulate the algorithm in a distributed and\nparallel implementation across the radio access points, requiring only a\nlimited coordination/signaling with the cloud. Numerical results show that the\nproposed schemes outperform disjoint optimization algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 18:31:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sardellitti", "Stefania", ""], ["Scutari", "Gesualdo", ""], ["Barbarossa", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8501", "submitter": "Eli A.

The detection\ninformation returned from a mobile node is meaningful only if its location is\nknown. In this paper, we propose two localization algorithms based on color\nfiltering technology called PCFL and ACFL. PCFL and ACFL aim at collaboratively\naccomplishing accurate localization of underwater mobile nodes with minimum\nenergy expenditure. They both adopt the overlapping signal region of task\nanchors which can communicate with the mobile node directly as the current\nsampling area. PCFL employs the projected distances between each of the task\nprojections and the mobile node, while ACFL adopts the direct distance between\neach of the task anchors and the mobile node. Also the proportion factor of\ndistance is proposed to weight the RGB values. By comparing the nearness\ndegrees of the RGB sequences between the samples and the mobile node, samples\ncan be filtered out. And the normalized nearness degrees are considered as the\nweighted standards to calculate coordinates of the mobile nodes. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed methods have excellent localization performance\nand can timely localize the mobile node. The average localization error of PCFL\ncan decline by about 30.4% than the AFLA method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 12:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Zhihua", ""], ["Gao", "Han", ""], ["Wang", "Wuling", ""], ["Chang", "Shuai", ""], ["Chen", "Jiaxing", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8708", "submitter": "Sanjay Goyal", "authors": "Sanjay Goyal, Pei Liu, Shivendra Panwar, Rui Yang, Robert A.

However, FD operation increases the\naggregate interference on each communication link, which limits the capacity\nimprovement. In this paper, we investigate how much of the potential doubling\ncan be practically achieved in the resource-managed, small multi-cellular\nsystem, similar to the TDD variant of LTE, both in indoor and outdoor\nenvironments, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD user equipment (UEs). We\nfocus on low-powered small cellular systems, because they are more suitable for\nFD operation given practical self-interference cancellation limits. A joint UE\nselection and power allocation method for a multi-cell scenario is presented,\nwhere a hybrid scheduling policy assigns FD timeslots when it provides a\nthroughput advantage by pairing UEs with appropriate power levels to mitigate\nthe mutual interference, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. Due to the\ncomplexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the proposed algorithm,\na sub-optimal method based on a heuristic greedy algorithm for UE selection,\nand a novel solution using geometric programming for power allocation, is\nproposed. With practical self-interference cancellation, antennas and circuits,\nit is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves as much as 94%\nthroughput improvement in the downlink, and 92% in the uplink, compared to a HD\nsystem in an indoor multi-cell scenario and 54% in downlink and 61% in uplink\nin an outdoor multi-cell scenario. Further, we also compare the energy\nefficiency of FD operation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 17:55:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 00:56:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 21:31:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 17:23:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 04:31:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Goyal", "Sanjay", ""], ["Liu", "Pei", ""], ["Panwar", "Shivendra", ""], ["Yang", "Rui", ""], ["DiFazio", "Robert A.", ""], ["Bala", "Erdem", ""]]}]
