Based on this analysis, we develop load adaptive algorithms\nthat can pick the best code rate on a per request basis by using off-line\ncomputed queue backlog thresholds. The solutions work with homogeneous services\nwith fixed object sizes, chunk sizes, operation type (e.g., read or write) as\nwell as heterogeneous services with mixture of object sizes, chunk sizes, and\noperation types. We also present a simple greedy solution that\nopportunistically uses idle connections and picks the erasure coding rate\naccordingly on the fly. Both backlog and greedy solutions support the full rate\nregion and provide best mean delay performance when compared to the best fixed\ncoding rate policy. Our evaluations show that backlog based solutions achieve\nbetter delay performance at higher percentile values than the greedy solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 18:25:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 01:18:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Liang", "Guanfeng", ""], ["Kozat", "Ulas C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.1746", "submitter": "Yulong Shen", "authors": "Yulong Shen, Xiaohong Jiang and Jianfeng Ma", "title": "Generalized Secure Transmission Protocol for Flexible Load-Balance\n  Control with Cooperative Relays in Two-Hop Wireless Networks", "comments": "15 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1212.0287, arXiv:1212.6627, arXiv:1211.7075", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This work considers secure transmission protocol for flexible load-balance\ncontrol in two-hop relay wireless networks without the information of both\neavesdropper channels and locations.

The expectations for next generations on issues like throughput,\nrange, reliability, and power consumption are even higher. This is quite a\nchallenge considering all the work already done. Cross-layer optimization of\nphysical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers can be an interesting\nexploration path for further enhancement. During this thesis we have studied\ncross-layer optimization techniques, with a focus on the IEEE 802.11ac\nstandard. A new multichannel aggregation scheme involving cross-knowledge\nbetween PHY and MAC layers has been proposed to improve performance in\ncollision-prone environments. We have shown that some functionalities directly\ninvolved PHY and MAC layers. An accurate modeling of both PHY and MAC\nmechanisms is thus needed to have a realistic characterization of such\nfunctionalities. A cross-layer simulator, compliant with IEEE 802.11ac\nspecifications, has thus been implemented. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first simulator incorporating detailed PHY and MAC functionalities for\nthe IEEE 802.11ac standard. The multiple-user multiple-input, multiple-output\n(MU-MIMO) technique, which is one of the main innovations of the IEEE 802.11ac,\nneeds both PHY and MAC layer considerations. We have thus used the implemented\ncross-layer simulator to evaluate the performance of MU-MIMO and compared it\nwith the single-user MIMO (SU-MIMO). The aim of these studies was to evaluate\nthe 'real' gains of MU-MIMO solutions (accounting for PHY+MAC) over SU-MIMO\nsolutions and not the generally accepted ones. The impact of the channel\nsounding interval has particularly been studied. Finally, we have proposed a\nshort PHY layer version of acknowledgment frames for overhead reduction in IEEE\n802.11ah communications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jan 2013 21:10:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Redieteab", "Getachew", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.4732", "submitter": "Nicolas Kuhn M.", "authors": "Nicolas Kuhn, Olivier Mehani, Huyen-Chi Bui, Jerome Lacan, Jose Radzik\n  and Emmanuel Lochin", "title": "Physical Channel Access (PCA): Time and Frequency Access Methods\n  Emulation in NS-2", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an NS-2 module, Physical Channel Access (PCA), to simulate\ndifferent access methods on a link shared with Multi-Frequency Time Division\nMultiple Access (MF-TDMA).

Such time- invariant properties are generally\ninteresting, because they tend to reflect some fundamental processes or\nconstraints behind Internet growth. As has been shown before, the\ntime-invariant structural properties of the Internet include some most basic\nones, such as the degree distribution or clustering. Here we add to this\ntime-invariant list a non-trivial property - k-dense decomposition. This\nproperty is derived from a recursive form of edge multiplicity, defined as the\nnumber of triangles that share a given edge. We show that after proper\nnormalization, the k- dense decomposition of the Internet has remained stable\nover the last decade, even though the Internet size has approximately doubled,\nand so has the k-density of its k-densest core. This core consists mostly of\ncontent providers peering at Internet eXchange Points, and it only loosely\noverlaps with the high-degree or high-rank AS core, consisting mostly of tier-1\ntransit providers. We thus show that high degrees and high k-densities reflect\ntwo different Internet-specific properties of ASes (transit versus content\nproviders). As a consequence, even though degrees and k-densities of nodes are\ncorrelated, the relative fluctuations are strong, and related to that, random\ngraphs with the same degree distribution or even degree correlations as in the\nInternet, do not reproduce its k-dense decomposition. Therefore an interesting\nopen question is what Internet topology models or generators can fully explain\nor at least reproduce the k-dense properties of the Internet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2013 01:10:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 01:16:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Aug 2013 20:09:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Oct 2013 16:48:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 18:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Orsini", "Chiara", ""], ["Gregori", "Enrico", ""], ["Lenzini", "Luciano", ""], ["Krioukov", "Dmitri", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5993", "submitter": "Majed ValadBeigi", "authors": "Farshad Safaei and Majed ValadBeigi", "title": "A Probabilistic Approach to Analysis of Reliability in n-D Meshes with\n  Interconnect Router Failures", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications\n  (IJCNC) Vol.3, No.4, July 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The routing algorithms for parallel computers, on-chip networks, multi-core\nprocessors, and multiprocessors system-on-chip (MP-SoCs) exhibit router\nfailures must be able to handle interconnect router failures that render a\nsymmetrical mesh non-symmetrically.

There is the\ncommon believe that those devices are of special interest for attackers due to\ntheir limited resources and the serious data they store. On the other hand, the\nmobile regime is a very lively network environment, which misses the (limited)\nground truth we have in commonly connected Internet nodes. In this paper we\nargue for a simple long-term measurement infrastructure that allows for (1) the\nanalysis of unsolicited traffic to and from mobile devices and (2) fair\ncomparison with wired Internet access. We introduce the design and\nimplementation of a mobile honeypot, which is deployed on standard hardware for\nmore than 1.5 years. Two independent groups developed the same concept for the\nsystem.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a quality of monitoring (QoM) metric defined by the expected number\nof active users monitored, and investigate the problem of maximizing QoM by\njudiciously assigning sniffers to channels based on the knowledge of user\nactivities in a multi-channel wireless network. Two types of capture models are\nconsidered. The user-centric model assumes frame-level capturing capability of\nsniffers such that the activities of different users can be distinguished while\nthe sniffer-centric model only utilizes the binary channel information (active\nor not) at a sniffer. For the user-centric model, we show that the implied\noptimization problem is NP-hard, but a constant approximation ratio can be\nattained via polynomial complexity algorithms. For the sniffer-centric model,\nwe devise stochastic inference schemes to transform the problem into the\nuser-centric domain, where we are able to apply our polynomial approximation\nalgorithms. The effectiveness of our proposed schemes and algorithms is further\nevaluated using both synthetic data as well as real-world traces from an\noperational WLAN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 02:42:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Huy", ""], ["Scalosub", "Gabriel", ""], ["Zheng", "Rong", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7517", "submitter": "Abhishek Chanda", "authors": "Abhishek Chanda, Cedric Westphal, Dipankar Raychaudhuri", "title": "Content Based Traffic Engineering in Software Defined Information\n  Centric Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes a content centric network architecture which uses\nsoftware defined networking principles to implement efficient metadata driven\nservices by extracting content metadata at the network layer.
