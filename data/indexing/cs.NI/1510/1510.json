All\nacoustic sensor nodes in a cluster are allocated to time slots and the number\nof allocated sensor nodes to each time slot is uniform. All sensor nodes\nallocated to a time slot listen for packet transmission from the beginning of\nthe time slot for a duration proportional to their priority.

Therefore, when many broadcasting video\nsessions are active, the bandwidth per video session can be allocated based on\npopularity of the video sessions (programs).

Our core contribution\nis a powerful model which combines three dimensional information (time,\nlocations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum) to extract and model the\ntraffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers.
