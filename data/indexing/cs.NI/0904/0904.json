The optimality of sub-paths\nensures consistency of hop by hop forwarding although paths, calculated using\nDijkstra algorithm, are recursively composed. According to the link metric, the\ndiversity of existing paths can be underestimated using only best paths. Hence,\nit reduces potential benefits of multipath applications such as load balancing\nand fast rerouting. In this paper, we propose a low time complexity multipath\ncomputation algorithm able to calculate at least two paths with a different\nfirst hop between all pairs of nodes in the network if such next hops exist.\nUsing real and generated topologies, we evaluate and compare the complexity of\nour proposition with several techniques.

We quantify the\nimpact of Byzantine attacks on the coded system by evaluating the probability\nthat a receiver node fails to correctly recover a file. We show that even for a\nsmall probability of attack, the system fails with overwhelming probability. We\nthen propose a novel signature scheme that allows packet-level Byzantine\ndetection. This scheme allows one-hop containment of the contamination, and\nsaves bandwidth by allowing nodes to detect and drop the contaminated packets.\nWe compare the net cost of our signature scheme with various other Byzantine\nschemes, and show that when the probability of Byzantine attacks is high, our\nscheme is the most bandwidth efficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2009 15:31:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "MinJi", ""], ["Lima", "Lu\u00edsa", ""], ["Zhao", "Fang", ""], ["Barros", "Joao", ""], ["Medard", "Muriel", ""], ["Koetter", "Ralf", ""], ["Kalker", "Ton", ""], ["Han", "Keesook", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2733", "submitter": "Cl\\'emence Magnien", "authors": "Fabien Viger (1), Brice Augustin (1), Xavier Cuvellier (1), Clemence\n  Magnien (1), Matthieu Latapy (1), Timur Friedman (1), and Renata Teixeira (1)\n  ((1) LIP6 (CNRS - UPMC))", "title": "Detection, Understanding, and Prevention of Traceroute Measurement\n  Artifacts", "comments": "Computer Networks 52-5 (2008), pp. 998-1018.

Our algorithm operates\nat a coarse-grain level, using atomic pairwise interactions in a way akin to\nrecent population protocol models. The algorithm relies on a perpetual\nalternation of \\emph{topology-induced splittings} and \\emph{computation-induced\nmergings} of a forest of spanning trees. Each tree in the forest hosts exactly\none token (also called root) that performs a random walk {\\em inside} the tree,\nswitching parent-child relationships as it crosses edges. When two tokens are\nlocated on both sides of a same edge, their trees are merged upon this edge and\none token disappears. Whenever an edge that belongs to a tree disappears, its\nchild endpoint regenerates a new token instantly. The main features of this\napproach is that both \\emph{merging} and \\emph{splitting} are purely localized\nphenomenons. In this paper, we present and motivate the algorithm, and we prove\nits correctness in arbitrary dynamic networks. Then we discuss several\nimplementation choices around this general principle.

This reveals\nthat the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for\n$\\gamma>1/m^2$, and paves the way for the following unifying result.\n  The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed\nprocesses is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate\nbackoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scale on which we\nview the backoff processes. While the aggregation on normal time-scales leads\nto a Poisson process, it is approximated by a new limiting process possessing\nlong-range dependence (LRD) on coarse time-scales.
