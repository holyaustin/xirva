With the model, we focus on minimizing a performance metric, stall\nduration tail probability (SDTP), and present a novel, yet efficient, algorithm\nto solve the formulated optimization problem. The theoretical bounds with\nrespect to the SDTP metric are also analyzed and presented. Our extensive\nsimulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms can significantly\nimprove the SDTP metric, compared to the baseline strategies. Small-scale video\nstreaming system implementation in a real cloud environment further validates\nour results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2018 10:24:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Alabbasi", "Abubakr", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""], ["Lan", "Tian", ""], ["Xiang", "Yu", ""], ["Ra", "Moo-Ryong", ""], ["Chen", "Yih-Farn R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.01163", "submitter": "Ramy Amer Mr", "authors": "Ramy Amer, M.

The proposed idea is based on the intuition that the vibrations\nexperienced by the passenger during traveling with different transportation\nmodes are distinctive. Thus, voltage signal generated by the energy harvesting\ndevices should contain sufficient features to distinguish different\ntransportation modes. We evaluate our system using over 28 hours of data, which\nis collected by eight individuals using a practical energy harvesting\nprototype. The evaluation results demonstrate that EnTrans is able to achieve\nan overall accuracy over 92% in classifying five different modes while saving\nmore than 34% of the system power compared to conventional accelerometer-based\napproaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2018 06:14:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2019 20:08:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Lan", "Guohao", ""], ["Xu", "Weitao", ""], ["Ma", "Dong", ""], ["Khalifa", "Sara", ""], ["Hassan", "Mahbub", ""], ["Hu", "Wen", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.02307", "submitter": "Vincenzo Sciancalepore", "authors": "Vincenzo Sciancalepore and Faqir Zarrar Yousaf and Xavier Costa-Perez", "title": "z-TORCH: An Automated NFV Orchestration and Monitoring Solution", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 14\n  pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Autonomous management and orchestration (MANO) of virtualized resources and\nservices, especially in large-scale Network Function Virtualization (NFV)\nenvironments, is a big challenge owing to the stringent delay and performance\nrequirements expected of a variety of network services.

In this paper, a real-time IoT monitoring system\nis considered, in which the IoT devices sample a physical process with a\nsampling cost and send the status packet to a given destination with an\nupdating cost. This joint status sampling and updating process is designed to\nminimize the average age of information (AoI) at the destination node under an\naverage energy cost constraint at each device. This is formulated as an\ninfinite horizon average cost constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) and\ntransformed into an unconstrained MDP using a Lagrangian method.

Therefore, security measures need to be taken into\naccount for the design of such systems. Within this work, an approach for the\nsecurity architecture of local wireless systems with respect to the needs of\ncontrol applications is presented and discussed. Further, new security\nsolutions based on Physical Layer Security are introduced in order to overcome\nthe drawbacks of state of the art security technologies within that scope.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:01:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Weinand", "Andreas", ""], ["Karrenbauer", "Michael", ""], ["Schotten", "Hans D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11607", "submitter": "Wolfgang Fink", "authors": "Tzyy-Juin Kao and Wolfgang Fink", "title": "Pareto-Optimization Framework for Automated Network-on-Chip Design", "comments": "25 pages (1.5 line spacing), 8 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.DC cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advent of multi-core processors, network-on-chip design has been key\nin addressing network performances, such as bandwidth, power consumption, and\ncommunication delays when dealing with on-chip communication between the\nincreasing number of processor cores. As the numbers of cores increase, network\ndesign becomes more complex. Therefore, there is a critical need in soliciting\ncomputer aid in determining network configurations that afford optimal\nperformance given resources and design constraints. We propose a\nPareto-optimization framework that explores the space of possible network\nconfigurations to determine optimal network latencies, power consumption, and\nthe corresponding link allocations. For a given number of routers, average\nnetwork latency and power consumption as example performance objectives can be\ndisplayed in form of Pareto-optimal fronts, thus not only offering a design\ntool, but also enabling trade-off studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 23:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kao", "Tzyy-Juin", ""], ["Fink", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11621", "submitter": "Saeed Vahidian", "authors": "Saeed Vahidian, Sajad Hatamnia, and Benoit Champagne", "title": "On the Security Analysis of a Cooperative Incremental Relaying Protocol\n  in the Presence of an Active Eavesdropper", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CR", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Physical layer security offers an efficient means to decrease the risk of\nconfidential information leakage through wiretap links. In this paper, we\naddress the physical-layer security in a cooperative wireless subnetwork that\nincludes a source-destination pair and multiple relays, exchanging information\nin the presence of a malevolent eavesdropper. Specifically, the eavesdropper is\nactive in the network and transmits artificial noise (AN) with a\nmultiple-antenna transmitter to confound both the relays and the destination.\nWe first analyse the secrecy capacity of the direct source-to-destination\ntransmission in terms of intercept probability (IP) and secrecy outage\nprobability (SOP). A decode-and-forward incremental relaying (IR) protocol is\nthen introduced to improve reliability and security of communications in the\npresence of the active eavesdropper. Within this context, and depending on the\navailability of channel state information, three different schemes (one optimal\nand two sub-optimal) are proposed to select a trusted relay to improve the\nachievable secrecy rate. For each one of these schemes, and for both selection\nand maximum ratio combining at the destination and eavesdropper, we derive new\nand exact closed-form expressions for the IP and SOP. Our analysis and\nsimulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nIR-based selection schemes for secure communication. They also confirm the\nexistence of a floor phenomenon for the SOP in the absence of AN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:12:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Oct 2019 22:49:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Vahidian", "Saeed", ""], ["Hatamnia", "Sajad", ""], ["Champagne", "Benoit", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11623", "submitter": "Zohreh Ovaisi", "authors": "Zohreh Ovaisi, Natasha Devroye, Hulya Seferoglu, Besma Smida, Daniela\n  Tuninetti", "title": "On Erasure Broadcast Channels with Hard Deadlines", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers packet scheduling over a broadcast channel with packet\nerasures to multiple receivers with different messages (multiple uni-cast) each\nwith possibly different hard deadline constraints. A novel metric is proposed\nand evaluated: the global deadline outage probability, which gives the\nprobability that the hard communication deadline is not met for at least one of\nthe receivers. The cut-set upper bound is derived and a scheduling policy is\nproposed to determine which receiver's packets should be sent in each time\nslot. This policy is shown to be optimal among all scheduling policies, i.e.,\nit achieves all boundary points of cut-set upper bounds when the transmitter\nknows the erasure patterns for all the receivers ahead of making the scheduling\ndecision. An expression for the global deadline outage probability is obtained\nfor two receivers and is plotted and interpreted for various system parameters.\nThese plots are not Monte-Carlo simulations, and hence the obtained expression\nmay be used in the design of future downlink broadcast networks. Future\nextensions to per-user deadline outage probabilities as well as to scenarios\nwith causal knowledge of the channel states are briefly discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 01:26:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ovaisi", "Zohreh", ""], ["Devroye", "Natasha", ""], ["Seferoglu", "Hulya", ""], ["Smida", "Besma", ""], ["Tuninetti", "Daniela", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11861", "submitter": "Michael Eiselt", "authors": "Michael Eiselt, Annika Dochhan, Joerg-Peter Elbers", "title": "Data Center Interconnects at 400G and Beyond", "comments": "This project has received funding from the European Union Horizon\n  2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 762055\n  (BlueSpace project) and from the German ministry of education and research\n  (BMBF) under contract 16KIS0477K (SENDATE Secure-DCI project)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/OECC.2018.8730011", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Current trends in Data Center Interconnectivity are considered in the light\nof increasing traffic and under the constraint of limited cost and power\nconsumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:12:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Eiselt", "Michael", ""], ["Dochhan", "Annika", ""], ["Elbers", "Joerg-Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.11915", "submitter": "Adnan Aijaz", "authors": "Adnan Aijaz, Zaher Dawy, Nikolaos Pappas, Meryem Simsek, Sharief\n  Oteafy, Oliver Holland", "title": "Toward a Tactile Internet Reference Architecture: Vision and Progress of\n  the IEEE P1918.1 Standard", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The term Tactile Internet broadly refers to a communication network which is\ncapable of delivering control, touch, and sensing/actuation information in\nreal-time.
