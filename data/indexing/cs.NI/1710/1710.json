In CBRT, the inputs of the\nfuzzy logic system are the relative variance (rv) of the metrics rather than\nthe values of the metrics, which reduces the number of fuzzy rules\ndramatically. Moreover, the number of fuzzy rules does not increase when the\nnumber of inputs increases. For reducing the control cost, in CBRT, the node\ndegree in the candidate relays set is a range rather than a constant number.\nThe nodes are divided into different categories based on their node degree in\nthe candidate relays set. The nodes adjust their transmission range based on\nwhich categories that they belong to. Additionally, for investigating the\neffection of the node mobility on routing performance, we propose a link\nlifetime prediction algorithm which takes both the moving speed and moving\ndirection into account. In CBRT, the source node determines the relaying\npriorities of the relaying nodes based on their utilities. The relaying node\nwhich the utility is large will have high priority to relay the data packet. By\nthese innovations, the network performance in CBRT is much better than that in\nExOR, however, the computation complexity is not increased in CBRT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 21:52:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 May 2018 10:57:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ning", ""], ["Martinez-Ortega", "Jose-Fernan", ""], ["Diaz", "Vicente Hernandez", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.00115", "submitter": "Rafael B Lourenco", "authors": "Rafael B.

An important\nconsideration is fairness between Wi-Fi and duty cycled LTE-U, which is often\ndefined in terms of channel access time, as adopted by the LTE-U Forum. Despite\nmany studies on duty cycle adaptation design for fair sharing, one crucial fact\nhas often been neglected: LTE-U systems unilaterally control LTE-U duty cycles;\nhence, as self- interested users, they have incentives to misbehave, e.g.,\ntransmitting with a larger duty cycle that exceeds a given limit, so as to gain\na greater share in channel access time and throughput. In this paper, we\npropose a scheme that allows the spectrum manager managing the shared bands to\nestimate the duty cycle of a target LTE-U cell based on PHY layer observations\nfrom a nearby Wi-Fi AP, without interrupting normal Wi-Fi operations. We\nfurther propose a thresholding scheme to detect duty cycling misbehavior (i.e.,\ndetermining if the duty cycle exceeds the assigned limit), and analyze its\nperformance in terms of detection and false alarm probabilities.

The key feature that distinguishes the FC paradigm for smart\ncities is that it spreads communication and computing resources over the\nwired/wireless access network (e.g., proximate access points and base stations)\nto provide resource augmentation (e.g., cyberforaging) for resource and\nenergy-limited wired/wireless (possibly mobile) things. Moreover, smart city\napplications are developed with the goal of improving the management of urban\nflows and allowing real-time responses to challenges that can arise in users'\ntransactional relationships. This article presents a Fog-supported smart city\nnetwork architecture called Fog Computing Architecture Network (FOCAN), a\nmulti-tier structure in which the applications running on things jointly\ncompute, route, and communicate with one another through the smart city\nenvironment to decrease latency and improve energy provisioning and the\nefficiency of services among things with different capabilities. An important\nconcern that arises with the introduction of FOCAN is the need to avoid\ntransferring data to/from distant things and instead to cover the nearest\nregion for an IoT application. We define three types of communications between\nFOCAN devices (e.g., interprimary, primary, and secondary communication) to\nmanage applications in a way that meets the quality of service standards for\nthe IoE. One of the main advantages of FOCAN is that the devices can provide\nthe services with low energy usage and in an efficient manner.

At first, it adopts a cross-layer\noptimized design for discovery of services that is based on simultaneous\ndiscovery of services and corresponding routes. Secondly, it provides a\nmulti-level ontology-based approach to describe the services. This resolves the\nissue of semantic interoperability among the service consumers in a scalable\nfashion. Finally, to further optimize the performance of the discovery process,\nHANDY recommends exploiting the inherent associations present among the\nservices. These associations are used in two ways. First, periodic service\nadvertisements are performed based on these associations. In addition, when a\nresponse of a service discovery request is generated, correlated services are\nalso attached with the response.

By reducing the size of cells, operators can pack\nmore (low-power) base stations in an area to better serve the growing demands,\nwithout causing extra interference. However, this approach suffers from low\nspectrum temporal efficiency. When a cell becomes smaller and covers fewer\nusers, its total traffic fluctuates significantly due to insufficient traffic\naggregation and exhibiting a large \"peak-to-mean\" ratio. As operators\ncustomarily provision spectrum for peak traffic, large traffic temporal\nfluctuation inevitably leads to low spectrum temporal efficiency. In this\npaper, we advocate device-to-device (D2D) load-balancing as a useful mechanism\nto address the fundamental drawback of small-cell architecture. The idea is to\nshift traffic from a congested cell to its adjacent under-utilized cells by\nleveraging inter-cell D2D communication, so that the traffic can be served\nwithout using extra spectrum, effectively improving the spectrum temporal\nefficiency. We provide theoretical modeling and analysis to characterize the\nbenefit of D2D load balancing, in terms of total spectrum requirements of all\nindividual cells. We also derive the corresponding cost, in terms of incurred\nD2D traffic overhead. We carry out empirical evaluations based on real-world 4G\ndata traces to gauge the benefit and cost of D2D load balancing under practical\nsettings.

It was noted that Suricata could process a higher speed of\nnetwork traffic than Snort with lower packet drop rate but it consumed higher\ncomputational resources. Snort had higher detection accuracy and was thus\nselected for further experiments. It was observed that the Snort triggered a\nhigh rate of false positive alarms. To solve this problem a Snort adaptive\nplug-in was developed. To select the best performing algorithm for Snort\nadaptive plug-in, an empirical study was carried out with different learning\nalgorithms and Support Vector Machine (SVM) was selected. A hybrid version of\nSVM and Fuzzy logic produced a better detection accuracy.

SD-WISE has several unique features making it a\nflexible and expandable solution that can be applied in heterogeneous\napplication domains. Its fundamental feature is that it provides software\nabstractions of the nodes' resources on both the controller and the nodes\nsides. By leveraging these abstractions, SD-WISE (i) extends the Software\nDefined Networking (SDN) approach to WSNs, introducing a more flexible way to\ndefine flows as well as the possibility to control the duty cycles of the node\nradios to increase energy efficiency; (ii) enables network function\nvirtualization (NFV) in WSNs; (iii) leverages the tight interplay between\ntrusted hardware and software to support regulation compliant behavior of\nsensor nodes. In this paper SD-WISE is introduced, its major operations are\ndescribed, and its features are demonstrated in three relevant scenarios, thus\nassessing the effectiveness of the approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Oct 2017 10:06:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Anadiotis", "Angelos-Christos G.", ""], ["Galluccio", "Laura", ""], ["Milardo", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Morabito", "Giacomo", ""], ["Palazzo", "Sergio", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.09303", "submitter": "Ramviyas Parasuraman", "authors": "Sergio Caccamo, Ramviyas Parasuraman, Luigi Freda, Mario Gianni,\n  Petter \\\"Ogren", "title": "RCAMP: A Resilient Communication-Aware Motion Planner for Mobile Robots\n  with Autonomous Repair of Wireless Connectivity", "comments": "IROS 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO cs.LG cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile robots, be it autonomous or teleoperated, require stable communication\nwith the base station to exchange valuable information.
