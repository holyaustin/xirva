While load-balanced switches can achieve\nsuch scalability, they suffer from a fundamental packet reordering problem.\nExisting proposals either suffer from poor worst-case packet delays or require\nsophisticated matching mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a new family of\nstable load-balanced switches called \"Sprinklers\" that has comparable\nimplementation cost and performance as the baseline load-balanced switch, but\nyet can guarantee packet ordering. The main idea is to force all packets within\nthe same virtual output queue (VOQ) to traverse the same \"fat path\" through the\nswitch, so that packet reordering cannot occur. At the core of Sprinklers are\ntwo key innovations: a randomized way to determine the \"fat path\" for each VOQ,\nand a way to determine its \"fatness\" roughly in proportion to the rate of the\nVOQ. These innovations enable Sprinklers to achieve near-perfect load-balancing\nunder arbitrary admissible traffic. Proving this property rigorously using\nnovel worst-case large deviation techniques is another key contribution of this\nwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 01:31:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jul 2014 22:19:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Weijun", ""], ["Xu", "Jim", ""], ["Dai", "Jim", ""], ["Song", "Yang", ""], ["Lin", "Bill", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0009", "submitter": "Sumalatha  G", "authors": "G.

As the {\\em cache hit ratio} increases, most of\nthe users' requests can be satisfied locally without incurring traffic over the\nbackhaul. To make informed caching decisions, the mobility patterns of users\nmust be carefully considered as users might frequently migrate from one small\ncell to another. We study the issue of mobility-aware content caching, which is\nformulated into an optimization problem with the objective to maximize the\ncaching utility. As the problem is NP-complete, we develop a polynomial-time\nheuristic solution termed {\\em MobiCacher} with bounded approximation ratio.

MC-CDMA system is a multicarrier system in which\nsingle wideband frequency selective carrier is converted into parallel\nnarrowband flat fading multiple sub-carriers to optimize the performance of\nsystem. Now this system further improved by combination of 2*4 MIMO (Multiple\nInput Multiple Output) system which utilizes ZF (Zero Forcing) decoder at the\nreceiver to reduce BER and also half rate convolutionally encoded Alamouti STBC\n(Space Time Block Code) block code as transmit diversity of MIMO for multiple\ntransmission of data through multiple transmit antenna. Main advantage of using\nMIMO-MC-CDMA using convolution code is to reduce the complexity of system and\nto reduce BER with increased gain.

To tackle these challenges, cloud-based cellular architectures have been\nproposed where virtual base stations (VBSs) play a key role. VBSs bring further\nenergy savings but also demands a new energy consumption model as well as the\noptimization of computational resources. This paper studies the energy-delay\ntradeoffs of VBSs with delay tolerant traffic. We propose a\ncomputational-resource-aware energy consumption model to capture the total\nenergy consumption of a VBS and reflect the dynamic allocation of computational\nresources including the number of CPU cores and the CPU speed. Based on the\nmodel, we analyze the energy-delay tradeoffs of a VBS considering BS sleeping\nand state switching cost to minimize the weighted sum of power consumption and\naverage delay. We derive the explicit form of the optimal data transmission\nrate and find the condition under which the energy optimal rate exists and is\nunique. Opportunities to reduce the average delay and achieve energy savings\nsimultaneously are observed. We further propose an efficient algorithm to\njointly optimize the data rate and the number of CPU cores. Numerical results\nvalidate our theoretical analyses and under a typical simulation setting we\nfind more than 60% energy savings can be achieved by VBSs compared with\nconventional base stations under the EARTH model, which demonstrates the great\npotential of VBSs in 5G cellular systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jul 2014 00:45:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 15:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Tao", ""], ["Wu", "Jian", ""], ["Zhou", "Sheng", ""], ["Niu", "Zhisheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.2323", "submitter": "Guillaume Ducoffe", "authors": "Mathias Lecuyer, Guillaume Ducoffe, Francis Lan, Andrei Papancea,\n  Theofilos Petsios, Riley Spahn, Augustin Chaintreau, and Roxana Geambasu", "title": "XRay: Enhancing the Web's Transparency with Differential Correlation", "comments": "Extended version of a paper presented at the 23rd USENIX Security\n  Symposium (USENIX Security 14)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Today's Web services - such as Google, Amazon, and Facebook - leverage user\ndata for varied purposes, including personalizing recommendations, targeting\nadvertisements, and adjusting prices.

Thus that localization accuracy depends on\nthe model which describes the relationship between RSS loss caused by\nobstruction and the position of the target.

One of their aims has been to replace the\nfirst generation of file sharing software with scalable peer-to-peer\narchitectures. On other fronts, the same techniques are applied, for example,\nto content delivery networks, streaming networks, cooperative caches,\ndistributed file systems, and grid computing architectures for scientific use.\nThis trend has emerged because with cooperative peers it is possible to\nasymptotically enhance the use of resouces in sharing of data compared to the\nbasic client-server architecture.\n  The need for distribution of data is wide and one could argue that it is as\nfundamental a building block as the message passing of the Internet. As an\nanswer to this need a new scalable architecture is introduced: Hybrid\nCommunication Architecture (HCA), which provides both data sharing and message\npassing as communication primitives for applications. HCA can be regarded as an\nabstraction layer for communication which is further encapsulated by a\nhigher-level middleware.

The flat-rate pricing encourages the\nmaximum usage, while the usage-based pricing can flexibly attract more users\nespecially those with low valuations in mobile Internet access. First, we use\ntheoretical analysis to compare the two schemes and show that for a single\nprovider in a market, as long as the WiFi capacity is abundant, the flat-rate\npricing leads to more revenue. Second, we study how a global provider (e.g.,\nSkype) collaborates with this monopolist in each local market to provide a\nglobal WiFi service. We formulate {the interactions between the global and\nlocal providers as a dynamic game. In Stage I, the global provider bargains\nwith the local provider in each market to determine the global WiFi service\nprice and revenue sharing agreement. In Stage II, local users and travelers\nchoose local or global WiFi services. We analytically show that the global\nprovider prefers to use the usage-based pricing to avoid a severe competition\nwith the local provider. At the equilibrium, the global provider always shares\nthe majority of his revenue with the local provider to incentivize the\ncooperation. Finally, we analytically study how the interaction changes if the\nlocal market has more than one local provider. In this case, the global\nprovider can integrate the coverages of multiple local providers and provide a\nbetter service. Compared to the local monopoly case, local market competition\nenables the global provider to share less revenue with each of the local\nproviders. However, we numerically show that the global provider's revenue\ncould decrease, as he shares his revenue with more providers and can only\ncharge a lower price.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 15:57:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Duan", "Lingjie", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""], ["Shou", "Biying", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.4489", "submitter": "Urs Niesen", "authors": "Urs Niesen, Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali", "title": "Coded Caching for Delay-Sensitive Content", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": "IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC), pp. 5559 -\n  5564, June 2015", "doi": "10.1109/ICC.2015.7249208", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coded caching is a recently proposed technique that achieves significant\nperformance gains for cache networks compared to uncoded caching schemes.\nHowever, this substantial coding gain is attained at the cost of large delivery\ndelay, which is not tolerable in delay-sensitive applications such as video\nstreaming.

In this paper, we\nhave proposed a traffic load balancing framework that strives a balance between\nnetwork utilities, e.g., the average traffic delivery latency, and the green\nenergy utilization. Various properties of the proposed framework have been\nderived. Leveraging the software-defined radio access network architecture, the\nproposed scheme is implemented as a virtually distributed algorithm, which\nsignificantly reduces the communication overheads between users and BSs. The\nsimulation results show that the proposed traffic load balancing framework\nenables an adjustable trade-off between the on-grid power consumption and the\naverage traffic delivery latency, and saves a considerable amount of on-grid\npower, e.g., 30%, at a cost of only a small increase, e.g., 8%, of the average\ntraffic delivery latency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2014 17:14:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 18:42:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 22:56:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Tao", ""], ["Ansari", "Nirwan", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8056", "submitter": "Fabio Ricciato", "authors": "Nicolo' Facchi, Francesco Gringoli, Fabio Ricciato, Andrea Toma", "title": "Emitter Localisation from Reception Timestamps in Asynchronous Networks", "comments": "To appear in Computer Networks", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.comnet.2015.06.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We address the problem of localising a mobile terminal (\"blind\" node) in\nunknown position from a set of \"anchor\" nodes in known positions. The proposed\nmethod does not require any form of node synchronisation nor measurement (or\ncontrol) of the transmission times, which is difficult or anyway costly to\nachieve in practice. It relies exclusively on reception timestamps collected by\nthe anchor nodes, according to their local clocks, that overhear packets\ntransmitted by the blind node and by (at least one) other transmitting node(s)\nin known position, e.g., other anchors. The clock differences between the nodes\nare not eliminated ex ante through clock synchronisation, as in traditional ToA\nand TDoA methods. Instead, they are counteracted ex post, during the data\nprocessing stage, leveraging the data redundancy that is intrinsic to the\nmultiple reception of the same packet by different (anchor) nodes. We validate\nthe proposed method in different experimental settings, indoor and outdoor,\nusing exclusively low-cost Commercial-Off-The-Shelf WiFi devices, achieving\nsub-meter accuracy in full Line-of-Sight conditions and meter-level accuracy in\nmild Non-line-of-sight environment. The proposed method does not require that\nthe blind node participate actively to the localisation procedure and can use\n\"opportunistically\" any legacy signal or packet available over-the-air for\ncommunication purposes. Considering the very minimal requirement on the system\n- basically, only that anchors in known positions are able to collect and share\nreception timestamps - the proposed approach can enable practical adoption of\nopportunistic and/or cooperative localisation on top of existing radio\ncommunication systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 14:31:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 08:52:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 08:06:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Facchi", "Nicolo'", ""], ["Gringoli", "Francesco", ""], ["Ricciato", "Fabio", ""], ["Toma", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8242", "submitter": "Rakesh Misra", "authors": "Rakesh Misra, Sachin Katti", "title": "A low-latency control plane for dense cellular networks", "comments": "14 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In order to keep up with the increasing demands for capacity, cellular\nnetworks are becoming increasingly dense and heterogeneous.
