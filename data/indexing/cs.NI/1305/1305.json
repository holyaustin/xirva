Recent measurements have shown that both large static\nobjects (e.g., buildings and foliage) as well as mobile objects (surrounding\nvehicles) have a profound impact on V2V communication. At the same time,\nsystem-level Vehicular Ad Hoc Network (VANET) simulators by and large employ\nsimple statistical propagation models, which do not account for surrounding\nobjects explicitly. We designed GEMV$^2$ (Geometry-based Efficient propagation\nModel for V2V communication), which uses outlines of vehicles, buildings, and\nfoliage to distinguish the following three types of links: line of sight (LOS),\nnon-LOS due to vehicles, and non- LOS due to static objects. For each link,\nGEMV$^2$ calculates the large-scale signal variations deterministically,\nwhereas the small- scale signal variations are calculated stochastically based\non the number and size of surrounding objects. We implement GEMV$^2$ in MATLAB\nand show that it scales well by using it to simulate radio propagation for\ncity-wide networks with tens of thousands of vehicles on commodity hardware. We\nmake the source code of GEMV$^2$ freely available. Finally, we validate\nGEMV$^2$ against extensive measurements performed in urban, suburban, highway,\nand open space environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 08:53:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2013 06:44:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 20:24:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Boban", "Mate", ""], ["Barros", "Joao", ""], ["Tonguz", "Ozan K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0209", "submitter": "Aaron Gember", "authors": "Aaron Gember, Anand Krishnamurthy, Saul St. John, Robert Grandl,\n  Xiaoyang Gao, Ashok Anand, Theophilus Benson, Vyas Sekar, Aditya Akella", "title": "Stratos: A Network-Aware Orchestration Layer for Virtual Middleboxes in\n  Clouds", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Enterprises want their in-cloud services to leverage the performance and\nsecurity benefits that middleboxes offer in traditional deployments.

HAS comes with\ntwo unique flavors. First, by riding on top of HTTP/TCP, it leverages the\nnetwork-friendly TCP to achieve firewall/NATS traversal and bandwidth sharing.\nSecond, by pre-encoding and storing the video in a number of discrete bitrate\nlevels, it introduces video bitrate adaptivity in a scalable way that the video\nencoding is excluded from the closed-loop adaptation. A conventional wisdom is\nthat the TCP throughput observed by a HAS client indicates the available\nnetwork bandwidth, thus can be used as a reliable reference for the video\nbitrate selection.\n  We argue that this no longer holds true when HAS becomes a substantial\nfraction of the Internet traffic. We show that when multiple HAS clients\ncompete at a network bottleneck, the presence of competing clients and the\ndiscrete nature of the video bitrates would together create confusion for a\nclient to correctly perceive its fair-share bandwidth. Through analysis and\nreal experiments, we demonstrate that this fundamental limitation would lead\nto, for example, video rate oscillation that negatively impacts the video\nwatching experiences. We therefore argue that it is necessary to implement at\nthe application layer a \"probe-and-adapt\" mechanism for HAS video rate\nadaptation, which is akin but orthogonal to the transport-layer network rate\nadaptation achieved by TCP. We present PANDA -- a client-side rate adaptation\nalgorithm for HAS -- as an embodiment of this idea. Our testbed results show\nthat compared to conventional algorithms, PANDA is able to reduce the\ninstability of video rate by 60%, at a given risk of buffer underrun.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 19:34:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Jul 2013 23:48:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Zhi", ""], ["Zhu", "Xiaoqing", ""], ["Gahm", "Josh", ""], ["Pan", "Rong", ""], ["Hu", "Hao", ""], ["Begen", "Ali C.", ""], ["Oran", "Dave", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0866", "submitter": "Snehanshu Saha", "authors": "Sarasvathi V, N.CH.S.N.Iyengar, Snehanshu Saha", "title": "Interference Aware Channel Assignmnet Using Edge Coloring in\n  Multi-Channel Multi-Radio Wireless Mesh Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks are considered a\nreliable and cost effective way for internet access in wide area.

Kleinberg suggested\nusing the inverse D-th power distribution, in which node v is the long range\ncontact of node u with a probability proportional to ||u-v||^(-D). He showed\nthat such an augmenting distribution allows to route a message efficiently in\nthe resulting random graph: The greedy algorithm, where in each intermediate\nnode the message travels over a link that brings the message closest to the\ntarget w.r.t. the Manhattan distance, finds a path of expected length O(log^2\nn) between any two nodes. In this paper we prove that greedy routing does not\nperform asymptotically better for any uniform and isotropic augmenting\ndistribution, i.e., the probability that node u has a particular long range\ncontact v is independent of the labels of u and v and only a function of\n||u-v||.\n  In order to obtain the result, we introduce a novel proof technique: We\ndefine a budget game, in which a token travels over a game board, while the\nplayer manages a \"probability budget\".

We configure our Markov chain to produce the impulses with the damped\noscillation effect, then, we determine the probability transition matrix and\nthe distribution of each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise\nsamples and we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics.\nOur Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured noise\nsamples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are similar in the\nsimulations and the measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 14:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sacuto", "Fabien", ""], ["Labeau", "Fabrice", ""], ["Agba", "Basile.

A key property of video\non-demand is the asynchronous content reuse, such that a few dominant videos\naccount for a large part of the traffic, but are viewed by users at different\ntimes. Caching of content on devices in conjunction with D2D communications\nallows to exploit this property, and provide a network throughput that is\nsignificantly in excess of both the conventional approach of unicasting from\nthe base station and the traditional D2D networks for regular data traffic.\nThis paper presents in a semi-tutorial concise form some recent results on the\nthroughput scaling laws of wireless networks with caching and asynchronous\ncontent reuse, contrasting the D2D approach with a competing approach based on\ncombinatorial cache design and network coded transmission from the base station\n(BS) only, referred to as coded multicasting. Interestingly, the spatial reuse\ngain of the former and the coded multicasting gain of the latter yield, somehow\nsurprisingly, the same near-optimal throughput behavior in the relevant regime\nwhere the number of video files in the library is smaller than the number of\nstreaming users. Based on our recent theoretical results, we propose a holistic\nD2D system design that incorporates traditional microwave (2 GHz) as well as\nmillimeter-wave D2D links; the direct connections to the base station can be\nused to provide those rare video requests that cannot be found in local caches.\nWe provide extensive simulations under a variety of system settings, and\ncompare our scheme with other existing schemes by the BS.

In this paper, we propose a \\emph{fixed-budget rebate\nmechanism} that gives each user a reward proportional to his percentage\ncontribution to the aggregate reduction in peak time demand. For comparison, we\nalso study a time-of-day pricing mechanism that gives each user a fixed reward\nper unit reduction of his peak-time demand.

We then investigate how imperfect information about user demand\naffects the mechanisms' effectiveness. From our results, the fixed-budget\nrebate pricing is more robust when the users' sensitivity to congestion is\n\"sufficiently\" convex. This feature of the fixed-budget rebate mechanism is\nattractive for many situations of interest and is driven by its closed-loop\nproperty, i.e., the unit reward decreases as the peak-time demand decreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 22:54:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Loiseau", "Patrick", ""], ["Schwartz", "Galina", ""], ["Musacchio", "John", ""], ["Amin", "Saurabh", ""], ["Sastry", "S.
