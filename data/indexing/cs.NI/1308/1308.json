In this paper we study the effect of ISP traffic\nshaping using traffic models based on user behaviors and\napplication/session-layer metrics providing quantifiable measures of\nuser-perceived performance for HTTP, FTP, and streaming video traffic. To\ncompare the user-perceived performance of shaped traffic flows with those of\nunshaped ones in an integrated way, we use a multivariate non-inferiority\ntesting procedure. We first investigate the effect of the token generation rate\nand the token bucket size of a token bucket filter on user-perceived\nperformance at a subscriber level with a single subscriber. Then we investigate\ntheir effect at an access level where shaped traffic flows from multiple\nsubscribers interact with one another in a common shared access network. The\nsimulation results show that for a given token generation rate, a larger token\nbucket provides better user-perceived performance at both subscriber and access\nlevels. It is also shown that the loose burst control resulting from the large\ntoken bucket --- up to 100 MB for access line rate of 100 Mbit/s --- does not\nnegatively affect user-perceived performance with multiple subscribers even in\nthe presence of non-conformant subscribers; with a much larger token bucket,\nhowever, the negative effect of non-conformant subscribers on the\nuser-perceived performance of conformant subscribers becomes clearly visible\nbecause the impact of token bucket size and that of token generation rate are\nvirtually indistinguishable in this case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Aug 2013 10:17:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:26:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Kyeong Soo", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.3855", "submitter": "Adam Bachorek", "authors": "Adam Bachorek, Bagavathiannan Palanisamy and Jens B.

The proposed algorithm makes full use of the spare capacities\nof those starving VCs to deflect the overflow traffic to other inputs and\nprovide bandwidth for the deflected traffic to re-access the desired VC. Our\nanalysis and simulation show that this deflection-compensated mechanism can\nsupport BvN switches to achieve close to 100% throughput of offered load even\nwith bursty input traffic, and reduces the average end-to-end delay and delay\njitter.
