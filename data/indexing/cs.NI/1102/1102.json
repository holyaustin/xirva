Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point\n(AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are\nrequired to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to\nthe wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that\ndo not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are\nconnected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to\nconventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other\nnetworks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for\nWMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols\nfor WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all\nassumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does\nnot hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in\nWMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks.

To date, most methods used to\ncompute such communities stem from the field of disjoint community detection by\neither extending the concept of modularity to an overlapping context or by\nattempting to decompose the whole set of nodes into several possibly\noverlapping subsets. In this report we take an orthogonal approach by\nintroducing a metric, the cohesion, rooted in sociological considerations. The\ncohesion quantifies the community-ness of one given set of nodes, based on the\nnotions of triangles - triplets of connected nodes - and weak ties, instead of\nthe classical view using only edge density. A set of nodes has a high cohesion\nif it features a high density of triangles and intersects few triangles with\nthe rest of the network. As such, we introduce a numerical characterization of\ncommunities: sets of nodes featuring a high cohesion. We then present a new\napproach to the problem of overlapping communities by introducing the concept\nof ego-munities, which are subjective communities centered around a given node,\nspecifically inside its neighborhood. We build upon the cohesion to construct a\nheuristic algorithm which outputs a node's ego-munities by attempting to\nmaximize their cohesion. We illustrate the pertinence of our method with a\ndetailed description of one person's ego-munities among Facebook friends. We\nfinally conclude by describing promising applications of ego-munities such as\ninformation inference and interest recommendations, and present a possible\nextension to cohesion in the case of weighted networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Feb 2011 19:08:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Feb 2011 19:41:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Friggeri", "Adrien", "", "ENS / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du\n  Parall\u00e9lisme / INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes"], ["Chelius", "Guillaume", "", "ENS / LIP\n  Laboratoire de l'Informatique du Parall\u00e9lisme / INRIA Grenoble\n  Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes"], ["Fleury", "Eric", "", "ENS / LIP Laboratoire de l'Informatique du\n  Parall\u00e9lisme / INRIA Grenoble Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes, IXXI"]]}, {"id": "1102.2785", "submitter": "Matias Korman", "authors": "Matias Korman", "title": "Minimizing interference in ad-hoc networks with bounded communication\n  radius", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CG cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a topology control problem in which we are given a set of $n$\nsensors in the plane and we would like to assign a communication radius to each\nof them.

Cooperative spectrum sharing is one effective way to achieve\nthis goal. In cooperative spectrum sharing, secondary users (SUs) relay\ntraffics for primary users (PUs), in exchange for dedicated transmission time\nfor the SUs' own communication needs. In this paper, we study the cooperative\nspectrum sharing under incomplete information, where SUs' types (capturing\ntheir heterogeneity in relay channel gains and evaluations of power\nconsumptions) are private information and not known by PUs. Inspired by the\ncontract theory, we model the network as a labor market. The single PU is the\nemployer who offers a contract to the SUs. The contract consists of a set of\ncontract items representing combinations of spectrum accessing time (i.e.,\nreward) and relaying power (i.e., contribution). The SUs are employees, and\neach of them selects the best contract item to maximize his payoff. We study\nthe optimal contract design for both weak and strong incomplete information\nscenarios. First, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for feasible\ncontracts in both scenarios. In the weak incomplete information scenario, we\nfurther derive the optimal contract that achieves the same maximum PU's utility\nas in the complete information benchmark. In the strong incomplete information\nscenario, we propose a Decompose-and-Compare algorithm that achieves a\nclose-to-optimal contract. We future show that the PU's average utility loss\ndue to the suboptimal algorithm and the strong incomplete information are both\nrelatively small (less than 2% and 1:3%, respectively, in our numerical results\nwith two SU types).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Feb 2011 10:10:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Duan", "Lingjie", ""], ["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.4469", "submitter": "Douglas Leith", "authors": "Douglas J.

Its main advantage over random walks and other\nexploration techniques is that a BFS sample is a plausible graph on its own,\nand therefore we can study its topological characteristics. However, it has\nbeen empirically observed that incomplete BFS is biased toward high-degree\nnodes, which may strongly affect the measurements. In this paper, we first\nanalytically quantify the degree bias of BFS sampling. In particular, we\ncalculate the node degree distribution expected to be observed by BFS as a\nfunction of the fraction f of covered nodes, in a random graph RG(pk) with an\narbitrary degree distribution pk. We also show that, for RG(pk), all commonly\nused graph traversal techniques (BFS, DFS, Forest Fire, Snowball Sampling, RDS)\nsuffer from exactly the same bias. Next, based on our theoretical analysis, we\npropose a practical BFS-bias correction procedure. It takes as input a\ncollected BFS sample together with its fraction f. Even though RG(pk) does not\ncapture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as\nassortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad\nrange of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut\nnetworks. Finally, we consider and evaluate a family of alternative correction\nprocedures, and demonstrate that, although they are unbiased for an arbitrary\ntopology, their large variance makes them far less effective than the\nRG(pk)-based technique.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Feb 2011 20:19:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kurant", "Maciej", ""], ["Markopoulou", "Athina", ""], ["Thiran", "Patrick", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.4728", "submitter": "Xu Chen", "authors": "Xu Chen and Jianwei Huang and Husheng Li", "title": "Adaptive Channel Recommendation For Opportunistic Spectrum Access", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a dynamic spectrum access scheme where secondary users recommend\n\"good\" channels to each other and access accordingly.
