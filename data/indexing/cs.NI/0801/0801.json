The available bandwidth of a link or\ncomplete path is expressed in terms of a {\\em service curve}, which is a\nfunction that appears in the network calculus to express the service available\nto a traffic flow. The service curve is estimated based on measurements of a\nsequence of probing packets or passive measurements of a sample path of\narrivals. It is shown that existing bandwidth estimation methods can be derived\nin the min-plus algebra of the network calculus, thus providing further\nmathematical justification for these methods. Principal difficulties of\nestimating available bandwidth from measurement of network probes are related\nto potential non-linearities of the underlying network. When networks are\nviewed as systems that operate either in a linear or in a non-linear regime, it\nis argued that probing schemes extract the most information at a point when the\nnetwork crosses from a linear to a non-linear regime. Experiments on the Emulab\ntestbed at the University of Utah evaluate the robustness of the system\ntheoretic interpretation of networks in practice. Multi-node experiments\nevaluate how well the convolution operation of the min-plus algebra provides\nestimates for the available bandwidth of a path from estimates of individual\nlinks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2008 00:11:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Liebeherr", "Jorg", ""], ["Fidler", "Markus", ""], ["Valaee", "Shahrokh", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0701", "submitter": "Leah Nutman", "authors": "Leah Nutman and Michael Langberg", "title": "Adversarial Models and Resilient Schemes for Network Coding", "comments": "Second version includes minor editing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DC cs.NI math.IT", "license": null, "abstract": "  In a recent paper, Jaggi et al.

It is well-known that the maximum possible throughput of a slotted\nAloha system with a large number of nodes is 1/e = 0.3679. Indeed, a saturation\nthroughput of 1/e can be achieved with an exponential backoff factor of r =\ne/(e-1)=1.5820. The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority\nof prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the\nEthernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r =\n2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise\nobjection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if\nmean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2\nis only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting\nof r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve\nsustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to\n1/e. A general conclusion is that the value of r may significantly affect the\nqueuing delay performance. Besides analyzing mean queuing delay, this paper\nalso delves into the phenomenon of starvation, wherein some nodes are deprived\nof service for an extended period of time while other nodes hog the system.\nSpecifically, we propose a quantitative definition for starvation and show that\nthe conditions to guarantee bounded mean delay and non-starved operation are\none of the same, thus uniting these two notions. Finally, we show that when\nmean delay is large and starvation occurs, the performance results obtained\nfrom simulation experiments may not converge. A quantitative discussion of this\nissue is provided in this paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2008 02:36:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Jul 2008 11:05:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""], ["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""], ["Chen", "Da Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.4082", "submitter": "Marcello Caleffi", "authors": "Marcello Caleffi, Giancarlo Ferraiuolo, Luigi Paura", "title": "On Reliability of Dynamic Addressing Routing Protocols in Mobile Ad Hoc\n  Networks", "comments": "Proc. of WRECOM '07: Wireless Rural and Emergency Communications\n  Conference, Roma (Italy), October 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper, a reliability analysis is carried out to state a performance\ncomparison between two recently proposed proactive routing algorithms.
