Energy wastage can be caused by failed\npacket transmission attempts at each node due to channel dynamics and\ninterference. Therefore transmission control techniques that are unaware of the\nchannel dynamics can lead to suboptimal channel use patterns. In this paper we\npropose a transmission controller that utilizes different \"grades\" of channel\nside information to schedule packet transmissions in an optimal way, while\nmeeting a deadline constraint for all packets waiting in the transmission\nqueue. The wireless channel is modeled as a finite-state Markov channel. We are\nspecifically interested in the case where the transmitter has low-grade channel\nside information that can be obtained based solely on the ACK/NAK sequence for\nthe previous transmissions. Our scheduler is readily implementable and it is\nbased on the dynamic programming solution to the finite-horizon transmission\ncontrol problem. We also calculate the information theoretic capacity of the\nfinite state Markov channel with feedback containing different grades of\nchannel side information including that, obtained through the ACK/NAK sequence.\nWe illustrate that our scheduler achieves a given throughput at a power level\nthat is fairly close to the fundamental limit achievable over the channel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Feb 2010 04:01:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Srivastava", "Rahul", ""], ["Koksal", "Can Emre", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.0190", "submitter": "Andrei Sukhov M", "authors": "A.M.

Recently, there has been a surge of activity in the computer\nscience, control, signal processing, and information theory communities,\ndeveloping faster and more robust gossip algorithms and deriving theoretical\nperformance guarantees. This article presents an overview of recent work in the\narea. We describe convergence rate results, which are related to the number of\ntransmitted messages and thus the amount of energy consumed in the network for\ngossiping. We discuss issues related to gossiping over wireless links,\nincluding the effects of quantization and noise, and we illustrate the use of\ngossip algorithms for canonical signal processing tasks including distributed\nestimation, source localization, and compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Mar 2010 16:20:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Dimakis", "Alexandros G.", ""], ["Kar", "Soummya", ""], ["Moura", "Jose M.

Using the empirical traffic patterns\ngenerated by a thousand users, we characterize several properties of Web\ntraffic that cannot be reproduced by Markovian models. We examine both\naggregate statistics capturing collective behavior, such as page and link\ntraffic, and individual statistics, such as entropy and session size. No model\ncurrently explains all of these empirical observations simultaneously. We show\nthat all of these traffic patterns can be explained by an agent-based model\nthat takes into account several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents\nmaintain individual lists of bookmarks (a non-Markovian memory mechanism) that\nare used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited\nlinks, a branching mechanism that also allows us to reproduce behaviors such as\nthe use of a back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by\nvisiting novel pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being more\ntopically related to each other than distant ones. This modulates the\nprobability that an agent continues to browse or starts a new session, allowing\nus to recreate heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model is capable of\nreproducing the collective and individual behaviors we observe in the empirical\ndata, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users\nwith the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements. This result\nallows us to identify a few salient features that are necessary and sufficient\nto interpret the browsing patterns observed in our data. In addition to the\ndescriptive and explanatory power of such a model, our results may lead the way\nto more sophisticated, realistic, and effective ranking and crawling\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Mar 2010 22:15:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Meiss", "Mark", ""], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Bruno", ""], ["Ramasco", "Jos\u00e9 J.", ""], ["Flammini", "Alessandro", ""], ["Menczer", "Filippo", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5383", "submitter": "Sreekanth Malladi", "authors": "Sreekanth Malladi, Bezawada Bruhadeshwar, Kishore Kothapalli", "title": "Automatic analysis of distance bounding protocols", "comments": "22 pages, Appeared in Foundations of Computer Security, (Affiliated\n  workshop of LICS 2009, Los Angeles, CA).", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "FCS09", "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Distance bounding protocols are used by nodes in wireless networks to\ncalculate upper bounds on their distances to other nodes.

The possible re-homing models are created and analyzed for core\nnetworks. The paper concludes that appropriate re-homing in radio domain, using\ncorrect algorithms, not only optimizes the radio network but also helps improve\nthe QoS of the core network and saves the carriers' OPEX and CAPEX on their\ncore networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 09:56:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Ouyang", "Ye", ""], ["Fallah", "M.

This paper provides a brief review on three fundamental\nproperties of the Internet topology at the autonomous systems (AS) level.\nFirstly the Internet has a power-law degree distribution, which means the\nmajority of nodes on the Internet AS graph have small numbers of links, whereas\na few nodes have very large numbers of links. Secondly the Internet exhibits a\nproperty called disassortative mixing, which means poorly-connected nodes tend\nto link with well-connected nodes, and vice versa. Thirdly the best-connected\nnodes, or the rich nodes, are tightly interconnected with each other forming a\nrich-club. We explain that it is these structural properties that make the\nglobal Internet so 'small'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 12:25:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Shi", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5979", "submitter": "Yuan Zhong", "authors": "Devavrat Shah, John N.

The main operational issue in this model is that of deciding which\nqueues to serve, subject to certain constraints. In this paper, we study\nqualitative performance properties of the well known $\\alpha$-weighted\nscheduling policies. The stability, in the sense of positive recurrence, of\nthese policies has been well understood. We establish exponential upper bounds\non the tail of the steady-state distribution of the backlog. Along the way, we\nprove finiteness of the expected steady-state backlog when $\\alpha<1$, a\nproperty that was known only for $\\alpha\\geq 1$. Finally, we analyze the\nexcursions of the maximum backlog over a finite time horizon for $\\alpha \\geq\n1$. As a consequence, for $\\alpha \\geq 1$, we establish the full state space\ncollapse property.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2010 06:38:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shah", "Devavrat", ""], ["Tsitsiklis", "John N.", ""], ["Zhong", "Yuan", ""]]}]
