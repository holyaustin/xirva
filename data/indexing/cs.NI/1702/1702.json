In our paper, we assume that in order to ensure Quality\nof service (QoS) requirements, the CR operator has the option of leasing the\nspecially designated high priority TVWS channels (HPC) for short term use by\npaying a small fee according to the actual usage. Based on Lyapunov drift plus\npenalty function framework, we develop an online algorithm to exploit QoS\nflexibility. Such flexibility might be available in terms of data transmission\ndelays as well as data quality reduction in order to minimize the overall HPC\nleasing cost. The developed algorithm also provides three adjustable parameters\nthat could be controlled to tradeoff the total cost and QoS. The performance of\nthe proposed algorithm is very close to the optimal offline lower bound\nsolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 15:15:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "Naveed UL", ""], ["Yuen", "Chau", ""], ["Atique", "Muhammad Bershgal", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.03257", "submitter": "Sandip Chakraborty", "authors": "Raja Karmakar and Sandip Chakraborty and Samiran Chattopadhyay", "title": "Impact of IEEE 802.11n/ac PHY/MAC High Throughput Enhancements over\n  Transport/Application Layer Protocols - A Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Since the inception of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in the year 1997,\nit has tremendously grown in the last few years.

Users face a complex, multi-dimensional tradeoff between cost,\nthroughput, and delay in making their offloading decisions: while they may save\nmoney and receive a higher throughput by waiting for WiFi access, they may not\nwait for WiFi if they are sensitive to delay.

Due\nto phase ambiguity, a unique estimation can only be obtained within the\nunambiguous distance (UD), which depends on the carrier frequencies used for\nranging. Without external information, the maximum measurable distance of an\nMPR system is defined by its UD. The MPR system employing random frequency\nhopping (FH) waveform has a strong anti-jamming capability and sees promising\npotentials in many fields. However, it is challenging to depict its measurable\ndistance. Different from current MPR system employing deterministic\nfrequencies, the carrier frequency under the FH waveform hops randomly within\nthe occupied bandwidth.

It is safe to adopt the\nlower bound of the random UD as the metric, but the measurable distance may be\ndrastically underestimated. Alternatively, we propose to adopt the upper bound\nof the random UD as the metric, because when the RSF set contains more than a\ndozen of carriers, i) we prove the probability that the random UD obtains its\nupper bound is very close to 1 if phase noise is not introduced; ii)\nsimulations show that the upper bound can also be obtained reliably in the\npresence of phase noise.

This article presents what lies beyond the first evolutionary\nsteps in network management, identifies the challenges in service verification,\nobservability, and troubleshooting, and explains how to address them using our\nService Provider DevOps (SP-DevOps) framework. We compendiously cover the\nentire process from design goals to tool realization and employ an elastic\nversion of an industry-standard use case to show how on-the-fly verification,\nsoftware-defined monitoring, and automated troubleshooting of services reduce\nthe cost of fault management actions. We assess SP-DevOps with respect to key\nattributes of software-defined telecommunication infrastructures both\nqualitatively and quantitatively, and demonstrate that SP-DevOps paves the way\ntoward carrier-grade operations and management in the network virtualization\nera.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 13:59:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["John", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Marchetto", "Guido", ""], ["N\u00e9meth", "Felici\u00e1n", ""], ["Sk\u00f6ldstr\u00f6m", "Pontus", ""], ["Steinert", "Rebecca", ""], ["Meirosu", "Catalin", ""], ["Papafili", "Ioanna", ""], ["Pentikousis", "Kostas", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.06423", "submitter": "Bekir Sait Ciftler", "authors": "Bekir Sait Ciftler, Sener Dikmese, Ismail Guvenc, Kemal Akkaya,\n  Abdullah Kadri", "title": "Occupancy Counting with Burst and Intermittent Signals in Smart\n  Buildings", "comments": "11 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Zone-level occupancy counting is a critical technology for smart buildings\nand can be used for several applications such as building energy management,\nsurveillance, and public safety.

Billions of\nUSD are being paid for modest bandwidths.\n  The earth observation, astronomy and similar science driven communities\ncannot compete financially with such a pressure system, so this is where\ngovernments have to step in and assess /regulate the situation.\n  It has been a pleasure to see a situation where the communications and\nbroadcast communities have come together to formulate sharing of an important\npart of the spectrum (roughly, 50 MHz to 800 MHz) in an IEEE standard,\nIEEE802.22. This standard (known as the \"TV White Space Network\" (built on\nlower level standards) shows a way that fixed and mobile users can collaborate\nin geographically widespread regions, using cognitive radio and geographic\ndatabases of users. This White Space (WS) standard is well described in the\nliterature and is not the major topic of this short paper.\n  We wish to extend the idea of the WS concept to include the idea of EM\nsensors (such as Radar) adopting this approach to spectrum sharing, providing a\nquantum leap in access to spectrum. We postulate that networks of sensors,\nusing the tools developed by the WS community, can replace and enhance our\npresent set of EM sensors.\n  We first define what Networks of Sensors entail (with some history), and then\ngo on to define, based on a Taxonomy of Symbiosis defined by de\nBary\\cite{symb}, how these sensors and other users (especially communications)\ncan co-exist. This new taxonomy is important for understanding, and should\nreplace somewhat outdated terminologies from the radar world.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 17:35:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Inggs", "Michael", ""], ["Mishra", "Amit", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07946", "submitter": "Erik Rye", "authors": "Erik Rye, Robert Beverly", "title": "SDN as Active Measurement Infrastructure", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Active measurements are integral to the operation and management of networks,\nand invaluable to supporting empirical network research.
