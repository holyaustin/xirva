Second, mitigating self-interference without the complex designs\nemployed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal\napart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and\nusing devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier\nsignal.

Hyperbolic routing (HR) presents a potential\nsolution to address the routing scalability problem, because it does not use\ntraditional forwarding tables or exchange routing updates upon changes in\nnetwork topologies. Although HR has the drawbacks of producing sub-optimal\nroutes or local minima for some destinations, these issues can be mitigated by\nNDN's intelligent data forwarding plane. However, HR's viability still depends\non both the quality of the routes HR provides and the overhead incurred at the\nforwarding plane due to HR's sub-optimal behavior. We designed a new forwarding\nstrategy called Adaptive Smoothed RTT-based Forwarding (ASF) to mitigate HR's\nsub-optimal path selection. This paper describes our experimental investigation\ninto the packet delivery delay and overhead under HR as compared with\nNamed-Data Link State Routing (NLSR), which calculates shortest paths. We run\nemulation experiments using various topologies with different failure\nscenarios, probing intervals, and maximum number of next hops for a name\nprefix. Our results show that HR's delay stretch has a median close to 1 and a\n95th-percentile around or below 2, which does not grow with the network size.\nHR's message overhead in dynamic topologies is nearly independent of the\nnetwork size, while NLSR's overhead grows polynomially at least.

We consider a use case based on the\ndeployment of smart services in decentralized territories. A two level\nsimulator is employed, which is based on a coarse agent-based, adaptive\nparallel and distributed simulation approach to model the general life of\nsimulated entities. However, when needed a finer grained simulator (based on\nOMNeT++) is triggered on a restricted portion of the simulated area, which\nallows considering all issues concerned with wireless communications. Based on\nthis use case, it is confirmed that the ad-hoc wireless networking technologies\ndo represent a principle tool to deploy smart services over decentralized\ncountrysides. Moreover, the performance evaluation confirms the viability of\nutilizing multi-level simulation for simulating large scale IoT environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 11:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 14:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["D'Angelo", "Gabriele", ""], ["Ferretti", "Stefano", ""], ["Ghini", "Vittorio", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.01361", "submitter": "Jinfa Wang", "authors": "Jinfa Wang, Hai Zhao, Xiao Liu", "title": "Research on Life Characteristics of Internet Based on Network Motifs", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  From biosystem to complex system,the study of life is always an important\narea.

In this paper, we studied the performance of victim and non-victim Wi-Fi\nusers, and Wi-Fi AP while varying LTE-U ON duration (i.e., duty cycle). A\npropitious scheme is proposed for WLANs, with regard to ease of implementation,\nemploying Point Coordination Function (PCF) mode of 802.11, promising fairness\namong Wi-Fi users with improvement in the channel utilization of Wi-Fi network.\nAn analytical model is developed to demonstrate guaranteed improvement and\nvalidate the simulation results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 08:07:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Baswade", "Anand M.", ""], ["Atif", "Touheed Anwar", ""], ["Tamma", "Bheemarjuna Reddy", ""], ["A", "Antony Franklin", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04394", "submitter": "Xiaodan Pan", "authors": "Xiaodan Pan, Tong Ye, Tony T.

One way to support it is by classifying and filtering\nethernet packets within network devices. Packet classification is a fundamental\ntask for network devices such as routers, firewalls, and intrusion detection\nsystems. In this paper we present architecture of fast and reconfigurable\nPacket Classification Engine (PCE). This engine is used in FPGA-based firewall.\nOur PCE inspects multi-dimensional field of packet header sequentially based on\ntree-based algorithm. This algorithm simplifies overall system to a lower scale\nand leads to a more secure system. The PCE works with an adaptation of single\ncycle processor architecture in the system. Ethernet packet is examined with\nPCE based on Source IP Address, Destination IP Address, Source Port,\nDestination Port, and Protocol fields of the packet header. These are basic\nfields to know whether it is a dangerous or normal packet before inspecting the\ncontent. Using implementation of tree-based algorithm in the architecture,\nfirewall rules are rebuilt into 24-bit sub-rules which are read as processor\ninstruction in the inspection process. The inspection process is comparing one\nsub-rule with input field of header every clock cycle. The proposed PCE shows\n91 MHz clock frequency in Cyclone II EP2C70F896C6 with 13 clocks throughput\naverage from input to output generation. The use of tree-based algorithm\nsimplifies the multidimensional packet inspection and gives us reconfigurable\nas well as scalable system. The architecture is fast, reliable, and adaptable\nand also can maximize the advantages of the algorithm very well. Although the\nPCE has high frequency and little amount of clock, filtering speed of a\nfirewall also depends on the other components, such as packet FIFO buffer. Fast\nand reliable FIFO buffer is needed to support the PCE. This PCE also is not\ncompleted with rule update mechanism yet. This proposed PCE is tested as a\ncomponent of FPGA-based firewall to filter Ethernet packet with FPGA DE2 Board\nusing NIOS II platform.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 13:59:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wicaksana", "Arief", "", "ITB"], ["Sasongko", "Arif", "", "ITB"]]}, {"id": "1611.06299", "submitter": "F.

The approach, implemented via\nSuccessive Convex Approximation (SCA), is seen to yield considerable gains in\nmobile energy consumption as compared to conventional independent offloading\nacross users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 17:09:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 02:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Shuwaili", "Ali", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09296", "submitter": "Saeed Akhoondian Amiri", "authors": "Saeed Akhoondian Amiri, Szymon Dudycz, Stefan Schmid, Sebastian\n  Wiederrecht", "title": "Congestion-Free Rerouting of Flows on DAGs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.DM cs.NI math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Changing a given configuration in a graph into another one is known as a re-\nconfiguration problem. Such problems have recently received much interest in\nthe context of algorithmic graph theory. We initiate the theoretical study of\nthe following reconfiguration problem: How to reroute $k$ unsplittable flows of\na certain demand in a capacitated network from their current paths to their\nrespective new paths, in a congestion-free manner? This problem finds immediate\napplications, e.g., in traffic engineering in computer networks. We show that\nthe problem is generally NP-hard already for $k = 2$ flows, which motivates us\nto study rerouting on a most basic class of flow graphs, namely DAGs.\nInterestingly, we find that for general $k$, deciding whether an unsplittable\nmulti-commodity flow rerouting schedule exists, is NP-hard even on DAGs. Both\nNP-hardness proofs are non-trivial. Our main contribution is a polynomial-time\n(fixed parameter tractable) algorithm to solve the route update problem for a\nbounded number of flows on DAGs. At the heart of our algorithm lies a novel\ndecomposition of the flow network that allows us to express and resolve\nreconfiguration dependencies among flows.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 19:25:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 17:02:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:14:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Amiri", "Saeed Akhoondian", ""], ["Dudycz", "Szymon", ""], ["Schmid", "Stefan", ""], ["Wiederrecht", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09335", "submitter": "Giuseppe Caso", "authors": "Giuseppe Caso, Luca De Nardis, Filip Lemic, Vlado Handziski, Adam\n  Wolisz, Maria-Gabriella Di Benedetto", "title": "ViFi: Virtual Fingerprinting WiFi-based Indoor Positioning via\n  Multi-Wall Multi-Floor Propagation Model", "comments": "Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (March 2019)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Widespread adoption of indoor positioning systems based on WiFi\nfingerprinting is at present hindered by the large efforts required for\nmeasurements collection during the offline phase. Two approaches were recently\nproposed to address such issue: crowdsourcing and RSS radiomap prediction,\nbased on either interpolation or propagation channel model fitting from a small\nset of measurements. RSS prediction promises better positioning accuracy when\ncompared to crowdsourcing, but no systematic analysis of the impact of system\nparameters on positioning accuracy is available. This paper fills this gap by\nintroducing ViFi, an indoor positioning system that relies on RSS prediction\nbased on Multi-Wall Multi-Floor (MWMF) propagation model to generate a discrete\nRSS radiomap (virtual fingerprints). Extensive experimental results, obtained\nin multiple independent testbeds, show that ViFi outperforms virtual\nfingerprinting systems adopting simpler propagation models in terms of\naccuracy, and allows a sevenfold reduction in the number of measurements to be\ncollected, while achieving the same accuracy of a traditional fingerprinting\nsystem deployed in the same environment. Finally, a set of guidelines for the\nimplementation of ViFi in a generic environment, that saves the effort of\ncollecting additional measurements for system testing and fine tuning, is\nproposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 09:57:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Apr 2017 17:04:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 2 Apr 2019 07:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Caso", "Giuseppe", ""], ["De Nardis", "Luca", ""], ["Lemic", "Filip", ""], ["Handziski", "Vlado", ""], ["Wolisz", "Adam", ""], ["Di Benedetto", "Maria-Gabriella", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09512", "submitter": "Masoume Sadeghi", "authors": "Masoumeh Sadeghi, Amirmasoud Rabiei", "title": "A Fair Relay Selection Scheme for a DF Cooperative Network With\n  Spatially Random Relays", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new, fair relay selection scheme is proposed for a dual-hop\ndecode-and-forward network with randomly-distributed relays.
