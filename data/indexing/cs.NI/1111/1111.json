This selfish behavior is\ndifficult to distinguish, making existing detection based incentive schemes\nfail to work. To thwart entropy selfishness in distributed collaborative\nsensing, we propose YouSense, a One-Time Pad (OTP) based incentive design that\ncould naturally isolate entropy selfish users from the honest users without\nselfish node detection. The basic idea of YouSense is to construct a trapdoor\none-time pad for each sensing report by combining the original report and a\nrandom key. Such a one-time pad based encryption could prevent entropy selfish\nusers from accessing the original sensing report while enabling the honest\nusers to recover the report. Different from traditional cryptography based OTP\nwhich requires the key delivery, YouSense allows an honest user to recover the\npad (or key) by exploiting a unique characteristic of collaborative sensing\nthat different secondary users share some common observations on the same radio\nspectrum. We further extend YouSense to improve the recovery successful rate by\nreducing the cardinality of set of the possible pads.

To this\nend, in this paper, we propose an alternative approach to investigate the CSI\nfeedback rate control problem in the analytical setting of a game theoretic\nframework, in which a multiple-antenna base station (BS) communicates with a\nnumber of co-channel MSs through linear precoder. Specifically, we first\npresent a non-cooperative feedback-rate control game (NFC), in which each MS\nselects the feedback rate to maximize its performance in a distributed way. To\nimprove efficiency from a social optimum point of view, we then introduce\npricing, called the non-cooperative feedback-rate control game with price\n(NFCP). The game utility is defined as the performance gain by CSI feedback\nminus the price as a linear function of the CSI feedback rate. The existence of\nthe Nash equilibrium of such games is investigated, and two types of feedback\nprotocols (FDMA and CSMA) are studied. Simulation results show that by\nadjusting the pricing factor, the distributed NFCP game results in close\noptimal performance compared with that of the centralized scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 09:52:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Lingyang", ""], ["Han", "Zhu", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhongshan", ""], ["Jiao", "Bingli", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.7226", "submitter": "Jin Hu", "authors": "Xiangyang Lu, Jin Hu, Ran Tao, and Yue Wang", "title": "Controlling Communication Field of Complex Networks by Transformation\n  Method", "comments": "16 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Controlling the global statuses of a network by its local dynamic parameters\nis an important issue, and it is difficult to obtain the direct solution for.\nThe transformation method, which is originally used to control physical field\nby designing material parameters, is proposed to obtain the necessary local\ndynamic parameters when the global statuses of a network system are prescribed\nin a space.
