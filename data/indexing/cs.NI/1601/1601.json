An ordered sequence of middleboxes composing a logical service is\ncalled service chain. Service Function Chaining (SFC) enables us to define\nthese service chains. Recent optimization models of SFCs assume that the\nfunctionality of a middlebox is provided by a single software appliance,\ncommonly known as Virtual Network Function (VNF). This assumption limits SFCs\nto the throughput of an individual VNF and resources of a physical machine\nhosting the VNF instance. Moreover, typical service providers offer VNFs with\nheterogeneous throughput and resource configurations. Thus, deploying a service\nchain with custom throughput can become a tedious process of stitching\nheterogeneous VNF instances. In this paper, we describe how we can overcome\nthese limitations without worrying about underlying VNF configurations and\nresource constraints. This prospect is achieved by distributed deploying\nmultiple VNF instances providing the functionality of a middlebox and modeling\nthe optimal deployment of a service chain as a mixed integer programming\nproblem. The proposed model optimizes host and bandwidth resources allocation,\nand determines the optimal placement of VNF instances, while balancing workload\nand routing traffic among these VNF instances.

In contrast with many existing works on energy-efficient power control,\nwhich ignore the possible presence of a queue at the transmitter, we consider a\nnew generalized cross-layer EE metric. This approach is relevant when the\ntransmitters have a non-zero energy cost even when the radiated power is zero\nand takes into account the presence of a finite packet buffer and packet\narrival at the transmitter. As the Nash equilibrium (NE) is an\nenergy-inefficient solution, the present work aims at overcoming this deficit\nby improving the global energy-efficiency. Indeed, as the considered system has\nmultiple agencies each with their own interest, the performance metric\nreflecting the individual interest of each decision maker is the global\nenergy-efficiency defined then as the sum over individual energy-efficiencies.\nRepeated games (RG) are investigated through the study of two dynamic games\n(finite RG and discounted RG), whose equilibrium is defined when introducing a\nnew operating point (OP), Pareto-dominating the NE and relying only on\nindividual channel state information (CSI). Accordingly, closed-form\nexpressions of the minimum number of stages of the game for finite RG (FRG) and\nthe maximum discount factor of the discounted RG (DRG) were established. The\ncross-layer model in the RG formulation leads to achieving a shorter minimum\nnumber of stages in the FRG even for higher number of users. In addition, the\nsocial welfare (sum of utilities) in the DRG decreases slightly with the\ncross-layer model when the number of users increases while it is reduced\nconsiderably with the Goodman model.

The number of multiple next hops also changes depending on the traffic\nconditions, but it is never less than one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 17:24:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Rashmi", ""], ["Singh", "Yatindra Nath", ""], ["Yadav", "Anita", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01278", "submitter": "Roman Lutz", "authors": "Roman Lutz", "title": "Security and Privacy in Future Internet Architectures - Benefits and\n  Challenges of Content Centric Networks", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As the shortcomings of our current Internet become more and more obvious,\nresearchers have started creating alternative approaches for the Internet of\nthe future.

This paper\nproposes an interesting use case of this capability for IBFD self-backhauling\nheterogeneous networks (HetNet). IBFD self-backhauling in a HetNet refers to\nIBFD-enabled small cells backhauling themselves with macro cells over the\nwireless channel. Owing to their IBFD capability, the small cells\nsimultaneously communicate over the access and backhaul links, using the same\nfrequency band. The idea is doubly advantageous, as it obviates the need for\nfiber backhauling small cells every hundred meters and allows the access\nspectrum to be reused for backhauling at no extra cost. This work considers the\ncase of a two-tier cellular network with IBFD-enabled small cells, wirelessly\nbackhauling themselves with conventional macro cells. For clear exposition, the\ncase considered is that of FDD network, where within access and backhaul links,\nthe downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) are frequency duplexed ($f1$, $f2$\nrespectively), while the total frequency spectrum used at access and backhaul\n($f1+f2$) is the same. Analytical expressions for coverage and average downlink\n(DL) rate in such a network are derived using tools from the field of\nstochastic geometry. It is shown that DL rate in such networks could be close\nto double that of a conventional TDD/FDD self-backhauling network, at the\nexpense of reduced coverage due to higher interference in IBFD networks. For\nthe proposed IBFD network, the conflicting aspects of increased interference on\none side and high spectral efficiency on the other are captured into a\nmathematical model. The mathematical model introduces an end-to-end joint\nanalysis of backhaul (or fronthaul) and access links, in contrast to the\nlargely available access-centric studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 12:38:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 12:50:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 03:11:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Ankit", ""], ["Ganti", "Radha Krishna", ""], ["Milleth", "J.

A password that is generated will be allocated to a particular\nuser and to the ATM that is nearest to the user. LAPPS ensures the following\nqualities of the passwords that it generates. Location Awareness: The passwords\nare generated according to the users' geographical area, that they request\ntheir passwords from. So a password will only be active in just one location.\nTime Awareness: A password will only be valid for five minutes. The unused\npasswords will be discarded. Dynamic: The user has to have a new password each\ntime he/she logs in. A password is generated to be used only once. User\nOriented/Specific: The received password can only be used by the requester, and\ncan only be used on its allocated ATM. Two Factor Authenticity: The\nconfidential information will be secured using two-factor authentication. For\nextra security, a Pin generating device has been introduced. This will produce\nan eight digit number that the user has to supply to the mobile application,\nbefore requesting for a password.

Then, we\npresent the Power Aware Neighbor Discovery Asynchronously (Panda) protocol in\nwhich nodes transition between the sleep, receive, and transmit states. We\nanalyze \\name and select its parameters to maximize the ND rate subject to a\nhomogeneous power budget. We also present Panda-D, designed for non-homogeneous\nEH nodes. We perform extensive testbed evaluations using the prototypes and\nstudy various design tradeoffs. We demonstrate a small difference (less then\n2%) between experimental and analytical results, thereby confirming the\nmodeling assumptions. Moreover, we show that Panda improves the ND rate by up\nto 3x compared to related protocols.

Classical verification tasks can then be trivially\nsolved by checking each representative header set. In general, the number of\nheader classes can increase exponentially with header length, but it remains\npolynomial in the number of rules in the practical case where rules are\nconstituted with predefined fields where exact, prefix matching or range\nmatching is applied in each field (e.g., IP/MAC addresses, TCP/UDP ports).

On the other hand, high-speed, reliable and scalable data communication\ninfrastructure is crucial in both construction and operation of WAMS. Universal\nmobile Telecommunication System (UMTS), the 3G standard for mobile\ncommunication networks, was developed to provide high speed data transmission\nwith reliable service performance for mobile users. Therefore, UMTS is\nconsidered a promising solution for providing a communication infrastructure\nfor WAMS. 3G based EWAMS (Egyptian wide area Monitoring System) is designed and\nimplemented in Egypt through deployment a number of frequency disturbance\nrecorders (FDRs) devices on a live 220kV/500kV Egyptian grid in cooperation\nwith the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company (EETC). The developed EWAMS\ncan gather information from 11 FDRs devices which are geographically dispersed\nthroughout the boundary of the Egyptian power grid and to a remote data\nmanagement center located at Helwan University. The communication performance\nfor the developed EWAMS in terms of communication time delay, throughput, and\npercentage of wasted bandwidth are studied in this paper. The results showed\nthat the system can achieve successfully the communication requirements needed\nby various wide area monitoring applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 21:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Eissa", "M.

In general, the stability\nregion of this system is non-convex. Thus, we develop a convex inner-bound on\nthe stability region, which is provably tight in certain cases. The convexity\nof the inner bound allows us to develop a resource allocation scheme; dFC.\nBased on the structure of dFC, we develop a stochastic flow control and\nscheduling algorithm; qFC.
