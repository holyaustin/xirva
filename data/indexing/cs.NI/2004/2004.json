How does moving a cluster between geographical regions affect\napplication throughput? How network dynamics affects application stability?\nAnswering these questions in a systematic and reproducible way is very hard,\ngiven the variability and lack of control over the underlying network.\nUnfortunately, state-of-the-art network emulation or testbeds scale poorly\n(i.e., MiniNet), focus exclusively on the control-plane (i.e., CrystalNet) or\nignore network dynamics (i.e., EmuLab). Kollaps is a fully distributed network\nemulator that address these limitations. Kollaps hinges on two key\nobservations. First, from an application's perspective, what matters are the\nemergent end-to-end properties (e.g., latency, bandwidth, packet loss, and\njitter) rather than the internal state of the routers and switches leading to\nthose properties.

However, it opens a new challenge: to\ndetermine the best AP for each given station (STA).\n  This article studies the achievable performance gains of using secondary APs,\nalso called Extenders, in Home WiFi networks in terms of throughput and delay.\nTo do that, we introduce a centralized, easily implementable channel load aware\nselection mechanism for WiFi networks that takes full advantage of IEEE\n802.11k/v capabilities to collect data from STAs, and distribute association\ndecisions accordingly. These decisions are completely computed in the AP (or,\nalternatively, in an external network controller) based on an AP selection\ndecision metric that, in addition to RSSI, also takes into account the load of\nboth access and backhaul wireless links for each potential STA-AP/Extender\nconnection.\n  Performance evaluation of the proposed channel load aware AP and Extender\nselection mechanism has been first conducted in a purpose-built simulator,\nresulting in an overall improvement of the main analyzed metrics (throughput\nand delay) and the ability to serve, at least, 35% more traffic while keeping\nthe network uncongested when compared to the traditional RSSI-based WiFi\nassociation. This trend was confirmed when the channel load aware mechanism was\ntested in a real deployment, where STAs were associated to the indicated\nAP/Extender and total throughput was increased by 77.12%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 08:34:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 16:21:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Adame", "Toni", ""], ["Carrascosa", "Marc", ""], ["Bellalta", "Boris", ""], ["Pretel", "Iv\u00e1n", ""], ["Etxebarria", "I\u00f1aki", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.08194", "submitter": "Zhipeng Cheng", "authors": "Zhipeng Cheng, Minghui LiWangy, Ning Chen, Hongyue Lin, Zhibin Gao,\n  Lianfen Huang", "title": "Learning-Based Joint User-AP Association and Resource Allocation in\n  Ultra Dense Network", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advantages of Millimeter wave in wireless communication network, the\ncoverage radius and inter-site distance can be further reduced, the ultra dense\nnetwork (UDN) becomes the mainstream of future networks.

We show that this is partially possible in many cases due to\nadvances in software testing and the structure of P4 programs. Our insight is\nthat runtime verification can detect bugs, even those that are not detected at\ncompile-time, with machine learning-guided fuzzing. This enables a more\nautomated and real-time localization of bugs in P4 programs using software\ntesting techniques like Tarantula. Once the bug in a P4 program is localized,\nthe faulty code can be patched due to the programmable nature of P4. In\naddition, platform-dependent bugs can be detected. From P4_14 to P4_16 (latest\nversion), our observation is that as the programmable blocks increase, the\npatchability of P4 programs increases accordingly. To this end, we design,\ndevelop, and evaluate P6 that (a) detects, (b) localizes, and (c) patches bugs\nin P4 programs with minimal human interaction. P6 tests P4 switch\nnon-intrusively, i.e., requires no modification to the P4 program for detecting\nand localizing bugs. We used a P6 prototype to detect and patch seven existing\nbugs in eight publicly available P4 application programs deployed on two\ndifferent switch platforms: behavioral model (bmv2) and Tofino.

While throughput\nmaximizing algorithms in a switch are well-understood, delay analysis was\ndeveloped only recently. It was recently shown that the well-known MaxWeight\nalgorithm achieves optimal scaling of mean queue lengths in steady state in the\nheavy-traffic regime, and is within a factor less than $2$ of a universal lower\nbound. However, MaxWeight is not used in practice because of its high time\ncomplexity. In this paper, we study several low complexity algorithms and show\nthat their heavy-traffic performance is identical to that of MaxWeight. We\nfirst present a negative result that picking a random schedule does not have\noptimal heavy-traffic scaling of queue lengths even under uniform traffic. We\nthen show that if one picks the best among two matchings or modifies a random\nmatching even a little, using the so-called flip operation, it leads to\nMaxWeight like heavy-traffic performance under uniform traffic. We then focus\non the case of non-uniform traffic and show that a large class of low time\ncomplexity algorithms have the same heavy-traffic performance as MaxWeight, as\nlong as it is ensured that a MaxWeight matching is picked often enough. We also\nbriefly discuss the performance of these algorithms in the large scale\nheavy-traffic regime when the size of the switch increases simultaneously with\nthe load. Finally, we perform empirical study on a new algorithm to compare its\nperformance with some existing algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Apr 2020 02:18:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 May 2021 19:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Jhunjhunwala", "Prakirt", ""], ["Maguluri", "Siva Theja", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.12435", "submitter": "Steven Platt", "authors": "Steven Platt, Miquel Oliver-Riera", "title": "A Distributed Ledger-Enabled Interworking Model for the Wireless Air\n  Interface", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.SY eess.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While direct allocation of spectrum and evolved medium access protocols\nprovide a base for ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the existing TCP/IP and\nOSI models were designed for wired networks and do not address open\ninterconnection of air interfaces.

The UN SDGs are a way of\nframing opportunities and challenges of a desirable future world and cover\ntopics as broad as ending poverty, gender equality, climate change and smart\ncities. The relationship between these potentially mutually reinforcing forces\nis currently under-defined. Building on the vision for 6G, a review of\nmegatrends, on-going activities on the relation of mobile communications to the\nUN SDGs and existing indicators, a novel linkage between 6G and the UN SDGs is\nproposed via indicators. The white paper has also launched the work of deriving\nnew 6G related indicators to guide the research of 6G systems. The novel\nlinkage is built on the envisaged three-fold role of 6G as a provider of\nservices to help steer and support communities and countries towards reaching\nthe UN SDGs, as an enabler of measuring tool for data collection to help\nreporting of indicators with hyperlocal granularity, and as a reinforcer of new\necosystems based on 6G technology enablers and 6G network of networks to be\ndeveloped in line with the UN SDGs that incorporates future mobile\ncommunication technologies available in 2030.

Since the direct\nline-of-sight (LOS) beam is prone to blockage in indoor optical wireless\ncommunication systems, a backup link needs to be at hand in case of blockage,\nand hence channel allocation algorithms should be blockage-aware. In this\npaper, the impact of beam blockage due to a disc with varying size and distance\nfrom the receiver is studied where blockage is quantitatively evaluated using\npercentage blockage for 512 room locations at 25 cm separation. It was found\nthat assigning two links with maximum separation between the serving access\npoints can reduce or eliminate blockage compared to the case when resilience is\nnot implemented.
