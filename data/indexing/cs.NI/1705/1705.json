Our proposed\nenergy aware stable multipath routing strategy could attain the reliability,\nload balancing, and bandwidth aggregation in order to increase the network\nlifetime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 May 2017 17:38:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Tanaya", ""], ["Roy", "Sandip", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.04934", "submitter": "Ran Liu", "authors": "Ran Liu, Chau Yuen, Tri-Nhut Do, Ye Jiang, Xiang Liu, U-Xuan Tan", "title": "Indoor Positioning using Similarity-based Sequence and Dead Reckoning\n  without Training", "comments": "18th IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in\n  Wireless Communications (SPAWC 2017)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  For the traditional fingerprinting-based positioning approach, it is\nessential to collect measurements at known locations as reference fingerprints\nduring a training phase, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.

QuickTalk lets a user device\nsuch as a smartphone pinpoint and activate an IoT device with the help of an IR\ntransmitter and communicate with the pinpointed IoT device through the\nbroadcast channel of WiFi. By the nature of its association-free communication,\nQuickTalk allows a user device to immediately give a command to a specific IoT\ndevice in proximity even when the IoT device is uninitialized, unregistered to\nthe control interface of the user, or registered but being physically confused\nwith others. Our experiments of QuickTalk implemented on Raspberry Pi 2 devices\nshow that the end-to-end delay of QuickTalk is upper bounded by 2.5 seconds and\nits median is only about 0.74 seconds. We further confirm that even when an IoT\ndevice has ongoing data sessions, QuickTalk can still establish a reliable\ncommunication channel to the IoT device with little impact to the ongoing\nsessions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 07:55:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Ham", "Seongmin", ""], ["Lee", "Jihyung", ""], ["Lee", "Kyunghan", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.06926", "submitter": "Myounggyu Won", "authors": "Dhaval Patel, Myounggyu Won", "title": "Experimental Study on Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) for Mobile\n  Internet of Things", "comments": "To appear at 2017 IEEE 85th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC'17\n  Spring)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/VTCSpring.2017.8108501", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the past decade, we have witnessed explosive growth in the number of\nlow-power embedded and Internet-connected devices, reinforcing the new\nparadigm, Internet of Things (IoT).

Following the recent 3GPP requirements on\nmodeling the dynamic blockage as well as the temporal consistency of the\nchannel at mmWave frequencies, in this paper a new model for predicting the\nstate of a user in the presence of mobile blockers for representative 3GPP\nscenarios is developed: urban micro cell (UMi) street canyon and\npark/stadium/square. It is demonstrated that the blockage effects produce an\nalternating renewal process with exponentially distributed non-blocked\nintervals, and blocked durations that follow the general distribution. The\nfollowing metrics are derived (i) the mean and the fraction of time spent in\nblocked/non-blocked state, (ii) the residual blocked/non-blocked time, and\n(iii) the time-dependent conditional probability of having blockage/no blockage\nat time t1 given that there was blockage/no blockage at time t0. The latter is\na function of the arrival rate (intensity), width, and height of moving\nblockers, distance to the mmWave access point (AP), as well as the heights of\nthe AP and the user device.

But, looking at certificates, most people can't\ndifferentiate between malicious and non-malicious websites. Thus, once\ntraditional certificate validation has failed, instead of asking for human\nintervention, we use machine learning techniques to enable a web browser to\ndecide whether the server to which the certificate belongs to is malignant or\nnot ie, whether the website should be visited or not.\n  Once a certificate has been accepted in the above phase, we observe that the\nwebsite may still turn out to be malicious. So, in the second phase, we\ndownload a part of the website in a sandbox without decrypting it and observe\nthe TLS encrypted traffic (encrypted malicious data captured in a sandbox\ncannot harm the system). As the traffic is encrypted after Handshake is\ncompleted, traditional pattern-matching techniques cannot be employed. Thus we\nuse flow features of the traffic along with the features used in the above\nfirst phase. We couple these features with the unencrypted TLS header\ninformation obtained during TLS Handshake and use these in a machine learning\nclassifier to identify whether the traffic is malicious or not.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 May 2017 04:54:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bagaria", "Sankalp", ""], ["Balaji", "R.", ""], ["Bindhumadhava", "B.

A cost-optimal caching problem (COCP) for\ndevice-to-device (D2D) networks is modelled, in which the impact of user\nmobility, cache size, and total number of encoded segments are all accounted\nfor. Compared with the related studies, our investigation guarantees that the\ncollected segments are non-overlapping, takes into account the cost of\ndownloading from the network, and provides a rigorous problem complexity\nanalysis. The hardness of the problem is proved via a reduction from the\nsatisfiability problem. Next, a lower-bounding function of the objective\nfunction is derived. By the function, an approximation of COCP (ACOCP)\nachieving linearization is obtained, which features two advantages. First, the\nACOCP approach can use an off-the-shelf integer linear programming algorithm to\nobtain the global optimal solution, and it can effectively deliver solutions\nfor small-scale and mediumscale system scenarios. Second, and more importantly,\nbased on the ACOCP approach, one can derive the lower bound of global optimum\nof COCP, thus enabling performance benchmarking of any suboptimal algorithm. To\ntackle large scenarios with low complexity, we first prove that the optimal\ncaching placement of one user, giving other users' caching placements, can be\nderived in polynomial time. Then, based on this proof, a mobility aware\nuser-by-user (MAUU) algorithm is developed. Simulation results verify the\neffectivenesses of the two approaches by comparing them to the lower bound of\nglobal optimum and conventional caching algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:28:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Deng", "Tao", ""], ["Ahani", "Ghafour", ""], ["Fan", "Pingzhi", ""], ["Yuan", "Di", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.11070", "submitter": "Seungmo Kim", "authors": "Seungmo Kim, Carl Dietrich", "title": "Coexistence of Outdoor Wi-Fi and Radar at 3.5 GHz", "comments": "Accepted for publication to IEEE Wireless Communications Letters", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Coexistence between radar and outdoor Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) needs\nthorough study since the IEEE 802.11 Working Group (WG) opposed the latest\nrules in 3550-3700 MHz (the 3.5 GHz band) that require \"exclusion zones.\" This\nletter proposes a method that suppresses Wi-Fi-to-radar (WtR) interference, in\nwhich a Wi-Fi transmitter (TX) is selected to avoid beam angles toward the\nvictim radar.
