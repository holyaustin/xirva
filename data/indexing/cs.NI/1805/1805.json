Thus, one of the major challenges\nin WSNs is to determine the coordinates of sensors while minimizing the\nhardware cost. To address this, numerous localization algorithms have been\nproposed in the literature. However, outcomes of these algorithms are affected\nby noise, fading, and interference. As a result, their levels of accuracy may\nbecome unacceptable in complex environments that contain obstacles and\nreflecting surfaces. The alternative is to use topological maps based only on\nconnectivity information. Since they do not contain information about physical\ndistances, however, they are not faithful representatives of the physical\nlayout. Thus, the primary goal of this research is to discover a topology map\nthat provides more accurate information about physical layouts. In doing so,\nthis research has resulted in four main contributions. First, a novel concept\nMaximum-Likelihood Topology Map for RF WSNs is presented. This topology map\nprovides a more accurate physical representation, by using the probability of\npacket reception. The second contribution is Millimetre wave Topology Map\ncalculation, which is a novel topology mapping algorithm based on maximum\nlikelihood estimation for millimetre wave WSNs. The third contribution is a\ndistributed algorithm being proposed to calculate the topology coordinates of\nsensors by themselves as two algorithms above calculate centrally, which\nrequires time. Since a topology map contains significant non-linear\ndistortions, two WSN applications i.e. target searching and extremum seeking,\nwhich use a proposed topology map to localize the sensors and perform its\nspecified task are presented as the final contribution of this dissertation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 00:04:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gunathillake", "Ashanie", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.00041", "submitter": "Vaneet Aggarwal", "authors": "Anis Elgabli and Vaneet Aggarwal and Shuai Hao and Feng Qian and\n  Subhabrata Sen", "title": "LBP: Robust Rate Adaptation Algorithm for SVC Video Streaming", "comments": "22 pages, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2018.

Our contribution is threefold.\nFirst, we formulate the quality decisions of video chunks constrained by the\navailable bandwidth, the playback buffer, and the chunk deadlines as an\noptimization problem. The objective is to optimize a novel QoE metric that\nmodels a combination of the three objectives of minimizing the stall/skip\nduration of the video, maximizing the playback quality of every chunk, and\nminimizing the number of quality switches.

The simulation experiments based on Riverbed Modeler demonstrate that\nthe proposed PMU fog can effectively reduce the data flow end-to-end (ETE)\ndelay without sacrificing data completeness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2018 15:04:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Zekun", ""], ["Chen", "Ning", ""], ["Chen", "Yu", ""], ["Zhou", "Ning", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.03721", "submitter": "Natanael Arndt", "authors": "Natanael Arndt, Patrick Naumann, Norman Radtke, Michael Martin, Edgard\n  Marx", "title": "Decentralized Collaborative Knowledge Management using Git", "comments": "Special Issue on Managing the Evolution and Preservation of the Data\n  Web", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.websem.2018.08.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.DC cs.MA cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The World Wide Web and the Semantic Web are designed as a network of\ndistributed services and datasets.

Considering mobile devices become both the content consumers and\nproviders, and majority of the contents are unnecessary to be uploaded to the\ncloud datacenter, at the network edge, we deploy a content server to store the\nraw contents generated from the mobile users, and a cache pool to store the\ncontents that are frequently requested by mobile users in the ECD. The cache\npools are ranked and high ranked cache pools will store contents with higher\npopularity. Furthermore, we propose edge content delivery scheme and edge\ncontent update scheme, based on content popularity and cache pool ranking. The\ncontent delivery scheme is to efficiently deliver contents to mobile users,\nwhile the edge content update scheme is to mitigate the content generated by\nusers to appropriate cache pools based on its request frequently and cache poor\nranking. The edge content delivery is completely different from the content\ndelivery network and can further reduce the load on the core network. In\naddition, because the top ranking cache pools are prioritized for higher\npriority contents and the cache pools are prioritized for higher priority\ncontents and the cache pools are in proximity to the mobile users, the\nimmediately interactive response between mobile users and cache pools can be\nachieved.

The work applies Dynamic Programming (DP), in particular,\nShortest Path search is used to determine the optimal functional split option\nconsidering traffic QoS requirements and available energy budget.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 14:53:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Temesgene", "Dagnachew A.", ""], ["Piovesan", "Nicola", ""], ["Miozzo", "Marco", ""], ["Dini", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12090", "submitter": "Luigi Vigneri", "authors": "Spyridon Vassilaras, Luigi Vigneri, Nikolaos Liakopoulos, Georgios S.\n  Paschos, Apostolos Destounis, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos, and Merouane Debbah", "title": "Problem-Adapted Artificial Intelligence for Online Network Optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Future 5G wireless networks will rely on agile and automated network\nmanagement, where the usage of diverse resources must be jointly optimized with\nsurgical accuracy.

In addition,\nsensor nodes in UWSNs are usually powered by batteries whose replacements\nintroduce high cost and complexity. Thus, the critical problem in UWSNs is to\nenable each sensor node to find enough anchor nodes in order to localize\nitself, with minimum energy costs. In this paper, an Energy-Efficient\nLocalization Algorithm (EELA) is proposed to analyze the decentralized\ninteractions among sensor nodes and anchor nodes. A\nSingle-Leader-Multi-Follower Stackelberg game is utilized to formulate the\ntopology control problem of sensor nodes and anchor nodes by exploiting their\navailable communication opportunities. In this game, the sensor node acts as a\nleader taking into account factors such as 'two-hop' anchor nodes and energy\nconsumption, while anchor nodes act as multiple followers, considering their\nability to localize sensor nodes and their energy consumption. We prove that\nboth players select best responses and reach a socially optimal Stackelberg\nNash Equilibrium. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed EELA\nimproves the perfor- mance of localization in UWSNs significantly, and in\nparticular the energy cost of sensor nodes. Compared to the baseline schemes,\nthe energy consumption per node is about 48% lower in EELA, while providing a\ndesirable localization coverage, under reasonable error and delay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 07:47:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Yali", ""], ["Liang", "Chencheng", ""], ["Kaneko", "Megumi", ""], ["Chen", "Xu", ""], ["Hogrefe", "Dieter", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12509", "submitter": "Michele Scarpiniti Dr.", "authors": "Enzo Baccarelli, Michele Scarpiniti, Alireza Momenzadeh", "title": "Fog-supported delay-constrained energy-saving live migration of VMs over\n  MultiPath TCP/IP 5G connections", "comments": "A shorter version of this paper has been submitted to IEEE Access", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The incoming era of the Fifth-Generation Fog Computing-supported Radio Access\nNetworks (shortly, 5G FOGRANs) aims at exploiting computing/networking resource\nvirtualization, in order to augment the limited resources of wireless devices\nthrough the seamless live migration of Virtual Machines (VMs) towards nearby\nFog data centers.
