In this paper we introduce an\nEnergy Efficient Location Aided Routing (EELAR) Protocol for MANETs that is\nbased on the Location Aided Routing (LAR). EELAR makes significant reduction in\nthe energy consumption of the mobile nodes batteries by limiting the area of\ndiscovering a new route to a smaller zone. Thus, control packets overhead is\nsignificantly reduced. In EELAR a reference wireless base station is used and\nthe network's circular area centered at the base station is divided into six\nequal sub-areas. At route discovery instead of flooding control packets to the\nwhole network area, they are flooded to only the sub-area of the destination\nmobile node. The base station stores locations of the mobile nodes in a\nposition table. To show the efficiency of the proposed protocol we present\nsimulations using NS-2. Simulation results show that EELAR protocol makes an\nimprovement in control packet overhead and delivery ratio compared to AODV,\nLAR, and DSR protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 05:32:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mikki", "Mohammad A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.0571", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Saad Ahmad Khan, Sheheryar Ali Arshad", "title": "QoS Provisioning Using Hybrid FSO RF Based Hierarchical Model for\n  Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "comments": "6 Pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS 2009, ISSN 1947 5500, Impact Factor 0.423\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 4, No. 1 & 2, August 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our objective is to provide guaranteed packet delivery service in time\nconstrained sensor networks.

A graph theoretic framework is introduced to study the fundamental\ntradeoffs between key storage, average key path length (directly related to the\nbattery consumption) and resilience (to compromised nodes) of key\npredistribution schemes for wireless sensor networks. Based on the proposed\nframework, a lower bound on key storage is derived for a given average key path\nlength. An upper bound on the compromising probability is also given. This\nframework also leads to the design of key assignment schemes with a storage\ncomplexity of the same order as the lower bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 02:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Aldar C-F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2024", "submitter": "Chi Anh La", "authors": "Chi-Anh La, Pietro Michiardi, Claudio Casetti, Carla-Fabiana\n  Chiasserini, Marco Fiore", "title": "A Lightweight Distributed Solution to Content Replication in Mobile\n  Networks", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Performance and reliability of content access in mobile networks is\nconditioned by the number and location of content replicas deployed at the\nnetwork nodes.

With the rapid and widespread adoption of CSMA technology, a\ncritical question is that whether CSMA networks can be as scalable as TDMA\nnetworks. To answer this question and explore the capacity of CSMA networks, we\nfirst formulate the models of CSMA protocols to take into account the unique\nCSMA characteristics not captured by existing interference models in the\nliterature. These CSMA models determine the feasible states, and consequently\nthe capacity of CSMA networks. We then study the throughput efficiency of CSMA\nscheduling as compared to TDMA. Finally, we tune the CSMA parameters so as to\nmaximize the throughput to the optimal order. As a result, we show that CSMA\ncan achieve throughput as $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$, the same order as\noptimal centralized TDMA, on uniform random networks.

For these\nsituations, one typically uses hypergraphs or simplicial complexes.\n  In this paper, we provide a precise framework in which graphs, hypergraphs,\nsimplicial complexes, and many other categories, all of which model higher\ngraphs, can be studied side-by-side. We show how to transform a hypergraph into\nits nearest simplicial analogue, for example. Our framework includes many new\ncategories as well, such as one that models broadcasting networks. We give\nseveral examples and applications of these ideas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2009 20:37:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Spivak", "David I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4516", "submitter": "Jos\\'e I.

Further investigations with the\nprototype implementation of our method in IEEE 802.11b/g testbeds reveal that\nthe accuracy of PDR estimation in mobile scenarios can be improved up to 50% in\ncomparison to generic packet-based PDR.
