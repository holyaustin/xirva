These redundant packets are Forward Error Correction (FEC)\nencoded RTP packets. A straightforward interpretation is that if no losses\noccur, the sender can increase the sending rate to include the FEC bit rate,\nand in the case of losses due to congestion the redundant packets help in\nrecovering the lost packets. We also show that by varying the FEC bit rate, the\nsender is able to conservatively or aggressively probe for available bandwidth.\nWe evaluate our FEC-based Rate Adaptation (FBRA) algorithm in a network\nsimulator and in the real-world and compare it to other congestion control\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Oct 2013 13:04:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Nagy", "Marcin", ""], ["Singh", "Varun", ""], ["Ott", "Joerg", ""], ["Eggert", "Lars", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.1679", "submitter": "Qingpei Cui", "authors": "Qingpei Cui, Tong Ye, Tony T.

However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to\nsatisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for\nwireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS\nrequirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing,\nwhere users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our\nspectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless\nchannels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and\nhow many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly\nheterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities,\nhardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we\nshow that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the\nmaximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also\nshow that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel\nselections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because\nbetter response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in\npolynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the\nworst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and\nchannels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the\nfrequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a\ngraph where players only contend with their neighbors.

In this paper, we propose a distributed\nalgorithm to compute data-gathering schedule that aim to improve the lifetime\nof WSN by suitably selecting energy-efficient data-flow paths from various\nsensors to the base station. For a multihop WSN with $n$ sensors, the proposed\nalgorithm first computes a schedule in $O(n^2)$ time steps, and then this\nschedule is periodically updated based the residual energy and the feedback\nreceived from the BS. The system performs approximately $\\log(\\mathcal{L})$\nschedule updates where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the expected lifetime of the system in\nnumber of data-gathering rounds.

This network feature is known to improve\noverall connectivity in 2D random networks operating at low channel path loss.\nTo this end, we advance recently established results to obtain analytic\nexpressions for the mean degree of 3D networks for simple but practical\nanisotropic gain profiles, including those of patch, dipole and end-fire array\nantennas. Our analysis reveals that for homogeneous systems (i.e. neglecting\nboundary effects) directional radiation patterns are superior to the isotropic\ncase only when the path loss exponent is less than the spatial dimension.\nMoreover, we establish that ad hoc networks utilizing directional transmit and\nisotropic receive antennas (or vice versa) are always sub-optimally connected\nregardless of the environment path loss. We extend our analysis to investigate\nboundary effects in inhomogeneous systems, and study the geometrical reasons\nwhy directional radiating nodes are at a disadvantage to isotropic ones.\nFinally, we discuss multi-directional gain patterns consisting of many equally\nspaced lobes which could be used to mitigate boundary effects and improve\noverall network connectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Oct 2013 16:05:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Georgiou", "Orestis", ""], ["Dettmann", "Carl P.", ""], ["Coon", "Justin P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7717", "submitter": "Nicola Bui", "authors": "Nicola Bui and Michele Rossi", "title": "Staying Alive: System Design for Self-Sufficient Sensor Networks", "comments": "42 pages, 17 figures, accepted in Transactions on Sensor Networks", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Self-sustainability is a crucial step for modern sensor networks.
