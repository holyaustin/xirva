Apart\nfrom low operational overhead, a highly attractive property of CHOKe is that it\ncan protect responsive TCP flows from unresponsive UDP flows. Particularly,\nprevious works have proven that CHOKe is able to bound both bandwidth share and\nbuffer share of (a possible aggregate) UDP traffic (flow) on a link. However,\nthese studies consider, and pertain only to, a steady state where the queue\nreaches equilibrium in the presence of many (long-lived) TCP flows and an\nunresponsive UDP flow of fixed arrival rate. If the steady state conditions are\nperturbed, particularly when UDP traffic rate changes over time, it is unclear\nwhether the protection property of CHOKe still holds. Indeed, it can be\nexamined, for example, that when UDP rate suddenly becomes 0 (i.e., flow\nstops), the unresponsive flow may assume close to full utilization in sub-RTT\nscales, potentially starving out the TCP flows. To explain this apparent\ndiscrepancy, this paper investigates CHOKe queue properties in a transient\nregime, which is the time period of transition between two steady states of the\nqueue, initiated when the rate of the unresponsive flow changes. Explicit\nexpressions that characterize flow throughputs in transient regimes are\nderived.

To cope\nwith the increasing demand for content, CPs deploy massively distributed\ninfrastructures. This poses new challenges for CPs as they have to dynamically\nmap end-users to appropriate servers, without being fully aware of network\nconditions within an ISP as well as the end-users network locations.\nFurthermore, ISPs struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the\ndynamic server selection process of CPs.\n  In this paper, we argue that the challenges that CPs and ISPs face separately\ntoday can be turned into an opportunity. We show how they can jointly take\nadvantage of the deployed distributed infrastructures to improve their\noperation and end-user performance. We propose Content-aware Traffic\nEngineering (CaTE), which dynamically adapts the traffic demand for content\nhosted on CPs by utilizing ISP network information and end-user location during\nthe server selection process. As a result, CPs enhance their end-user to server\nmapping and improve end-user experience, thanks to the ability of\nnetwork-informed server selection to circumvent network bottlenecks. In\naddition, ISPs gain the ability to partially influence the traffic demands in\ntheir networks. Our results with operational data show improvements in path\nlength and delay between end-user and the assigned CP server, network wide\ntraffic reduction of up to 15%, and a decrease in ISP link utilization of up to\n40% when applying CaTE to traffic delivered by a small number of major CPs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 17:11:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Benjamin", ""], ["Poese", "Ingmar", ""], ["Smaragdakis", "Georgios", ""], ["Uhlig", "Steve", ""], ["Feldmann", "Anja", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.1584", "submitter": "Kai Han", "authors": "Kai Han, Liu Xiang, Jun Luo, and Yang Liu", "title": "MEGCOM: Min-Energy Group COMmunication in Multi-hop Wireless Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given the increasing demand from wireless applications, designing\nenergy-efficient group communication protocols is of great importance to\nmulti-hop wireless networks.

The existing schemes consider homogeneous\nsensor networks which have poor performance and scalability.

Most\nexisting schemes establish shared keys for all the sensors no matter whether\nthey are communicating or not. Hence it leads to large storage overhead.\nAnother problem in sensor network is compromised node attack and denial of\nservice attack which occurs because of its wireless nature. Existing multi path\nrouting algorithms are vulnerable to these attacks. So once an adversary\nacquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the\nsource, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes. If an\nadversary performs node compromise attack, they can easily get the encryption/\ndecryption keys used by that node and hence they can intercept the information\neasily.

The major challenge in femtocell networks is\ninterference management which in our system, based on the Long Term Evolution\n(LTE) standard, translates to which user should be allocated which physical\nresource block (or fraction thereof) from which femtocell access point (FAP).\nThe globally optimal solution requires integer programming and is\nmathematically intractable. We propose a hierarchical three-stage solution:\nfirst, the load of each FAP is estimated considering the number of users\nconnected to the FAP, their average channel gain and required data rates.\nSecond, based on each FAP's load, the physical resource blocks (PRBs) are\nallocated to FAPs in a manner that minimizes the interference by coloring the\nmodified interference graph. Finally, the resource allocation is performed at\neach FAP considering users' instantaneous channel gain. The two major\nadvantages of this suboptimal approach are the significantly reduced\ncomputation complexity and the fact that the proposed algorithm only uses\ninformation that is already likely to be available at the nodes executing the\nrelevant optimization step. The performance of the proposed solution is\nevaluated in networks based on the LTE standard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2012 19:03:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sadr", "Sanam", ""], ["Adve", "Raviraj", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.5755", "submitter": "Kirill Kogan", "authors": "Kirill Kogan, Alejandro Lopez-Ortiz, Sergey I.

Although the performance\ngains of cooperative approaches are well known, the combinatorial nature of\nthese schemes makes it difficult to design efficient polynomial-time algorithms\nfor joint routing, scheduling and power control. This becomes more so when\nthere is more than one flow in the network. It has been conjectured by many\nauthors, in the literature, that the multiflow problem in cooperative networks\nis an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formulate the problem, as a\ncombinatorial optimization problem, for a general setting of $k$-flows, and\nformally prove that the problem is not only NP-hard but it is\n$o(n^{1/7-\\epsilon})$ inapproxmiable. To our knowledge*, these results provide\nthe first such inapproxmiablity proof in the context of multiflow cooperative\nwireless networks. We further prove that for a special case of k = 1 the\nsolution is a simple path, and devise a polynomial time algorithm for jointly\noptimizing routing, scheduling and power control. We then use this algorithm to\nestablish analytical upper and lower bounds for the optimal performance for the\ngeneral case of $k$ flows. Furthermore, we propose a polynomial time heuristic\nfor calculating the solution for the general case and evaluate the performance\nof this heuristic under different channel conditions and against the analytical\nupper and lower bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 19:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Baghaie", "Marjan", ""], ["Hochbaum", "Dorit S.", ""], ["Krishnamachari", "Bhaskar", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6291", "submitter": "Antonio Fern\\'andez Anta", "authors": "Jordi Arjona Aroca and Antonio Fern\\'andez Anta", "title": "Bisection (Band)Width of Product Networks with Application to Data\n  Centers", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC cs.DM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The bisection width of interconnection networks has always been important in\nparallel computing, since it bounds the amount of information that can be moved\nfrom one side of a network to another, i.e., the bisection bandwidth.

For\ninstance, the problem of finding the exact bisection width of the\nmultidimensional torus was posed by Leighton and has remained open for almost\n20 years. In this paper we provide the exact value of the bisection width of\nthe torus, as well as of several d-dimensional classical parallel topologies\nthat can be obtained by the application of the Cartesian product of graphs.
