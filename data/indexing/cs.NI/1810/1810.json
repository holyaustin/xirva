To address these\nchallenges, we propose a deep learning based caching for self-driving car, by\nusing Deep Learning approaches deployed on the Multi-access Edge Computing\n(MEC) structure.

Firstly, based on proposed multivariate flow\nsimilarity method on temporal locality, a complex network model (MFS-TL) is\nconstructed to describe the interactive behaviors of traffic flows. Having\nanalyzed the relationships between MFS-TL characteristics, temporal locality\nwindow and multivariate flow similarity critical threshold, an approach for\nparameter determination is established. Having observed the evolution of MFS-TL\ncharacteristics, three non-deterministic correlations are defined for network\nstates (i.e. normal or abnormal). Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS)\nis introduced to quantify three non-deterministic correlations, and then a\nanomaly detection method is put forward for single characteristic sequence. To\nbuild an objective IFS, we design a Gaussian distribution-based membership\nfunction with a variable hesitation degree. To determine the mapping of IFS's\nclustering intervals to network states, a distinction index is developed.

Most\nof these devices are expected to be of low-complexity, low-cost, and limited\npower supply, which impose stringent constraints on the network operation. In\nthis regard, this paper investigates aerial data aggregation and field\nestimation from a finite spatial field via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nInstead of fusing, relaying, and routing the data across the wireless nodes to\nfixed locations access points, a UAV flies over the field and collects the\nrequired data for two prominent missions; data aggregation and field\nestimation. To accomplish these tasks, the field of interest is divided into\nseveral subregions over which the UAV hovers to collect samples from the\nunderlying nodes. To this end, we formulate and solve an optimization problem\nto minimize total hovering and traveling time of each mission. While the former\nrequires the collection of a prescribed average number of samples from the\nfield, the latter ensures for a given field spatial correlation model that the\naverage mean-squared estimation error of the field value is no more than a\npredetermined threshold at any point. These goals are fulfilled by optimizing\nthe number of subregions, the area of each subregion, the hovering locations,\nthe hovering time at each location, and the trajectory traversed between\nhovering locations. The proposed formulation is shown to be np-hard mixed\ninteger problem, and hence, a decoupled heuristic solution is proposed.

Simply stated, the goal of our framework is clustering IP addresses\n(clients) such that in each cluster the choice of best available server is same\n(or similar). Then, finding a best available server for one client in a given\ncluster will be sufficient to assign that server to the rest of the clients in\nthe cluster.\n  To achieve this goal, first we introduce two distance metrics to compute how\nsimilar the server choices of any given two clients. Second, we use a\nclustering method that is based on interdomain routing information. We evaluate\nthe goodness of our clusters by using the metrics we introduce. We show that\nthere is a strong correlation between the similarity in how two destination\nclients are routed to in the Internet and the similarity in their server\nselections. Finally, we show how to choose representative clients from each\ncluster so that it is sufficient to learn the latencies from the CDN servers to\nthe representative and find a best available server accordingly for the rest of\nthe clients in the same cluster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Oct 2018 13:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gursun", "Gonca", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.09134", "submitter": "Maxime Piraux", "authors": "Maxime Piraux, Quentin De Coninck, Olivier Bonaventure", "title": "Observing the Evolution of QUIC Implementations", "comments": "6 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3284850.3284852", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The QUIC protocol combines features that were initially found inside the TCP,\nTLS and HTTP/2 protocols.

Canopus is a scalable distributed\nconsensus protocol that ensures that live nodes in a system agree on an ordered\nsequence of operations (called transactions). Unlike most prior consensus\nprotocols, Canopus does not rely on a single leader. Instead, it uses a virtual\ntree overlay for message dissemination to limit network traffic across\noversubscribed links. It leverages hardware redundancies, both within a rack\nand inside the network fabric, to reduce both protocol complexity and\ncommunication overhead. These design decisions enable Canopus to support large\ndeployments without significant performance degradation.\n  The existing Canopus protocol is resilient in the face of node and\ncommunication failures, but its focus is primarily on performance, so does not\nrespond well to other types of failures. For example, the failure of a single\nrack of servers causes all live nodes to stall. The protocol is also open to\nattack by Byzantine nodes, which can cause different live nodes to conclude the\nprotocol with different transaction orders. In this paper, we describe RCanopus\n(`resilent Canopus') which extends Canopus to add liveness, that is, allowing\nlive nodes to make progress, when possible, despite many types of failures.\nThis requires RCanopus to accurately detect and recover from failure despite\nusing unreliable failure detectors, and tolerance of Byzantine attacks.

Many existing works discuss either heuristics or exact algorithms,\nresulting in a choice between quick runtimes and quality guarantees for the\nsolutions. Recently, the first fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) approximation\nalgorithm for the VNEP with arbitrary request and substrate topologies has been\npublished by Rost and Schmid. This algorithm is based on a LP formulation and\nis FPT in the newly introduced graph parameter extraction width (EW). It\ntherefore combines positive traits of heuristics and exact approaches: The\nruntime is polynomial for instances with bounded EW, and the algorithm returns\napproximate solutions with high probability.\n  We propose two extensions of this algorithm to optimize its runtime. Firstly,\nwe develop a new LP formulation related to tree decompositions. We show that\nthis LP formulation is always smaller, and that the resulting algorithm is FPT\nin the new parameter extraction label width (ELW). We improve on two important\nresults by Rost and Schmid: For centrally rooted half-wheel topologies, the EW\nscales linearly with request size, whereas the ELW is constant. Further, adding\nany number of paths parallel to an existing edge increases the EW by at most\nthe maximum degree of the request. By contrast, the ELW only increases by at\nmost one. Lastly, we show that finding the minimal ELW is NP-hard.\n  Secondly, we consider the approach of partitioning the request into subgraphs\nwhich are processed independently, yielding even smaller LP formulations. While\nthis algorithm may lead to higher ELW within the subgraphs, we show that this\nincrease is always smaller than the size of the inter-subgraph boundary.

A significant\ndrawback of the state-of-the-art have been designing a WCN in which the\nservice-oriented performance measures (e.g., throughput) are optimized without\nconsidering different relevant decisions such as determining the location and\nallocating the resources, jointly. In this study, we address the UAVBS location\nand bandwidth allocation problems together to optimize the total network\nprofit. In particular, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP)\nformulation is developed, in which the location of a single UAVBS and bandwidth\nallocations to users are jointly determined. The objective is to maximize the\ntotal profit without exceeding the backhaul and access capacities. The profit\ngained from a specific user is assumed to be a piecewise-linear function of the\nprovided data rate level, where higher data rate levels would yield higher\nprofit. Due to high complexity of the MINLP, we propose an efficient heuristic\nalgorithm with lower computational complexity. We show that, when the UAVBS\nlocation is determined, the resource allocation problem can be reduced to a\nMultidimensional Binary Knapsack Problem (MBKP), which can be solved in\npseudo-polynomial time.

Based on BDR, we design a multi hosts' cardinalities\nestimation algorithm under sliding time window, virtual bit distance recorder\nVBDR. VBDR allocate a virtual vector of BDR for every host and every physical\nBDR is shared by several hosts to improve the memory usage. After a small\nmodifcation, we propose another two parallel versions of VBDR which can run on\nGPU to handle high speed traffic. One of these parallel VBDR is fast in IP pair\nscanning and the other one is memory efficient.

In this work, we focus on\nhow to fulfill the expected sojourn time of passengers in carpooling service\nusing coalition game. We formulate the QoE guarantee problem as a benefit\nallocation problem. To solve the problem, we quantify the impatience of\npassengers due to detouring time delay, depending on their own expected sojourn\ntime and expected compensation per unit time of delay. The algorithm named PCA\nis proposed to minimize the impatience of all passengers, under which we\ncalculate the compensation for passengers based on Shapley value. We prove that\nPCA can guarantee the fairness of passengers. Extensive simulation results\ndemonstrate that PCA can minimize the impatience of passengers. Moreover,\ncompared with the existing algorithm DST, PCA can reduce the payment of each\npassenger by 14.4 percent averagely with only 13.3 percent loss of driver's\nrevenue.
