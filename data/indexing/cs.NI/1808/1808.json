In such scenarios, UAVs can make more efficient\ndecisions if they acquire more information about the mobility, sensing and\nactuation capabilities of their neighbor nodes. In this paper, we develop an\nunsupervised online learning algorithm for joint mobility prediction and object\nprofiling of UAVs to facilitate control and communication protocols.

We evaluate the applicability of the proposed approach using the\nStudentLife dataset which contains Wi-Fi, GPS, and accelerometer measurements\ncollected from smartphones of 49 students within a three-month period.

This necessitates the development of a simple yet\nenergy efficient routing scheme for wireless IoT sensor networks.

To conserve the energy of device nodes, the routing\nprotocol first aggregates devices into clusters based on a number of different\nfeatures such as distance from base station, data/message length and data\nsensed from the environment in the current epoch. Then, a cluster head is\nelected for each cluster and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is generated with\nall the cluster heads as nodes. Edges represent communication intent from\ntransmitter to receiver and the edge weights are computed using a formulated\nequation. The minimum cost path to the base station is computed to allow for\nefficient real-time routing. Sleep scheduling is also optionally used to\nfurther boost network energy efficiency.

Our goal is to\nacquire an online algorithm that optimally adapts task offloading decisions and\nwireless resource allocations to the time-varying wireless channel conditions.\nThis requires quickly solving hard combinatorial optimization problems within\nthe channel coherence time, which is hardly achievable with conventional\nnumerical optimization methods. To tackle this problem, we propose a Deep\nReinforcement learning-based Online Offloading (DROO) framework that implements\na deep neural network as a scalable solution that learns the binary offloading\ndecisions from the experience. It eliminates the need of solving combinatorial\noptimization problems, and thus greatly reduces the computational complexity\nespecially in large-size networks. To further reduce the complexity, we propose\nan adaptive procedure that automatically adjusts the parameters of the DROO\nalgorithm on the fly. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can\nachieve near-optimal performance while significantly decreasing the computation\ntime by more than an order of magnitude compared with existing optimization\nmethods.

The\nproposed framework allows to exploit the multi-community social context of\nusers for improving the local offloading of cached content in a multihop D2D\nnetwork. To model the collaborative effect of a set of UEs on content\noffloading, a cooperative game between the UEs is formulated. For this game, it\nis shown that the Shapley value (SV) of each UE effectively captures the impact\nof this UE on the overall content offloading process. To capture the presence\nof multiple social communities that connect the UEs, a hypergraph model is\nproposed. Two line graphs, an influence-weighted graph, and a\nconnectivity-weighted graph, are developed for analyzing the proposed hypergaph\nmodel. Using the developed line graphs along with the SV of the cooperative\ngame, a precise offloading power metric is derived for each UE within a\nmulti-community, multi-hop D2D network. Then, UEs with high offloading power\nare chosen as the optimal locations for caching the popular content. Simulation\nresults show that, on the average, the proposed cache placement framework\nachieves 12%, 19%, and 21% improvements in terms of the number of UEs that\nreceived offloaded popular content compared to the schemes based on\nbetweenness, degree, and closeness centrality, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 06:15:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Soorki", "Mehdi Naderi", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Manshaei", "Mohammad Hossein", ""], ["Saidi", "Hossein", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.02975", "submitter": "Sabidur Rahman", "authors": "Sabidur Rahman, Tanjila Ahmed, Minh Huynh, Massimo Tornatore, and\n  Biswanath Mukherjee", "title": "Auto-Scaling Network Resources using Machine Learning to Improve QoS and\n  Reduce Cost", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Virtualization of network functions (as virtual routers, virtual firewalls,\netc.) enables network owners to efficiently respond to the increasing\ndynamicity of network services.

In this paper,\nwe formulate cellular network performance tuning as a reinforcement learning\n(RL) problem and provide a solution to improve the performance for indoor and\noutdoor environments. By leveraging the ability of Q-learning to estimate\nfuture performance improvement rewards, we propose two algorithms: (1) closed\nloop power control (PC) for downlink voice over LTE (VoLTE) and (2)\nself-organizing network (SON) fault management. The VoLTE PC algorithm uses RL\nto adjust the indoor base station transmit power so that the signal to\ninterference plus noise ratio (SINR) of a user equipment (UE) meets the target\nSINR. It does so without the UE having to send power control requests. The SON\nfault management algorithm uses RL to improve the performance of an outdoor\nbase station cluster by resolving faults in the network through configuration\nmanagement. Both algorithms exploit measurements from the connected users,\nwireless impairments, and relevant configuration parameters to solve a\nnon-convex performance optimization problem using RL. Simulation results show\nthat our proposed RL based algorithms outperform the industry standards today\nin realistic cellular communication environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2018 22:46:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2019 21:12:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 5 May 2019 18:42:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 17:49:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 18 Jul 2019 12:29:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 04:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mismar", "Faris B.", ""], ["Choi", "Jinseok", ""], ["Evans", "Brian L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.05195", "submitter": "Mehrdad Hessar", "authors": "Mehrdad Hessar, Ali Najafi, Shyamnath Gollakota", "title": "NetScatter: Enabling Large-Scale Backscatter Networks", "comments": "13 pages, 19 figures, To be published at 16th USENIX Symposium on\n  Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI 19)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the first wireless protocol that scales to hundreds of concurrent\ntransmissions from backscatter devices.

In this work, we propose a new interference\nestimation and CA performance prediction algorithm called CALM, which is\ninspired by social theory. We borrow the sociological idea of a \"sui generis\"\nsocial reality, and apply it to WMNs with significant success. To achieve this,\nwe devise a novel Sociological Idea Borrowing Mechanism that facilitates easy\noperationalization of sociological concepts in other domains. Further, we\nformulate a heuristic Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model called NETCAP which\nmakes use of link quality estimates generated by CALM to offer a reliable\nframework for network capacity prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of CALM\nby evaluating its theoretical estimates against experimental data obtained\nthrough exhaustive simulations on ns-3 802.11g environment, for a comprehensive\nCA test-set of forty CA schemes. We compare CALM with three existing\ninterference estimation metrics, and demonstrate that it is consistently more\nreliable.

However, for\nproviders to agree to pool their resources, the arrangement has to be mutually\nbeneficial. The traditional notion of resource pooling, which implies complete\nsharing, need not have this property. For example, under full pooling, one of\nthe providers may be worse off and hence have no incentive to participate. In\nthis paper, we propose partial resource sharing models as a generalization of\nfull pooling, which can be configured to be beneficial to all participants.\n  We formally define and analyze two partial sharing models between two service\nproviders, each of which is an Erlang-B loss system with the blocking\nprobabilities as the performance measure. We show that there always exist\npartial sharing configurations that are beneficial to both providers,\nirrespective of the load and the number of circuits of each of the providers. A\nkey result is that the Pareto frontier has at least one of the providers\nsharing all its resources with the other. Furthermore, full pooling may not lie\ninside this Pareto set. The choice of the sharing configurations within the\nPareto set is formalized based on bargaining theory.

The\nharvested energy then can be used to transmit data when the primary channel\nbecomes idle. To maximize the throughput for the secondary system, it is\ncritical for the RSU to decide when to backscatter and when to harvest energy.\nThis optimal decision has to account for the dynamics of the primary channel,\nenergy storage capability, and data to be sent. To tackle that problem, we\npropose a Markov decision process (MDP)-based framework to optimize RSU's\ndecisions based on its current states, e.g., energy, data as well as the\nprimary channel state.

For\nthe first scenario, a number of trusted cooperative half-duplex relays is\nemployed to assist with the BS's transmission and secure its signals from the\nexternal eavesdropper.

We show that\nthe ADR technique lacks the agility to adapt to the changing link conditions,\nrequiring a number of hours to days to converge to a reliable and\nenergy-efficient communication state. As a vital step towards improving this\nsituation, we then change different control knobs or parameters in the ADR\ntechnique to observe their effects on the convergence time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2018 13:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Shengyang", ""], ["Raza", "Usman", ""], ["Khan", "Aftab", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.09390", "submitter": "Jaydip Sen", "authors": "Jaydip Sen, Moonkun Lee, Sunghyeon Lee, Yeongbok Choe, Menachem Domb,\n  Arpan Pal, Hemant Kumar Rath, Samar Shailendra, Abhijan Bhattacharyya, Albena\n  Mihovska, Mahasweta Sarkar, Hyun Jung Lee, Myungho Kim, and Alexandru Averian", "title": "Internet of Things: Technology, Applications and Standardardization", "comments": "The book contains 137 pages.

One major\nlimitation with PS is the sparsity of notifications owing to lack of active\nparticipation, thus inhibiting large scale real-life experiments for the\nresearch community.
