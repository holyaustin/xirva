In this paper, we model and\nanalyze cognitive and energy harvesting-based D2D communication in cellular\nnetworks. The cognitive D2D transmitters harvest energy from ambient\ninterference and use one of the channels allocated to cellular users (in uplink\nor downlink), which is referred to as the D2D channel, to communicate with the\ncorresponding receivers. We investigate two spectrum access policies for\ncellular communication in the uplink or downlink, namely, random spectrum\naccess (RSA) policy and prioritized spectrum access (PSA) policy. In RSA, any\nof the available channels including the channel used by the D2D transmitters\ncan be selected randomly for cellular communication, while in PSA the D2D\nchannel is used only when all of the other channels are occupied. A D2D\ntransmitter can communicate successfully with its receiver only when it\nharvests enough energy to perform channel inversion toward the receiver, the\nD2D channel is free, and the $\\mathsf{SINR}$ at the receiver is above the\nrequired threshold; otherwise, an outage occurs for the D2D communication.

However, co-channel\ndeployment of multiple tiers of BSs gives rise to the problem of cross-tier\ninterference that significantly impacts the performance of wireless networks.\nMulticell cooperation techniques, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP)\ntransmission, have been proposed as a promising solution to mitigate the impact\nof the cross-tier interference in multi-tier networks.

Each ONU checks all arrival\ndownstream packets and selects the downstream packets destined to itself.\nTherefore, receivers at ONUs have to always stay awake, thus consuming a large\namount of energy.

Specifically, we introduce a one-to-many bargaining game among the MNO\nand APOs, and analyze the bargaining solution (game equilibrium) systematically\nunder two different bargaining protocols: (i) sequential bargaining, where the\nMNO bargains with APOs sequentially, with one APO at a time, in a given order,\nand (ii) concurrent bargaining, where the MNO bargains with all APOs\nconcurrently. We quantify the benefits for APOs when bargaining sequentially\nand earlier with the MNO, and the losses for APOs when bargaining concurrently\nwith the MNO. We further study the group bargaining scenario where multiple\nAPOs form a group bargaining with the MNO jointly, and quantify the benefits\nfor APOs when forming such a group.

Then, we extend our algorithm to\nhybrid access femtocells where some intra-femtocell resources are dedicated\nonly for femtocell owners while remaining resources are shared with foreign\nmacrocell users. Our evaluation results show that the proposed parameter\noptimization schemes significantly enhance the performance of macrocell users\nthanks to the large offloading gain. The benefits provided to femtocell users\nare also adaptively maintained according to the femtocell users' requirements.\nThe results in this paper provide insights about the situations where femtocell\ndeployment on dedicated channels is preferred to the co-channel deployment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 02:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Dongmyoung", ""], ["Park", "Taejun", ""], ["Kim", "Hyoil", ""], ["Choi", "Sunghyun", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.6953", "submitter": "J\\'anos Farkas Ph.D.", "authors": "J\\'anos Farkas, Stephen Haddock, Panagiotis Saltsidis", "title": "Software Defined Networking Supported by IEEE 802.1Q", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper gives an overview on how Software Defined Networking (SDN)\nprinciples can be applied to existing Ethernet merchant silicon considering the\nrequirements modern networks face.

We formulate this problem as a\ndiscounted Markov decision process (MDP) framework, whereby the energy\nharvesting process is stochastically quantized into several representative\nsolar states with distinct energy arrivals and is totally driven by historical\ndata records at a sensor node. With the observed solar irradiance at each time\nepoch, a mixed strategy is developed to compute the belief information of the\nunderlying solar states for the choice of transmission parameters. In addition,\na theoretical analysis is conducted for a simple on-off policy, in which a\npredetermined transmission parameter is utilized whenever a sensor node is\nactive. We prove that such an optimal policy has a threshold structure with\nrespect to battery states and evaluate the performance of an energy harvesting\nnode by analyzing the expected net bit rate. The design framework is\nexemplified with real solar data records, and the results are useful in\ncharacterizing the interplay that occurs between energy harvesting and\nexpenditure under various system configurations.
