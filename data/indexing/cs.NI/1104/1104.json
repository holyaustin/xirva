In a D-MAB problem there are $M$ users and $N$ arms (channels)\nthat each offer i.i.d. stochastic rewards with unknown means so long as they\nare accessed without collision. The goal is to design a decentralized online\nlearning policy that incurs minimal regret, defined as the difference between\nthe total expected rewards accumulated by a model-aware genie, and that\nobtained by all users applying the policy. We make two contributions in this\npaper. First, we consider the setting where the users have a prioritized\nranking, such that it is desired for the $K$-th-ranked user to learn to access\nthe arm offering the $K$-th highest mean reward. For this problem, we present\nthe first distributed policy that yields regret that is uniformly logarithmic\nover time without requiring any prior assumption about the mean rewards.\nSecond, we consider the case when a fair access policy is required, i.e., it is\ndesired for all users to experience the same mean reward. For this problem, we\npresent a distributed policy that yields order-optimal regret scaling with\nrespect to the number of users and arms, better than previously proposed\npolicies in the literature. Both of our distributed policies make use of an\ninnovative modification of the well known UCB1 policy for the classic\nmulti-armed bandit problem that allows a single user to learn how to play the\narm that yields the $K$-th largest mean reward.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 08:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gai", "Yi", ""], ["Krishnamachari", "Bhaskar", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0142", "submitter": "Sumit Kumar", "authors": "Sumit Kumar, Deepti Singhal, Rama Murthy Garimella (International\n  Institute of Information Technology, India)", "title": "Doubly Cognitive Architecture Based Cognitive Wireless Sensor Network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nowadays scarcity of spectrum availability is increasing highly.

Thus, the major issue for operators is to find the best\nsolution at reasonable expanses. The femto cell seems to be the answer to this\nproblematic. In this work (This work is supported by the COMET project AWARE.\nhttp://www.ftw.at/news/project-start-for-aware-ftw), we focus on the problem of\nsharing femto access between a same mobile operator's customers. This problem\ncan be modeled as a game where service requesters customers (SRCs) and service\nproviders customers (SPCs) are the players.\n  This work addresses the sharing femto access problem considering only one SPC\nusing game theory tools. We consider that SRCs are static and have some similar\nand regular connection behavior. We also note that the SPC and each SRC have a\nsoftware embedded respectively on its femto access, user equipment (UE).\n  After each connection requested by a SRC, its software will learn the\nstrategy increasing its gain knowing that no information about the other SRCs\nstrategies is given. The following article presents a distributed learning\nalgorithm with incomplete information running in SRCs software. We will then\nanswer the following questions for a game with $N$ SRCs and one SPC: how many\nconnections are necessary for each SRC in order to learn the strategy\nmaximizing its gain? Does this algorithm converge to a stable state? If yes,\ndoes this state a Nash Equilibrium and is there any way to optimize the\nlearning process duration time triggered by SRCs software?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 14:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Krichen", "Mariem", ""], ["Cohen", "Johanne", ""], ["Barth", "Dominique", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5170", "submitter": "Harshan Jagadeesh", "authors": "J.

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called the\nConstellation Power Allocation (CPA) scheme, wherein the instantaneous transmit\npower of the two users are varied by maintaining their average power\nconstraints. We show that the CPA scheme offers CC sum capacities equal (at low\nSNR values) or close (at high SNR values) to those offered by the CR scheme\nwith reduced decoding complexity for QAM constellations. We study the\nrobustness of the CPA scheme for random phase offsets in the channel and\nunequal average power constraints for the two users. With random phase offsets\nin the channel, we show that the CC sum capacity offered by the CPA scheme is\nmore than the CR scheme at high SNR values. With unequal average power\nconstraints, we show that the CPA scheme provides maximum gain when the power\nlevels are close, and the advantage diminishes with the increase in the power\ndifference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 15:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Nov 2012 01:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Harshan", "J.", ""], ["Rajan", "B.
