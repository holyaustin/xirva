A generalized Kelly mechanism\n(GKM) is also designed, based on which the upper level of the resource\nallocation issue (i.e., between the InP and MVNOs) is addressed.

Thus, xRAC improves network security without\nmodifying core parts of applications, hosts, and infrastructure. In this paper,\nwe review the technological background of xRAC, explain its architecture,\ndiscuss selected use cases, and investigate on the performance. To demonstrate\nthe feasibility of xRAC, we implement it based on standard components with only\na few modifications. Finally, we validate xRAC through experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 12:11:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hauser", "Frederik", ""], ["Schmidt", "Mark", ""], ["Menth", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03592", "submitter": "Sejuti Banik", "authors": "Sejuti Banik, Irvin Steve Cardenas, Jong Hoon Kim", "title": "IoT Platforms for 5G Network and Practical Considerations: A Survey", "comments": "14 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fifth generation (5G) mobile network will enable the Internet of Things\n(IoT) to take a large leap into the age of future computing.

Essentially, our proposed method decouples the joint design of UAV\ntrajectory and communication scheduling into two phases: namely, an offline\nphase that determines the UAV path prior to its flight based on the\nprobabilistic LoS channel model, followed by an online phase that adaptively\nadjusts the UAV flying speeds along the offline optimized path as well as\ncommunication scheduling based on the instantaneous UAV-SNs CSI and SNs'\nindividual amounts of data received accumulatively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Jul 2019 07:42:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 12:51:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["You", "Changsheng", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.06197", "submitter": "Marcello Caleffi", "authors": "Angela Sara Cacciapuoti, Marcello Caleffi, Rodney Van Meter, Lajos\n  Hanzo", "title": "When Entanglement meets Classical Communications: Quantum Teleportation\n  for the Quantum Internet (Invited Paper)", "comments": "Invited Paper, 53 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables, double column", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2020", "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2020.2978071", "report-no": null, "categories": "quant-ph cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantum Teleportation is the key communication functionality of the Quantum\nInternet, allowing the \"transmission' of qubits without either the physical\ntransfer of the particle storing the qubit or the violation of the quantum\nmechanical principles.

To evaluate the performance of VAE-CIR,\nwe generate the beam-specific CIRs by simulating the beam sweeping of 802.11ad\ndevices with the beam patterns measured on off-the-shelf 802.11ad devices. The\n60GHz channel is generated via a ray-tracing simulator and the CIRs are\nextracted via channel estimation based on Golay sequences. Through experiments\nin various scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of VAE-CIR and its\nsuperiority to existing angular inference schemes for 802.11ad devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:00:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ding", "Haichuan", ""], ["Shin", "Kang G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.10669", "submitter": "Francesco Malandrino", "authors": "Francesco Malandrino and Carla-Fabiana Chiasserini and Claudio Casetti\n  and Giada Landi and Marco Capitani", "title": "An Optimization-enhanced MANO for Energy-efficient 5G Networks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1804.05187", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  5G network nodes, fronthaul and backhaul alike, will have both forwarding and\ncomputational capabilities.

We first\nanalyze the adversary model of stealthy DoS attacks, the related\nvulnerabilities in SDN-based networks and the key characteristics of stealthy\nDoS attacks. Next, we describe and analyze an anomaly detection system that\nuses a Reinforcement Learning-based approach based on Q-Learning in order to\nmaximize its detection performance. Finally, we outline the complete Q-MIND\ndefense framework that incorporates the optimal policy derived from the\nQ-Learning agent to efficiently defeat stealthy DoS attacks in SDN-based\nnetworks. An extensive comparison of the Q-MIND framework and currently\nexisting methods shows that significant improvements in attack detection and\nmitigation performance are obtained by Q-MIND.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2019 10:12:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2019 18:12:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Phan", "Trung V.", ""], ["Gias", "T M Rayhan", ""], ["Islam", "Syed Tasnimul", ""], ["Huong", "Truong Thu", ""], ["Thanh", "Nguyen Huu", ""], ["Bauschert", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12307", "submitter": "Philipp Gorczak", "authors": "Philipp Gorczak, Caner Bektas, Fabian Kurtz, Thomas L\\\"ubcke,\n  Christian Wietfeld", "title": "Robust Cellular Communications for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in Maritime\n  Search and Rescue", "comments": "IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are a promising technology for fast, large\nscale survey operations such as maritime search and rescue (SAR).

To overcome these effects, we consider a\ndistributed cooperative beamforming system, which relies on static relays\ndeployed in clusters with similar channel characteristics, and where, at every\ntime instance, only one relay from each cluster is selected to participate in\nbeamforming to the destination. To meet the quality-of-service guarantees of\nthe network, a key prerequisite for beamforming is relay selection. However, as\nthe channels change with time, relay selection becomes a resource demanding\ntask. Indeed, estimation of channel state information for all candidate relays,\nessential for relay selection, is a process that takes up bandwidth, wastes\npower and introduces latency and interference in the network. We instead\npropose a unique, predictive scheme for resource efficient relay selection,\nwhich exploits the special propagation patterns of the mmWave medium, and can\nbe executed distributively across clusters, and in parallel to optimal\nbeamforming-based communication. The proposed predictive scheme efficiently\nexploits spatiotemporal channel correlations with current and past networkwide\nReceived Signal Strength (RSS), the latter being invariant to relay cluster\nsize, measured sequentially during the operation of the system. Our numerical\nresults confirm that our proposed relay selection strategy outperforms any\nrandomized selection policy that does not exploit channel correlations,\nwhereas, at the same time, it performs very close to an ideal scheme that uses\ncomplete, cluster size dependent RSS, and offers significant savings in terms\nof channel estimation overhead, providing substantially better network\nutilization, especially in dense topologies, typical in mmWave networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 19:47:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dimas", "Anastasios", ""], ["Kalogerias", "Dionysios S.", ""], ["Petropulu", "Athina P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12649", "submitter": "Michalis Pachilakis", "authors": "Michalis Pachilakis and Panagiotis Papadopoulos and Evangelos P.\n  Markatos and Nicolas Kourtellis", "title": "No More Chasing Waterfalls: A Measurement Study of the Header Bidding\n  Ad-Ecosystem", "comments": "14 pages, 24 Figures, 56 References, 1 Table.

The network consists of small cell base\nstations (SCBSs) with limited cache capacity and a macrocell base station\n(MCBS). SCBSs are connected with their neighboring SCBSs through high-speed\nlinks and collaboratively decide what data to cache. Contents are placed at the\nSCBSs \"free of charge\" at off-peak hours and updated during the day according\nto the content demands by considering the network usage cost. We first model\nthe caching optimization as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process that\nincorporates an auto-regressive model to forecast the evolution of the content\ndemands. The problem is NP-hard and the optimal solution can be found only for\na small number of base stations and contents. To allow derivation of close to\noptimal solutions for larger networks, we propose the rolling horizon method,\nwhich approximates future network usage cost by considering a small decision\nhorizon. The results show that the rolling horizon approach outperforms\ncomparison schemes significantly. Finally, we examine two simplifications of\nthe problem to accelerate the speed of the solution: (a) we restrict the number\nof content replicas in the network and (b) we limit the allowed content\nreplacements. The results show that the rolling horizon scheme can reduce the\ncommunication cost by over 84% compared to that of running Least Recently Used\n(LRU) updates on offline schemes. The results also shed light on the tradeoff\nbetween the efficiency of the caching policy and the time needed to run the\nonline algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 14:12:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Xinan", ""], ["Thomos", "Nikolaos", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.13612", "submitter": "Roberto Mag\\'an-Carri\\'on Dr.", "authors": "Roberto Mag\\'an-Carri\\'on, Jos\\'e Camacho, Gabriel Maci\\'a-Fern\\'andez\n  and \\'Angel Ru\\'iz-Zafra", "title": "MSNM-Sensor: An Applied Network Monitoring Tool for Anomaly Detection in\n  Complex Networks and Systems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Distributed Sensor Networks-2020", "doi": "10.1177/1550147720921309", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.LG cs.NI stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Technology evolves quickly. Low-cost and ready-to-connect devices are\ndesigned to provide new services and applications. Smart grids or smart\nhealthcare systems are some examples of these applications, all of which are in\nthe context of smart cities. In this total-connectivity scenario, some security\nissues arise since the larger the number of connected devices is, the greater\nthe surface attack dimension. In this way, new solutions for monitoring and\ndetecting security events are needed to address new challenges brought about by\nthis scenario, among others, the large number of devices to monitor, the large\namount of data to manage and the real-time requirement to provide quick\nsecurity event detection and, consequently, quick response to attacks. In this\nwork, a practical and ready-to-use tool for monitoring and detecting security\nevents in these environments is developed and introduced. The tool is based on\nthe Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring (MSNM) methodology for\nmonitoring and anomaly detection and we call it MSNM-Sensor. Although it is in\nits early development stages, experimental results based on the detection of\nwell-known attacks in hierarchical network systems prove the suitability of\nthis tool for more complex scenarios, such as those found in smart cities or\nIoT ecosystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:25:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Feb 2020 20:38:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mag\u00e1n-Carri\u00f3n", "Roberto", ""], ["Camacho", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Maci\u00e1-Fern\u00e1ndez", "Gabriel", ""], ["Ru\u00edz-Zafra", "\u00c1ngel", ""]]}]
