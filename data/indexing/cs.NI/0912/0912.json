Cognitive Radio enhanced ad-hoc\narchitecture has been put forward as a candidate to enable such networks.\nSpectrum sensing, the cornerstone of the Cognitive Radio paradigm, has been the\nfocus of intensive research, from which the main conclusion was that its\nperformance can be greatly enhanced through the use of cooperative sensing\nschemes. To apply the Cognitive Radio paradigm to Ad-hoc disaster relief\nnetworks, the design of effective cooperative spectrum sensing schemes is\nessential. In this paper we propose a cluster based orchestration cooperative\nsensing scheme, which adapts to the cluster nodes surrounding radio environment\nstate as well as to the degree of correlation observed between those nodes. The\nproposed scheme is given both in a centralized as well as in a decentralized\napproach. In the centralized approach, the cluster head controls and adapts the\ndistribution of the cluster sensing nodes according to the monitored spectrum\nstate. While in the decentralized approach, each of the cluster nodes decides\nwhich spectrum it should monitor, according to the past local sensing decisions\nof the cluster nodes. The centralized and decentralized schemes can be combined\nto achieve a more robust cooperative spectrum sensing scheme. The proposed\nscheme performance is evaluated through a framework, which allows measuring the\naccuracy of the spectrum sensing cooperative scheme by measuring the error in\nthe estimation of the monitored spectrum state. Through this evaluation it is\nshown that the proposed scheme outperforms the case where the choice of which\nspectrum to sense is done without using the knowledge obtained in previous\nsensing iterations, i.e. a implementation of a blind Round Robin scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 13:37:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pratas", "Nuno", ""], ["Marchetti", "Nicola", ""], ["Prasad", "Neeli Rashmi", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Antonio", ""], ["Prasad", "Ramjee", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.0599", "submitter": "Rdv Ijcsis", "authors": "Sabah Al Fedaghi, Alaa Alsaqa, Zahraa Fadel", "title": "Conceptual Model for Communication", "comments": "13 pages IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and\n  Information Security, IJCSIS November 2009, ISSN 1947 5500,\n  http://sites.google.com/site/ijcsis/", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Science and Information\n  Security, IJCSIS, Vol. 6, No. 2, pp. 029-041, November 2009, USA", "doi": null, "report-no": "ISSN 1947 5500", "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A variety of idealized models of communication systems exist, and all may\nhave something in common.

Compared with a traditional MVNO who often leases spectrum via\nlong-term contracts, a C-MVNO can acquire spectrum dynamically in short-term by\nboth sensing the empty \"spectrum holes\" of licensed bands and dynamically\nleasing from the spectrum owner. As a result, a C-MVNO can make flexible\ninvestment and pricing decisions to match the current demands of the secondary\nunlicensed users. Compared to dynamic spectrum leasing, spectrum sensing is\ntypically cheaper, but the obtained useful spectrum amount is random due to\nprimary licensed users' stochastic traffic. The C-MVNO needs to determine the\noptimal amounts of spectrum sensing and leasing by evaluating the trade off\nbetween cost and uncertainty. The C-MVNO also needs to determine the optimal\nprice to sell the spectrum to the secondary unlicensed users, taking into\naccount wireless heterogeneity of users such as different maximum transmission\npower levels and channel gains. We model and analyze the interactions between\nthe C-MVNO and secondary unlicensed users as a Stackelberg game. We show\nseveral interesting properties of the network equilibrium, including threshold\nstructures of the optimal investment and pricing decisions, the independence of\nthe optimal price on users' wireless characteristics, and guaranteed fair and\npredictable QoS among users. We prove that these properties hold for general\nSNR regime and general continuous distributions of sensing uncertainty.

We define the capacity of a journey (i.e., a path in space and time,\nfrom a source to a destination) as the maximum amount of data that can be\ntransferred from the source to the destination in the given journey. Combining\na stochastic model (conveying all possible journeys) and an analysis of the\ndurations of the nodes' encounters, we study the properties of journeys that\nmaximize the space-time information propagation capacity, in bit-meters per\nsecond. More specifically, we provide theoretical lower and upper bounds on the\ninformation propagation speed, as a function of the journey capacity. In the\nparticular case of random way-point-like models (i.e., when nodes move for a\ndistance of the order of the network domain size before changing direction), we\nshow that, for relatively large journey capacities, the information propagation\nspeed is of the same order as the mobile node speed. This implies that,\nsurprisingly, in sparse but large-scale mobile DTNs, the space-time information\npropagation capacity in bit-meters per second remains proportional to the\nmobile node speed and to the size of the transported data bundles, when the\nbundles are relatively large. We also verify that all our analytical bounds are\naccurate in several simulation scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2009 16:27:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jacquet", "Philippe", ""], ["Mans", "Bernard", ""], ["Rodolakis", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3856", "submitter": "Vinith Reddy Podduturi", "authors": "Vinith Reddy, Younghoon Kim, Srinivas Shakkottai, A.L.

We use a dynamic programming framework to model the optimal\nprefetching policy. We further propose a) a prefetching algorithm Fetch-or- Not\n(FON), which uses quasi-static assumption on system state to make prefetching\ndecisions, and b) a prefetching policy RFON, which uses randomized\napproximation to the optimal solution thus obviating the need for dynamic\nonline optimization and substantially reducing the computational complexity.\nThrough performance evaluation under slow and fast fading scenarios we show\nthat proposed algorithms come close to performance of the optimal scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2009 07:21:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Dua", "Aditya", ""], ["Tsamis", "Dimitrios", ""], ["Bambos", "Nicholas", ""], ["Singh", "Jatinder Pal", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.5292", "submitter": "Arun  Kumar  S P", "authors": "Arun Kumar S P", "title": "High-Speed Signature Matching in Network Interface Device using Bloom\n  Filters", "comments": "Pre-print version.

Based on Semantic Web standards, this paper makes\nseveral contributions to content enrichment. Work starts from harvesting\nmultimedia annotations in class-room recordings, and proceeds to deriving a\ndense educational semantic net between eLearning Objects decorated with\nextended LOM relations. Special focus is drawn on the processing of recorded\nspeech and on an Ontological Evaluation Layer that autonomously derives\nmeaningful inter-object relations. Further on, a semantic representation of\nhyperlinks is developed and elaborated to the concept of semantic link\ncontexts, an approach to manage a coherent rhetoric of linking.
