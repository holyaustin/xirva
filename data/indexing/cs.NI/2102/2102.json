In more detail, some common atmosphere molecules, such as oxygen and\nwater, can absorb and re-radiate energy in their natural resonance frequencies,\nsuch as 60 GHz, 180 GHz and 320 GHz. Hence, when hit by electromagnetic waves,\nmolecules will get excited and absorb energy, which leads to an extra path loss\nand is known as molecular attenuation. Meanwhile, the absorbed energy will be\nre-radiated towards a random direction with a random phase. These re-radiated\nwaves also interfere with the signal transmission. Although, the molecular\nre-radiation was mostly considered as noise in literature, recent works show\nthat it is correlated to the main signal and can be viewed as a composition of\nmultiple delayed or scattered signals.

Such\napplications require a short flow completion time (FCT) to perform their jobs\neffectively. However, TCP is oblivious to the composite nature of application\ndata and artificially inflates the FCT of such flows by several orders of\nmagnitude. This is due to TCP's Internet-centric design that fixes the\nretransmission timeout (RTO) to be at least hundreds of milliseconds. To better\nunderstand this problem, in this paper, we use empirical measurements in a\nsmall testbed to study, at a microscopic level, the effects of various types of\npacket losses on TCP's performance. In particular, we single out packet losses\nthat impact the tail end of small flows, as well as bursty losses, that span a\nsignificant fraction of the small congestion window of TCP flows in\ndata-centers, to show a non-negligible effect on the FCT. Based on this, we\npropose the so-called, timely-retransmitted ACKs (or T-RACKs), a simple loss\nrecovery mechanism to conceal the drawbacks of the long RTO even in the\npresence of heavy packet losses. Interestingly enough, T-RACKS achieves this\ntransparently to TCP itself as it does not require any change to TCP in the\ntenant's virtual machine (VM). T-RACKs can be implemented as a software shim\nlayer in the hypervisor between the VMs and server's NIC or in hardware as a\nnetworking function in a SmartNIC.

While both of these issues need to be addressed in\npractice, the impact of the latter problem on the performance of the\nmulti-agent systems has often been neglected. This becomes even more important\nwhen the agents' information or observations have different importance, in\nwhich case the agents require different priorities for accessing the medium and\nsharing their information.

To achieve this goal, we adopt a queueing theoretic\napproach and propose a distributed fair scheduling algorithm for providing\nweighted fairness in single-hop networks. Our proposed algorithm guarantees an\nupper-bound on the normalized share disparity among any pair of agents. This\ncan particularly improve the short-term fairness, which is important in\nreal-time applications.

Thus, there is a natural tension between the\n'desire' for unobservability on the one hand, and for observability on the\nother hand. On a middle ground, one would at least be interested on some\nstatistical features of the Bitcoin network like the number of peers that\nparticipate in the propagation of transactions and blocks.

Thus, the number of unreachable peers can only be\nestimated based on some indicators.

The PAL method allows for detecting unreachable peers that\nindicate that they provide services useful to the P2P network.

Many existing\nstudies consider fixed robust uplink transmission parameter selection that\nallows satisfying the requirements even for UEs with poor channel conditions.\nHowever, the more robust transmission parameters are selected, the lower is the\nnetwork capacity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm that selects\nthe transmission parameters depending on the channel quality based on the\nsignal-to-noise ratio statistics analysis at the gNB. Simulation results\nobtained with NS-3 show that the algorithm allows meeting the URLLC latency and\nreliability requirements while reducing the channel resource consumption more\nthan twice in comparison with the fixed transmission parameters selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:49:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shahsin", "Aleksei", ""], ["Belogaev", "Andrey", ""], ["Krasilov", "Artem", ""], ["Khorov", "Evgeny", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13584", "submitter": "Italo Valcy Da Silva Brito", "authors": "Italo V S Brito", "title": "NDVR: NDN Distance Vector Routing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Ad hoc mobile scenarios desire a lightweight routing protocol to propagate\nrapidly changing data reachability information in a highly dynamic environment.\nWe are developing a distance-vector routing protocol that enables each node to\nselectively propagate a data reachability vector containing the named-data\nprefixes current reachable to their neighbors.
