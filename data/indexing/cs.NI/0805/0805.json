Before this vision becomes a reality, however, a large number of\nchallenges have to be addressed. Network quality of service (QoS) management in\nthis new realm is among those issues that deserve extensive research efforts.\nIt is envisioned that wireless sensor/actuator networks (WSANs) will play an\nessential role in CPS. This paper examines the main characteristics of WSANs\nand the requirements of QoS provisioning in the context of cyber-physical\ncomputing. Several research topics and challenges are identified.

In this\nwork, we study the benefit of node cooperation in conjunction with\nmulti-hopping on the network capacity. We propose a multi-phase communication\nscheme, combining distributed MIMO transmission with multi-hop forwarding among\nclusters of nodes.
