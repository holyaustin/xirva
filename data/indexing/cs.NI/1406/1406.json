NFV introduces and deploys new\nnetwork functions in an open and standardized IT environment, while SDN aims to\ntransform the way networks function.

The separation of concerns introduced between the\ndefinition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and\nthe forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the\nnetwork control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create\nand introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management\nand facilitating network evolution.

We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main\nconcepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the\nstandardization activities regarding this novel paradigm.

Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) composed of\nsmall unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are flexible, inexpensive and fast to\ndeploy.

Due to the high mobility of the nodes, maintaining a\ncommunication link between the UAVs is a challenging task. The topology of\nthese networks is more dynamic than that of typical mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs) and of typical vehicle ad hoc networks (VANETs). As a consequence, the\nexisting routing protocols designed for MANETs partly fail in tracking network\ntopology changes. In this work, we compare two different routing algorithms for\nad hoc networks: optimized link-state routing (OLSR), and predictive-OLSR\n(P-OLSR). The latter is an OLSR extension that we designed for FANETs; it takes\nadvantage of the GPS information available on board.

The notion of\n\"hierarchical hubbing\" was introduced (in the narrow context of a specific\nrobust network design question), by Olver and Shepherd [2010]. Hierarchical\nhubbing allows for routings with a multiplicity of \"hubs\" which are connected\nto the terminals and to each other in a treelike fashion. Recently, Fr\\'echette\net al. [2013] explored this notion much more generally, focusing on its\napplicability to an extension of the well-studied hose model that allows for\nupper bounds on individual point-to-point demands. In this paper, we consider\nhierarchical hubbing in the context of a previously studied (and extremely\nnatural) generalization of the hose model, and prove that the optimal\nhierarchical hubbing solution can be found efficiently. This result is relevant\nto a recently proposed generalization of the \"VPN Conjecture\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 18:32:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Olver", "Neil", ""]]}]
