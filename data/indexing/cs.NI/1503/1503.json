A key step that enables communication in such a network is that of\ntopology discovery, or train inauguration, whereby nodes learn in a distributed\nfashion the physical topology of the backbone network. While the current\nstandard for train inauguration assumes wired links between adjacent backbone\nnodes, this work investigates the more challenging scenario in which the nodes\ncommunicate wirelessly. The key motivations for this desired switch from wired\ntopology discovery to wireless one are the flexibility and capability for\nexpansion and upgrading of a wireless backbone. The implementation of topology\ndiscovery over wireless channels is made difficult by the broadcast nature of\nthe wireless medium, and by fading and interference. A novel topology discovery\nprotocol is proposed that overcomes these issues and requires relatively minor\nchanges to the wired standard. The protocol is shown via analysis and numerical\nresults to be robust to the impairments caused by the wireless channel\nincluding interference from other trains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 21:34:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 12 Sep 2015 20:18:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 18:39:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yu", ""], ["Feng", "Jianghua", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""], ["Tang", "Jun", ""], ["Wen", "Zheng", ""], ["Haimovich", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Zhou", "MengChu", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00267", "submitter": "Hayssam Dahrouj", "authors": "Hayssam Dahrouj, Tareq Y.

Using the collected data,\nwe define a simple model for calculating neighborhood awareness given packet\ndelivery ratio for a given environment. Finally, we perform realistic,\nlarge-scale simulations to explore the achievable performance of cooperative\nawareness under realistic transmit power and transmit rate constraints. Our\nmeasurements and simulation results show that: i) above a certain threshold,\nthere is little benefit in increasing cooperative message rate to improve the\nawareness; higher transmit power and fewer messages transmissions are a better\napproach, since message delivery is dominated by shadowing. ii) the efficacy of\ncooperative awareness varies greatly in different environments on both large\nscale (e.g., 90\\% awareness is achievable up to 200~m in urban and over 500~m\nin highway) and small scale (e.g., vehicles in nearby streets can have\nsignificantly different awareness); iii) V2V and V2I communication have\ndistinct awareness patterns; iv) each location has a distinct transmit power\nthat achieves high awareness; and v) achieving high awareness levels results in\nincreased reception of potentially unwanted messages; therefore, a balance\nneeds to be found between awareness and interference, depending on the specific\ncontext. We hope our results will serve as a starting point for designing more\neffective periodic message exchange services for cooperative awareness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 10:35:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 00:43:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 20:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Boban", "Mate", ""], ["d'Orey", "Pedro M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.06630", "submitter": "Dmitry Namiot", "authors": "Dmitry Namiot, Manfred Sneps-Sneppe", "title": "Metadata in SDN API", "comments": "submitted to EuCNC 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses the system aspects of development of applied programming\ninterfaces in Software-Defined Networking (SDN).
