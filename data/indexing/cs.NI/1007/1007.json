We then characterize the throughput from a\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) perspective, in which a packet\nis successfully received if the SINR exceeds some threshold, considering the\ninterference from all emitting nodes in the network. Our main contribution is\nto generalize and unify various results scattered throughout the literature.

Recently, a Cognitive\nRadio Cognitive Network (CRCN) patch for NS-2 simulator has proposed to support\nmulti-channel multi-interface capability in NS-2. In this tutorial, we consider\nhow to simulate a multi-channel multiinterface wireless network using the NS-2\nsimulator. This tutorial is trageted to the novice users who wants to\nunderstand the implementation of multi-channel multi-interface in NS-2. We take\nthe Cognitive Radio Cognitive Network (CRCN) patch for NS-2 simulator and\ndemonstrate broadcasting over multiple-channels in a multi-interface network\nsetting. In our seeting, node braodcasts the Hello packets to its neighbors.\nNeighboring nodes receive the Hello packets if and only if they are tuned to\nthe same channel. We demonstrate through example that the tuning of receivers\ncan be done in two fashions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 08:20:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 13:02:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Zeeshan Ali", ""], ["Rehmani", "Mubashir Husain", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4068", "submitter": "Mubashir Husain Rehmani", "authors": "Mubashir Husain Rehmani and Aline Carneiro Viana (Supervisor)", "title": "Decoupling data dissemination from the mobile sink's trajectory in\n  wireless sensor networks: Current Research and Open Issues", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Masters Thesis, Laboratory of Signals and Systems, Supelec and\n  University of Paris Sud-11, July 2008", "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this report, firstly, we presents state of the art survey on Data\nManagement and Data Dissemination techniques with Mobile Sink.

Due to the inherent opration of P2P systems,\nwhich involves repeated interactions among peers over a long period of time,\nthe peers can efficiently identify free-riders as well as desirable\ncollaborators by learning the behavior of their associated peers.

We model the peers' interactions in the\nBitTorrent-like network as a repeated interaction game, where we explicitly\nconsider the strategic behavior of the peers. A peer, which applies the\nRL-based mechanism, uses a partial history of the observations on associated\npeers' statistical reciprocal behaviors to determine its best responses and\nestimate the corresponding impact on its expected utility. The policy\ndetermines the peer's resource reciprocations with other peers, which would\nmaximize the peer's long-term performance, thereby making foresighted\ndecisions.

In contrast with the Nash equilibrium (NE),\nwhere RDs are interested in selfishly maximizing its QoS, we present a concept\nof equilibrium, named satisfaction equilibrium (SE), where RDs are interested\nonly in guaranteing a minimum QoS. We provide the conditions for the existence\nand the uniqueness of the SE. Later, in order to provide an equilibrium\nselection framework for the SE, we introduce the concept of effort or cost of\nsatisfaction, for instance, in terms of transmit power levels, constellation\nsizes, etc. Using the idea of effort, the set of efficient SE (ESE) is defined.\nAt the ESE, transmitters satisfy their minimum QoS incurring in the lowest\neffort. We prove that contrary to the (generalized) NE, at least one ESE always\nexists whenever the network is able to simultaneously support the individual\nQoS requests. Finally, we provide a fully decentralized algorithm to allow\nself-configuring networks to converge to one of the SE relying only on local\ninformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 09:50:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Perlaza", "Samir M.", ""], ["Tembine", "Hamidou", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""], ["Debbah", "Merouane", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.5218", "submitter": "Caihong Kai", "authors": "Cai Hong Kai, Soung Chang Liew", "title": "Applications of Belief Propagation in CSMA Wireless Networks", "comments": "A technical report of The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is an efficient way to solve\n\"inference\" problems in graphical models, such as Bayesian networks and Markov\nrandom fields.

Of particular interest is the fact that the adaptive CSMA\ncan achieve a system utility arbitrarily close to that is achievable under a\ncentral scheduler. However, a specially designed transport-layer rate\ncontroller is needed for this result. An outstanding question is whether the\nwidely-installed TCP Reno is compatible with adaptive CSMA and can achieve the\nsame result. The answer to this question will determine how close to practical\ndeployment adaptive CSMA is. Our answer is yes and no. First, we observe that\nrunning TCP Reno directly over adaptive CSMA results in severe starvation\nproblems. Effectively, its performance is no better than that of TCP Reno over\nlegacy CSMA (IEEE 802.11), and the potentials of adaptive CSMA cannot be\nrealized. Fortunately, we find that multi-connection TCP Reno over adaptive\nCSMA with active queue management can materialize the advantages of adaptive\nCSMA. NS-2 simulations demonstrate that our solution can alleviate starvation\nand achieve fair and efficient rate allocation. Multi-connection TCP can be\nimplemented at either application or transport layer. Application-layer\nimplementation requires no kernel modification, making the solution readily\ndeployable in networks running adaptive CSMA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 14:49:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Aug 2010 05:29:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Wang", "Yue", ""], ["Chen", "Minghua", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.5240", "submitter": "Paolo Santi", "authors": "Josep Diaz, Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela, Dieter Mitsche, Paolo Santi,\n  and Julinda Stefa", "title": "Social-Aware Forwarding Improves Routing Performance in Pocket Switched\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Several social-aware forwarding strategies have been recently introduced in\nopportunistic networks, and proved effective in considerably in- creasing\nrouting performance through extensive simulation studies based on real-world\ndata.

In this MAC, a node carrier-senses multiple frequency\nchannels simultaneously, and it takes the first opportunity to transmit on any\none of the channels when allowed by the CSMA backoff mechanism. We show that\nthe frequency-agile MAC can effectively 1) boost throughput and 2) remove\ntemporal starvation. Furthermore, the MAC can be implemented on the existing\nmultiple-frequency setup in Wi-Fi using multi-radio technology, and it can\nco-exist with the legacy MAC using single radio. This paper provides exact\nstationary throughput analysis for regular 1D and thin-strip 2D CSMA networks\nusing a \"transfer-matrix\" approach. In addition, accurate approximations are\ngiven for 2D grid networks. Our closed-form formulas accurately quantify the\nthroughput gain of frequency-agile CSMA. To characterize temporal starvation,\nwe use the metric of \"mean residual access time\" (MRAT). Our simulations and\nclosed-form approximations indicate that the frequency-agile MAC can totally\neliminate temporal starvation in 2D grid networks, reducing its MRAT by orders\nof magnitude. Finally, this paper presents a \"coloring theorem\" to justify the\nuse of the frequency-agile MAC in general network topologies.

Taking\ninto account the particular characteristics of UCS, we formulate the problem as\na facility location problem and devise a distributed and highly scalable\nheuristic solution to it.\n  Key to the proposed approach is the introduction of a novel metric drawing on\nComplex Network Analysis.
