We then discuss proactive\ndecision making and decision delivery via the user-device feedback loop.\nFinally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities of anticipatory mobile\ncomputing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 20:57:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 22:43:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2014 18:31:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 22:54:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 23:51:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pejovic", "Veljko", ""], ["Musolesi", "Mirco", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2360", "submitter": "I-Hong  Hou", "authors": "I-Hong Hou and Rahul Singh", "title": "Capacity and Scheduling of Access Points for Multiple Live Video Streams", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the problem of serving multiple live video streams to\nseveral different clients from a single access point over unreliable wireless\nlinks, which is expected to be major a consumer of future wireless capacity.\nThis problem involves two characteristics.

However, when D2D (in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project also\ncalled Long Term Evolution (LTE) Direct) communication in cellular spectrum is\nsupported, there is a need to revisit and modify the existing radio resource\nmanagement (RRM) and power control (PC) techniques to realize the potential of\nthe proximity and reuse gains and to limit the interference at the cellular\nlayer. In this paper, we examine the performance of the flexible LTE PC tool\nbox and benchmark it against a utility optimal iterative scheme. We find that\nthe open loop PC scheme of LTE performs well for cellular users both in terms\nof the used transmit power levels and the achieved\nsignal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) distribution. However, the\nperformance of the D2D users as well as the overall system throughput can be\nboosted by the utility optimal scheme, because the utility maximizing scheme\ntakes better advantage of both the proximity and the reuse gains. Therefore, in\nthis paper we propose a hybrid PC scheme, in which cellular users employ the\nopen loop path compensation method of LTE, while D2D users use the utility\noptimizing distributed PC scheme. In order to protect the cellular layer, the\nhybrid scheme allows for limiting the interference caused by the D2D layer at\nthe cost of having a small impact on the performance of the D2D layer. To\nensure feasibility, we limit the number of iterations to a practically feasible\nlevel. We make the point that the hybrid scheme is not only near optimal, but\nit also allows for a distributed implementation for the D2D users, while\npreserving the LTE PC scheme for the cellular users.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Jun 2013 10:20:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Fodor", "Gabor", ""], ["Belleschi", "Marco", ""], ["Penda", "Demia D.", ""], ["Pradini", "Aidilla", ""], ["Johansson", "Mikael", ""], ["Abrardo", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.5677", "submitter": "Dong Zhao", "authors": "Dong Zhao, Xiang-Yang Li, and Huadong Ma", "title": "OMG: How Much Should I Pay Bob in Truthful Online Mobile Crowdsourced\n  Sensing?", "comments": "14 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile crowdsourced sensing (MCS) is a new paradigm which takes advantage of\nthe pervasive smartphones to efficiently collect data, enabling numerous novel\napplications.
