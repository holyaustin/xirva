This fingerprint requires significant overhead in manual\nconstruction, and thus has been one of the major drawbacks of WiFi-based\nlocalization. In this paper, we present an automated tool for fingerprint\nconstructions and leverage it to study novel scenarios for device-based and\ndevice-free WiFi-based localization that are difficult to evaluate in a real\nenvironment. In a particular, we examine the effect of changing the access\npoints (AP) mounting location, AP technology upgrade, crowd effect on\ncalibration and operation, among others; on the accuracy of the localization\nsystem.

This greatly limits the usage of FH in many 5G\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to understand and\ndesign FH for next-generation wireless access. We allow the renovated FH to\ntransport information other than time-domain I/Q samples and to support logical\ntopologies beyond point-to-point links. In this way, different function\nsplitting scheme could be incorporated into the radio access network to satisfy\nthe bandwidth and latency requirements of ultra-dense networks, control/data\n(C/D) decoupling architectures, and delay-sensitive communications. At the same\ntime, massive cooperation and device-centric networking could be effectively\nenabled with point-to-multi-point FH transportation. We analyze three unique\ndesign requirements for the renovated FH, including the ability to handle\nvarious payload traffic, support different logical topology, and provide\ndifferentiated latency guarantee. Following this analysis, we propose a\nreference architecture for designing the renovated FH. The required\nfunctionalities are categorized into four logical layers and realized using\nnovel technologies such as decoupled synchronization layer, packet switching,\nand session-based control.

This paper develops a new spatial\nmodel for D2D networks in which the device locations are modeled as a Poisson\ncluster process. Using this model, we study the performance of a typical D2D\nreceiver in terms of coverage probability under two realistic content\navailability setups: (i) content of interest for a typical device is available\nat a device chosen uniformly at random from the same cluster, which we term\nuniform content availability, and (ii) content of interest is available at the\n$k^{th}$ closest device from the typical device inside the same cluster, which\nwe term $k$-closest content availability. Using these coverage probability\nresults, we also characterize the area spectral efficiency (ASE) of the whole\nnetwork for the two setups. A key intermediate step in this analysis is the\nderivation of the distributions of distances from a typical device to both the\nintra- and inter-cluster devices. Our analysis reveals that an optimum number\nof D2D transmitters must be simultaneously activated per cluster in order to\nmaximize ASE. This can be interpreted as the classical tradeoff between more\naggressive frequency reuse and higher interference power. The optimum number of\nsimultaneously transmitting devices and the resulting ASE increase as the\ncontent is made available closer to the receivers.

Under HCN,\nSCs can be dynamically turned off when traffic load decreases for energy\nsaving. A fundamental problem then arises: how many SCs can be turned off as\ntraffic varies? In this paper, we address this problem in a theoretical way,\nwhere two sleeping schemes (i.e., random and repulsive schemes) with vertical\ninter-layer offloading are considered. Analytical results indicate the\nfollowing facts: (1) Under the random scheme where SCs are turned off with\ncertain probability, the expected ratio of sleeping SCs is inversely\nproportional to the traffic load of SC-layer and decreases linearly with the\ntraffic load of MBS-layer; (2) The repulsive scheme, which only turns off the\nSCs close to MBSs, is less sensitive to the traffic variations; (3) deploying\ndenser MBSs enables turning off more SCs, which may help to improve network\nenergy-efficiency.

Most of the\nproposed techniques, however, require the involvement of a third party, and\nthis by itself can be viewed as another security concern. These security\nbreaches can be avoided by following a new approach that depends on data\nsorted, managed, and stored in encrypted form at the remote servers.

The RFM has been\nused to model and analyze mRNA translation, a biological process in which\nribosomes (the particles) move along the mRNA molecule (the chain), and decode\nthe genetic information into proteins.\n  Here we propose the RFM as an analytical framework for modeling and analyzing\nlinear communication networks. In this context, the moving particles are\ndata-packets, the chain of sites is a one dimensional set of ordered buffers,\nand the decreasing entry rate to a fuller buffer represents a kind of\ndecentralized backpressure flow control. For an RFM with homogeneous link\ncapacities, we provide closed-form expressions for important network metrics\nincluding the throughput and end-to-end delay. We use these results to analyze\nthe hop length and the transmission probability (in a contention access mode)\nthat minimize the end-to-end delay in a multihop linear network, and provide\nclosed-form expressions for the optimal parameter values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 06:09:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zarai", "Yoram", ""], ["Mendel", "Oz", ""], ["Margaliot", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06093", "submitter": "Jie Xu Dr.", "authors": "Jie Xu, Lingjie Duan, Rui Zhang", "title": "Energy Group-Buying with Loading Sharing for Green Cellular Networks", "comments": "This is a longer version of a paper to be appear in IEEE Journal on\n  Selected Areas in Communications Special Issue on Energy-Efficient Techniques\n  for 5G Wireless Communication Systems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2016.2544603", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.GT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the emerging hybrid electricity market, mobile network operators (MNOs) of\ncellular networks can make day-ahead energy purchase commitments at low prices\nand real-time flexible energy purchase at high prices.
