In this protocol, each node i maintains a \\trust\nvalue\" about an other node j which is computed both as a result of the\nexchanges with node j itself and as a function of the opinion that other nodes\nhave about j. These two aspects are respectively weighted by a trust index that\nmeasures the trust quality the node has in its own experiences and by a trust\nindex representing the trust the node has in the opinions of the other nodes.\nSimulations have been realized to validate the robustness of this protocol\nagainst three kinds of attacks: simple coalitions, Trojan attacks and detonator\nattacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jan 2009 08:03:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Morvan", "Michel", "", "LIP, Ixxi"], ["Sen\u00e9", "Sylvain", "", "IXXI, Timc"]]}, {"id": "0901.3257", "submitter": "Simon Heimlicher", "authors": "Simon Heimlicher, Merkouris Karaliopoulos, Hanoch Levy and\n  Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos", "title": "On Leveraging Partial Paths in Partially-Connected Networks", "comments": "Extended version of paper appearing at IEEE INFOCOM 2009, April\n  20-25, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/INFCOM.2009.5061906", "report-no": "TR-303", "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile wireless network research focuses on scenarios at the extremes of the\nnetwork connectivity continuum where the probability of all nodes being\nconnected is either close to unity, assuming connected paths between all nodes\n(mobile ad hoc networks), or it is close to zero, assuming no multi-hop paths\nexist at all (delay-tolerant networks). In this paper, we argue that a sizable\nfraction of networks lies between these extremes and is characterized by the\nexistence of partial paths, i.e. multi-hop path segments that allow forwarding\ndata closer to the destination even when no end-to-end path is available. A\nfundamental issue in such networks is dealing with disruptions of end-to-end\npaths. Under a stochastic model, we compare the performance of the established\nend-to-end retransmission (ignoring partial paths), against a forwarding\nmechanism that leverages partial paths to forward data closer to the\ndestination even during disruption periods. Perhaps surprisingly, the\nalternative mechanism is not necessarily superior. However, under a stochastic\nmonotonicity condition between current v.s. future path length, which we\ndemonstrate to hold in typical network models, we manage to prove superiority\nof the alternative mechanism in stochastic dominance terms. We believe that\nthis study could serve as a foundation to design more efficient data transfer\nprotocols for partially-connected networks, which could potentially help\nreducing the gap between applications that can be supported over disconnected\nnetworks and those requiring full connectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jan 2009 14:47:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Jan 2009 01:04:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Heimlicher", "Simon", ""], ["Karaliopoulos", "Merkouris", ""], ["Levy", "Hanoch", ""], ["Spyropoulos", "Thrasyvoulos", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3611", "submitter": "Liqun Fu", "authors": "Liqun Fu, Soung Chang Liew, Jianwei Huang", "title": "Safe Carrier Sensing Range in CSMA Network under Physical Interference\n  Model", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the setting of carrier-sensing range in 802.11\nnetworks under the (cumulative) physical interference model.

Recognizing that the periodic erasure scheme usually used in the\ntechnical literature turns out to be quite inefficient when using real traffic\ntraces over a long period of time, we introduce a simple adaptive scheme that\nclosely follows the variations of traffic. When tested against real traffic\ntraces, the proposed on-line algorithm performs well in the sense that the\ndetection ratio of long flows by the algorithm over a long time period is quite\nhigh. Beyond the identification of elephants, this same class of algorithms is\napplied to the closely related problem of detection of anomalies in IP traffic,\ne.g., SYN flood due for instance to attacks. An algorithm for detecting SYN and\nvolume flood anomalies in Internet traffic is designed. Experiments show that\nan anomaly is detected in less than one minute and the targeted destinations\nare identified at the same time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jan 2009 09:41:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2009 15:26:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Azzana", "Youssef", "", "EI"], ["Chabchoub", "Yousra", "", "INRIA"], ["Fricker", "Christine", "", "FT R&D"], ["Guillemin", "Fabrice", "", "FT R&D"], ["Robert", "Philippe", ""]]}]
