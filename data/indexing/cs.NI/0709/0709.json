When each node has full knowledge of the\nglobal network connectivity, finding short communication paths is merely a\nmatter of distributed computation.

Here we show\nthat the peculiar structural characteristics of many complex networks support\nefficient communication without global knowledge.

Many previous\nalgorithms for distributed topology control have assumed an ability at each\nnode to deduce some location-based information such as the direction and the\ndistance of its neighbor nodes with respect to itself. Such a deduction of\nlocation-based information, however, cannot be relied upon in real environments\nwhere the path loss exponents vary greatly leading to significant errors in\ndistance estimates. Also, multipath effects may result in different signal\npaths with different loss characteristics, and none of these paths may be\nline-of-sight, making it difficult to estimate the direction of a neighboring\nnode. In this paper, we present Step Topology Control (STC), a simple\ndistributed topology control algorithm which reduces energy consumption while\npreserving the connectivity of a heterogeneous sensor network without use of\nany location-based information. We show that the STC algorithm achieves the\nsame or better order of communication and computational complexity when\ncompared to other known algorithms that also preserve connectivity without the\nuse of location-based information. We also present a detailed simulation-based\ncomparative analysis of the energy savings and interference reduction achieved\nby the algorithms.

Such a strategy can be inefficient because: (i) identifiers give no\nclue on the node's mobility and (ii) locators can be far from the\nsource/destination shortest path, which increases both location delays and\nbandwidth consumption. To solve these issues, Otiy introduces a new strategy\nthat identifies nodes to play the role of locators based on the likelihood of a\ndestination to be close to these nodes- i.e., locators are identified depending\non the mobility pattern of nodes. Otiy relies on the cyclic mobility patterns\nof nodes and creates a slotted agenda composed of a set of predicted locations,\ndefined according to the past and present patterns of mobility.
