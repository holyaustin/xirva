We are inspired by the conduciveness of Tullock contests to\nattracting user entry (yet not necessarily a higher revenue) in other domains.\nIn this paper, we explore a new dimension in optimal Tullock contest design, by\nsuperseding the contest prize---which is fixed in conventional Tullock\ncontests---with a prize function that is dependent on the (unknown) winner's\ncontribution, in order to maximize the crowdsourcer's utility.

By\ncontrolling a parameter $V$ in the algorithm, the backpressure algorithm can\nachieve an arbitrarily small utility optimality gap. However, this in turn\nbrings in a large queue length at each node and hence causes large network\ndelay. This phenomenon is known as the fundamental utility-delay tradeoff. The\nbest known utility-delay tradeoff for general networks is $[O(1/V), O(V)]$ and\nis attained by a backpressure algorithm based on a drift-plus-penalty\ntechnique. This may suggest that to achieve an arbitrarily small utility\noptimality gap, the existing backpressure algorithms necessarily yield an\narbitrarily large queue length. However, this paper proposes a new backpressure\nalgorithm that has a vanishing utility optimality gap, so utility converges to\nexact optimality as the algorithm keeps running, while queue lengths are\nbounded throughout by a finite constant. The technique uses backpressure and\ndrift concepts with a new method for convex programming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 03:09:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Hao", ""], ["Neely", "Michael J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.04562", "submitter": "Vahid Behzadan", "authors": "Vahid Behzadan, Banafsheh Rekabdar", "title": "A Game-Theoretic Model for Analysis and Design of Self-Organization\n  Mechanisms in IoT", "comments": "preprint of submission to GameNets 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a framework based on Network Formation Game for self-organization\nin the Internet of Things (IoT), in which heterogeneous and multi-interface\nnodes are modeled as self-interested agents who individually decide on\nestablishment and severance of links to other agents.

A distinguishing feature of NCMA is the joint use of\nphysical-layer network coding (PNC) and multiuser decoding (MUD) to boost NOMA\nthroughputs. We first show that a simple NCMA architecture in which all users\nuse the same modulation, referred to as rate-homogeneous NCMA, can achieve\nsubstantial throughput improvement over SIC-based NOMA under near\npower-balanced scenarios. Then, we put forth a new NCMA architecture, referred\nto as rate-diverse NCMA, in which different users may adopt different\nmodulations commensurate with their relative SNRs. A challenge for rate-diverse\nNCMA is the design of a channel-coded PNC system. This paper is the first\nattempt to design channel-coded rate-diverse PNC.

A possible solution employs direct device-to-device (D2D)\ncommunications, which is particularly promising when the two terminals involved\nin the communications are located in close proximity. The D2D communications\nshould coexist with other transmissions, so they must be careful scheduled in\norder to avoid harmful interference impacts. In this paper, we analyze how a\ndistributed context-awareness, obtained by observing few local channel and\ntopology parameters, can be used to adaptively exploit D2D communications. We\ndevelop a rigorous theoretical analysis to quantify the balance between the\ngain offered by a D2D transmission, and its impact on the other network\ncommunications. Based on this analysis, we derive two theorems that define the\noptimal strategy to be employed, in terms of throughput maximization, when a\nsingle or multiple transmit power levels are available for the D2D\ncommunications. We compare this strategy to the state-of-the-art in the same\nnetwork scenario, showing how context awareness can be exploited to achieve a\nhigher sum throughput and an improved fairness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 17:41:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-25", "authors_parsed": [["Librino", "Federico", ""], ["Quer", "Giorgio", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.07106", "submitter": "Joydeep Banerjee", "authors": "Joydeep Banerjee, Kaustav Basu, and Arunabha Sen", "title": "On Hardening Problems in Critical Infrastructure Systems", "comments": "The previous version was made into a journal paper that contains the\n  previous problem along with an existing problem.

The limitations of the aforementioned\nmodels have been overcome by the Implicative Interdependency Model, which uses\nBoolean Logic to denote the dependencies. This paper formulates the Entity\nHardening problem and the Targeted Entity Hardening problem using the\nImplicative Interdependency Model.
