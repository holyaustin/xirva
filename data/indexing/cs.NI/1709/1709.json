In the forthcoming 5G cellular networks, edge caching is emerging as a\npromising technique to deliver videos with lower cost and higher quality. The\nkey idea is to cache video contents on edge networks (e.g., femtocells and WiFi\naccess points) in advance and deliver the cached contents to local video users\ndirectly (without involving cellular data cost for users). In this work, we aim\nto study how the edge caching will affect the CP's data sponsoring strategy as\nwell as the users' behaviors and the data market. Specifically, we consider a\nsingle CP who offers both the edge caching service and the data sponsoring\nservice to a set of heterogeneous mobile video users (with different mobility\nand video request patterns). We formulate the interactions of the CP and the\nusers as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where the CP (leader) determines the\nbudgets (efforts) for both services in Stage I, and the users (followers)\ndecide whether and which service(s) they would like to subscribe to. We analyze\nthe sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) of the proposed game systematically. Our\nanalysis and experimental results show that by introducing the edge caching,\nthe CP can increase his revenue by 105%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 12:28:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pang", "Haitian", ""], ["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Ding", "Qinghua", ""], ["Sun", "Lifeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00348", "submitter": "Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili", "authors": "Kyumars Sheykh Esmaili, Jaideep Chandrashekar, Pascal Le Guyadec", "title": "Inferring Networked Device Categories from Low-Level Activity Indicators", "comments": "14 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of inferring the type of a networked device in a home\nnetwork by leveraging low level traffic activity indicators seen at commodity\nhome gateways.

In the ICP approach, vehicles jointly localize\nnon-cooperative physical features (such as people, traffic lights or inactive\ncars) in the surrounding areas, and use them as common noisy reference points\nto refine their location estimates. Information on sensed features are fused\nthrough V2V links by a consensus procedure, nested within a message passing\nalgorithm, to enhance the vehicle localization accuracy.

With a widely growing adoption rate, SIP is an\napplication layer signaling protocol, standardized by the IETF, for creating,\nmodifying, and terminating VoIP sessions. Generally speaking, SIP routes a call\nrequest to its destination by using SIP proxies. With the increasing use of\nSIP, traditional configurations pose certain drawbacks, such as ineffective\nrouting, un-optimized management of proxy resources (including CPU and memory),\nand overload conditions. This paper presents OpenSIP to upgrade the SIP network\nframework with emerging technologies, such as SDN and NFV. SDN provides for\nmanagement that decouples the data and control planes along with a\nsoftware-based centralized control that results in effective routing and\nresource management. Moreover, NFV assists SDN by virtualizing various network\ndevices and functions. However, current SDN elements limit the inspected fields\nto layer 2-4 headers, whereas SIP routing information resides in the layer-7\nheader. A benefit of OpenSIP is that it enforces policies on SIP networking\nthat are agnostic to higher layers with the aid of a Deep Packet Inspection\n(DPI) engine. Among the benefits of OpenSIP is programmability, cost reduction,\nunified management, routing, as well as efficient load balancing. The present\nstudy implements OpenSIP on a real testbed which includes Open vSwitch and the\nFloodlight controller.

As a first step, we have\nformulated such deployment along a line as a sequential decision problem. In\nour earlier work, we proposed two possible deployment approaches: (i) the pure\nas-you-go approach where the deployment agent can only move forward, and (ii)\nthe explore-forward approach where the deployment agent explores a few\nsuccessive steps and then selects the best relay placement location.

In [1] we, therefore, developed learning\nalgorithms for the explore-forward approach.\n  The current paper provides deploy-and-learn algorithms for the pure as-you-go\napproach.

We notice that in comparison,\nunder the backpressure routing policy, a node $i$ requires only the knowledge\nof its neighbours queue lengths in order to guarantee maximal stability, and\nhence is decentralized. The key difference arises due to the fact that in our\nset-up the packets loose their utility once their \"age\" has crossed their\ndeadline, thus making the task of optimizing timely throughput much more\nchallenging than that of ensuring network stability. Of course, due to this key\ndifference, the decision process involved in maximizing the timely throughput\nis also much more complex than that involved in ensuring network-wide queue\nstabilization.

For scheduling\nresources between these devices, we give the DEARF resource allocation and\nevaluate the scheme with help of simulations. Devices suffer a higher delay\nbut, at high loads, devices using the proposed scheme are able to save 30%\nenergy per packet and upto 330% energy per device. Packet delivery ratio is\n100% at low loads and 90% at high loads as compared to 95% and 27% given by the\ntraditional access. Other delay tolerant devices save upto 16% on energy per\npacket transmitted and 23% on delay at high loads.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:02:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Charania", "Navroz Firoz", ""], ["Giluka", "Mukesh Kumar", ""], ["Tamma", "Bheemarjuna Reddy", ""], ["Franklin", "Antony", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03734", "submitter": "Pei Zhou", "authors": "Pei Zhou, Xuming Fang, Yuguang Fang, Yan Long, Rong He, Xiao Han", "title": "Enhanced Random Access and Beam Training for mmWave Wireless Local\n  Networks with High User Density", "comments": "13 pages, 17 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications, Sep. 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As low frequency band becomes more and more crowded, millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nhas attracted significant attention recently. IEEE has released the 802.11ad\nstandard to satisfy the demand of ultra-high-speed communication. It adopts\nbeamforming technology that can generate directional beams to compensate for\nhigh path loss. In the Association Beamforming Training (A-BFT) phase of\nbeamforming (BF) training, a station (STA) randomly selects an A-BFT slot to\ncontend for training opportunity. Due to the limited number of A-BFT slots,\nA-BFT phase suffers high probability of collisions in dense user scenarios,\nresulting in inefficient training performance. Based on the evaluation of the\nIEEE 802.11ad standard and 802.11ay draft in dense user scenarios of mmWave\nwireless networks, we propose an enhanced A-BFT beam training and random access\nmechanism, including the Separated A-BFT (SA-BFT) and Secondary Backoff A-BFT\n(SBA-BFT). The SA-BFT can provide more A-BFT slots and divide A-BFT slots into\ntwo regions by defining a new `E-A-BFT Length' field compared to the legacy\n802.11ad A-BFT, thereby maintaining compatibility when 802.11ay devices are\nmixed with 802.11ad devices. It can also reduce the collision probability in\ndense user scenarios greatly. The SBA-BFT performs secondary backoff with very\nsmall overhead of transmission opportunities within one A-BFT slot, which not\nonly further reduces collision probability, but also improves the A-BFT slots\nutilization. Furthermore, we propose a three-dimensional Markov model to\nanalyze the performance of the SBA-BFT. The analytical and simulation results\nshow that both the SA-BFT and the SBA-BFT can significantly improve BF training\nefficiency, which are beneficial to the optimization design of dense user\nwireless networks based on the IEEE 802.11ay standard and mmWave technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:22:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Pei", ""], ["Fang", "Xuming", ""], ["Fang", "Yuguang", ""], ["Long", "Yan", ""], ["He", "Rong", ""], ["Han", "Xiao", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03745", "submitter": "Michael Kirsche", "authors": "Anna F\\\"orster, Asanga Udugama, Andreas K\\\"onsgen, Antonio Virdis,\n  Michael Kirsche", "title": "Proceedings of the 4th OMNeT++ Community Summit, University of Bremen -\n  Germany, September 7-8, 2017", "comments": "Proceedings of the 4th OMNeT++ Community Summit", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  These are the Proceedings of the 4th OMNeT++ Community Summit, which was held\nat the University of Bremen - Germany - on September 7-8, 2017.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 08:59:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["F\u00f6rster", "Anna", ""], ["Udugama", "Asanga", ""], ["K\u00f6nsgen", "Andreas", ""], ["Virdis", "Antonio", ""], ["Kirsche", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03784", "submitter": "Bin Han", "authors": "Bin Han, Shreya Tayade, and Hans D.

Also, for a seller MNO, we\nanalyze the power consumption of the network per unit area (i.e., areal power\nconsumption) which is shown to be a piecewise continuous function of BS\nintensity, composed of a linear and a convex function. Accordingly, the BS\nintensity of the seller MNO can be optimized to minimize the areal power\nconsumption while achieving a minimum QoS for the buyer MNO.

A popular strategy for energy saving is duty\ncycling. However, when in energy saving mode, users cannot communicate with\neach other. The side effects of duty cycling are twofold. On the one hand, duty\ncycling may reduce the number of usable contacts for delivering messages,\nincreasing intercontact times and delays. On the other hand, duty cycling may\nbreak long contacts into smaller contacts, thus also reducing the capacity of\nthe opportunistic network. Despite the potential serious effects, the role\nplayed by duty cycling in opportunistic networks has been often neglected in\nthe literature. In order to fill this gap, in this paper we propose a general\nmodel for deriving the pairwise contact and intercontact times measured when a\nduty cycling policy is superimposed on the original encounter process\ndetermined only by node mobility. The model we propose is general, i.e., not\nbound to a specific distribution of contact and intercontact times, and very\naccurate, as we show exploiting two traces of real human mobility for\nvalidation. Using this model, we derive several interesting results about the\nproperties of measured contact and intercontact times with duty cycling: their\ndistribution, how their coefficient of variation changes depending on the duty\ncycle value, how the duty cycling affects the capacity and delay of an\nopportunistic network. The applicability of these results is broad, ranging\nfrom performance models for opportunistic networks that factor in the duty\ncycling effect, to the optimisation of the duty cycle to meet a certain target\nperformance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 14:23:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 12:25:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Biondi", "Elisabetta", ""], ["Boldrini", "Chiara", ""], ["Passarella", "Andrea", ""], ["Conti", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.09615", "submitter": "Xiao Lu", "authors": "Xiao Lu, Dusit Niyato, Hai Jiang, Dong In Kim, Yong Xiao and Zhu Han", "title": "Ambient Backscatter Networking: A Novel Paradigm to Assist Wireless\n  Powered Communications", "comments": "A shortened version of this article is to appear in IEEE Wireless\n  Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ambient backscatter communication technology has been introduced recently,\nand is then quickly becoming a promising choice for self-sustainable\ncommunication systems as an external power supply or a dedicated carrier\nemitter is not required.

The best attacking strategies that an attacker can apply\nhave not been well studied. In this paper, for the first time, we study optimal\nPUE attack strategies by formulating an online learning problem where the\nattacker needs to dynamically decide the attacking channel in each time slot\nbased on its attacking experience. The challenge in our problem is that since\nthe PUE attack happens in the spectrum sensing phase, the attacker cannot\nobserve the reward on the attacked channel. To address this challenge, we\nutilize the attacker's observation capability. We propose online learning-based\nattacking strategies based on the attacker's observation capabilities. Through\nour analysis, we show that with no observation within the attacking slot, the\nattacker loses on the regret order, and with the observation of at least one\nchannel, there is a significant improvement on the attacking performance.\nObservation of multiple channels does not give additional benefit to the\nattacker (only a constant scaling) though it gives insight on the number of\nobservations required to achieve the minimum constant factor.
