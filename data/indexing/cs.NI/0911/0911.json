More\nspecifically, it is shown that, in a large n-dimensional hyperbolic ball B of\nradius R viewed as a roughly similar model of a Gromov hyperbolic network, the\nproportion of traffic paths transiting through a small ball near the center is\nindependent of the radius R whereas, in a Euclidean ball, the same proportion\nscales as 1/R^{n-1}. This discrepancy persists for the traffic load, which at\nthe center of the hyperbolic ball scales as the square of the volume, whereas\nthe same traffic load scales as the volume to the power (n+1)/n in the\nEuclidean ball. This provides a theoretical justification of the experimental\nexponent discrepancy observed by Narayan and Saniee between traffic loads in\nGromov-hyperbolic networks from the Rocketfuel data base and synthetic\nEuclidean lattice networks.
