However, even though traditional networking applications run\nmostly unchanged over wireless links, the actual interaction between these\napplications and the dynamics of wireless transmissions is not yet fully\nunderstood. An important example of such applications are bandwidth estimation\ntools. This area has become a mature research topic with well-developed\nresults. Unfortunately recent studies have shown that the application of these\nresults to WLAN links is not straightforward. The main reasons for this is that\nthe assumptions taken to develop bandwidth measurements tools do not hold any\nlonger in the presence of wireless links (e.g. non-FIFO scheduling). This paper\nbuilds from these observations and its main goal is to analyze the interaction\nbetween probe packets and WLAN transmissions in bandwidth estimation processes.\nThe paper proposes an analytical model that better accounts for the\nparticularities of WLAN links. The model is validated through extensive\nexperimentation and simulation and reveals that (1) the distribution of the\ndelay to transmit probing packets is not the same for the whole probing\nsequence, this biases the measurements process and (2) existing tools and\ntechniques point at the achievable throughput rather than the available\nbandwidth or the capacity, as previously assumed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 17:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Portoles-Comeras", "Marc", ""], ["Cabellos-Aparicio", "Albert", ""], ["Mangues-Bafalluy", "Josep", ""], ["Domingo-Pascual", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0746", "submitter": "Katia  Jaffr?s-Runser", "authors": "Katia Jaffr\\`es-Runser, Cristina Comaniciu, Jean-Marie Gorce", "title": "Interference and Congestion Aware Gradient Broadcasting Routing for\n  Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "submitted to Eurasip Journal on Wireless Communications and\n  Networking, special issue on Interference Management in Wireless\n  Communication Systems: Theory and Applications in November 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper addresses the problem of reliable transmission of data through a\nsensor network.

Using a\nmodel of wireless networks based on random geometric graphs with dynamic on-off\nlinks, we show that the delay for disseminating broadcast information exhibits\ntwo behavioral regimes, corresponding to the phase transition of the underlying\nnetwork connectivity. When the dynamic network is in the subcritical phase,\nignoring propagation delays, the delay scales linearly with the Euclidean\ndistance between the sender and the receiver. When the dynamic network is in\nthe supercritical phase, the delay scales sub-linearly with the distance.\nFinally, we show that in the presence of a non-negligible propagation delay,\nthe delay for information dissemination scales linearly with the Euclidean\ndistance in both the subcritical and supercritical regimes, with the rates for\nthe linear scaling being different in the two regimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2009 19:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kong", "Zhenning", ""], ["Yeh", "Edmund M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4527", "submitter": "Nikolaos Livathinos", "authors": "Nikolaos S.

The purpose of this tool is to help the\nresearcher examine in detail how the wireless protocol works both on a network\nand a node basis. It is clear that much of this information is protocol\ndependent and cannot be depicted properly by a general purpose animation\nprocess. Existing animation tools do not provide this level of information\nneither permit the specific protocol to control the animation at all. EXAMS is\nan NS-2 visualization tool for mobile simulations which makes possible the\nportrayal of NS-2 internal information like transmission properties and node\ndata structures. This is mainly possible due to EXAMS extensible architecture\nwhich separates the animation process into a general and a protocol specific\npart. The latter can be developed independently by the protocol designer and\nloaded on demand. These and other useful characteristics of the EXAMS tool can\nbe an invaluable help for a researcher in order to investigate and debug a\nmobile networking protocol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2009 08:03:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Livathinos", "Nikolaos S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4572", "submitter": "Saloua Chettibi", "authors": "Saloua Chettibi, M.
