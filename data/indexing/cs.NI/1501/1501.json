OFDM\nsignals exhibit Gaussian characteristics in time domain and fourth order\ncumulants of Gaussian distributed signals vanish in contrary to the cumulants\nof other signals. Thus fourth order cumulants can be utilized for OFDM signal\nidentification. In this paper, first, formulations of the estimates of the\nfourth order cumulants for OFDM signals are provided. Then it is shown these\nestimates are affected significantly from the wireless channel impairments,\nfrequency offset, phase offset and sampling mismatch. To overcome these\nproblems, a general chi-square constant false alarm rate Gaussianity test which\nemploys estimates of cumulants and their covariances is adapted to the specific\ncase of wireless OFDM signals. Estimation of the covariance matrix of the\nfourth order cumulants are greatly simplified peculiar to the OFDM signals. A\nmeasurement setup is developed to analyze the performance of the identification\nmethod and for comparison purposes. A parametric measurement analysis is\nprovided depending on modulation order, signal to noise ratio, number of\nsymbols, and degree of freedom of the underlying test.
