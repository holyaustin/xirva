In particular, we propose a fast, and communication-efficient\ndecentralized framework to solve the distributed machine learning (DML)\nproblem. The proposed algorithm, Group Alternating Direction Method of\nMultipliers (GADMM) is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers\n(ADMM) framework. The key novelty in GADMM is that it solves the problem in a\ndecentralized topology where at most half of the workers are competing for the\nlimited communication resources at any given time. Moreover, each worker\nexchanges the locally trained model only with two neighboring workers, thereby\ntraining a global model with a lower amount of communication overhead in each\nexchange. We prove that GADMM converges to the optimal solution for convex loss\nfunctions, and numerically show that it converges faster and more\ncommunication-efficient than the state-of-the-art communication-efficient\nalgorithms such as the Lazily Aggregated Gradient (LAG) and dual averaging, in\nlinear and logistic regression tasks on synthetic and real datasets.\nFurthermore, we propose Dynamic GADMM (D-GADMM), a variant of GADMM, and prove\nits convergence under the time-varying network topology of the workers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 19:39:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jan 2020 10:18:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2020 12:06:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Elgabli", "Anis", ""], ["Park", "Jihong", ""], ["Bedi", "Amrit S.", ""], ["Bennis", "Mehdi", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.00065", "submitter": "MohammadReza Ebrahimi", "authors": "MohammadReza Ebrahimi, Farshad Lahouti, Victoria Kostina", "title": "Two-layer Coded Channel Access with Collision Resolution: Design and\n  Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a two-layer coding architecture for communication of multiple\nusers over a shared slotted medium enabling joint collision resolution and\ndecoding.

We analyze two types of codes for the outer\nlayer: long-blocklength LDPC codes, and short-blocklength algebraic codes. With\nLDPC codes, a density evolution analysis enables joint optimization of both\nouter and inner code parameters for maximum throughput. With algebraic codes,\nwe invoke a similar analysis by approximating their average erasure correcting\ncapability while assuming a large number of active transmitters.

BWP has\ntwo conflicting effects: while the interference is reduced as the concurrent\ntransmissions are divided over multiple frequency bands, the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) requirement is increased due to smaller\nallocated bandwidth if the data rate is to be kept constant. Instead, if the\nSIR requirement is to be kept the same, BWP reduces the data rate and in turn\nincreases the local delay.

Parts of these systems are\ncomprised of short-range wireless networks in the form of clusters that\ncollectively cover a large geographical area. In these clusters, the nodes that\nrepresent the cluster heads need to deal with two types of communications: one\nis within the cluster and the other is from the cluster to the sink node. As\nthe number of clusters increases, it takes multiple hops for the cluster head\nto forward data to the sink node, thus resulting in a low packet delivery rate\nand throughput. To solve this problem, we propose a heterogeneous area network\nin which the cluster head is equipped with two types of radios: the IEEE\n802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 radios. The former is for the devices within the\ncluster to communicate, whereas the latter is for the cluster heads to\ncommunicate to the sink node. Although the IEEE 802.11 links increase the link\ncapacity, the IEEE 802.11 radio and the IEEE 802.15.4 radio might share the 2.4\nGHz unlicensed band, thus giving rise to the inter-network collisions or\ninterference.

The results show that using interface diversity\nconfigurations that include at least one {Wi-Fi} interface leads to, somewhat\nsurprisingly, since Wi-Fi is generally less reliable than LTE, superior results\nin terms of packet success and error burst duration. Another interesting\nfinding is that {Wi-Fi}-based interface diversity configurations outperform\neven ultra-reliable single links.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2019 14:09:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Nielsen", "Jimmy J.", ""], ["Leyva-Mayorga", "Israel", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.03900", "submitter": "Weitao Xu", "authors": "Weitao Xu, Jun Young Kim, Walter Huang, Salil Kanhere, Sanjay Jha, Wen\n  Hu", "title": "Measurement, Characterization and Modeling of LoRa Technology in\n  Multi-floor Buildings", "comments": "10 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, we have witnessed the rapid development of LoRa technology,\ntogether with extensive studies trying to understand its performance in various\napplication settings.

Consequently, new challenges are expected for inter-system\nsatellite coexistence due to the increased interference level and the\ncomplexity of the interactions resulting from the heterogeneity of the\nconstellations. This is especially relevant for the Ku-band, where the NGSO\nsystems are most diverse and existing GSO systems, which often support critical\nservices, must be protected from interference. It is thus imperative to\nevaluate the impact of mutual inter-system interference, the efficiency of the\nbasic interference mitigation techniques, and whether regulatory intervention\nis needed for the new systems. We conduct an extensive study of inter-satellite\ncoexistence in the Ku-band, where we consider all recently proposed NGSO and\nsome selected GSO systems. Our throughput degradation results suggest that\nexisting spectrum regulation may be insufficient to ensure GSO protection from\nNGSO interference, especially due to the high transmit power of the LEO Kepler\nsatellites. This also results in strong interference towards other NGSO\nsystems, where traditional interference mitigation techniques like look-aside\nmay perform poorly. Specifically, look-aside can be beneficial for large\nconstellations, but detrimental for small constellations. Furthermore, we\nconfirm that band-splitting among satellite operators significantly degrades\nthroughput, also for the Ku-band. Our results overall show that the complexity\nof the inter-satellite interactions for new NGSO systems is too high to be\nmanaged via simple interference mitigation techniques.

Since all training parameters are transmitted over wireless links, the\nquality of the training will be affected by wireless factors such as packet\nerrors and the availability of wireless resources.

However, there is a gap in\nthe literature which particularly needs to follow recent computing paradigms as\nalternative mechanisms for the enhancement of security. To cover this, a\ndetailed description of the security for the 5G networks is presented in this\narticle along with the discussions on the evolution of osmotic and catalytic\ncomputing-based security modules. The taxonomy on the basis of security\nrequirements is presented, which also includes the comparison of the existing\nstate-of-the-art solutions. This article also provides a security model,\n\"CATMOSIS\", which idealizes the incorporation of security features on the basis\nof catalytic and osmotic computing in the 5G networks. Finally, various\nsecurity challenges and open issues are discussed to emphasize the works to\nfollow in this direction of research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Sep 2019 08:10:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Choudhary", "Gaurav", ""], ["Sharma", "Vishal", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.08928", "submitter": "Mohammed Alasmar", "authors": "Mohammed Alasmar and George Parisis and Jon Crowcroft", "title": "SCDP: Systematic Rateless Coding for Efficient Data Transport in Data\n  Centres", "comments": "14 pages, 15 figures, Submitted to ToN Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose SCDP, a novel, general-purpose data transport\nprotocol for data centres that, in contrast to all other protocols proposed to\ndate, natively supports one-to-many and many-to-one data communication, which\nis extremely common in modern data centres.

Consequently, the rise of new infrastructures and spectrum\nstakeholders is anticipated. This will fuel the development of a 5G data\nexchange ecosystem where data transactions are deemed to be high-value business\ncommodities. Also, a data economy-oriented business model is proposed. The\nstudy found that with the potential commodification of data and data\ntransactions along with the low-cost physical infrastructure and spectrum, the\n5G network will introduce significant disruption in the Telco business\necosystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 19:06:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 31 May 2020 08:45:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Patwary", "Mohmammad N.", ""], ["Nawaz", "Syed Junaid", ""], ["Rahman", "Md.

IoT objects capable of handling\nmultiple sensing and actuating functions are the cornerstone of smart\napplications such as smart buildings, smart factories, home automation, and\nhealthcare automation. These smart applications express their demands in terms\nof high-level requests. These requests are characterised by the different\nrequirements of sensing actuating functions, processing and memory needs,\nactivation zones, latency, etc. In service-oriented architecture-based IoT,\napplication requests are translated into a business process BP workflow. In\nthis study, we model such a BP as a virtual network containing a set of virtual\nnodes and links connected in a specific topology. These virtual nodes represent\nthe requested processing and location where sensing or actuation are needed.\nThe virtual links capture the requested communication requirements between\nnodes. In this paper, we introduce a framework, optimised using mixed integer\nlinear programming MILP, that embeds the BPs from the virtual layer into a\nlower-level implementation at the IoT physical layer. The proposed framework\nresults in a physical plan that optimally allocates the processing needed and\nprovisions the sensing and actuation at the required locations requirements to\nan appropriate set of IoT nodes. The optimisation goal is to minimise the IoT\nlayer total power consumption and optimise the traffic distribution in a manner\nthat minimises the traffic latency of each IoT node.

This paper addresses the crowd estimation problem and builds an\nIoT service to share the crowd estimation results across different systems. The\ncrowd estimation problem is to approximate the crowd size in a targeted area\nusing the observed information (e.g., Wi-Fi data). This paper exploits Wi-Fi\nprobe request packets (\"Wi-Fi probes\" for short) broadcasted by mobile devices\nto solve this problem. However, using only Wi-Fi probes to estimate the crowd\nsize may result in inaccurate results due to various environmental\nuncertainties which may lead to crowd overestimation or underestimation.\nMoreover, the ground-truth is unavailable because the coverage of Wi-Fi signals\nis time-varying and invisible. This paper introduces auxiliary sensors,\nstereoscopic cameras, to collect the near ground-truth at a specified\ncalibration choke point. Two calibration algorithms are proposed to solve the\ncrowd estimation problem. The key idea is to calibrate the Wi-Fi-only crowd\nestimation based on the correlations between the two types of data modalities.\nThen, to share the calibrated results across systems required by different\nstakeholders, our system is integrated with the FIWARE-based IoT platform. To\nverify the proposed system, we have launched an indoor pilot study in the\nWellington Railway Station and an outdoor pilot study in the Christchurch\nRe:START Mall in New Zealand. The large-scale pilot studies show that\nstereoscopic cameras can reach minimum accuracy of 85\\% and high precision\ndetection for providing the near ground-truth. The proposed calibration\nalgorithms reduce estimation errors by 43.68% on average compared to the\nWi-Fi-only approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 13:17:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Fang-Jing", ""], ["Solmaz", "G\u00fcrkan", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13809", "submitter": "Ridha Nasri", "authors": "Ridha Nasri, Jalal Rachad and Laurent Decreusefond", "title": "Radio Resource Dimensioning with Cox Process Based User Location\n  Distribution", "comments": "11 pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1805.06637", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The upcoming fifth generation (5G) New Radio (NR) interface inherits many\nconcepts and techniques from 4G systems such as the Orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiplex (OFDM) based waveform and multiple access.
