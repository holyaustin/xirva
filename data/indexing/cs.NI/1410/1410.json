The\nexperimental studies conducted reveal that impairments over the WiFi link\n(frame loss, ARQ and increased delay) and the residual loss seen by TCP causes\na cascade of duplicate ACKs to be generated. This triggers large congestion\nwindow reductions at the sender, leading to a drastic degradation of throughput\nto the vehicular client.

It is\nobvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment\ndue to traffic signals and speed limits at different portions of the road, as\nwell as vehicle interactions that are significant on busy streets. In light of\nthe inadequacy, we present in this paper an original methodology to study the\nbroadcasting performance of 802.11p VANETs with practical vehicle distribution\nin urban environments.

Each\nunwanted signal consumes a fraction of the available capacity. In the extreme,\nas more interferers are added the available bandwidth can support only one\nuser.\n  We adapt CDMA techniques to a single user by assigning a constellation of M\nsymbols built around Walsh codes. This M-ary constellation encodes K bits of\ndata into one of the length N codewords, and gives preference to a\nnon-power-of-two Hadamard length, e.g., 12, 20, and higher multiples. The\ntradeoff between the modified and conventional Walsh code designs is that one\nuser sends K bits per Walsh symbol interval as opposed to many users sending\none bit each per symbol. The throughput sacrifice is a consequence of the\nsevere external interference environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 20:47:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Clites", "Dave", ""], ["Orr", "Richard", ""], ["Rieser", "Jack", ""], ["Dellomo", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.4599", "submitter": "Erte Pan", "authors": "Erte Pan and Zhu Han", "title": "Non-parametric Bayesian Learning with Deep Learning Structure and Its\n  Applications in Wireless Networks", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures and 1 algorithm list", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NE cs.NI stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present an infinite hierarchical non-parametric Bayesian\nmodel to extract the hidden factors over observed data, where the number of\nhidden factors for each layer is unknown and can be potentially infinite.\nMoreover, the number of layers can also be infinite.

In this way, the SDN\ncontroller can tune routing protocol updates for traffic engineering purposes\nbefore they are flooded into sub-domains.

The blanking method is used to mitigate the\ninter-cell interference, where a resource is either used with a predetermined\ntransmit power or not used at all, i.e., blanked. This problem is known to be\nstrongly NP-hard, which means that it is not only hard to solve in polynomial\ntime, but it is also hard to find an approximation algorithm with guaranteed\noptimality gap. In this work, we identify special scenarios where a\npolynomial-time algorithm can be constructed to solve this problem with\ntheoretical guarantees. In particular, we define a dominant interference\nenvironment, in which for each user the received power from each interferer is\nsignificantly greater than the aggregate received power from all other weaker\ninterferers.\n  We show that the strongly NP-hard problem can be tightly relaxed to a linear\nprogramming problem in a dominant interference environment. Consequently, we\npropose a polynomial-time distributed algorithm that is based on the\nprimal-decomposition, the projected-subgradient, and the network flow\noptimization methods. In comparison with baseline schemes, simulation results\nshow that the proposed scheme achieves higher gains in aggregate throughput,\ncell-edge throughput, and outage probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 04:32:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sediq", "Akram Bin", ""], ["Schoenen", "Rainer", ""], ["Yanikomeroglu", "Halim", ""], ["Senarath", "Gamini", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8635", "submitter": "Xiao Lu", "authors": "Xiao Lu, Dusit Niyato, Ping Wang, Dong In Kim, and Zhu Han", "title": "Wireless Charger Networking for Mobile Devices: Fundamentals, Standards,\n  and Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless charging is a technique of transmitting power through an air gap to\nan electrical device for the purpose of energy replenishment.
