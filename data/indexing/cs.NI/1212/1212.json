Our goal is to design practical scheduling\npolicies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput\nand delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$-complexity\nhybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both\nrate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic\nregime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),\ntheir practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop\na simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a\n\\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves\nthroughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay\nperformance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for\nany delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable\nrate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able\nto achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \\log n)$ of the hybrid\npolicies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More\nimportantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity\nthan the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in\nthe $O(\\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate\nour theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that\nD-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is\nvirtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 16:05:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Mar 2013 21:53:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2013 09:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 23 Mar 2014 17:06:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Bo", ""], ["Gupta", "Gagan R.", ""], ["Sharma", "Manu", ""], ["Lin", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1735", "submitter": "Mark Levin", "authors": "Mark Sh.

In this paper, we focus on the second\npart, which had previously received less attention in the literature. In\nparticular, we assume that a $1$-by-$N$ topology is given and that all\n$2$-by-$2$ components can be queried and learned using end-to-end probes.

We\nprovide a lower bound, $\\lceil \\frac{N}{2} \\rceil$, on the number of\n$2$-by-$2$'s required by any active learning algorithm and propose two greedy\nalgorithms. The first algorithm follows the framework of multiple hypothesis\ntesting, in particular Generalized Binary Search (GBS), since our problem is\none of active learning, from $2$-by-$2$ queries. The second algorithm is called\nthe Receiver Elimination Algorithm (REA) and follows a bottom-up approach: at\nevery step, it selects two receivers, queries the corresponding $2$-by-$2$, and\nmerges it with the given $1$-by-$N$; it requires exactly $N-1$ steps, which is\nmuch less than all $\\binom{N}{2}$ possible $2$-by-$2$'s.

In the first monopoly market with one operator using opportunistic\nshared-use DSA, we study the operator's pricing effect on the equilibrium\nbehaviors of self-optimizing SUs in a queueing system. %This queue represents\nthe congestion of the multiple SUs sharing the operator's single \\ON-\\OFF\nchannel that models the primary users (PUs) traffic.

We also provide a sufficient condition\nand iterative algorithms for equilibrium convergence. In terms of operators,\ntwo pricing mechanisms are proposed with different goals: revenue maximization\nand social welfare maximization.
