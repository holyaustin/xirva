The trends from the trace-driven simulations are consistent\nwith the model, in general. Immunization and timely deployment seem to be the\nmost effective to counter the worm attacks in such scenarios while cooperation\nmay help in a specific case. These findings provide insight that we hope would\naid to develop counter-worm protocols in future encounter-based networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2007 18:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tanachaiwiwat", "Sapon", ""], ["Helmy", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4175", "submitter": "Cedric Adjih", "authors": "Song Yean Cho (INRIA Rocquencourt), C\\'edric Adjih (INRIA\n  Rocquencourt), Philippe Jacquet (INRIA Rocquencourt)", "title": "Heuristics for Network Coding in Wireless Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": null, "abstract": "  Multicast is a central challenge for emerging multi-hop wireless\narchitectures such as wireless mesh networks, because of its substantial cost\nin terms of bandwidth. In this report, we study one specific case of multicast:\nbroadcasting, sending data from one source to all nodes, in a multi-hop\nwireless network. The broadcast we focus on is based on network coding, a\npromising avenue for reducing cost; previous work of ours showed that the\nperformance of network coding with simple heuristics is asymptotically optimal:\neach transmission is beneficial to nearly every receiver. This is for\nhomogenous and large networks of the plan. But for small, sparse or for\ninhomogeneous networks, some additional heuristics are required. This report\nproposes such additional new heuristics (for selecting rates) for broadcasting\nwith network coding. Our heuristics are intended to use only simple local\ntopology information. We detail the logic of the heuristics, and with\nexperimental results, we illustrate the behavior of the heuristics, and\ndemonstrate their excellent performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2007 09:56:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2007 12:24:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Song Yean", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Adjih", "C\u00e9dric", "", "INRIA\n  Rocquencourt"], ["Jacquet", "Philippe", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"]]}]
