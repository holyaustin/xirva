It has been\nshown that sending more packets than maximum achievable end-to-end throughput\nnot only fails to increase throughput, but also decreases throughput owing to\nhigh contention and collision. Accordingly, it is of crucial importance for a\nsource node to know the maximum end-to-end throughput. The end-to-end\nthroughput depends on multiple factors, such as physical layer limitations, MAC\nprotocol properties, routing policy and nodes distribution. There have been\nmany studies on analytical modeling of end-to-end throughput but none of them\nhas taken routing policy and nodes distribution as well as MAC layer altogether\ninto account. In this paper, the end-to-end throughput with perfect MAC layer\nis obtained based on routing policy and nodes distribution in one and two\ndimensional networks.

First, we demonstrate how current state-of-the-art\ndelay-based geolocation techniques are susceptible to evasion through delay\nmanipulations, which involve both increasing and decreasing the Internet delays\nthat are observed between a client and a remote measuring party. We then\npropose Client Presence Verification (CPV) as a delay-based technique to verify\nan assertion about a client's physical presence in a prescribed geographic\nregion. Three verifiers geographically encapsulating a client's asserted\nlocation are used to corroborate that assertion by measuring the delays between\nthemselves and the client. CPV infers geographic distances from these delays\nand thus, using the smaller of the forward and reverse one-way delay between\neach verifier and the client is expected to result in a more accurate distance\ninference than using the conventional round-trip times. Accordingly, we devise\na novel protocol for accurate one-way delay measurements between the client and\nthe three verifiers to be used by CPV, taking into account that the client\ncould manipulate the measurements to defeat the verification process. We\nevaluate CPV through extensive real-world experiments with legitimate clients\n(those truly present at where they asserted to be) modeled to use both wired\nand wireless access networks. Wired evaluation is done using the PlanetLab\ntestbed, during which we examine various factors affecting CPV's efficacy, such\nas the client's geographical nearness to the verifiers. For wireless\nevaluation, we leverage the Internet delay information collected for wired\nclients from PlanetLab, and model additional delays representing the last-mile\nwireless link. Finally, we reinforce CPV against a (hypothetical) middlebox\nthat an adversary specifically customizes to defeat CPV.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Feb 2018 15:51:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Abdou", "AbdelRahman", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.05198", "submitter": "George Xylomenos", "authors": "Nikos Fotiou and George Xylomenos and George C.

In this way,\nwe mathematically formulate an optimization problem and define a genetic\nalgorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem. We test the proposed\nalgorithm on real-world network traffic. Our results show that CECT is\ncomputationally fast and the solution is feasible in all cases. In order to\nevaluate our algorithm in term of throughput, CECT is compared with ECMP (where\nthe shortest path algorithm is used as the cost function). Simulation results\nconfirm that the throughput obtained by running CECT is improved up to 3x\ncompared to ECMP while packet loss is decreased up to 2x.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:57:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:54:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tajiki", "Mohammad Mahdi", ""], ["Akbari", "Behzad", ""], ["Shojafar", "Mohammad", ""], ["Petroudi", "Seyed Hesamedin Ghasemi", ""], ["Barazandeh", "Mahdi Latifi", ""], ["Mokari", "Nader", ""], ["Chiaraviglio", "Luca", ""], ["Zink", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.07855", "submitter": "Tao Gong", "authors": "Song Han and Tao Gong and Mark Nixon and Eric Rotvold and Kam-yiu Lam\n  and Krithi Ramamritham", "title": "RT-DAP: A Real-Time Data Analytics Platform for Large-scale Industrial\n  Process Monitoring and Control", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In most process control systems nowadays, process measurements are\nperiodically collected and archived in historians.

While such services may be deemed more convenient than riding\npublic transit due to their on-demand nature, reports show that they do not\nnecessarily decrease the congestion in major cities. One of the key problems is\nthat typically mobility decision support systems focus on individual utility\nand react only after congestion appears. In this paper, we propose socially\nconsiderate multi-modal routing algorithms that are proactive and consider, via\npredictions, the shared effect of riders on the overall efficacy of mobility\nservices. We have adapted the MATSim simulator framework to incorporate the\nproposed algorithms present a simulation analysis of a case study in Nashville,\nTennessee that assesses the effects of our routing models on the traffic\ncongestion for different levels of penetration and adoption of socially\nconsiderate routes. Our results indicate that even at a low penetration (social\nratio), we are able to achieve an improvement in system-level performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Feb 2018 19:50:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Samal", "Chinmaya", ""], ["Zheng", "Liyuan", ""], ["Sun", "Fangzhou", ""], ["Ratliff", "Lillian J.", ""], ["Dubey", "Abhishek", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10338", "submitter": "Khaled Abdelfadeel", "authors": "Khaled Q.

Since LoRa/LoRaWAN supports various data rates, we\nfirstly derive the fairest ratios of deploying each data rate within a cell for\na fair collision probability. LoRa/LoRaWAN, like other frequency modulation\nbased radio interfaces, exhibits the \\textit{capture effect} in which only the\nstronger signal of colliding signals will be extracted. This leads to\nunfairness, where far nodes or nodes experiencing higher attenuation are less\nlikely to see their packets received correctly. Therefore, we secondly develop\na transmission power control algorithm to balance the received signal powers\nfrom all nodes regardless of their distances from the gateway for a fair data\nextraction. Simulations show that our approach achieves higher fairness in data\nrate than the state-of-art in almost all network configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 10:16:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Abdelfadeel", "Khaled Q.", ""], ["Cionca", "Victor", ""], ["Pesch", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10438", "submitter": "Banu Kabakulak", "authors": "Banu Kabakulak", "title": "Sensor and Sink Placement, Scheduling and Routing Algorithms for\n  Connected Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "30 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI eess.SP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A sensor is a small electronic device which has the ability to sense, compute\nand communicate either with other sensors or directly with a base station\n(sink). In a wireless sensor network (WSN), the sensors monitor a region and\ntransmit the collected data packets through routes to the sinks. In this study,\nwe propose a mixed--integer linear programming (MILP) model to maximize the\nnumber of time periods that a WSN carries out the desired tasks with limited\nenergy and budget. Our sink and sensor placement, scheduling, routing with\nconnected coverage ($SPSRC$) model is the first in the literature that combines\nthe decisions for the locations of sinks and sensors, activity schedules of the\ndeployed sensors, and data flow routes from each active sensor to its assigned\nsink for connected coverage of the network over a finite planning horizon. The\nproblem is NP--hard and difficult to solve even for small instances. Assuming\nthat the sink locations are known, we develop heuristics which construct a\nfeasible solution of the problem by gradually satisfying the constraints. Then,\nwe introduce search heuristics to determine the locations of the sinks to\nmaximize the network lifetime. Computational experiments reveal that our\nheuristic methods can find near optimal solutions in an acceptable amount of\ntime compared to the commercial solver CPLEX 12.7.0.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 14:43:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kabakulak", "Banu", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.10472", "submitter": "Andrea Tassi", "authors": "Ioannis Mavromatis, Andrea Tassi, Robert J.
