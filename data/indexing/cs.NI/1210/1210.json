This paper aims at proposing a diagrammatic\nmethodology to represent protocols in general, with a focus on the Transmission\nControl Protocol and Secure Sockets Layer in particular. The purpose is to\nfacilitate understanding of protocols for learning and communication purposes.\nThe methodology is based on the notion of flow of primitive things in a system\nwith six stages: creation, release, transfer, arrival, acceptance, and\nprocessing. Though the method presents a basic description of protocols without\nin-depth analysis of all aspects and mechanisms, the resultant conceptual\ndescription is a systematic specification that utilizes a few basic notions\nthat assist in illustrating functionality and support comprehension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Oct 2012 22:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Fedaghi", "Sabah", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.2025", "submitter": "Abdul Razaque", "authors": "Wafa Elmannai, Abdul Razaque, Khaled Elleithy", "title": "TCP-UB: A New congestion aware transmission control protocolvariant", "comments": "13 Pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Computer Networks & Communications\n  (IJCNC) Vol.4, No.4, July 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transmission control protocol (TCP) is a connection oriented protocol for\nseveral types of distributed applications.

As the number of sub carriers is increased there\nis no guarantee of sustained orthogonality, i.e. at some point the carriers are\nnot independent to each other, and hence where the orthogonality can be loosed\nwhich leads to interference and also owing to the synchronization between\ntransmitter and receiver local oscillator, it causes interference known as\nInter Carrier Interference (ICI).In this scheme at the transmitter side the\nmodulated data and a few predefined pilot symbols are mapped onto the non\nneighboring sub carriers with weighting coefficients of +1 and -1. With the aid\nof pilot symbols the frequency offset is exactly estimated by using Maximum\nLikelihood Estimation MLE and hence can be minimized. At demodulation stage the\nreceived signals are linearly combined along with their weighted oefficients\nand pilot symbols, called as Pilot Aided Self Cancellation Method PASCS. The\nsimulations are carried out on Stanford University Interim (SUI)channels. The\nsimulation results shows that by incorporating this method into WiMAX systems\nit performs better when the Line Of Sight (LOS) component is present in the\ntransmission and also it improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) and Carrier to\nInterference Ratio (CIR). The CIR can be improved 20 dB. In this paper the\neffectiveness of PASCS scheme is compared with the Self Cancellation Method\n(SCM). It provides accurate estimation of frequency offset and when residual\nCFO is less significant the ICI can be diminished successfully.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Oct 2012 12:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Juluru", "Tarun Kumar", ""], ["Kankacharla", "Anitha sheela", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3768", "submitter": "Shih-Jung Wu", "authors": "Shih-Jung Wu, Shih-Yi Huang, Kuo-Feng Huang", "title": "Adaptive Priority-Based Downlink Scheduling for WiMAX Networks", "comments": "12 pages, 16 figures, 6 algorithms, 27 equations, 40 references", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Supporting quality of service (QoS) guarantees for diverse multimedia\nservices are the primary concerns for WiMAX (IEEE 802.16) networks.

However, it remains\ndifficult to increase the number of channels per node, thus the maximal degree\nof the network may be bounded. This is typically the case in grid topology\nnetworks, where each node has at most four neighbors. In this paper, we address\nthe following issue: if each node is likely to fail in an unpredictable manner,\nhow can we preserve some global reliability guarantees when the number of nodes\nkeeps increasing unboundedly ? To be more specific, we consider the problem or\nreliably broadcasting information on an asynchronous grid in the presence of\nByzantine failures -- that is, some nodes may have an arbitrary and potentially\nmalicious behavior. Our requirement is that a constant fraction of correct\nnodes remain able to achieve reliable communication. Existing solutions can\nonly tolerate a fixed number of Byzantine failures if they adopt a worst-case\nplacement scheme. Besides, if we assume a constant Byzantine ratio (each node\nhas the same probability to be Byzantine), the probability to have a fatal\nplacement approaches 1 when the number of nodes increases, and reliability\nguarantees collapse. In this paper, we propose the first broadcast protocol\nthat overcomes these difficulties. First, the number of Byzantine failures that\ncan be tolerated (if they adopt the worst-case placement) now increases with\nthe number of nodes. Second, we are able to tolerate a constant Byzantine\nratio, however large the grid may be. In other words, the grid becomes\nscalable.

As a result, these\nnetworks have an enormous Carbon footprint. In this note, we describe the\nsources of the inefficiencies in such networks. First we quantify how much\nCarbon footprint such networks generate. We also discuss how much more mobile\ntraffic is expected to increase so that this Carbon footprint will even\nincrease tremendously more. We then discuss specific sources of inefficiency\nand potential sources of improvement at the physical layer as well as higher\nlayers of the communication protocol hierarchy. In particular, considering that\nmost of the energy inefficiency in wireless cellular networks is at the base\nstations, we discuss multi-tier networks and point to the potential of\nexploiting mobility patterns in order to use base station energy judiciously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2012 18:39:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ayanoglu", "Ender", ""]]}]
