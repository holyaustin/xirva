We\nfurther reveal that beamsteering mobile clients face a unique challenge to\nbalance client efficiency and network capacity. There is an optimal operating\npoint for a beamsteering mobile client in terms of the number of antennas and\ntransmit power that achieve the required capacity with lowest power. Finally,\nwe provide a distributed algorithm called BeamAdapt that allows each client to\nclosely approach its optimal point iteratively without central coordination. We\nalso offer a cellular system realization of BeamAdapt. Using Qualnet-based\nsimulation, we show that BeamAdapt with four antennas can reduce client power\nconsumption by 55% while maintaining a required network throughput for a\nlarge-scale network, compared to the same network with omni directional mobile\nclients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 18:47:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Hang", ""], ["Zhong", "Lin", ""], ["Sabharwal", "Ashutosh", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.3005", "submitter": "Yi Gai", "authors": "Yi Gai, Bhaskar Krishnamachari and Mingyan Liu", "title": "On the Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit Problem with Markovian Rewards", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC cs.LG cs.NI cs.SY math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a combinatorial generalization of the classical multi-armed\nbandit problem that is defined as follows.

It establishes new flows on newly\navailable networks but allows pre-existing flows on the old network to\nterminate naturally, effectively decreasing, or even eliminating, connectivity\ngaps during network switches. Resumption Agent takes advantage of the\nfunctionality integrated into many modern protocols to securely resume flows\nwithout application intervention. When combined, Wait-n-Migrate and Resumption\nAgent provide an unprecedented opportunity to immediately deploy performance\nand efficiency-enhancing policies that leverage multiple networks to improve\nthe performance, efficiency, and connectivity of mobile devices.

For the foreseeable future, however, a direct\nconnectivity between equipped vehicles in one direction is rarely possible. We\ntherefore investigate an alternative mode in which messages are stored by relay\nvehicles traveling in the opposite direction, and forwarded to vehicles in the\noriginal direction at a later time. The wireless communication consists of two\n`transversal' message hops across driving directions. Since direct connectivity\nfor transversal hops and a successful message transmission to vehicles in the\ndestination region is only a matter of time, the quality of this IVC strategy\ncan be described in terms of the distribution function for the total\ntransmission time. Assuming a Poissonian distance distribution between equipped\nvehicles, we derive analytical probability distributions for message\ntransmission times and related propagation speeds for a deterministic and a\nstochastic model of the maximum range of direct communication. By means of\nintegrated microscopic simulations of communication and bi-directional traffic\nflows, we validated the theoretical expectation for multi-lane roadways. We\nfound little deviation of the analytical result for multi-lane scenarios, but\nsignificant deviations for a single-lane. This can be explained by vehicle\nplatooning.

Such approaches aim to minimize network delay, increase capacity, and\nenhance security services between two core (relay) network nodes, an ingress\nnode and an egress node. MATE (Multipath Adaptive Traffic Engineering) has been\nproposed for multipath adaptive traffic engineering between an ingress node\n(source) and an egress node (destination) to distribute the network flow among\nmultiple disjoint paths. Its novel idea is to avoid network congestion and\nattacks that might exist in edge and node disjoint paths between two core\nnetwork nodes.\n  This paper proposes protection schemes over asymmetric channels. Precisely,\nthe paper aims to develop an adaptive, robust, and reliable traffic engineering\nscheme to improve performance and reliability of communication networks. This\nscheme will also provision Quality of Server (QoS) and protection of traffic\nengineering to maximize network efficiency. Specifically, S-MATE (secure MATE)\nis proposed to protect the network traffic between two core nodes (routers,\nswitches, etc.) in a cloud network. S-MATE secures against a single link\nattack/failure by adding redundancy in one of the operational redundant paths\nbetween the sender and receiver nodes. It is also extended to secure against\nmultiple attacked links.
