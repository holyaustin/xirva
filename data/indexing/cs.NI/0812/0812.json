Indeed, whereas P2P content distribution enables financial savings\nfor the content providers, it dramatically increases the traffic on inter-ISP\nlinks. To solve this issue, the idea to keep a fraction of the P2P traffic\nlocal to each ISP was introduced a few years ago. Since then, P2P solutions\nexploiting locality have been introduced. However, several fundamental issues\non locality still need to be explored. In particular, how far can we push\nlocality, and what is, at the scale of the Internet, the reduction of traffic\nthat can be achieved with locality? In this paper, we perform extensive\nexperiments on a controlled environment with up to 10 000 BitTorrent clients to\nevaluate the impact of high locality on inter-ISP links traffic and peers\ndownload completion time. We introduce two simple mechanisms that make high\nlocality possible in challenging scenarios and we show that we save up to\nseveral orders of magnitude inter-ISP traffic compared to traditional locality\nwithout adversely impacting peers download completion time. In addition, we\ncrawled 214 443 torrents representing 6 113 224 unique peers spread among 9 605\nASes.

However, this must be done with the least amount of protection\nresources, while using simple management plane functionality. Recently, network\ncoding has been proposed as a solution to provide agile and cost efficient\nnetwork self-healing against link failures, in a manner that does not require\ndata rerouting, packet retransmission, or failure localization, hence leading\nto simple control and management planes. To achieve this, separate paths have\nto be provisioned to carry encoded packets, hence requiring either the addition\nof extra links, or reserving some of the resources for this purpose.\n  In this paper we introduce autonomic self-healing strategies for autonomic\nnetworks in order to protect against link failures. The strategies are based on\nnetwork coding and reduced capacity, which is a technique that we call network\nprotection codes (NPC). In these strategies, an autonomic network is able to\nprovide self-healing from various network failures affecting network operation.\nThe techniques improve service and enhance reliability of autonomic\ncommunication.\n  Network protection codes are extended to provide self-healing from multiple\nlink failures in autonomic networks. We provide implementation aspects of the\nproposed strategies. We present bounds and network protection code\nconstructions. Finally, we study the construction of such codes over the binary\nfield. The paper also develops an Integer Linear Program formulation to\nevaluate the cost of provisioning connections using the proposed strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2008 20:59:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2008 05:13:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""], ["Kamal", "Ahmed E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1093", "submitter": "Stephane Devismes", "authors": "Ajoy K.

Linial (FOCS'87) has proved a\nlower bound of 1/2 \\log^* n for the problem, and Szegedy and Vishwanathan\n(STOC'93) provided a heuristic argument that shows that algorithms from a wide\nfamily of locally iterative algorithms are unlikely to achieve running time\nsmaller than \\Theta(Delta log Delta).\n  We present a deterministic (Delta + 1)-coloring distributed algorithm with\nrunning time O(Delta) + 1/2 log^* n.

In an m-defective p-coloring the\nvertices are colored with p colors so that each vertex has up to m neighbors\nwith the same color. We show that an m-defective p-coloring with reasonably\nsmall m and p can be computed very efficiently.

(1) We\nconsider various problems on centralized link scheduling in Spatial Time\nDivision Multiple Access (STDMA) wireless mesh networks. We motivate the use of\nspatial reuse as performance metric and provide an explicit characterization of\nspatial reuse. We propose link scheduling algorithms based on certain graph\nmodels (communication graph, SINR graph) of the network. Our algorithms achieve\nhigher spatial reuse than that of existing algorithms, with only a slight\nincrease in computational complexity.

We assume that the receiver is capable of\npower-based capture and propose a splitting algorithm that varies transmission\npowers of users on the basis of quaternary channel feedback.

Our algorithm achieves higher maximum\nstable throughput and significantly lower delay than the First Come First Serve\n(FCFS) splitting algorithm with uniform transmission power. (3) We consider the\nproblem of flow control in packet networks from an information-theoretic\nperspective. We derive the maximum entropy of a flow which conforms to traffic\nconstraints imposed by a generalized token bucket regulator (GTBR), by taking\ninto account the covert information present in randomness of packet lengths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2008 13:37:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Gore", "Ashutosh Deepak", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4826", "submitter": "Long Gao", "authors": "Long Gao, Rui Zhang, Changchuan Yin, Shuguang Cui", "title": "Delay-Throughput Tradeoff for Supportive Two-Tier Networks", "comments": "5 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ISIT 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider a static wireless network that has two tiers with different\npriorities: a primary tier vs. a secondary tier. The primary tier consists of\nrandomly distributed legacy nodes of density $n$, which have an absolute\npriority to access the spectrum. The secondary tier consists of randomly\ndistributed cognitive nodes of density $m=n^\\beta$ with $\\beta\\geq 2$, which\ncan only access the spectrum opportunistically to limit the interference to the\nprimary tier. By allowing the secondary tier to route the packets for the\nprimary tier, we show that the primary tier can achieve a throughput scaling of\n$\\lambda_p(n)=\\Theta(1/\\log n)$ per node and a delay-throughput tradeoff of\n$D_p(n)=\\Theta(\\sqrt{n^\\beta\\log n}\\lambda_p(n))$ for $\\lambda_p(n)=O(1/\\log\nn)$, while the secondary tier still achieves the same optimal delay-throughput\ntradeoff as a stand-alone network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Dec 2008 16:18:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Long", ""], ["Zhang", "Rui", ""], ["Yin", "Changchuan", ""], ["Cui", "Shuguang", ""]]}]
