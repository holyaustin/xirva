One major\nchallenge these architectures face is the difficulty of handling uncertain\ntraffic demands using commercial optical circuit switches (OCS) with high\nswitching latency. Prior works have generally focused on developing\nfast-switching OCS prototypes to quickly react to traffic changes through\nfrequent reconfigurations. This approach, however, adds tremendous complexity\nto the control plane, and raises the barrier for commercial adoption of optical\ncircuit switched data center networks.\n  We propose COUDER, a robust topology and routing optimization framework for\nreconfigurable optical circuit switched data centers. COUDER optimizes topology\nand routing based on a convex set of traffic matrices, and offers strict\nthroughput guarantees for any future traffic matrices bounded by the convex\nset. For the bursty traffic demands that are unbounded by the convex set, we\nemploy a desensitization technique to reduce performance hit. This enables\nCOUDER to generate topology and routing solutions capable of handling\nunexpected traffic changes without relying on frequent topology\nreconfigurations. Our extensive evaluations based on Facebook's production DCN\ntraces show that, even with daily reconfiguration, COUDER achieves about 20\\%\nhigher throughput, and about 32\\% lower average hop count compared to\ncost-equivalent static topologies. Our work shows that adoption of\nreconfigurable topologies in commercial DCNs is feasible even without fast\nOCSs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:09:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Teh", "Min Yee", ""], ["Zhao", "Shizhen", ""], ["Cao", "Peirui", ""], ["Bergman", "Keren", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00176", "submitter": "Yong Xiao", "authors": "Yong Xiao and Guangming Shi and Yingyu Li and Walid Saad and H.\n  Vincent Poor", "title": "Towards Self-learning Edge Intelligence in 6G", "comments": "To be published at IEEE Communications Magazine, vol. 58, no. 12,\n  December 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Edge intelligence, also called edge-native artificial intelligence (AI), is\nan emerging technological framework focusing on seamless integration of AI,\ncommunication networks, and mobile edge computing.

In this paper, we consider a multi-user MEC network with\ntime-varying wireless channels and stochastic user task data arrivals in\nsequential time frames. In particular, we aim to design an online computation\noffloading algorithm to maximize the network data processing capability subject\nto the long-term data queue stability and average power constraints. The online\nalgorithm is practical in the sense that the decisions for each time frame are\nmade without the assumption of knowing future channel conditions and data\narrivals. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic mixed integer\nnon-linear programming (MINLP) problem that jointly determines the binary\noffloading (each user computes the task either locally or at the edge server)\nand system resource allocation decisions in sequential time frames. To address\nthe coupling in the decisions of different time frames, we propose a novel\nframework, named LyDROO, that combines the advantages of Lyapunov optimization\nand deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, LyDROO first applies\nLyapunov optimization to decouple the multi-stage stochastic MINLP into\ndeterministic per-frame MINLP subproblems. By doing so, it guarantees to\nsatisfy all the long-term constraints by solving the per-frame subproblems that\nare much smaller in size.

For\nreliable communication, routing plays an important role, which establishes a\npath between source and destination on the basis of certain criteria.\nConventional routing protocols of FANET generally use a minimum hop count\ncriterion to find the best route between source and destination, which results\nin lower latency with the consideration that there is single source/destination\nnetwork environment.

To tackle the challenge\nof infinite design variables arising from the continuous-time UAV trajectory\noptimization, a commonly adopted approach is by approximating the UAV\ntrajectory with piecewise-linear path segments in three-dimensional (3D) space.\nHowever, this approach may still incur prohibitive computational complexity in\npractice when the UAV flight period/distance becomes long, as the distance\nbetween consecutive waypoints needs to be kept sufficiently small to retain\nhigh approximation accuracy. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose in\nthis paper a new and general framework for UAV trajectory and communication\nco-design. First, we propose a flexible path discretization scheme that\noptimizes only a number of selected waypoints (designable waypoints) along the\nUAV path for complexity reduction, while all the designable and non-designable\nwaypoints are used in calculating the approximated communication utility along\nthe UAV trajectory for ensuring high trajectory discretization accuracy. Next,\ngiven any number of designable waypoints, we propose a novel path compression\nscheme where the UAV 3D path is first decomposed into three one-dimensional\n(1D) sub-paths and each sub-path is then approximated by superimposing a number\nof selected basis paths weighted by their corresponding path coefficients, thus\nfurther reducing the path design complexity.

This enabled us to construct a framework called IDWork, which can\nbe used for categorising existing IoT fingerprinting mechanisms in a way that\nwill facilitate a coherent and fair comparison of these mechanisms. We found\nthat the majority of the IoT fingerprinting mechanisms take a passive approach\n-- mainly through network sniffing -- instead of being intrusive and\ninteractive with the device of interest. Additionally, a significant number of\nthe surveyed mechanisms employ both static and dynamic approaches, in order to\nbenefit from complementary features that can be more robust against certain\nattacks such as spoofing and replay attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:08:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Yadav", "Poonam", ""], ["Feraudo", "Angelo", ""], ["Arief", "Budi", ""], ["Shahandashti", "Siamak F.", ""], ["Vassilakis", "Vassilios G.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.08620", "submitter": "Jingfan Meng", "authors": "Jingfan Meng, Long Gong and Jun (Jim) Xu", "title": "Sliding-Window QPS (SW-QPS): A Perfect Parallel Iterative Switching\n  Algorithm for Input-Queued Switches", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in ACM Performance Evaluation\n  Review (PER)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we first propose a parallel batch switching algorithm called\nSmall-Batch Queue-Proportional Sampling (SB-QPS).

To keep up with these\nchallenges we have identified four main requirements that are common across\nmodern enterprise networks: (i) scalable mobility, (ii) endpoint segmentation,\n(iii) simplified administration, and (iv) resource optimization. To address\nthese challenges we designed SDA (Software Defined Access), a solution for\nmodern enterprise networks that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and\nother state of the art techniques. In this paper we present the design,\nimplementation and evaluation of SDA. Specifically, SDA: (i) leverages a\ncombination of an overlay approach with an event-driven protocol (LISP) to\ndynamically adapt to traffic and mobility patterns while preserving resources,\nand (ii) enforces dynamic endpoint groups for scalable segmentation with low\noperational burden. We present our experience with deploying SDA in two\nreal-life scenarios: an enterprise campus, and a large warehouse with mobile\nrobots. Our evaluation shows that SDA, when compared with traditional\nenterprise networks, can (i) reduce overall data plane forwarding state up to\n70% thanks to a reactive protocol using a centralized routing server, and (ii)\nreduce by an order of magnitude the handover delays in scenarios of massive\nmobility with respect to other approaches.
