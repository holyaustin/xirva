A distinct characteristic of these\nsystems is the fact that the nodes can harvest energy throughout the duration\nin which communication takes place.

In this paper, we consider\noptimization of point-to-point data transmission with an energy harvesting\ntransmitter which has a limited battery capacity, communicating in a wireless\nfading channel. We consider two objectives: maximizing the throughput by a\ndeadline, and minimizing the transmission completion time of the communication\nsession. We optimize these objectives by controlling the time sequence of\ntransmit powers subject to energy storage capacity and causality constraints.\nWe, first, study optimal offline policies. We introduce a directional\nwater-filling algorithm which provides a simple and concise interpretation of\nthe necessary optimality conditions. We show the optimality of an adaptive\ndirectional water-filling algorithm for the throughput maximization problem. We\nsolve the transmission completion time minimization problem by utilizing its\nequivalence to its throughput maximization counterpart. Next, we consider\nonline policies. We use stochastic dynamic programming to solve for the optimal\nonline policy that maximizes the average number of bits delivered by a deadline\nunder stochastic fading and energy arrival processes with causal channel state\nfeedback.

We\nuse data collected by means of a proximity-sensing network of wearable sensors\nthat we deployed at three different social gatherings, simultaneously involving\nseveral hundred individuals. We simulate a message spreading process over the\nrecorded proximity network, focusing on both the topological and the temporal\nproperties. We show that by using an appropriate technique to deal with the\ntemporal heterogeneity of proximity events, a universal statistical pattern\nemerges for the delivery times of messages, robust across all the data sets.\nOur results are useful to set constraints for generic processes of data\ndissemination, as well as to validate established models of human mobility and\nproximity that are frequently used to simulate realistic behaviors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 16:24:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Panisson", "Andr\u00e9", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""], ["Ruffo", "Giancarlo", ""], ["Schifanella", "Rossano", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6069", "submitter": "Harish Chintakunta", "authors": "Harish Chintakunta and Hamid Krim", "title": "Topological Fidelity in Sensor Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sensor Networks are inherently complex networks, and many of their associated\nproblems require analysis of some of their global characteristics. These are\nprimarily affected by the topology of the network. We present in this paper, a\ngeneral framework for a topological analysis of a network, and develop\ndistributed algorithms in a generalized combinatorial setting in order to solve\ntwo seemingly unrelated problems, 1) Coverage hole detection and Localization\nand 2) Worm hole attack detection and Localization. We also note these\nsolutions remain coordinate free as no priori localization information of the\nnodes is assumed. For the coverage hole problem, we follow a \"divide and\nconquer approach\", by strategically dissecting the network so that the overall\ntopology is preserved, while efficiently pursuing the detection and\nlocalization of failures. The detection of holes, is enabled by first\nattributing a combinatorial object called a \"Rips Complex\" to each network\nsegment, and by subsequently checking the existence/non-existence of holes by\nway of triviality of the first homology class of this complex. Our estimate\nexponentially approaches the location of potential holes with each iteration,\nyielding a very fast convergence coupled with optimal usage of valuable\nresources such as power and memory. We then show a simple extension of the\nabove problem to address a well known problem in networks, namely the\nlocalization of a worm hole attack. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\npresented algorithm with several substantiating examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2011 22:15:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Chintakunta", "Harish", ""], ["Krim", "Hamid", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6328", "submitter": "Jeong-woo Cho", "authors": "Jeong-woo Cho, Jean-Yves Le Boudec, Yuming Jiang", "title": "On the Asymptotic Validity of the Decoupling Assumption for Analyzing\n  802.11 MAC Protocol", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on\n  Information Theory", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2012.2208582", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Performance evaluation of the 802.11 MAC protocol is classically based on the\ndecoupling assumption, which hypothesizes that the backoff processes at\ndifferent nodes are independent. This decoupling assumption results from mean\nfield convergence and is generally true in transient regime in the asymptotic\nsense (when the number of wireless nodes tends to infinity), but, contrary to\nwidespread belief, may not necessarily hold in stationary regime. The issue is\noften related with the existence and uniqueness of a solution to a fixed point\nequation; however, it was also recently shown that this condition is not\nsufficient; in contrast, a sufficient condition is a global stability property\nof the associated ordinary differential equation. In this paper, we give a\nsimple condition that establishes the asymptotic validity of the decoupling\nassumption for the homogeneous case. We also discuss the heterogeneous and the\ndifferentiated service cases and formulate a new ordinary differential\nequation. We show that the uniqueness of a solution to the associated fixed\npoint equation is not sufficient; we exhibit one case where the fixed point\nequation has a unique solution but the decoupling assumption is not valid in\nthe asymptotic sense in stationary regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2011 18:29:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 19:04:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 00:20:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cho", "Jeong-woo", ""], ["Boudec", "Jean-Yves Le", ""], ["Jiang", "Yuming", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.6333", "submitter": "Kundan Singh", "authors": "Carol Davids, Alan Johnston, Kundan Singh, Henry Sinnreich and Wilhelm\n  Wimmreuter", "title": "SIP APIs for Voice and Video Communications on the Web", "comments": "Accepted at IPTcomm 2011, 7 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.MM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Existing standard protocols for the web and Internet telephony fail to\ndeliver real-time interactive communication from within a web browser. In\nparticular, the client-server web protocol over reliable TCP is not always\nsuitable for end-to-end low latency media path needed for interactive voice and\nvideo communication. To solve this, we compare the available platform options\nusing the existing technologies such as modifying the web programming language\nand protocol, using an existing web browser plugin, and a separate host\nresident application that the web browser can talk to. We argue that using a\nseparate application as an adaptor is a promising short term as well as\nlong-term strategy for voice and video communications on the web. Our project\naims at developing the open technology and sample implementations for web-based\nreal-time voice and video communication applications. We describe the\narchitecture of our project including (1) a RESTful web communication API over\nHTTP inspired by SIP message flows, (2) a web-friendly set of metadata for\nsession description, and (3) an UDP-based end-to-end media path. All other\ntelephony functions reside in the web application itself and/or in web feature\nservers. The adaptor approach allows us to easily add new voice and video\ncodecs and NAT traversal technologies such as Host Identity Protocol. We want\nto make web-based communication accessible to millions of web developers,\nmaximize the end user experience and security, and preserve the huge global\ninvestment in and experience from SIP systems while adhering to web standards\nand development tools as much as possible.
