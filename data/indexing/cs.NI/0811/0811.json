In reality, for any finite link SINR,\nthere is a non-zero probability of erroneous reception of the packet. We show\nthat in a large network, as the packet travels an asymptotically large number\nof hops from source to destination, the cumulative impact of packet losses over\nintermediate links results in a per-node throughput of only $O(\\frac{1}{n})$.\nWe then propose a new scheduling scheme to counter this effect. The proposed\nscheme provides tight guarantees on end-to-end packet loss probability, and\nimproves the per-node throughput to $\\Omega(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}\n({\\log{n}})^{\\frac{\\alpha{{+2}}}{2(\\alpha-2)}}})$ where $\\alpha>2$ is the path\nloss exponent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Nov 2008 17:24:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mhatre", "Vivek P.", ""], ["Rosenberg", "Catherine P.", ""], ["Mazumdar", "Ravi R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3712", "submitter": "Kui Wu", "authors": "Kui Wu, Yuming Jiang, Guoqiang Hu", "title": "Performance Modeling and Evaluation for Information-Driven Networks", "comments": "14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Information-driven networks include a large category of networking systems,\nwhere network nodes are aware of information delivered and thus can not only\nforward data packets but may also perform information processing.

This paper shows that convex optimization can\nminimize the WADT for P2P networks by equivalently minimizing the WADT for\nstrictly hierarchical networks of sub-peers. This paper then gives an upper\nbound for minimizing WADT by constructing a hierarchical P2P network, and lower\nbound by weakening the constraints of the convex problem.
