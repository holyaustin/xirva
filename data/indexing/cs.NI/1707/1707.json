However, these multipath schemes have not been widely\ndeployed in DCNs. We argue that two key factors among others impeded their\nadoption: TCP incast and minimum window syndrome. First, these mechanisms are\nill-suited for workloads with a many-to-one communication pattern, commonly\nfound in DCNs, causing frequent TCP incast collapses. Second, the syndrome we\ndiscover for the first time, results in 2-5 times lower throughput for\nsingle-path flows than multipath flows, thus severely violating network\nfairness.\n  To effectively tackle these problems, we propose AMP: an adaptive multipath\ncongestion control mechanism that quickly detects the onset of these problems\nand transforms its multipath flow into a single-path flow. Once these problems\ndisappear, AMP safely reverses this transformation and continues its data\ntransmission via multiple paths. Our evaluation results under a diverse set of\nscenarios in a fat-tree topology with realistic workloads demonstrate that AMP\nis robust to the TCP incast problem and improves network fairness between\nmultipath and single-path flows significantly with little performance loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jul 2017 16:56:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 14:08:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 17 Mar 2019 12:45:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kheirkhah", "Morteza", ""], ["Lee", "Myungjin", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.00513", "submitter": "Chao Zhang", "authors": "Chao Zhang, Vineeth Varma, Samson Lasaulce, Raphael Visoz", "title": "Interference Coordination via Power Domain Channel Estimation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A novel technique is proposed which enables each transmitter to acquire\nglobal channel state information (CSI) from the sole knowledge of individual\nreceived signal power measurements, which makes dedicated feedback or\ninter-transmitter signaling channels unnecessary.

The main contributions of our paper\nare to 1) use RL to solve performance tuning problems in an indoor cellular\nnetwork for voice bearers and 2) show that our derived lower bound loss in\neffective signal to interference plus noise ratio due to neighboring cell\nfailure is sufficient for VoLTE power control purposes in practical cellular\nnetworks. In our simulation, the proposed RL-based power control algorithm\nsignificantly improves both voice retainability and mean opinion score compared\nto current industry standards. The improvement is due to maintaining an\neffective downlink signal to interference plus noise ratio against adverse\nnetwork operational issues and faults.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 02:30:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jan 2018 23:43:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 21:17:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 5 Mar 2018 14:44:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 22:03:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2018 21:16:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mismar", "Faris B.", ""], ["Evans", "Brian L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.03290", "submitter": "Pavel Loskot", "authors": "Salman M.

Each incoming task is irrevocably assigned to\nwhichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where it\nappears and its neighbors in $G_N$. Tasks have unit-mean exponential service\ntimes and leave the system upon service completion.\n  The above model has been extensively investigated in the case $G_N$ is a\nclique. Since the servers are exchangeable in that case, the queue length\nprocess is quite tractable, and it has been proved that for any $\\lambda < 1$,\nthe fraction of servers with two or more tasks vanishes in the limit as $N \\to\n\\infty$. For an arbitrary graph $G_N$, the lack of exchangeability severely\ncomplicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than\nfor a clique. Accordingly, a graph $G_N$ is said to be $N$-optimal or\n$\\sqrt{N}$-optimal when the occupancy process on $G_N$ is equivalent to that on\na clique on an $N$-scale or $\\sqrt{N}$-scale, respectively.\n  We prove that if $G_N$ is an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random graph with average\ndegree $d(N)$, then it is with high probability $N$-optimal and\n$\\sqrt{N}$-optimal if $d(N) \\to \\infty$ and $d(N) / (\\sqrt{N} \\log(N)) \\to\n\\infty$ as $N \\to \\infty$, respectively. This demonstrates that optimality can\nbe maintained at $N$-scale and $\\sqrt{N}$-scale while reducing the number of\nconnections by nearly a factor $N$ and $\\sqrt{N} / \\log(N)$ compared to a\nclique, provided the topology is suitably random. It is further shown that if\n$G_N$ contains $\\Theta(N)$ bounded-degree nodes, then it cannot be $N$-optimal.\nIn addition, we establish that an arbitrary graph $G_N$ is $N$-optimal when its\nminimum degree is $N - o(N)$, and may not be $N$-optimal even when its minimum\ndegree is $c N + o(N)$ for any $0 < c < 1/2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 21:30:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Apr 2019 16:06:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mukherjee", "Debankur", ""], ["Borst", "Sem C.", ""], ["van Leeuwaarden", "Johan S.

The problem is\nformulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the\nplayers that seek to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function\nthat captures each MTD's energy consumption and time-varying queue length.\nWithin each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends the access\nrequests of the coalition members over the RACH.

HEPs are designed for a wide\nspectrum of notable applications (e.g., missing detection) without need to\ncollect all tags. HEPs assume that each tag contains a hash function, such that\na tag can select a random but predicable time slot to reply with a one-bit\npresence signal that shows its existence. However, the hash function has never\nbeen implemented in COTS tags in reality, which makes HEPs a 10-year\nuntouchable mirage. This work designs and implements a group of analog on-tag\nhash primitives (called Tash) for COTS Gen2-compatible RFID systems, which\nmoves prior HEPs forward from theory to practice. In particular, we design\nthree types of hash primitives, namely, tash function, tash table function and\ntash operator. All of these hash primitives are implemented through selective\nreading, which is a fundamental and mandatory functionality specified in Gen2\nprotocol, without any hardware modification and fabrication.
