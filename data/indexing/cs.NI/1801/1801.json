First, a send operation performed by\na node delivers copies of the same message to all directly reachable nodes.\nSecondly, a node can successfully receive an incoming message only if exactly\none of its neighbors sent a message in that step. It is this semantics of how\nports at nodes send and receive messages that defines the networks rather than\nthe fact that only radio waves are used as a medium of communication; but if\nthat is the case then just a single frequency is used. We discuss algorithmic\naspects of exchanging information in such networks, concentrating on\ndistributed randomized protocols. Specific problems and solutions depend a lot\non the topology of the underlying reachability graph and how much the nodes\nknow about it. In single-hop networks each pair of nodes can communicate\ndirectly. This kind of networks is also known as the multiple access channel.\nPopular broadcasting protocols used on such channels are Aloha and the\nexponential backoff. Multi-hop networks may have arbitrary topology and packets\nneed to be routed hopping through a sequence of adjacent nodes. Distributed\nprotocols run by such networks are usually robust enough not to expect the\nnodes to know their neighbors. These ad-hoc networks and protocols model the\nsituation when nodes are mobile and do not rely on a fixed infrastructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Dec 2017 02:24:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chlebus", "Bogdan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.00095", "submitter": "Xin Wang", "authors": "Xin Wang, Yinlong Xu, Richard T.

We study the optimal peering schemes for the IAP, i.e.,\nto offer CPs both the paid and settlement-free peering to choose from or only\none of them, as the objective is profit or welfare maximization. Our results\nshow that 1) the IAP should always offer the paid and settlement-free peering\nunder the profit-optimal and welfare-optimal schemes, respectively, 2) whether\nto simultaneously offer the other peering type is largely driven by the type of\ndata traffic, e.g., text or video, and 3) regulators might want to encourage\nthe IAP to allocate more network capacity to the settlement-free peering for\nincreasing user welfare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Dec 2017 07:44:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Xu", "Yinlong", ""], ["Ma", "Richard T.

Simultaneous access of multiple interfaces can\nsignificantly improve the users' quality of experience (QoE) in video\nstreaming.

We formulate the\nquality decisions of video chunks subject to the available bandwidth of the\ndifferent paths, chunk deadlines, and link preferences as an optimization\nproblem. The objective is to to optimize a QoE metric that maintains a tradeoff\nbetween maximizing the playback rate of every chunk and ensuring fairness among\nchunks. The QoE is a weighted some of the following metrics: skip/stall\nduration, average playback rate, and quality switching rate.

This\npaper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear\noptimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received\ndata symbols.

To overcome this issue, Vehicular Ad Hoc\nNetwork (VANET) has come up with lot of novel ideas such as vehicular\ncommunication, navigation and traffic controlling. In this study, the main\nfocus is on congestion control at the intersections which result from unclear\nahead. For this purpose, a city lane and intersection model has been proposed\nto manage vehicle mobility. It shows the actual vehicle to vehicle and vehicle\nto traffic infrastructure communication. The experiment was conducted using\nNetwork Simulator 2 (NS 2). The implementation required modelling the road side\nunit, traffic control unit, and on-board unit along the roadside. In the\nsimulation, including traffic volume, the distance between two signals,\nend-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio, throughput and packet lost were taken\ninto consideration. These parameters ensure efficient communication between the\ntraffic signals. This results in improved congestion control and road safety,\nsince the vehicles will be signalled not to enter the junction box and\ninformation about other vehicles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 09:15:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Ruchin", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.06449", "submitter": "Yanxiang Jiang", "authors": "Yanxiang Jiang, Miaoli Ma, Mehdi Bennis, Fu-Chun Zheng, Xiaohu You", "title": "User Preference Learning Based Edge Caching for Fog Radio Access Network", "comments": "16 pages, 9 figures.

Besides their known\nbenefits, microservice architecture also enables to mix and match cloud\napplications and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) services (service\nchains), which are composed of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). Provisioning\ncomplex services containing VNFs and microservices in a combined NFV/cloud\nplatform can enhance service quality and optimise cost. Such a platform can be\nbased on the multi-cloud concept. However, current multi-cloud solutions do not\nsupport NFV requirements, making them inadequate to support complex services.\nIn this paper, we investigate these challenges and propose a solution for\njointly managing and orchestrating microservices and virtual network functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jan 2018 13:55:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kouchaksaraei", "Hadi Razzaghi", ""], ["Karl", "Holger", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10094", "submitter": "Robert Gardner Jr.", "authors": "James Zhang, Ilija Vukotic, Robert Gardner", "title": "Anomaly detection in wide area network mesh using two machine learning\n  anomaly detection algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Anomaly detection is the practice of identifying items or events that do not\nconform to an expected behavior or do not correlate with other items in a\ndataset.

We formulate the wireless LAN offloading problem\nas a finite-horizon discrete-time Markov decision process (MDP) and establish\nan optimal policy by a dynamic programming based algorithm. Since the time\ncomplexity of the dynamic programming based offloading algorithm is still high,\nwe propose a low time complexity heuristic offloading algorithm with\nperformance sacrifice.

In this paper, the problem of network\nslicing is studied in the context of a wireless system having a time-varying\nnumber of users that require two types of slices: reliable low latency (RLL)\nand self-managed (capacity limited) slices. To address this problem, a novel\ncontrol framework for stochastic optimization is proposed based on the Lyapunov\ndrift-plus-penalty method. This new framework enables the system to minimize\npower, maintain slice isolation, and provide reliable and low latency\nend-to-end communication for RLL slices.
