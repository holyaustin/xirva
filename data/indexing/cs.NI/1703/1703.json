In this paper we\npresent a measurement based analysis of multilink shadowing effects in a V2V\ncommunication system with cars as blocking objects. In particular we analyze,\ncharacterize and model the large scale fading, both regarding the\nautocorrelation and the joint multilink cross-correlation process, for\ncommunication at 5.9 GHz between four cars in a highway convoy scenario. The\nresults show that it is essential to separate the instantaneous propagation\ncondition into line-of-sight (LOS) and obstructed LOS (OLOS), by other cars,\nand then apply an appropriate pathloss model for each of the two cases. The\nchoice of the pathloss model not only influences the autocorrelation but also\nchanges the cross-correlation of the large scale fading process between\ndifferent links.

In this ultra-dense edge\ncaching network (UDCN), SBS-user distances shrink, and each user can request a\ncached content from multiple SBSs. Unfortunately, the complexity of existing\ncaching controls' mechanisms increases with the number of SBSs, making them\ninapplicable for solving the fundamental caching problem: How to maximize local\ncaching gain while minimizing the replicated content caching? Furthermore,\nspatial dynamics of interference is no longer negligible in UDCNs due to the\nsurge in interference. In addition, the caching control should consider\ntemporal dynamics of user demands. To overcome such difficulties, we propose a\nnovel caching algorithm weaving together notions of mean-field game theory and\nstochastic geometry. These enable our caching algorithm to become independent\nof the number of SBSs and users, while incorporating spatial interference\ndynamics as well as temporal dynamics of content popularity and storage\nconstraints. Numerical evaluation validates the fact that the proposed\nalgorithm reduces not only the long run average cost by at least 24% but also\nthe number of replicated content by 56% compared to a popularity-based\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 05:05:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Hyesung", ""], ["Park", "Jihong", ""], ["Bennis", "Mehdi", ""], ["Kim", "Seong-Lyun", ""], ["Debbah", "M\u00e9rouane", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01065", "submitter": "Jieqiong Chen", "authors": "Jieqiong Chen, Guoqiang Mao", "title": "On the Security of Warning Message Dissemination in Vehicular Ad Hoc\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Communications and Information Networks, Vol.2, No.2,\n  Jun. 2017", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Information security is an important issue in vehicular networks as the\naccuracy and integrity of information is a prerequisite to satisfactory\nperformance of almost all vehicular network applications.

This theoretical framework consists of\ni) a queuing network to model the vMME in a data center, and ii) analytic\nexpressions to estimate the overall mean system delay and the signaling\nworkload to be processed by the vMME. We validate our mathematical model by\nsimulation. One direct use of the proposed model is vMME dimensioning, i.e., to\ncompute the number of vMME processing instances to provide a target system\ndelay given the number of users in the system. Additionally, the paper includes\na scalability analysis of the system. In our study, we consider the billing\nmodel and a data center setup of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service, and\nestimate experimentally the processing time of MME processing instances for\ndifferent LTE control procedures. For the considered setup, our results show\nthat a vMME is scalable for signaling workloads up to 37000 LTE control\nprocedures per second for a target mean system delay of 1 ms.

To this end, two frequency reuse schemes are considered:\nuser-specific frequency reuse (FRu) and BS-specific frequency reuse (FRb). For\na given unit frequency channel, FRu reduces the number of serving user\nequipments (UEs), whereas FRb directly decreases the number of interfering base\nstations (BSs). This increases the distance from the interfering BSs and the\nsignal-to-interference ratio (SIR) attains ultra-reliability, e.g. 99% SIR\ncoverage at a randomly picked UE. The ultra-reliability is, however, achieved\nat the cost of the reduced frequency allocation, which may degrade overall\ndownlink rate. To fairly capture this reliability-rate tradeoff, we propose\nubiquitous rate defined as the maximum downlink rate whose required SIR can be\nachieved with ultra-reliability.

A unique characteristic of this\nproblem is the tradeoff between sufficient indoor coverage and limited outdoor\nleakage, which has to be met without explicit knowledge of the environment. In\nthis paper, we address the small base station (SBS) transmit power assignment\nproblem based on stochastic bandit theory. Unlike existing solutions that rely\non heavy involvement of RF engineers surveying the target area, we take\nadvantage of the human user behavior with simple coverage feedback in the\nnetwork, and thus significantly reduce the planned human measurement. In\naddition, the proposed power assignment algorithms follow the Bayesian\nprinciple to utilize the available prior knowledge from system self\nconfiguration. To guarantee good performance when the prior knowledge is\ninsufficient, we incorporate the performance correlation among similar power\nvalues, and establish an algorithm that exploits the correlation structure to\nrecover majority of the degraded performance. Furthermore, we explicitly\nconsider power switching penalties in order to discourage frequent changes of\nthe transmit power, which cause varying coverage and uneven user experience.\nComprehensive system-level simulations are performed for both single and\nmultiple SBS deployment scenarios, and the resulting power settings are\ncompared to the state-of-the-art solutions. Significant performance gains of\nthe proposed algorithms are observed. Particularly, the correlation structure\nenables the algorithm to converge much faster to the optimal long-term power\nthan other methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 11:46:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhiyang", ""], ["Shen", "Cong", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06060", "submitter": "Jie Xu", "authors": "Jie Xu, Lixing Chen, Shaolei Ren", "title": "Online Learning for Offloading and Autoscaling in Energy Harvesting\n  Mobile Edge Computing", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1701.01090 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobile edge computing (a.k.a. fog computing) has recently emerged to enable\nin-situ processing of delay-sensitive applications at the edge of mobile\nnetworks.

As a new\nclass of DDoS attacks, Link-flooding attack (LFA) disrupts connectivity between\nlegitimate IoT devices and target servers by flooding only a small number of\nlinks.

The fact behind Linkbait is that adversaries\nrely on the set of key links impacting the network connectivity (i.e.,linkmap)\nto identify target links. Linkbait mitigates the attacks by interfering with\nlinkmap discovery and providing a fake linkmap to adversaries. Inspired by\nmoving target defense (MTD), we propose a link obfuscation algorithm in\nLinkbait that selectively reroutes probing flows to hide target links from\nadversaries and mislead them to identify bait links as target links. By\nproviding the faked linkmap to adversaries, Linkbait can actively mitigate LFA\nfor IoT even without identifying compromised IoT devices while not affecting\nflows from legitimate IoT devices.
