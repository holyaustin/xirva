A cloud, also commonly known as a cloud network,\ntypically comprises of hardware (network of servers) and a collection of\nsoftwares that is made available to end-users in a pay-as-you-go manner.\nMultiple public cloud providers (ex., Amazon) co-existing in a cloud computing\nmarket provide similar services (software as a service) to its clients, both in\nterms of the nature of an application, as well as in quality of service (QoS)\nprovision. The decision of whether a cloud hosts (or finds it profitable to\nhost) a service in the long-term would depend jointly on the price it sets, the\nQoS guarantees it provides to its customers, and the satisfaction of the\nadvertised guarantees. In this paper, we devise and analyze three\ninter-organizational economic models relevant to cloud networks. We formulate\nour problems as non co-operative price and QoS games between multiple cloud\nproviders existing in a cloud market. We prove that a unique pure strategy Nash\nequilibrium (NE) exists in two of the three models. Our analysis paves the path\nfor each cloud provider to 1) know what prices and QoS level to set for\nend-users of a given service type, such that the provider could exist in the\ncloud market, and 2) practically and dynamically provision appropriate capacity\nfor satisfying advertised QoS guarantees.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 22:43:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Pal", "Ranjan", ""], ["Hui", "Pan", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0116", "submitter": "Remous-Aris Koutsiamanis", "authors": "Remous-Aris Koutsiamanis, Pavlos S.

Furthermore, using the game's potential\nproperty, we derive a modified version of the replicator dynamics of\nevolutionary game theory which applies to this continuous game, and we show\nthat if the network's users employ a distributed learning scheme based on these\ndynamics, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially quickly. On the other\nhand, a major challenge occurs if the channels do not remain static but\nfluctuate stochastically over time, following a stationary ergodic process. In\nthat case, the associated ergodic game still admits a unique equilibrium, but\nthe learning analysis becomes much more complicated because the replicator\ndynamics are no longer deterministic. Nonetheless, by employing results from\nthe theory of stochastic approximation, we show that users still converge to\nthe game's unique equilibrium.\n  Our analysis hinges on a game-theoretical result which is of independent\ninterest: in finite player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex\npotential function, the replicator dynamics (suitably modified to account for\nnonlinear payoffs) converge to an eps-neighborhood of an equilibrium at time of\norder O(log(1/eps)).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2011 00:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Nov 2011 13:34:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mertikopoulos", "Panayotis", ""], ["Belmega", "Elena V.", ""], ["Moustakas", "Aris L.", ""], ["Lasaulce", "Samson", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3616", "submitter": "Mehmet Karaca", "authors": "Nursen Aydin, Mehmet Karaca, Ozgur Ercetin", "title": "Energy-Optimal Scheduling in Low Duty Cycle Sensor Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.SY math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Energy consumption of a wireless sensor node mainly depends on the amount of\ntime the node spends in each of the high power active (e.g., transmit, receive)\nand low power sleep modes.

We use flow allocation as an example to see how this\napproach can manage the bandwidth use in a distributed manner. The focus is on\nhow to assign components of a network to the controllers so that (1) each\ncontroller only need to look after a small part of the network but (2) there is\nat least one controller that can answer any request. We outline a way to\nconfigure the controllers to fulfill these requirements as a proof that the use\nof devolved controllers is possible.

We propose two metrics for measuring the\nreliability of wireless mesh routing topologies, one for flooding and one for\nunicast routing. The Flooding Path Probability (FPP) metric measures the\nend-to-end packet delivery probability when each node broadcasts a packet after\nhearing from all its upstream neighbors. The Unicast Retransmission Flow (URF)\nmetric measures the end-to-end packet delivery probability when a relay node\nretransmits a unicast packet on its outgoing links until it receives an\nacknowledgement or it tries all the links. Both metrics rely on specific packet\nforwarding models, rather than heuristics, to derive explicit expressions of\nthe end-to-end packet delivery probability from individual link probabilities\nand the underlying connectivity graph.\n  We also propose a distributed, greedy algorithm that uses the URF metric to\nconstruct a reliable routing topology. This algorithm constructs a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG) from a weighted, undirected connectivity graph, where each\nlink is weighted by its success probability. The algorithm uses a vector of\ndecreasing reliability thresholds to coordinate when nodes can join the routing\ntopology. Simulations demonstrate that, on average, this algorithm constructs a\nmore reliable topology than the usual minimum hop DAG.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:23:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Phoebus", ""], ["Johansson", "Karl H.", ""], ["Balister", "Paul", ""], ["Bollob\u00e1s", "B\u00e9la", ""], ["Sastry", "Shankar", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.6049", "submitter": "Kamal Al-Bawani", "authors": "Kamal Al-Bawani, Alexander Souza", "title": "Buffer Overflow Management with Class Segregation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a new model for buffer management of network switches with\nQuality of Service (QoS) requirements.

The switch is equipped with\nmultiple queues of limited capacities, where each queue stores packets of one\nvalue only. The objective is to maximize the total value of the transmitted\npackets (i.e., the weighted throughput).\n  We analyze a natural greedy algorithm, GREEDY, which sends in each time step\na packet with the greatest value.
