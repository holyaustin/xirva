A key benefit of our architecture\nis its ability to accommodate gradual migration from the current IP\ninfrastructure to a future that may be a ubiquitous Information Centric\nNetwork. Basic building blocks of Internames are: i) a name-based Application\nProgramming Interface; ii) a separation of identifiers (names) and locators;\niii) a powerful Name Resolution Service (NRS) that dynamically maps names to\nlocators, as a function of time/location/context/service; iv) a built-in\ncapacity of evolution, allowing a transparent migration from current networks\nand the ability to include as particular cases current specific architectures.\nTo achieve this vision, shared by many other researchers, we exploit and expand\non Information Centric Networking principles, extending ICN functionality\nbeyond content retrieval, easing send-to-name and push services, and allowing\nto use names also to route data in the return path. A key role in this\narchitecture is played by the NRS, which allows for the co-existence of\nmultiple network \"realms\", including current IP and non-IP networks, glued\ntogether by a name-to-name overarching communication primitive.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 09:05:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Melazzi", "Nicola Blefari", ""], ["Detti", "Andrea", ""], ["Arumaithurai", "Mayutan", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "K.

The theme of the MANIAC Challenge 2013 was ``Mobile Data\nOffloading,'' and consisted on developing and comparatively evaluating\nstrategies to offload infrastructure access points via customer ad hoc\nforwarding using handheld devices (e.g., tablets and smartphones). According to\nthe challenge rules, a hop-by-hop bidding contest (or ``auction'') should\ndecide the path of each data packet towards its destination. Consequently, each\nteam should rely on other teams' willingness to forward packets for them in\norder to get their traffic across the network. In this application scenario,\nthe incentive for customers to join the ad hoc network is discounted monthly\nfees, while operators should benefit from decreased infrastructure costs.\nFollowing the rules of MANIAC Challenge 2013, this paper proposes a strategy\nthat is based on the concept of how ``tight'' a node is to successfully deliver\na packet to its destination within a given deadline. This ``tightness'' idea\nrelies on a shortest-path analysis of the underlying network graph, and it is\nused to define three sub-strategies that specify a) how to participate in an\nauction; b) how to announce an auction; and c) how to decide who wins the\nannounced auction. The proposed strategy seeks to minimize network resource\nutilization and to promote cooperative behavior among participant nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 16:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kalejaiye", "Gabriel B.

We develop a new framework\nfor wireless algorithms in which distance-based path loss is replaced by an\narbitrary gain matrix, typically obtained by measurements of received signal\nstrength (RSS). Gain matrices allow for the modeling of complex environments,\ne.g., with obstacles and walls. We experimentally evaluate the framework in two\nindoors testbeds with 20 and 60 motes, and confirm superior predictive\nperformance in packet reception rate for a gain matrix model over a geometric\ndistance-based model.\n  At the heart of our approach is a new parameter $\\zeta$ called metricity\nwhich indicates how close the gain matrix is to a distance metric, effectively\nmeasuring the complexity of the environment. A powerful theoretical feature of\nthis parameter is that all known SINR scheduling algorithms that work in\ngeneral metric spaces carry over to arbitrary gain matrices and achieve\nequivalent performance guarantees in terms of $\\zeta$ as previously obtained in\nterms of the path loss constant. Our experiments confirm the sensitivity of\n$\\zeta$ to the nature of the environment.

We propose novel\nmodelling techniques to minimize the daily energy consumption of IP networks,\nwhile explicitly guaranteeing, in addition to typical QoS requirements, both\nnetwork survivability and robustness to traffic variations. The impact of such\nlimitations on final network consumption is exhaustively investigated. Daily\ntraffic variations are modelled by dividing a single day into multiple time\nintervals (multi-period problem), and network consumption is reduced by putting\nto sleep idle line cards and chassis. To preserve network resiliency we\nconsider two different protection schemes, i.e. dedicated and shared\nprotection, according to which a backup path is assigned to each demand and a\ncertain amount of spare capacity has to be available on each link. Robustness\nto traffic variations is provided by means of a specific modelling framework\nthat allows to tune the conservatism degree of the solutions and to take into\naccount load variations of different magnitude.

This paper complements previous efforts in\nthroughput maximization and delay minimization for P2P streaming by considering\nthe consequences of playout smoothing on the scheduling mechanisms for stream\nlayer acquisition. The two main problems to be considered when designing a\nplayout smoothing mechanism for P2P streaming are the fluctuation in available\nbandwidth between peers and the unreliability of user-contributed\nresources--particularly peer churn.

We determine that the\ncauses of previous misprediction are common analytical assumptions and the\npotential occurrence of a transitory phase, that we show to be of extremely\nlong duration under certain circumstances. We also provide techniques, both\nanalytical and experimental, to correctly predict long-term behaviour and\nanalyse the effect of specific Homeplug/IEEE 1901 features on the magnitude of\nmisprediction errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 11:04:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Oct 2014 10:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cano", "Cristina", ""], ["Malone", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7002", "submitter": "Matthew Wright PhD", "authors": "Nabila Rahman, Matthew Wright, Donggang Liu", "title": "Fast and energy-efficient technique for jammed region mapping in\n  wireless sensor networks", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have great practical importance for\nsurveillance systems to perform monitoring by acquiring and sending information\non any intrusion in a secured area.

Based\non this analysis, we try to answer the fundamental question: can we dispense\nwith SUs cooperation and still achieve an arbitrary diversity gain? It is shown\nthat this is indeed possible via a novel technique that can offer diversity\ngain for a single SU using a single antenna. The technique is based on the\nusage of a reconfigurable antenna that changes its propagation characteristics\nover time, thus creating an artificial temporal diversity. It is shown that the\nusage of reconfigurable antennas outperforms cooperative as well as\nnon-cooperative schemes at low and high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs).\nMoreover, if the channel state information is available at the SU, an\nadditional SNR gain can also be achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 09:18:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Alaa", "Ahmed M.", ""], ["Ismail", "Mahmoud H.", ""], ["Tawfik", "Hazim", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7944", "submitter": "Fragkiskos Papadopoulos", "authors": "Constantinos Psomas, Fragkiskos Papadopoulos", "title": "Performance Rescaling of Complex Networks", "comments": "To appear in IEEE Communications Letters", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Letters, Vol. 18, Issue 4, pp. 684-687, 2014", "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2014.021014.132684", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cond-mat.stat-mech cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent progress in network topology modeling [1], [2] has shown that it is\npossible to create smaller-scale replicas of large complex networks, like the\nInternet, while simultaneously preserving several important topological\nproperties.

A fault in network degrades\nits performance by affecting parameters like throughput, delay, latency,\nreliability etc. In hierarchical network models any possibility of fault may\ncollapse entire network. If a fault occurrence disables a device in\nhierarchical network then it may distresses all the devices underneath. Thus it\naffects entire networks performance.

(ii) Each TCP packet is randomly dropped\nwith probability p; independently of previous drops or any other\nevent/parameter.

The contributions of the\npresent work are the following: (a) We determine three regimes, and their\nconditions of applicability, depending on p: Linear law regime, square root law\nregime, and timeout regime. (b) As concerns the relationship between the linear\nand square root regimes, we give additional insights relatively to previously\npublished work. (c) We give the exact equations governing the TCP send rate in\nany regime. (d) From the exact equation and under the further condition that\nthe path is not saturated, we give and discuss approximations for the send rate\nof the NewReno variant of TCP.
