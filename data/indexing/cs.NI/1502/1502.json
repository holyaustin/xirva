There exists a trade-off of optimizing the average\nor maximum TTR in the CH rendezvous protocol design.

The results from our study show that the sensors are\ncapable of detecting the cause of errors as translational or rotational\nmovements. Furthermore it is also shown that the sensor data can be used to\npredict the next location of the user. This can be used to reconfigure the\ndirectional antenna to switch the antenna beam directions and hence avoid\nfrequent link disruptions. This decreases the number of beam searches thus\nlowering the MAC overhead.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 16:48:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 14:19:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Doff", "A.

In this paper, we propose to allocate the multi-operator D2D\ncommunication over dedicated cellular spectral resources contributed from both\noperators. Ideally, the operators should negotiate about the amount of spectrum\nto contribute, without revealing proprietary information to each other and/or\nto other parties. One possible way to do that is to use the sequence of\noperators' best responses, i.e., the operators make offers about the amount of\nspectrum to contribute using a sequential updating procedure until reaching\nconsensus. Besides spectrum allocation, we need a mode selection scheme for the\nmulti-operator D2D users. We use a stochastic geometry framework to capture the\nimpact of mode selection on the distribution of D2D users and assess the\nperformance of the best response iteration algorithm. With the performance\nmetrics considered in the paper, we show that the best response iteration has a\nunique Nash equilibrium that can be reached from any initial strategy.

In most real-world applications, even though the\nenvironment is 3D, the grounded sensor nodes are usually deployed on 2D planar\nsurfaces. Examples of these surfaces include structures seen in both indoor\n(e.g. floors, doors, walls, tables etc.) and outdoor (e.g. mountains, valleys,\nhills etc.) environments. In such environments, sensor nodes typically appear\nas coplanar node clusters. We refer to this type of a deployment as a planar\ndeployment. When there is a planar deployment, the coplanarity causes\ndifficulties to the traditional range-based multilateration algorithms because\na node cannot be unambiguously localized if the distance measurements to that\nnode are from coplanar nodes. Thus, many already localized groups of nodes are\nrendered ineffective in the process just because they are coplanar. We,\ntherefore propose an algorithm called Coplanarity Based Localization (CBL) that\ncan be used as an extension of any localization algorithm to avoid most flips\ncaused by coplanarity. CBL first performs a 2D localization among the nodes\nthat are clustered on the same surface, and then finds the positions of these\nclusters in 3D. We have carried out experiments using trilateration for 2D\nlocalization, and quadrilateration for 3D localization, and experimentally\nverified that exploiting the clustering information leads to a more precise\nlocalization than mere quadrilateration. We also propose a heuristic to extract\nthe clustering information in case it is not available, which is yet to be\nimproved in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 23:30:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Mar 2015 14:53:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cagirici", "Onur", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07809", "submitter": "Xueying Guo", "authors": "Xueying Guo, Rahul Singh, P.R.

As a result, we propose a monotone DAWN algorithm that approximately\nsolves the general offloading problem, and has a much lower computational\ncomplexity comparing to the optimal algorithm.
