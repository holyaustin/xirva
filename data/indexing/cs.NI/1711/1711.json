Moreover, users are entering with a given time\nstatistics, for example described by inter-arrival times. In this context we\npropose scanning strategies for IA that take into account the entrance\nstatistics. In particular, we propose two approaches: a memory-less random\nillumination (MLRI) algorithm and a statistic and memory-based illumination\n(SMBI) algorithm. The MLRI algorithm scans a random sector in each slot, based\non the statistics of sector entrance, without memory. The SMBI algorithm\ninstead scans sectors in a deterministic sequence selected according to the\nstatistics of sector entrance and time of entrance, and taking into account the\nfact that the user has not yet been discovered (thus including memory). We\nassess the performance of the proposed methods in terms of average discovery\ntime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Nov 2017 08:54:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Soleimani", "Hossein", ""], ["Parada", "Ra\u00f9l", ""], ["Tomasin", "Stefano", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.05581", "submitter": "Romain Jacob", "authors": "Romain Jacob, Licong Zhang, Marco Zimmerling, Jan Beutel, Samarjit\n  Chakraborty, Lothar Thiele", "title": "TTW: A Time-Triggered-Wireless Design for CPS [ Extended version ]", "comments": "13 pages, 8 figures.

To this end,\nF-RAN utilizes caches at the edge nodes (ENs) and fronthaul links connecting a\ncloud processor to ENs. Assuming time-invariant content popularity, existing\ninformation-theoretic analyses of content delivery in F-RANs rely on offline\ncaching with separate content placement and delivery phases. In contrast, this\nwork focuses on the scenario in which the set of popular content is\ntime-varying, hence necessitating the online replenishment of the ENs' caches\nalong with the delivery of the requested files. The analysis is centered on the\ncharacterization of the long-term Normalized Delivery Time (NDT), which\ncaptures the temporal dependence of the coding latencies accrued across\nmultiple time slots in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. Online edge\ncaching and delivery schemes are investigated for both serial and pipelined\ntransmission modes across fronthaul and edge segments. Analytical results\ndemonstrate that, in the presence of a time-varying content popularity, the\nrate of fronthaul links sets a fundamental limit to the long-term NDT of F- RAN\nsystem.

The tradeoff is between energy efficiency,\nwhich decreases with the number of active sensors, and fidelity, which\nincreases with the number of active sensors. The problem of minimizing the\ntime-averaged mean-squared error over infinite horizon is examined under the\nconstraint of the mean number of active sensors. The proposed methods artfully\ncombine three key ingredients: Gibbs sampling, stochastic approximation for\nlearning, and modifications to consensus algorithms to create a high\nperformance, energy efficient tracking mechanisms with active sensor selection.\nThe following progression of scenarios are considered: centralized tracking of\nan i.i.d. process; distributed tracking of an i.i.d. process and finally\ndistributed tracking of a Markov chain. The challenge of the i.i.d. case is\nthat the process has a distribution parameterized by a known or unknown\nparameter which must be learned. The key theoretical results prove that the\nproposed algorithms converge to local optima for the two i.i.d process cases;\nnumerical results suggest that global optimality is in fact achieved. The\nproposed distributed tracking algorithm for a Markov chain, based on\nKalman-consensus filtering and stochastic approximation, is seen to offer an\nerror performance comparable to that of a competetive centralized Kalman\nfilter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 23:19:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chattopadhyay", "Arpan", ""], ["Mitra", "Urbashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.10651", "submitter": "Mhafuzul Islam", "authors": "Mhafuzul Islam, Mashrur Chowdhury, Hongda Li, Hongxin Hu", "title": "Cybersecurity Attacks in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Applications\n  and their Prevention", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures, Will be published in the \"2018 Transportation\n  Research Board Conference Proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.CR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A connected vehicle (CV) environment is composed of a diverse data\ncollection, data communication and dissemination, and computing infrastructure\nsystems that are vulnerable to the same cyberattacks as all traditional\ncomputing environments.

As cyberattacks can lead to severe traffic incidents, it has\nbecome one of the primary concerns in connected vehicle applications. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of cyberattacks on the\nvehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) network from a V2I application point of view.\nThen, we develop a novel V2I cybersecurity architecture, named CVGuard, which\ncan detect and prevent cyberattacks on the V2I environment. In designing\nCVGuard, key challenges, such as scalability, resiliency and future usability\nwere considered. A case study using a distributed denial of service (DDoS) on a\nV2I application, i.e., the Stop Sign Gap Assist (SSGA) application, shows that\nCVGuard was effective in mitigating the adverse effects created by a DDoS\nattack. In our case study, because of the DDoS attack, conflicts between the\nminor and major road vehicles occurred in an unsignalized intersection, which\ncould have caused potential crashes. A reduction of conflicts between vehicles\noccurred because CVGuard was in operation. The reduction of conflicts was\ncompared based on the number of conflicts before and after the implementation\nand operation of the CVGuard security platform.

To deal with the problem of such incomparable metrics, this\npaper proposes using the attack's expected duration as a unifying metric to\ncompare distinct attack metrics because a longer-duration of unsuccessful\nattack assumes a higher cost.
