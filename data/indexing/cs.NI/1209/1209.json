In this paper, we address the problem of packet\nrouting for efficient data forwarding in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with the\nhelp of smart ants acting as intelligent agents. The aim of this paper is to\nstudy the use of such biologically inspired agents to effectively route the\npackets in WMNs. In particular, we propose AntMesh, a distributed\ninterference-aware data forwarding algorithm which enables the use of smart\nants to probabilistically and concurrently perform the routing and data\nforwarding in order to stochastically solve a dynamic network routing problem.\nAntMesh belongs to the class of routing algorithms inspired by the behaviour of\nreal ants which are known to find a shortest path between their nest and a food\nsource. In addition, AntMesh has the capability to effectively utilize the\nspace/channel diversity typically common in multi radio WMNs and to discover\nhigh throughput paths with less inter-flow and intra-flow interference while\nconventional wireless network routing protocols fail to do so. We implement our\nsmart ant-based routing algorithm in ns-2 and carry out extensive evaluation.\nWe demonstrate the stability of AntMesh in terms of how quickly it adapts\nitself to the changing dynamics or load on the network. We tune the parameters\nof AntMesh algorithm to study the effect on its performance in terms of the\nrouting load and end-to-end delay and have tested its performance under various\nnetwork scenarios particularly fixed nodes mesh networks and also on mobile WMN\nscenarios. The results obtained show AntMesh's advantages that make it a\nvaluable candidate to operate in mesh networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 07:35:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bokhari", "Fawaz", ""], ["Zaruba", "Gergely", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0622", "submitter": "Nishadh K A", "authors": "K.

However, the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet\nto emerge. A large portion of the existing literature does not build on real\nworld scenarios, hence, neglecting various important interactions of the\nresearch with commercial telecommunication networks. For instance, a lot of\nattention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality\nthat needs to be completed in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an\nopportunistic CR network architecture. This is necessary to detect the\nexistence of spectrum holes without which no other procedure can be fulfilled.\nHowever, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy received from a\nprimary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example,\nthe low strength of a primary transmitter's signal does not assure that there\nwill be no interference to a nearby primary receiver. In addition, the presence\nof a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot\naccess the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the\nvicinity. Despite the existing elegant and clever solutions to the DSA problem\nno robust, implementable scheme has emerged. In this paper, we challenge the\nbasic premises of the proposed schemes. We further argue that addressing the\ntechnical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be\nachieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities.\nIn support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired\nby realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, focusing on\nspectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of\nCRs. We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable\nto realistic deployment in complex wireless environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2012 20:51:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pelechrinis", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Krishnamurthy", "Prashant", ""], ["Weiss", "Martin", ""], ["Znati", "Taied", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.2189", "submitter": "Najmeh Kamyabpour", "authors": "Najmeh Kamyabpour, Doan B.Hoang", "title": "Statistical Analysis to Extract Effective Parameters on Overall Energy\n  Consumption of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)", "comments": "5-pages.

A diversity of\nmethods have been proposed to engage these new resources. As opposed to direct\nload control, many methods rely on consumers and/or loads responding to\nexogenous signals, typically in the form of energy pricing, originating from\nthe utility or system operator. Here, we propose an open loop\ncommunication-lite method for estimating the price elasticity of many customers\ncomprising a distribution system. We utilize a sparse linear regression method\nthat relies on operator-controlled, inhomogeneous minor price variations, which\nwill be fair to all the consumers. Our numerical experiments show that reliable\nestimation of individual and thus aggregated instantaneous elasticities is\npossible.
