In this context,\nmesh/pull-based swarming plays an important role either as pure streaming\napproach or in combination with tree/push mechanisms. However, the impact of\nrealistic client populations with heterogeneous resources is not yet fully\nunderstood. In this technical report, we contribute to closing this gap by\nmathematically analysing the most basic scheduling mechanisms latest deadline\nfirst (LDF) and earliest deadline first (EDF) in a continuous time Markov chain\nframework and combining them into a simple, yet powerful, mixed strategy to\nleverage inherent differences in client resources. The main contributions are\ntwofold: (1) a mathematical framework for swarming on random graphs is proposed\nwith a focus on LDF and EDF strategies in heterogeneous scenarios; (2) a mixed\nstrategy, named SchedMix, is proposed that leverages peer heterogeneity. The\nproposed strategy, SchedMix is shown to outperform the other two strategies\nusing different abstractions: a mean-field theoretic analysis of buffer\nprobabilities, simulations of a stochastic model on random graphs, and a\nfull-stack implementation of a P2P streaming system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 21:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["KhudaBukhsh", "Wasiur R.", ""], ["R\u00fcckert", "Julius", ""], ["Wulfheide", "Julian", ""], ["Hausheer", "David", ""], ["Koeppl", "Heinz", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11481", "submitter": "Chaojie Gu", "authors": "Chaojie Gu, Linshan Jiang, Rui Tan", "title": "LoRa-Based Localization: Opportunities and Challenges", "comments": "The 1st workshop on Low Power Wide Area Networks for Internet of\n  Things (LPNET), co-located with EWSN'19", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies featuring long-range\ncommunication capability and low power consumption will be important for\nforming the Internet of Things (IoT) consisting of many geographically\ndistributed objects.
