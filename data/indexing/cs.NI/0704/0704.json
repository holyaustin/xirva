It has\ngenerally been assumed in prior studies that the many-to-one throughput\ncapacity is upper-bounded by the link capacity L. Throughput capacity L is not\nachievable under 802.11. This paper introduces the notion of \"canonical\nnetworks\", which is a class of regularly-structured networks whose capacities\ncan be analyzed more easily than unstructured networks. We show that the\nthroughput capacity of canonical networks under 802.11 has an analytical upper\nbound of 3L/4 when the source nodes are two or more hops away from the sink;\nand simulated throughputs of 0.690L (0.740L) when the source nodes are many\nhops away. We conjecture that 3L/4 is also the upper bound for general\nnetworks. When all links have equal length, 2L/3 can be shown to be the upper\nbound for general networks. Our simulations show that 802.11 networks with\nrandom topologies operated with AODV routing can only achieve throughputs far\nbelow the upper bounds. Fortunately, by properly selecting routes near the\ngateway (or by properly positioning the relay nodes leading to the gateway) to\nfashion after the structure of canonical networks, the throughput can be\nimproved significantly by more than 150%. Indeed, in a dense network, it is\nworthwhile to deactivate some of the relay nodes near the sink judiciously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2007 09:17:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chan", "Chi Pan", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""], ["Chan", "An", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.0730", "submitter": "Hamed Haddadi MSc MIEE", "authors": "Hamed Haddadi, Raul Landa, Miguel Rio, Saleem Bhatti", "title": "Revisiting the Issues On Netflow Sample and Export Performance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PF cs.NI", "license": null, "abstract": "  The high volume of packets and packet rates of traffic on some router links\nmakes it exceedingly difficult for routers to examine every packet in order to\nkeep detailed statistics about the traffic which is traversing the router.\nSampling is commonly applied on routers in order to limit the load incurred by\nthe collection of information that the router has to undertake when evaluating\nflow information for monitoring purposes. The sampling process in nearly all\ncases is a deterministic process of choosing 1 in every N packets on a\nper-interface basis, and then forming the flow statistics based on the\ncollected sampled statistics. Even though this sampling may not be significant\nfor some statistics, such as packet rate, others can be severely distorted.\nHowever, it is important to consider the sampling techniques and their relative\naccuracy when applied to different traffic patterns. The main disadvantage of\nsampling is the loss of accuracy in the collected trace when compared to the\noriginal traffic stream. To date there has not been a detailed analysis of the\nimpact of sampling at a router in various traffic profiles and flow criteria.\nIn this paper, we assess the performance of the sampling process as used in\nNetFlow in detail, and we discuss some techniques for the compensation of loss\nof monitoring detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2007 14:47:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Haddadi", "Hamed", ""], ["Landa", "Raul", ""], ["Rio", "Miguel", ""], ["Bhatti", "Saleem", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1068", "submitter": "Leo Liberti", "authors": "Giacomo Nannicini, Philippe Baptiste, Gilles Barbier, Daniel Krob, Leo\n  Liberti", "title": "Fast paths in large-scale dynamic road networks", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.DS", "license": null, "abstract": "  Efficiently computing fast paths in large scale dynamic road networks (where\ndynamic traffic information is known over a part of the network) is a practical\nproblem faced by several traffic information service providers who wish to\noffer a realistic fast path computation to GPS terminal enabled vehicles.
