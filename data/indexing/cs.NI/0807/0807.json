Our study is motivated by the tight user-network\ncoupling in future mobile societies. In such a paradigm, messages are sent to\ninferred behavioral profiles, instead of explicit IDs. Our paper provides a\nsystematic framework in providing such services. First, user behavioral\nprofiles are constructed based on traces collected from two large wireless\nnetworks, and their spatio-temporal stability is analyzed. The implicit\nrelationship discovered between mobile users could be utilized to provide a\nservice for message delivery and discovery in various network environments. As\nan example application, we provide a detailed design of such a service in\nchallenged opportunistic network architecture, named CSI. We provide a fully\ndistributed solution using behavioral profile space gradients and small world\nstructures.\n  Our analysis shows that user behavioral profiles are surprisingly stable,\ni.e., the similarity of the behavioral profile of a user to its future\nbehavioral profile is above 0.8 for two days and 0.75 for one week, and remains\nabove 0.6 for five weeks. The correlation coefficient of the similarity metrics\nbetween a user pair at different time instants is above 0.7 for four days, 0.62\nfor a week, and remains above 0.5 for two weeks. Leveraging such a stability in\nuser behaviors, the CSI service achieves delivery rate very close to the\ndelay-optimal strategy (above 94%), with minimal overhead (less than 84% of the\noptimal). We believe that this new paradigm will act as an enabler of multiple\nnew services in mobile societies, and is potentially applicable in\nserver-based, heterogeneous or infrastructure-less wireless environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 01:58:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hsu", "Wei-jen", ""], ["Dutta", "Debojyoti", ""], ["Helmy", "Ahmed", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1160", "submitter": "Charles Shen", "authors": "Charles Shen, Henning Schulzrinne, Erich Nahum", "title": "Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Server Overload Control: Design and\n  Evaluation", "comments": "In Proceedings of IPTComm 2008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server may be overloaded by\nemergency-induced call volume, ``American Idol'' style flash crowd effects or\ndenial of service attacks.

In this work we formulate the validation problem as a\ngeneralization of the well know set cover problem. We reduce the set cover\nproblem to the validation problem, thus proving that the validation problem is\n${\\cal NP}$-hard. We present a $O(\\log n)$-approximation algorithm to the\nvalidation problem, where $n$ in the number of edges that need to be validated.\nWe also show that unless ${\\cal P = NP}$ the approximation ratio of the\nvalidation problem is $\\Omega(\\log n)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2008 19:30:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gonen", "Mira", ""], ["Shavitt", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3374", "submitter": "Reginald Smith", "authors": "Reginald D.

Previous works that study energy efficiency and\ndelay are based on the assumption of reliable links. However, the unreliability\nof the channel is inevitable in wireless multi-hop networks.

It provides a closed form expression of the lower bound on the\nenergy-delay trade-off for different channel models (AWGN, Raleigh flat fading\nand Nakagami block-fading) in a linear network. These analytical results are\nalso verified in 2-dimensional Poisson networks using simulations. The main\ncontribution of this work is the use of a probabilistic link model to define\nthe energy efficiency of the system and capture the energy-delay trade-offs.\nHence, it provides a more realistic lower bound on both the energy efficiency\nand the energy-delay trade-off since it does not restrict the study to the set\nof perfect links as proposed in earlier works.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 13:32:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Ruifeng", "", "CITI, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / CITI"], ["Gorce", "Jean-Marie", "", "CITI, INRIA Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes / CITI"], ["Jaffr\u00e8s-Runser", "Katia", "", "CITI, WNET"]]}, {"id": "0807.4770", "submitter": "Zhang Shengli", "authors": "Shengli Zhang, Soung-Chang Liew", "title": "Channel Coding and Decoding in a Relay System Operated with Physical\n  layer Network Coding", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE journal on selection area in communications, Jun. 2009", "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2009.090618", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Physical-layer Network Coding (PNC) can significantly improve the throughput\nof wireless two way relay channel (TWRC) by allowing the two end nodes to\ntransmit messages to the relay simultaneously. To achieve reliable\ncommunication, channel coding could be applied on top of PNC. This paper\ninvestigates link-by-link channel-coded PNC, in which a critical process at the\nrelay is to transform the superimposed channel-coded packets received from the\ntwo end nodes plus noise, Y3=X1+X2+W3, to the network-coded combination of the\nsource packets, S1 XOR S2 . This is in distinct to the traditional\nmultiple-access problem, in which the goal is to obtain S1 and S2 separately.\nThe transformation from Y3 to (S1 XOR S2) is referred to as the\nChannel-decoding-Network-Coding process (CNC) in that it involves both channel\ndecoding and network coding operations. A contribution of this paper is the\ninsight that in designing CNC, we should first (i) channel-decode Y3 to the\nsuperimposed source symbols S1+S2 before (ii) transforming S1+S2 to the\nnetwork-coded packets (S1 XOR S2) . Compared with previously proposed\nstrategies for CNC, this strategy reduces the channel-coding network-coding\nmismatch. It is not obvious, however, that an efficient decoder for step (i)\nexists. A second contribution of this paper is to provide an explicit\nconstruction of such a decoder based on the use of the Repeat Accumulate (RA)\ncode. Specifically, we redesign the belief propagation algorithm of the RA code\nfor traditional point-to-point channel to suit the need of the PNC\nmultiple-access channel. Simulation results show that our new scheme\noutperforms the previously proposed schemes significantly in terms of BER\nwithout added complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 02:44:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2010 07:04:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Shengli", ""], ["Liew", "Soung-Chang", ""]]}]
