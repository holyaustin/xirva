This popular approach has two major shortcomings. First,\nalthough the PPP model may be a fitting one for the BS locations, it is less\nadequate for the UE locations mainly due to the fact that the model is not\nadjustable (tunable) to represent the severity of the heterogeneity\n(non-uniformity) in the UE locations. Besides, the independence assumption\nbetween the two PPPs does not capture the often-observed correlation between\nthe UE and BS locations.\n  This paper presents a novel heterogeneous spatial traffic modeling which\nallows statistical adjustment. Simple and non-parameterized, yet sufficiently\naccurate, measures for capturing the traffic characteristics in space are\nintroduced. Only two statistical parameters related to the UE distribution,\nnamely, the coefficient of variation (the normalized second-moment), of an\nappropriately defined inter-UE distance measure, and correlation coefficient\n(the normalized cross-moment) between UE and BS locations, are adjusted to\ncontrol the degree of heterogeneity and the bias towards the BS locations,\nrespectively. This model is used in heterogeneous wireless cellular networks\n(HetNets) to demonstrate the impact of heterogeneous and BS-correlated traffic\non the network performance. This network is called HetHetNet since it has two\ntypes of heterogeneity: heterogeneity in the infrastructure (supply), and\nheterogeneity in the spatial traffic distribution (demand).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 02:59:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mirahsan", "Meisam", ""], ["Schoenen", "Rainer", ""], ["Yanikomeroglu", "Halim", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.00463", "submitter": "Ratnesh Kumbhkar", "authors": "Ratnesh Kumbhkar, Tejashri Kuber, Narayan B.

Non-contiguous Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing\n(NC-OFDM) is a promising technique to utilize such disjoint frequency bands in\nan efficient manner. In this paper we study the problem of fair spectrum\nallocation across multiple NCOFDM-enabled point-to-point cognitive radio links\nunder certain practical considerations that arise from such non-contiguous\naccess. When using NC-OFDMA, the channels allocated to a cognitive link are\nspread across several disjoint frequency bands leading to a large spectral span\nfor that link. Increased spectral span requires higher sampling rates, leading\nto increased power consumption in the ADC/DAC of the transmit/receive nodes. In\nthis context, this paper proposes a spectrum allocation that maximizes the\nminimum rate achieved by the cognitive radio links, under a constraint on the\nmaximum permissible spectral span. Under constant transmit powers and\northogonal spectrum allocation, such an optimization is a mixed-integer linear\nprogram and can be solved efficiently. There exists a clear trade-off between\nthe max-min rate achieved and the maximum permissible spectral span. The\nspectral allocation obtained from the proposed optimization framework is shown\nto be close to the tradeoff boundary, thus showing the effectiveness of the\nproposed technique.

The fact that such an\nearly prototype compares favorably against Boost, a well-known open source\nlibrary developed by expert programmers, gives us reason to believe our design\nfor the queue is indeed better suited to the problem at hand, and the favorable\ntime measurements are not a product of any specific implementation technique we\nemployed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2015 14:58:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Aviram", "Nimrod", ""], ["Shavitt", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.05259", "submitter": "Daniel Posch", "authors": "Daniel Posch and Benjamin Rainer and Hermann Hellwagner", "title": "SAF: Stochastic Adaptive Forwarding in Named Data Networking", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 14 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Forwarding decisions in classical IP-based networks are predetermined by\nrouting.

In Named Data Networking (NDN) instead, routing shall hold a\nsupporting role to forwarding, providing sufficient potential to enhance\ncontent dissemination at the forwarding plane. In this paper we design,\nimplement, and evaluate a novel probability-based forwarding strategy, called\nStochastic Adaptive Forwarding (SAF) for NDN. SAF imitates a self-adjusting\nwater pipe system, intelligently guiding and distributing Interests through\nnetwork crossings circumventing link failures and bottlenecks. Just as real\npipe systems, SAF employs overpressure valves enabling congested nodes to lower\npressure autonomously. Through an implicit feedback mechanism it is ensured\nthat the fraction of the traffic forwarded via congested nodes decreases. By\nconducting simulations we show that our approach outperforms existing\nforwarding strategies in terms of the Interest satisfaction ratio in the\nmajority of the evaluated scenarios. This is achieved by extensive utilization\nof NDN's multipath and content-lookup capabilities without relying on the\nrouting plane. SAF explores the local environment by redirecting requests that\nare likely to be dropped anyway. This enables SAF to identify new paths to the\ncontent origin or to cached replicas, circumventing link failures and resource\nshortages without relying on routing updates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 May 2015 06:50:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 11:27:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 09:08:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 09:41:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Posch", "Daniel", ""], ["Rainer", "Benjamin", ""], ["Hellwagner", "Hermann", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.05579", "submitter": "Ehab Mahmoud Mohamed Dr.", "authors": "Ehab Mahmoud Mohamed, Kei Sakaguchi, and Seiichi Sampei", "title": "Millimeter Wave Beamforming Based on WiFi Fingerprinting in Indoor\n  Environment", "comments": "6 pages, 9 Figures, 1 Table, ICC workshops 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Millimeter Wave (mm-w), especially the 60 GHz band, has been receiving much\nattention as a key enabler for the 5G cellular networks.

The quantitative performance studies indicate the\nsuperior throughput gain and the flexibility of our algorithm in practice,\nwhich is resilient to both oblivious and adaptive jamming attacks with\ndifferent intelligence and any attacking strength that ranges from no-attack to\nthe full-attack of all spectrum resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 12:28:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2015 12:44:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:22:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2015 09:07:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 07:44:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2015 04:26:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 06:54:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 06:33:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Pan", ""], ["Jiang", "Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.06615", "submitter": "Dong Liu", "authors": "Dong Liu and Chenyang Yang", "title": "Energy Efficiency of Downlink Networks with Caching at Base Stations", "comments": "Accepted by Journal on Selected Areas in Communications (JSAC),\n  Special Issue on Energy-Efficient Techniques for 5G Wireless Communication\n  Systems", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/JSAC.2016.2549398", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Caching popular contents at base stations (BSs) can reduce the backhaul cost\nand improve the network throughput.

Due to the entangled impact of various factors on EE\nsuch as interference level, backhaul capacity, BS density, power consumption\nparameters, BS sleeping, content popularity and cache capacity, another\nimportant question is what are the key factors that contribute more to the EE\ngain from caching. In this paper, we attempt to explore the potential of EE of\nthe cache-enabled wireless access networks and identify the key factors. By\nderiving closed-form expression of the approximated EE, we provide the\ncondition when the EE can benefit from caching, find the optimal cache capacity\nthat maximizes the network EE, and analyze the maximal EE gain brought by\ncaching. We show that caching at the BSs can improve the network EE when power\nefficient cache hardware is used. When local caching has EE gain over not\ncaching, caching more contents at the BSs may not provide higher EE. Numerical\nand simulation results show that the caching EE gain is large when the backhaul\ncapacity is stringent, interference level is low, content popularity is skewed,\nand when caching at pico BSs instead of macro BSs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 13:07:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 07:52:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 03:37:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Dong", ""], ["Yang", "Chenyang", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.06630", "submitter": "Laurent Vanbever", "authors": "Michael Alan Chang, Thomas Holterbach, Markus Happe, Laurent Vanbever", "title": "Supercharge me: Boost Router Convergence with SDN", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a promising approach for improving the\nperformance and manageability of future network architectures.

The proposed chunk request\nscheme is a pull strategy where every user opportunistically requests video\nchunks from the neighboring base stations and dynamically adapts the quality of\nits requests based on the current size of the request queue. For the\ntransmission scheduling component, we first describe the general max-weight\nscheduler and then particularize it to a wireless network where the base\nstations have multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) beamforming capabilities.
