The vote comes from other sensor nodes,\ncalled \"witnesses,\" to verify the correctness of the fusion data. Because the\nbase station obtains the vote through the chosen node, the chosen node could\nforge the vote if it is compromised. Thus, the witness node must encrypt the\nvote to prevent this forgery. Compared with the vote, the encryption requires\nmore bits, increasing transmission burden from the chosen node to the base\nstation. The chosen node consumes more power. This work improves the\nwitness-based approach using direct voting mechanism such that the proposed\nscheme has better performance in terms of assurance, overhead, and delay. The\nwitness node transmits the vote directly to the base station. Forgery is not a\nproblem in this scheme. Moreover, fewer bits are necessary to represent the\nvote, significantly reducing the power consumption. Performance analysis and\nsimulation results indicate that the proposed approach can achieve a 40 times\nbetter overhead than the witness-based approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2007 02:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pai", "H. -T.", ""], ["Han", "Y.
