These layerings can replace hard-to-compute BFS-trees in many\ncontexts while having an efficient randomized distributed construction. We\ndemonstrate their versatility by using them to provide near optimal distributed\nalgorithms for several multi-message communication primitives.\n  Designing efficient communication primitives for radio networks has a rich\nhistory that began 25 years ago when Bar-Yehuda et al. introduced fast\nrandomized algorithms for broadcasting and for constructing BFS-trees. Their\nBFS-tree construction time was $O(D \\log^2 n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the network\ndiameter and $n$ is the number of nodes.

On the other hand, BFS-trees have been used as a crucial building\nblock for many communication primitives and their construction time remained a\nbottleneck for these primitives.\n  We introduce collision free layerings that can be used in place of BFS-trees\nand we give a randomized construction of these layerings that runs in nearly\nbroadcast time, that is, w.h.p. in $T_{Lay} = O(D \\log \\frac{n}{D} +\n\\log^{2+\\epsilon} n)$ rounds for any constant $\\epsilon>0$.

Small cells come with a significant challenge of providing\nbackhaul to transport data to(from) a gateway node in the core network. Fiber\nbased backhaul offers the high rates needed to meet this requirement, but is\ncostly and time-consuming to deploy, when not readily available. Wireless\nbackhaul is an attractive option for small cells as it provides a less\nexpensive and easy-to-deploy alternative to fiber. However, there are multitude\nof bands and features (e.g. LOS/NLOS, spatial multiplexing etc.) associated\nwith wireless backhaul that need to be used intelligently for small cells.\nCandidate bands include: sub-6 GHz band that is useful in non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) scenarios, microwave band (6-42 GHz) that is useful in point-to-point\nline-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, and millimeter wave bands (e.g. 60, 70 and 80\nGHz) that are recently being commercially used in LOS scenarios. In many\ndeployment topologies, it is advantageous to use aggregator nodes, located at\nthe roof tops of tall buildings near small cells. These nodes can provide high\ndata rate to multiple small cells in NLOS paths, sustain the same data rate to\ngateway nodes using LOS paths and take advantage of all available bands. This\nwork performs the joint cost optimal aggregator node placement, power\nallocation, channel scheduling and routing to optimize the wireless backhaul\nnetwork.

In this setting, the BackPressure policy is\nmaximum stable, but must maintain a queue for every route-destination, which\ntypically grows rapidly with a network's size. However, this proportionally\nfair policy only needs to maintain a queue for each outgoing link, which is\ntypically bounded in number. As is common with Internet routing, by maintaining\nper-link queueing each node only needs to know the next hop for each packet and\nnot its entire route. Further, in contrast to BackPressure, the Proportional\nScheduler does not compare downstream queue lengths to determine weights, only\nlocal link information is required. This leads to greater potential for\ndecomposed implementations of the policy. Through a reduction argument and an\nentropy argument, we demonstrate that, whilst maintaining substantially less\nqueueing overhead, the Proportional Scheduler achieves maximum throughput\nstability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 08:15:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Walton", "Neil", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.2759", "submitter": "Bendaoud Fayssal", "authors": "Fayssal Bendaoud, Marwen Abdennebi and Fedoua Didi", "title": "Survey On Scheduling And Radio Resources Allocation In Lte", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Next Generation Network ( IJNGN ), Volume\n  6, March 2014", "doi": "10.5121/ijngn.2014.6102", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on an essential task of the enhanced NodeB eNodeB element\nin LTE architecture, the Radio Resource Manager RRM, which aims to accept or\nreject requests for connection to the network based on some constraints and\nensuring optimal distribution of radio resources between Users Equipments UEs.\nIts main functionalities include Admission Control AC and Packet Scheduling PS.\nThis paper will center mainly on the PS part of the RRM task, which performs\nthe radio resource allocation in both uplink and downlink directions.

A fundamental and essential\noperation for SUs is to establish communication through choosing a common\nchannel at the same time slot, which is referred to as rendezvous problem. In\nthis paper, we study strategies to achieve fast rendezvous for two secondary\nusers.\n  The channel availability for secondary nodes is subject to temporal and\nspatial variation. Moreover, in a distributed system, one user is oblivious of\nthe other user's channel status. Therefore, a fast rendezvous is not trivial.\nRecently, a number of rendezvous strategies have been proposed for different\nsystem settings, but rarely have they taken the temporal variation of the\nchannels into account. In this work, we first derive a time-adaptive strategy\nwith optimal expected time-to-rendezvous (TTR) for synchronous systems in\nstable environments, where channel availability is assumed to be static over\ntime. Next, in dynamic environments, which better represent temporally dynamic\nchannel availability in CRNs, we first derive optimal strategies for two\nspecial cases, and then prove that our strategy is still asymptotically optimal\nin general dynamic cases.\n  Numerous simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our\nstrategies, and validate the theoretical analysis. The impacts of different\nparameters on the TTR are also investigated, such as the number of channels,\nthe channel open possibilities, the extent of the environment being dynamic,\nand the existence of an intruder.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Apr 2014 08:24:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Haisheng", ""], ["Yu", "Jiajun", ""], ["Liang", "Hongyu", ""], ["Lou", "Tiancheng", ""], ["Lau", "Francis C.

Different\nfrom prior work in which CSMA protocol parameters are adaptively adjusted to\nachieve better performance, in this paper we propose to achieve maximal link\nthroughputs by adjusting the rates of the traffic pumped into the source nodes\nof links, which runs in a software manner and is more practical to implement in\nreal networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 11:09:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kai", "Caihong", ""], ["Zhang", "Qi", ""], ["Wang", "Lusheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7287", "submitter": "Sameer Qazi", "authors": "Sameer Qazi and Tim Moors", "title": "Disjoint-Path Selection in Internet: What traceroutes tell us?", "comments": "9 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Routing policies used in the Internet can be restrictive, limiting\ncommunication between source-destination pairs to one path, when often better\nalternatives exist. To avoid route flapping, recovery mechanisms may be\ndampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays have been proposed to\nmitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing\nthrough an indirect-path via overlay peer(s). Choosing alternate-paths in\noverlay networks is a challenging issue. Ensuring both availability and\nperformance guarantees on alternate paths requires aggressive monitoring of all\noverlay paths using active probing; this limits scalability. An alternate\ntechnique to select an overlay-path is to bias its selection based on physical\ndisjointness criteria to bypass the failure on the primary-path. Recently,\nseveral techniques have emerged which can optimize the selection of a\ndisjoint-path without incurring the high costs associated with probing paths.\nIn this paper, we show that using only commodity approaches, i.e. running\ninfrequent traceroutes between overlay hosts, a lot of information can be\nrevealed about the underlying physical path diversity in the overlay network\nwhich can be used to make informed-guesses for alternate-path selection. We\ntest our approach using datasets between real-world hosts in AMP and RIPE\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 09:28:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2014 05:27:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Qazi", "Sameer", ""], ["Moors", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7330", "submitter": "Akshay Uttama Nambi", "authors": "Akshay Uttama Nambi S.

New protocol standards,\ntailored to constrained devices, have been designed taking into account\nrequirements such as asynchronous application traffic, need for caching, and\ngroup communication. The existing connection oriented security architecture is\nnot able to keep up---first, in terms of the supported features, but also in\nterms of the scale and resulting latency on small constrained devices. In this\npaper, we propose an architecture that leverages the security concepts both\nfrom content-centric and traditional connection-oriented approaches. We rely on\nsecure channels established by means of (D)TLS for key exchange, but we get rid\nof the notion of the 'state' among communicating entities. We provide a\nmechanism to protect from replay attacks by coupling our scheme with the CoAP\napplication protocol. Our object-based security architecture (OSCAR)\nintrinsically supports caching and multicast, and does not affect the radio\nduty-cycling operation of constrained objects. We evaluate OSCAR in two cases:\n802.15.4 Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLN) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M)\ncommunication for two different hardware platforms and MAC layers on a real\ntestbed and using the Cooja emulator.
