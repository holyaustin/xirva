These networks have gained immense\npopularity primarily due to their infrastructure-less mode of operation which\nmakes them a suitable candidate for deployment in emergency scenarios like\nrelief operation, battlefield etc., where either the pre-existing\ninfrastructure is totally damaged or it is not possible to establish a new\ninfrastructure quickly. However, MANETs are constrained due to the limited\ntransmission range of the mobile nodes which reduces the total coverage area.\nSometimes the infrastructure-less ad hoc network may be combined with a fixed\nnetwork to form a hybrid network which can cover a wider area with the\nadvantage of having less fixed infrastructure. In such a combined network, for\ntransferring data, we need base stations which act as gateways between the\nwired and wireless domains.

This motivates the need\nfor designing schemes that provide near optimal performance even when hidden\nnodes are present. The primary reason for the failure of existing protocols in\nthe presence of hidden nodes is that these protocols are based on the model\ndeveloped by Bianchi. However this model does not hold when hidden nodes exist.\nMoreover, analyzing networks with hidden nodes is still an open problem. Thus,\ndesigning throughput optimal schemes in networks with hidden nodes is\nparticularly challenging. The novelty of our approach is that it is not based\non any underlying mathematical model, rather it directly tunes the control\nvariables so as to maximize the throughput. We demonstrate that this model\nindependent approach achieves maximum throughput in networks with hidden\nterminals as well.

In particular, we aim to maximize the throughput\nof the SU, while keeping the interference temperature at the primary receivers\nbelow a certain threshold.\n  Unlike traditional MIMO systems, SUs may not have the luxury of knowing the\nchannel state information (CSI) on the links to PUs. This presents a key\nchallenge for a secondary transmitter to steer interference away from primary\nreceivers. In this paper, we consider three scenarios, namely when the\nsecondary transmitter has complete, partial, or no knowledge about the channels\nto the primary receivers. In particular, when complete CSI is not available,\nthe interference-temperature constraints are to be satisfied with high\nprobability, thus resulting in chance constraints that are typically hard to\ndeal with.

The homogeneous QCQP\nformulation, though non-convex, is amenable to semidefinite programming (SDP)\nrelaxation methods.

By contrast, prior investigations on throughput\nperformance under unsaturated traffic condition was largely based on\nphenomenological observations, which lead to a common misconception that WLAN\ncan support a traffic load as high as saturation throughput, if not higher,\nunder non-saturation condition. In this paper, we show through rigorous\nanalysis that this misconception may result in unacceptable quality of service:\nmean packet delay and delay jitter may approach infinity even when the traffic\nload is far below the saturation throughput. Hence, saturation throughput is\nnot a sound measure of WLAN capacity under non-saturation condition. To bridge\nthe gap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require finite mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively.\n  Our earlier work proved that in a WLAN with multi-packet reception (MPR)\ncapability, saturation throughput scales super-linearly with the MPR capability\nof the network.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nmulti-round contention random-access protocol to address this problem. This\nwork complements the existing random-access methods that are based on\nsingle-round contention. In the proposed scheme, stations are given multiple\nchances to contend for the channel until there are a sufficient number of\n``winning\" stations that can share the MPR channel for data packet\ntransmission. The key issue here is the identification of the optimal time to\nstop the contention process and start data transmission. The solution\ncorresponds to finding a desired tradeoff between channel utilization and\ncontention overhead. In this paper, we conduct a rigorous analysis to\ncharacterize the optimal strategy using the theory of optimal stopping. An\ninteresting result is that the optimal stopping strategy is a simple\nthreshold-based rule, which stops the contention process as soon as the total\nnumber of winning stations exceeds a certain threshold. Compared with the\nconventional single-round contention protocol, the multi-round contention\nscheme significantly enhances channel utilization when the MPR capability of\nthe channel is small to medium. Meanwhile, the scheme automatically falls back\nto single-round contention when the MPR capability is very large, in which case\nthe throughput penalty due to random access is already small even with\nsingle-round contention.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2010 10:03:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Jun", "Ying", "", "Angela"], ["Zhang", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4278", "submitter": "Yahia Medjahdi", "authors": "Yahia Medjahdi, Michel Terr\\'e, Didier Le Ruyet and Daniel Roviras", "title": "A New Model for Interference Analysis in Asynchronous Multi-Carrier\n  Transmission", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.

The\nresearch over the last decade on adaptive OFDMA systems has focused on adapting\nthe allocation of radio resources, such as subcarriers and power, to the\ninstantaneous channel conditions of all users. However, such \"fast\" adaptation\nrequires high computational complexity and excessive signaling overhead. This\nhinders the deployment of adaptive OFDMA systems worldwide. This paper proposes\na slow adaptive OFDMA scheme, in which the subcarrier allocation is updated on\na much slower timescale than that of the fluctuation of instantaneous channel\nconditions. Meanwhile, the data rate requirements of individual users are\naccommodated on the fast timescale with high probability, thereby meeting the\nrequirements except occasional outage. Such an objective has a natural chance\nconstrained programming formulation, which is known to be intractable. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, we formulate safe tractable constraints for the\nproblem based on recent advances in chance constrained programming. We then\ndevelop a polynomial-time algorithm for computing an optimal solution to the\nreformulated problem. Our results show that the proposed slow adaptation scheme\ndrastically reduces both computational cost and control signaling overhead when\ncompared with the conventional fast adaptive OFDMA.

This paper argues that such multipacket\nreception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In\naddition, the paper provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to\nachieve the improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MPR as a powerful\ncapacity-enhancement technique, we prove a \"super-linearity\" result, which\nstates that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability\nincreases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential\nbackoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR\nsystem, and that the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability,\nthe number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the\nabove insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE\n802.11-like WLAN that incorporates advanced PHY-layer signal processing\ntechniques to implement MPR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 02:39:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Jun", "Ying", "", "Angela"], ["Zhang", "", ""], ["Zheng", "Pengxuan", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4490", "submitter": "Ashwin Rao", "authors": "Ashwin Rao (INRIA Sophia Antipolis / INRIA Rh\\^one-Alpes), Arnaud\n  Legout (INRIA Sophia Antipolis / INRIA Rh\\^one-Alpes), Walid Dabbous (INRIA\n  Sophia Antipolis / INRIA Rh\\^one-Alpes)", "title": "Can Realistic BitTorrent Experiments Be Performed on Clusters?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "10th IEEE International Conference on Peer-to-Peer Computing (IEEE\n  P2P'10), Delft : Netherlands (2010)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Network latency and packet loss are considered to be an important requirement\nfor realistic evaluation of Peer-to-Peer protocols.
