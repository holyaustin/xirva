For improving the\napplication throughput, recent research works have embedded application\ndeadline information into design of network flow schedule to meet the latency\nrequirement. Here, arises a critical question: does application-level\nthroughput mean providing better quality service? We note that there are\nusually a set of semantic related responses (or flows) for answering a query;\nand, some responses are highly correlative with the query while others do not.\nThus, this observation motivates us to associate the importance of the contents\nwith the application flows (or responses) in order to enhance the service\nquality. We first model the application importance maximization problem in a\ngeneric network and in a server-centric network. Since both of them are too\ncomplicated to be deployed in the real world, we propose the importance-aware\ndelivery protocol, which is a distributed event-driven rate-based delivery\ncontrol protocol, for server-centric datacenter networks. The proposed protocol\nis able to make use of the multiple disjoin paths of server-centric network,\nand jointly consider flow importance, flow size, and deadline to maximize the\ngoodput of most-related semantic data of a query. Through real-data-based or\nsynthetic simulations, the results show that our proposed protocol\nsignificantly outperforms D3 and MPTCP in terms of the precision at K and the\nsum of application-level importance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 15:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Ming-Hung", ""], ["Wang", "Shi-Chen", ""], ["Chou", "Cheng-Fu", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0234", "submitter": "Lin Wang", "authors": "Lin Wang, Antonio Fern\\'andez Anta, Fa Zhang, Chenying Hou and Zhiyong\n  Liu", "title": "Routing for Energy Minimization with Discrete Cost Functions", "comments": "14 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Energy saving is becoming an important issue in the design and use of\ncomputer networks. In this work we propose a problem that considers the use of\nrate adaptation as the energy saving strategy in networks. The problem is\nmodeled as an integral demand-routing problem in a network with discrete cost\nfunctions at the links. The discreteness of the cost function comes from the\ndifferent states (bandwidths) at which links can operate and, in particular,\nfrom the energy consumed at each state. This in its turn leads to the\nnon-convexity of the cost function, and thus adds complexity to solve this\nproblem. We formulate this routing problem as an integer program, and we show\nthat the general case of this problem is NP-hard, and even hard to approximate.\nFor the special case when the step ratio of the cost function is bounded, we\nshow that effective approximations can be obtained. Our main algorithm executes\ntwo processes in sequence: relaxation and rounding. The relaxation process\neliminates the non-convexity of the cost function, so that the problem is\ntransformed into a fractional convex program solvable in polynomial time. After\nthat, a randomized rounding process is used to get a feasible solution for the\noriginal problem. This algorithm provides a constant approximation ratio for\nuniform demands and an approximation ratio of $O(\\log^{\\beta-1} d)$ for\nnon-uniform demands, where $\\beta$ is a constant and $d$ is the largest demand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 18:04:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Lin", ""], ["Anta", "Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez", ""], ["Zhang", "Fa", ""], ["Hou", "Chenying", ""], ["Liu", "Zhiyong", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0320", "submitter": "Xingqin Lin", "authors": "Xingqin Lin and Harish Viswanathan", "title": "Dynamic Spectrum Refarming with Overlay for Legacy Devices", "comments": "12 pages, 14 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Wireless\n  Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The explosive growth in data traffic is resulting in a spectrum crunch\nforcing many wireless network operators to look towards refarming their 2G\nspectrum and deploy more spectrally efficient Long Term Evolution (LTE)\ntechnology. However, mobile network operators face a challenge when it comes to\nspectrum refarming because 2G technologies such as Global System for Mobile\n(GSM) is still widely used for low bandwidth machine-to-machine (M2M) devices.\nM2M devices typically have long life cycles, e.g. smart meters, and it is\nexpensive to migrate these devices to newer technology since a truck roll will\ntypically be required to the site where a device is deployed. Furthermore, with\ncost of 2G modules several times less than that of LTE, even newly deployed M2M\ndevices tend to adopt 2G technology. Nevertheless, operators are keen to either\nforce their 2G M2M customers to migrate so that they can refarm the spectrum or\nset aside a portion of the 2G spectrum for continuing operating 2G and only\nrefarm the rest for LTE. In this paper we propose a novel solution to provide\nGSM connectivity within an LTE carrier through an efficient overlay by\nreserving a few physical resource blocks for GSM. With this approach, operators\ncan refarm their 2G spectrum to LTE efficiently while still providing some GSM\nconnectivity to their low data rate M2M customers. Furthermore, spectrum can be\ndynamically shared between LTE and GSM.

The challenge in\ndesigning a low-complexity distributed MAC, that achieves low delay, is posed\nby two additional dimensions of cognitive radio networks: interference graphs\nand data rates that are frequency-band dependent, and explosion in number of\nfeasible schedules due to large number of available frequency-bands.

Interference becomes a serious problem when two or more\nlayers are considered in the same network. For this purpose, power control in\nthe downlink needs to be used to limit the interference and to fully exploit\nthe benefits of additional layer deployments.We present an analytical framework\nto the common rate maximization problem both with and without maximum power\nconstraints and propose a heuristic algorithm. We present simulation results\nfor the proposed approaches in a two-layer network setup and observe a\nsignificant common rate increase compared to single-layer wireless networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 00:52:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Davaslioglu", "Kemal", ""], ["Ayanoglu", "Ender", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.7048", "submitter": "Kemal Davaslioglu Kemal Davaslioglu", "authors": "Kemal Davaslioglu and Ender Ayanoglu", "title": "Interference-Based Cell Selection in Heterogenous Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/ITA.2013.6502931", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Heterogeneous cellular networks provide significant improvements in terms of\nincreased data rates and cell coverage, and offer reduced user rate starvation.\nHowever, there are important problems to be solved.

They are based on algebraic\nobjects, such as Cech complex and Rips complex. Cech complex gives accurate\ninformation about coverage quality but requires a precise knowledge of the\nrelative locations of nodes. This assumption is rather strong and hard to\nimplement in practical deployments. Rips complex provides an approximation of\nCech complex. It is easier to build and does not require any knowledge of nodes\nlocation. This simplicity is at the expense of accuracy. Rips complex can not\nalways detect all coverage holes. It is then necessary to evaluate its\naccuracy. This work proposes to use the proportion of the area of undiscovered\ncoverage holes as performance criteria. Investigations show that it depends on\nthe ratio between communication and sensing radii of a sensor. Closed-form\nexpressions for lower and upper bounds of the accuracy are also derived. For\nthose coverage holes which can be discovered by Rips complex, a homology-based\ndistributed algorithm is proposed to detect them. Simulation results are\nconsistent with the proposed analytical lower bound, with a maximum difference\nof 0.5%. Upper bound performance depends on the ratio of communication and\nsensing radii. Simulations also show that the algorithm can localize about 99%\ncoverage holes in about 99% cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 19:17:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:52:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Feng", ""], ["Vergne", "Anais", ""], ["Martins", "Philippe", ""], ["Decreusefond", "Laurent", ""]]}]
