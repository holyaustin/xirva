In regular streaming services, content providers restrict the amount\nof viewable video that users can download prior to playback. This approach can\ncause inferior user experience due to bandwidth variations, especially in\nmobile networks with varying capacity. In streamloading, the video is encoded\nusing Scalable Video Coding, and users are allowed to pre-fetch enhancement\nlayers and store them on the device, while base layers are streamed in a near\nreal-time fashion ensuring that buffering constraints on viewable content are\nmet.\n  We begin by formulating the offline problem of jointly optimizing rate\nallocation and quality selection for streamloading in a wireless network. This\nmotivates our proposed online algorithms for joint scheduling at the base\nstation and segment quality selection at receivers. The results indicate that\nstreamloading outperforms state-of-the-art streaming schemes in terms of the\nnumber of additional streams we can admit for a given video quality.\nFurthermore, the quality adaptation mechanism of our proposed algorithm\nachieves a higher performance than baseline algorithms with no (or limited)\nvideo-centric optimization of the base station's allocation of resources, e.g.,\nproportional fairness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 04:35:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseini", "S.

The\nconsequence of this is that a large amount of bytes must be transmitted across\nthe public Cloud. However, very little is known about its bandwidth dynamics.\nTo address this, we have conducted a measurement campaign for bandwidth between\neighteen data-centers of four major CSPs. Such extensive campaign allowed us to\ncharacterize the resulting time series of bandwidth as the addition of a\nstationary component and some infrequent excursions (typically, downtimes).\nWhile the former provides a description of the bandwidth users can expect in\nthe Cloud, the latter is closely related to the robustness of the Cloud (i.e.,\nthe occurrence of downtimes is correlated). Both components have been studied\nfurther by applying a factor analysis, specifically ANOVA, as a mechanism to\nformally compare data-centers' behaviors and extract generalities. The results\nshow that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations\nand CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more\npredictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other\nhand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the\nmeasured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that\nsuch correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of\ndata-centers with little link to more general factors. Positively, this implies\nthat data-centers either at the same area or CSP do not show qualitatively more\ncorrelation than others data-centers, which eases the deployment of robust\ninfrastructures.

Traditionally, PCA is performed in a centralized manner, which has\npoor scalability for large distributed systems, on account of the large network\nbandwidth cost required to gather the distributed state at a fusion center.\nConsequently, several recent works have proposed various distributed PCA\nalgorithms aiming to reduce the communication overhead incurred by PCA without\nlosing its inferential power. This paper evaluates the tradeoff between\ncommunication cost and solution quality of two distributed PCA algorithms on a\nreal domain name system (DNS) query dataset from a large network. We also apply\nthe distributed PCA algorithm in the area of network anomaly detection and\ndemonstrate that the detection accuracy of both distributed PCA-based methods\nhas little degradation in quality, yet achieves significant savings in\ncommunication bandwidth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 13:35:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 14:07:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 13:01:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["An", "Ni", ""], ["Weber", "Steven", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.05281", "submitter": "Stefano Salsano", "authors": "Stefano Salsano, Luca Veltri, Luca Davoli, Pier Luigi Ventre, Giuseppe\n  Siracusano", "title": "PMSR - Poor Man's Segment Routing, a minimalistic approach to Segment\n  Routing and a Traffic Engineering use case", "comments": "September 2015 - Paper accepted to the Mini-conference track of NOMS\n  2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The current specification of the Segment Routing (SR) architecture requires\nenhancements to the intra-domain routing protocols (e.g. OSPF and IS-IS) so\nthat the nodes can advertise the Segment Identifiers (SIDs).

As an architectural enhancement for network flows allocation,\nrouting, and control, SMART ensures timely delivery of flows by diverting them\nto a less congested path dynamically in the software-defined data center\nnetworks. SMART also clones packets of higher priority flows to route in an\nalternative path, along with the original flow.

It is\ncommonly stated in protocol specifications that sequence numbers are sufficient\nto guarantee loop freedom if they are monotonically increased over time. A\nclassical example for the use of sequence numbers is the popular Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol. The loop freedom of AODV is\nnot only a common belief, it has been claimed in the abstract of its RFC and at\nleast two proofs have been proposed. AODV-based protocols such as AODVv2 (DYMO)\nand HWMP also claim loop freedom due to the same use of sequence numbers.\n  In this paper we show that AODV is not a priori loop free; by this we counter\nthe proposed proofs in the literature. In fact, loop freedom hinges on\nnon-evident assumptions to be made when resolving ambiguities occurring in the\nRFC. Thus, monotonically increasing sequence numbers, by themselves, do not\nguarantee loop freedom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 09:51:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["van Glabbeek", "Rob", ""], ["H\u00f6fner", "Peter", ""], ["Tan", "Wee Lum", ""], ["Portmann", "Marius", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09293", "submitter": "Lubos Buzna", "authors": "Lubos Buzna, Rui Carvalho", "title": "Controlling congestion on complex networks: fairness, efficiency and\n  network structure", "comments": "published", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 9152 (2017)", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-017-09524-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.NI math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider two elementary (max-flow and uniform-flow) and two realistic\n(max-min fairness and proportional fairness) congestion control schemes, and\nanalyse how the algorithms and network structure affect throughput, the\nfairness of flow allocation, and the location of bottleneck edges. The more\nrealistic proportional fairness and max-min fairness algorithms have similar\nthroughput, but path flow allocations are more unequal in scale-free than in\nrandom regular networks. Scale-free networks have lower throughput than their\nrandom regular counterparts in the uniform-flow algorithm, which is favoured in\nthe complex networks literature. We show, however, that this relation is\nreversed on all other congestion control algorithms for a region of the\nparameter space given by the degree exponent $\\gamma$ and average degree ${k}$.\nMoreover, the uniform-flow algorithm severely underestimates the network\nthroughput of congested networks, and a rich phenomenology of path flow\nallocations is only present in the more realistic $\\alpha$-fair family of\nalgorithms. Finally, we show that the number of paths passing through an edge\ncharacterises the location of a wide range of bottleneck edges in these\nalgorithms.
