Hence, correct receiver feedback (in the form of TCP acknowledgements)\nis essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and\navoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a\nTCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer\nholds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the\nprotocol. In fact, it has been shown that a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is\nto bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to\nconceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders\narbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows,\nleading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal\ntreatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism\nto force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect\nacknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would\nbe identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender\ngenerates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could\ngenerate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender;\nthe sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof\nwould indicate a cheating receiver. The scheme is very efficient in the sense\nthat the TCP sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the\nproofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. The scheme is\nbased on an aggregate authenticator.

Appropriate mechanisms can dramatically\nimprove bandwidth usage over the Internet, especially for multimedia transport\nbased on partial reliability. In this paper we have implemented and evaluated a\ncongestion control mechanism that implicitly discriminates congestion and\nwireless losses in the datagram congestion control protocol (DCCP) congestion\ncontrol identification (CCID) framework. The new CCID was implemented as a NS-2\nmodule.
