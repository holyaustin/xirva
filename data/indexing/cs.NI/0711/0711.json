Applications include\nscientific data transfers and database backup. In this paper, we present two\nnew, on-line algorithms for advanced reservation, called BatchAll and BatchLim,\nthat are guaranteed to achieve optimal throughput performance, based on\nmulti-commodity flow arguments. Both algorithms are shown to have\npolynomial-time complexity and provable bounds on the maximum delay for\n1+epsilon bandwidth augmented networks. The BatchLim algorithm returns the\ncompletion time of a connection immediately as a request is placed, but at the\nexpense of a slightly looser competitive ratio than that of BatchAll. We also\npresent a simple approach that limits the number of parallel paths used by the\nalgorithms while provably bounding the maximum reduction factor in the\ntransmission throughput. We show that, although the number of different paths\ncan be exponentially large, the actual number of paths needed to approximate\nthe flow is quite small and proportional to the number of edges in the network.\nSimulations for a number of topologies show that, in practice, 3 to 5 parallel\npaths are sufficient to achieve close to optimal performance. The performance\nof the competitive algorithms are also compared to a greedy benchmark, both\nthrough analysis and simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 12:54:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cohen", "Reuven", ""], ["Fazlollahi", "Niloofar", ""], ["Starobinski", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.0892", "submitter": "Alessandro Mei", "authors": "Alessandro Mei and Julinda Stefa", "title": "Routing in Outer Space: Improved Security and Energy-Efficiency in\n  Multi-Hop Wireless Networks", "comments": "Short version invited to INFOCOM 2008 mini-conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper we consider security-related and energy-efficiency issues in\nmulti-hop wireless networks.
