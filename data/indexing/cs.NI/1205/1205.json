Spectrum sensing and compulsory idling (for incumbent\nprotection) introduce energy-overheads for Secondary User's (SU's) operations,\nand thus an appropriate balance between energy consumption in data transmission\nand energy-overheads is required. We formulate this problem as a discrete-time\nMarkov Decision Process (MDP) in which the SU aims at minimizing its average\ncost (including both energy consumption and delay cost) to finish a target\ntraffic payload through an appropriate rate allocation. Based on Certainty\nEquivalent Control, we propose a low-complexity rate-adaptation policy that\nachieves comparable performance as the optimal policy. With the low-complexity\npolicy, we quantify the impact of energy-overheads (including the power\nconsumption for spectrum sensing and compulsory idling) on the SU transmission\nstrategy. Specifically, the SU rate increases with the increase of\nenergy-overheads, whose marginal impact, however, diminishes. Moreover, the\nmarginal impact of energy-overheads is more significant for delay-insensitive\ntraffic compared to that for delay-sensitive traffic. To mitigate the loss due\nto imperfect spectrum sensing, we quantify that the SU decreases (increases)\nits rate with a larger mis-detection probability (false alarm probability).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2012 05:20:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2012 10:11:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Yuan", ""], ["Lau", "Vincent K.

GPS is the most common positioning technique for\nVANET. However, it is not accurate. Moreover, the GPS signals cannot be\nreceived in the tunnels, undergrounds, or near tall buildings. Thus, no\npositioning service can be obtained in these locations. Even if the Deferential\nGPS (DGPS) can provide high accuracy, but still no GPS converge in these\nlocations. In this paper, we provide positioning techniques for VANET that can\nprovide accurate positioning service in the areas where GPS signals are\nhindered by the obstacles. Experimental results show significant improvement in\nthe accuracy. This allows when combined with DGPS the continuity of a precise\npositioning service that can be used by most of the VANET applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2012 09:04:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mohamed", "Samir A.

To assess the\ncontribution of these entropy estimations in the enhancement of tensor-based\nlink prediction efficiency, we perform prediction on two real traces.

Introduction Modern network are multi-layer by their structure. This\nrequires the development of new mathematical models, which would allow to\nadequately describe the existing physical and logical connections between the\nelements on its different levels, and to effectively solve the problems of\ndesign. The paper formulates the problem of synthesis of structure of MPLS\nnetwork layered with the transport SDH network or WDM and suggests the method\nof its solving. The solving is based on the application of mathematical model\nof multi-layer graph. II, III, IV. Main Part During the planning of MPLS\nnetworks it is necessary to determine the topology of both the networks: that\nof transport one and that of MPLS one. This means that one needs to determine:\n- what nodes of the transport network should support the MPLS functionality; -\nin what way the LSR nodes should be connected via the transport network; - what\nshould be the bandwidth between LSR links. According to the general method for\nsolving the problem of synthesis of multiservice telecommunication systems with\nthe usage of multi-layer graphs, we have to synthesize the initial redundant .\nThe solving of the task above can be reduced to the finding of the multi-layer\nminimum weight subgraph that provides the transfer of information flows with\nthe consideration of the requirements to the structure of the multilayer graph\n[5] and the flows on its edges [6] observed at the applying of constraints to\nthe bandwidth of the edges of the multi-layer graph. V. Conclusion The paper\nreduces the problem of design of multiservice telecommunication system with the\ntransferred flows to the problem of finding a multilayer minimum weight\nsubgraph with the consideration of constraints to the graph edges bandwidth. It\nis shown that application of given method provide to reduce MPLS network cost\nto 10 - 16 %.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 May 2012 11:30:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ageyev", "Dmytro", ""], ["Abdalla", "Haidara", ""], ["Starkova", "O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.4353", "submitter": "Xiaoli  Chu", "authors": "Xiaoli Chu, Yuhua Wu, David L\\'opez-P\\'erez, and Xiaofeng Tao", "title": "On Providing Downlink Services in Collocated Spectrum-Sharing Macro and\n  Femto Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications, December 2011", "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2011.101511.110237", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Femtocells have been considered by the wireless industry as a cost-effective\nsolution not only to improve indoor service providing, but also to unload\ntraffic from already overburdened macro networks.

How to discover the coding opportunity in relay nodes is really\nimportant for it. There are more coding chances, there are more times it can\nimprove network throughput by network coding operation. In this paper, an\nextended network coding opportunity discovery scheme (ExCODE) is proposed,\nwhich is realized by appending the current node ID and all its 1-hop neighbors'\nIDs to the packet. ExCODE enables the next hop relay node to know which nodes\nelse have already overheard the packet, so it can discover the potential coding\nopportunities as much as possible. ExCODE expands the region of discovering\ncoding chance to n-hops, and have more opportunities to execute network coding\noperation in each relay node. At last, we implement ExCODE over the AODV\nprotocol, and efficiency of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated with NS2\nsimulations, compared to the existing coding opportunity discovery scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2012 03:50:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "Yunlong", ""], ["Dong", "Zhao", ""], ["Iwai", "Masayuki", ""], ["Sezaki", "Kaoru", ""], ["Tobe", "Yoshito", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.6595", "submitter": "Mouradian Alexandre", "authors": "Alexandre Mouradian (CITI, CITI Insa Lyon / Inria Grenoble\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes), Isabelle Aug\\'e-Blum (CITI Insa Lyon / Inria Grenoble\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes), Fabrice Valois (CITI, CITI Insa Lyon / Inria Grenoble\n  Rh\\^one-Alpes)", "title": "RTXP : A Localized Real-Time Mac-Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor\n  Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "N&deg; RR-7978 (2012)", "doi": null, "report-no": "RR-7978", "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Protocols developed during the last years for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\nare mainly focused on energy efficiency and autonomous mechanisms (e.g.\nself-organization, self-configuration, etc).

Real-time\napplications require the packets to be delivered before a known time bound\nwhich depends on the application requirements. We particularly focus on\napplications which consist in alarms sent to the sink node. We propose\nReal-Time X-layer Protocol (RTXP), a real-time communication protocol. To the\nbest of our knowledge, RTXP is the first MAC and routing real-time\ncommunication protocol that is not centralized, but instead relies only on\nlocal information. The solution is cross-layer (X-layer) because it allows to\ncontrol the delays due to MAC and Routing layers interactions. RTXP uses a\nsuited hop-count-based Virtual Coordinate System which allows deterministic\nmedium access and forwarder selection. In this paper we describe the protocol\nmechanisms. We give theoretical bound on the end-to-end delay and the capacity\nof the protocol. Intensive simulation results confirm the theoretical\npredictions and allow to compare with a real-time centralized solution. RTXP is\nalso simulated under harsh radio channel, in this case the radio link\nintroduces probabilistic behavior.

Traditionally, TCP has applied a set of congestion control\nalgorithms (slow-start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, fast recovery)\nto probe the currently available bandwidth on the connection path.

Denser spectrum reuse through the deployment of\nmore access points per square mile has the potential to successfully meet the\nincreasing demand for more bandwidth. In theory, the best approach to density\nincrease is via distributed multiuser MIMO, where several access points are\nconnected to a central server and operate as a large distributed multi-antenna\naccess point, ensuring that all transmitted signal power serves the purpose of\ndata transmission, rather than creating \"interference.\" In practice, while\nenterprise networks offer a natural setup in which distributed MIMO might be\npossible, there are serious implementation difficulties, the primary one being\nthe need to eliminate phase and timing offsets between the jointly coordinated\naccess points.\n  In this paper we propose AirSync, a novel scheme which provides not only time\nbut also phase synchronization, thus enabling distributed MIMO with full\nspatial multiplexing gains. AirSync locks the phase of all access points using\na common reference broadcasted over the air in conjunction with a Kalman filter\nwhich closely tracks the phase drift. We have implemented AirSync as a digital\ncircuit in the FPGA of the WARP radio platform. Our experimental testbed,\ncomprised of two access points and two clients, shows that AirSync is able to\nachieve phase synchronization within a few degrees, and allows the system to\nnearly achieve the theoretical optimal multiplexing gain. We also discuss MAC\nand higher layer aspects of a practical deployment.
