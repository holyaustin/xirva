Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research\ncommunity in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the\ndesign of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect\nof transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform\nso as to enhance the DC power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a\ntractable model of the non-linearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear\nmodel conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design\nnovel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information\n(CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission\nwith all the power allocated to a single frequency, the non-linear model\nfavours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic\nsimulations, waveforms designed based on the non-linear model are shown to\nprovide significant gains (in terms of harvested DC power) over those designed\nbased on the linear model and over non-adaptive waveforms. We also compute\nanalytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various\nwaveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those\nscaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT\nand of a WPT design based on a non-linear rectenna model over a linear model.\nResults also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on\nlarge-scale multisine multi-antenna waveforms for WPT.

The stochastic\nnature of wireless channels in general gives rise to a time varying\ntransmission rate. In such an environment, interference is increasingly\nbecoming a key constraint. Obtaining an expressive model for offered service of\nsuch channels has major implications in the design and optimization of future\nnetworks. However, interference channels are not well-understood with respect\nto their higher layer performance. The particular difficulty for handling\ninterference channels arises from the superposition of random fading processes\nfor the signals of the transmitters involved (i.e., for the signal of interest\nand for the signals of the interferers). Starting from the distribution of the\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), we derive a statistical\ncharacterization of the underlying service process in terms of its Mellin\ntransform. Then, we adapt a recent stochastic network calculus approach for\nfading channels to derive measures of the queuing performance of single- and\nmulti-hop wireless interference networks. Special cases of our solution include\nnoise-limited and interference-limited systems. A key finding of our analysis\nis that for a given average signal and average sum interference power, the\nperformance of interfered systems not only depends on the relative strength of\nthe sum interference with respect to the signal-of-interest power, but also on\nthe interference structure (i.e., the number of interferers) as well as the\nabsolute levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Apr 2016 13:52:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Schiessl", "Sebastian", ""], ["Naghibi", "Farshad", ""], ["Al-Zubaidy", "Hussein", ""], ["Fidler", "Markus", ""], ["Gross", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00736", "submitter": "Mohammad Abu Alsheikh", "authors": "Mohammad Abu Alsheikh, Shaowei Lin, Dusit Niyato, Hwee-Pink Tan", "title": "Rate-distortion Balanced Data Compression for Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1408.2948", "journal-ref": "IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 16, no. 12, pp. 5072-5083, June15, 2016", "doi": "10.1109/JSEN.2016.2550599", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a data compression algorithm with error bound guarantee\nfor wireless sensor networks (WSNs) using compressing neural networks.

We\nsample from the resulting metamer sets to find color steps for each base color\nto embed a binary message into an arbitrary image with reduced visible\nartifacts. Unlike previous methods that rely on visually obtrusive intensity\nmodulation, we embed with color so that the message is more hidden.

In this paper, we formulate the cooperative spectrum sharing\nbetween multiple PUs and multiple SUs as a two-sided market, and study the\nmarket equilibrium under both complete and incomplete information. First, we\ncharacterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the market\nequilibrium. We analytically show that there may exist multiple market\nequilibria, among which there is always a unique Pareto-optimal equilibrium for\nPUs (called PU-Optimal-EQ), in which every PU achieves a utility no worse than\nin any other equilibrium. Then, we show that under complete information, the\nunique Pareto-optimal equilibrium PU-Optimal-EQ can always be achieved despite\nthe competition among PUs; whereas, under incomplete information, the\nPU-Optimal-EQ may not be achieved due to the mis-representations of SUs (in\nreporting their private information). Regarding this, we further study the\nworse-case equilibrium for PUs, and characterize a Robust equilibrium for PUs\n(called PU-Robust-EQ), which provides every PU a guaranteed utility under all\npossible mis-representation behaviors of SUs. Numerical results show that in a\ntypical network where the number of PUs and SUs are different, the performance\ngap between PU-Optimal-EQ and PU-Robust-EQ is quite small (e.g., less than 10%\nin the simulations).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 13:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Lin", ""], ["Duan", "Lingjie", ""], ["Huang", "Jianwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03823", "submitter": "Guilherme Thompson", "authors": "Fabrice Guillemin and Guilherme Thompson", "title": "Analysis of a trunk reservation policy in the framework of fog computing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.PF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze in this paper a system composed of two data centers with limited\ncapacity in terms of servers.

However, in a cellular network, FD\noperation is not a straightforward extension of half duplex operations. The\nincreased interference due to a large number of simultaneous transmissions in\nFD operation and realtime traffic conditions limits the capacity improvement.\nRealizing the potential of FD requires careful coordination of resource\nallocation among the cells as well as within the cell. In this paper, we\npropose a distributed resource allocation, i.e., joint user selection and power\nallocation for a FD multi-cell system, assuming FD base stations (BSs) and HD\nuser equipment (UEs). Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum\nsolution, a sub-optimal solution for UE selection, and a novel geometric\nprogramming based solution for power allocation, are proposed. The proposed\ndistributed approach converges quickly and performs almost as well as a\ncentralized solution, but with much lower signaling overhead. It provides a\nhybrid scheduling policy which allows FD operations whenever it is\nadvantageous, but otherwise defaults to HD operation. We focus on small cell\nsystems because they are more suitable for FD operation, given practical\nself-interference cancellation limits.With practical self-interference\ncancellation, it is shown that the proposed hybrid FD system achieves nearly\ntwo times throughput improvement for an indoor multi-cell scenario, and about\n65% improvement for an outdoor multi-cell scenario compared to the HD system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 19:07:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 20:13:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Goyal", "Sanjay", ""], ["Liu", "Pei", ""], ["Panwar", "Shivendra", ""]]}]
