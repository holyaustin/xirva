We use Ethernet AVB, which can guarantee\nnetwork bandwidth, to improve the real-time property of CAN messages through\nthe backbone Ethernet bus. To simulate the networks, we also developed a\nCAN--Ethernet AVB gateway (GW) model. To verify the efficacy of our model, we\nmeasured the latency of CAN messages sent from a CAN bus to an Ethernet AVB\nnode via the backbone Ethernet AVB bus in both bandwidth-guaranteed and\nbest-effort queue scenarios. The results indicate that the latency of Ethernet\nAVB frames containing CAN messages is minimized and limited by the\nbandwidth-guaranteed mechanism of Ethernet AVB.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 09:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kawahara", "Keigo", ""], ["Matsubara", "Yutaka", ""], ["Takada", "Hiroaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.1001", "submitter": "Matthias W\\\"ahlisch", "authors": "Gabriel Martins Dias, Boris Bellalta, Simon Oechsner", "title": "Towards information-centric WSN simulations", "comments": "Published in: A.

Since the proposed\nfast sensing method cannot identify the indices of inactive primary streams, we\nalso provide a fine sensing method based on the generalized likelihood ratio\ntest (GLRT) to decide the absence of individual primary streams. Simulation\nresults show that the proposed CR sensing and transmission scheme can, in\npractice, provide a significant throughput while causing no interference to the\nprimary receivers, and that the sensing detects the spatial holes of the\nprimary network with high detection probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 18:28:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Alizadeh", "Ardalan", ""], ["Bahrami", "Hamid Reza", ""], ["Maleki", "Mehdi", ""], ["Sastry", "Shivakumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.3917", "submitter": "Zhe He", "authors": "Zhe He, Rui-Jie Xu, Si-Wu Liu, Bing-Hong Wang", "title": "The upper bound of packet transmission capacity in local static routings", "comments": "7pages,4figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a universal analysis for static routings on networks and describe\nthe congestion characteristics by the theory.

In heterogeneous wireless\nsensor network some of the nodes are equipped with more energy than the other\nnodes.\n  Many routing algorithms are proposed for heterogeneous wireless sensor\nnetwork. Stable Election Protocol (SEP) is one of the important protocol in\nthis category. In this research paper a novel energy efficient distance based\ncluster protocol (DBCP) is proposed for single hop heterogeneous wireless\nsensor network to increase the life and energy efficiency of a sensor network.\nDBCP use the average distance of the sensor from the base station as the major\nissue for the selection of a cluster head in the sensor network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 07:11:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Surender", ""], ["Prateek", "Manish", ""], ["Bhushan", "Bharat", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.5828", "submitter": "Zoubeir Mlika", "authors": "Zoubeir Mlika, Mathew Goonewardena, Wessam Ajib, and Halima Elbiaze", "title": "User-Base Station Association in HetSNets: Complexity and Efficient\n  Algorithms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work considers the problem of user association to small-cell base\nstations (SBSs) in a heterogeneous and small-cell network (HetSNet).

Moreover, due\nto varied channel conditions, each client may suffer from different packet loss\nprobabilities, and retransmissions incur additional bandwidth consumption. To\naddress this issue, we first analyze the merit of view protection via DIBR for\nmulti-view video multicast and then design a new protocol, named Multi-View\nGroup Management Protocol (MVGMP), for the dynamic group management of\nmulticast users. Simulation results manifest that our protocol effectively\nreduces bandwidth consumption and increases the probability for each client to\nsuccessfully playback the desired view of a multi-view 3D video.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 23:38:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 07:31:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 04:51:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 03:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Chi-Heng", ""], ["Yang", "De-Nian", ""], ["Lin", "Chih-Chung", ""], ["Liao", "Wanjiun", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8359", "submitter": "Swayambhoo Jain", "authors": "Swayambhoo Jain, Seung-Jun Kim and Georgios B.

Furthermore, the scheduler is\nacquainted with channel state information periodically reported by user\nequipments either in an aggregate form for the whole downlink channel, or\ndistinguished for each available subchannel. This mechanism allows for wide\ndiscretion in resource allocation, thus promoting the flourishing of several\nscheduling algorithms, with different purposes. It is therefore of great\ninterest to compare the performance of such algorithms in different scenarios.\nA very common simulation tool that can be used for this purpose is ns-3, which\nalready supports a set of well known scheduling algorithms for LTE downlink,\nthough it still lacks schedulers that provide throughput guarantees. In this\nwork we contribute to fill this gap by implementing a scheduling algorithm that\nprovides long-term throughput guarantees to the different users, while\nopportunistically exploiting the instantaneous channel fluctuations to increase\nthe cell capacity. We then perform a thorough performance analysis of the\ndifferent scheduling algorithms by means of extensive ns-3 simulations, both\nfor saturated UDP and TCP traffic sources.
