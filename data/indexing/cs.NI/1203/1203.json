Tiresias leverages\nthe hierarchical structure of operational data to identify high-impact\naggregates (e.g., locations in the network, failure modes) likely to be\nassociated with anomalous events. To accommodate different kinds of operational\nnetwork data, Tiresias consists of an online detection algorithm with low time\nand space complexity, while preserving high detection accuracy. We present\nresults from two case studies using operational data collected at a large\ncommercial IP network operated by a Tier-1 ISP: customer care call logs and\nset-top box crash logs.

A distinguishing feature of wireless sensors is the need to perform\nboth source coding tasks, such as measurement and compression, and transmission\ntasks. It is known that the overall energy consumption for source coding is\ngenerally comparable to that of transmission, and that a joint design of the\ntwo classes of tasks can lead to relevant performance gains. Moreover, the\nefficiency of source coding in a sensor network can be potentially improved via\ndistributed techniques by leveraging the fact that signals measured by\ndifferent nodes are correlated.\n  In this paper, a data gathering protocol for multihop wireless sensor\nnetworks with energy harvesting capabilities is studied whereby the sources\nmeasured by the sensors are correlated. Both the energy consumptions of source\ncoding and transmission are modeled, and distributed source coding is assumed.\nThe problem of dynamically and jointly optimizing the source coding and\ntransmission strategies is formulated for time-varying channels and sources.\nThe problem consists in the minimization of a cost function of the distortions\nin the source reconstructions at the sink under queue stability constraints. By\nadopting perturbation-based Lyapunov techniques, a close-to-optimal online\nscheme is proposed that has an explicit and controllable trade-off between\noptimality gap and queue sizes.
