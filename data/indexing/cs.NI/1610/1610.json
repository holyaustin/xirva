A number of\ncrowdsourcing measurement apps (e.g., MobiPerf [4, 6] and Netalyzr [5, 7]) have\nbeen embarked for the last few years. Unlike existing apps that use active\nmeasurement methods, we employ a novel passive-active approach to continuously\nmonitor per-app network performance on unrooted smartphones without injecting\nadditional network traffic. By leveraging the VpnService API on Android,\nMopEye, our measurement app, intercepts all network traffic and then relays\nthem to their destinations using socket APIs. Therefore, not only MopEye can\nmeasure the round-trip time accurately, it can do so without injecting\nadditional traffic. As a result, the bandwidth cost (and monetary cost of data\nusage) for conducting such a measurement is eliminated, and the measurement can\nbe conducted free of user intervention. Our evaluation shows that MopEye's RTT\nmeasurement is very close to result of tcpdump and is more accurate than\nMobiPerf. We have used MopEye to conduct a one-week measurement revealing\nmultiple interesting findings on different apps' performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 06:41:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Daoyuan", ""], ["Li", "Weichao", ""], ["Chang", "Rocky K.

Thus, the available spectrum is not utilized efficiently. In\nthis work, we propose CSCR, a channel selection scheme for cooperation-based\nrouting protocols in CRNs. The proposed scheme increases the spectrum\nutilization through integrating the channels selection in the route discovery\nphase of the cooperation-based routing protocols. The best channels, that are\nless congested with primary users and that lead to minimum switching overhead,\nare chosen while constructing the cooperative group.

In this paper, a framework for joint\nresource bidding and tipping is developed where users iteratively revise their\nstrategies, which include bidding and incentivizing relays, to achieve their\nQuality of Service (QoS) requirements. A bidding language is designed to\ngeneralize secondary users' heterogeneous demands for multiple resources and\nwillingness to pay. Then, group partitioning-based auction mechanisms are\npresented to exploit the heterogeneity of SU demands in multi-hop secondary\nnetworks. These mechanisms include primary operator (PO) strategies based on\nstatic and dynamic partition schemes combined with new payment mechanisms to\nobtain high revenue and fairly allocate the resources. The proposed auction\nschemes stimulate the participation of SUs and provide high revenue for the PO\nwhile maximizing the social welfare. Besides, they satisfy the properties of\ntruthfulness, individual rationality and computational tractability. Simulation\nresults have shown that for highly demanding users the static group scheme\nachieves 150% more winners and 3 times higher revenue for the PO compared to a\nscheme without grouping. For lowly demanding users, the PO may keep similar\nrevenue with the dynamic scheme by lowering 50% the price per channel as the\nnumber of winners will increase proportionally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 09:53:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lorenzo", "Beatriz", ""], ["Kovacevic", "Ivana", ""], ["Peleteiro", "Ana", ""], ["Gonzalez-Castano", "Francisco J.", ""], ["Burguillo", "Juan C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.02895", "submitter": "Beatriz Lorenzo", "authors": "Beatriz Lorenzo, F.

The switches control the amount of credit packets by rate limiting\nand ensure data packets flow in the reverse direction without any loss.\nExpressPass leverages this to ramp up aggressively.

Meanwhile,\nalternative anchorless, solutions are not feasible due to the current\nlimitations of the IP semantics, which strongly ties addressing information to\nlocation. In contrast, novel path-based forwarding solutions may be exploited\nfor feasible anchorless solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nnetwork-based mobility management solution that facilitates IP mobility over\nsuch a path-based forwarding substrate. Our solution exploits the advantages of\nsuch substrates in decoupling path calculation from data transfer to eliminate\nthe need for anchoring traffic through the network core; thereby, allowing\nflexible path calculation and service provisioning. Furthermore, by eliminating\nthe limitation of routing via the anchor point, our approach reduces the\nnetwork cost compared to anchored solution through bandwidth saving while\nmaintaining comparable handover delay. We evaluate our solution through\nanalytical and simulation models and compare it with the IETF standardized\nsolution, Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6). Evaluation results illustrate a\nsignificant saving in the total network cost when using our proposed solution,\ncompared to its counterpart.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 20:50:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 12:27:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Al-Khalidi", "Mohammed", ""], ["Thomos", "Nikolaos", ""], ["Reed", "Martin J.", ""], ["AL-Naday", "Mays F.", ""], ["Trossen", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.09123", "submitter": "Wolfram Lautenschlaeger", "authors": "Wolfram Lautenschlaeger", "title": "The Weak Convergence of TCP Bandwidth Sharing", "comments": "15 pages", "journal-ref": "Anne, Haverkort, Boudewijn R.

The fluctuations are not short term but correlated over\nlong intervals, so that the carried data volume converges rather slowly. The\nweak convergence does not negate fairness in general.

The\ndominant MAC protocol for high data-rate PLC, the IEEE 1901, employs a CSMA/CA\nmechanism similar to the backoff process of 802.11. Existing performance\nevaluation studies of this protocol assume that the backoff processes of the\nstations are independent (the so-called decoupling assumption). However, in\ncontrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the\nmedium busy, which is regulated by the so-called deferral counter. This\nmechanism introduces strong coupling between the stations and, as a result,\nmakes existing analyses inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a performance\nmodel for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. We prove that\nour model admits a unique solution for a wide range of configurations and\nconfirm the accuracy of the model using simulations. Our results show that we\noutperform current models based on the decoupling assumption. In addition to\nevaluating the performance in steady state, we further study the transient\ndynamics of 1901, which is also affected by the deferral counter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 16:45:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Vlachou", "Christina", ""], ["Banchs", "Albert", ""], ["Herzen", "Julien", ""], ["Thiran", "Patrick", ""]]}]
