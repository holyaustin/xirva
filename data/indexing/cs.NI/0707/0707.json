A\nparticularly suitable application of the network coding arises for the two--way\nrelay channels, where two nodes communicate with each other assisted by using a\nthird, relay node. Such a scenario enables application of \\emph{physical\nnetwork coding}, where the network coding is either done (a) jointly with the\nchannel coding or (b) through physical combining of the communication flows\nover the multiple access channel. In this paper we first group the existing\nschemes for physical network coding into two generic schemes, termed 3--step\nand 2--step scheme, respectively. We investigate the conditions for\nmaximization of the two--way rate for each individual scheme: (1) the\nDecode--and--Forward (DF) 3--step schemes (2) three different schemes with two\nsteps: Amplify--and--Forward (AF), JDF and Denoise--and--Forward (DNF). While\nthe DNF scheme has a potential to offer the best two--way rate, the most\ninteresting result of the paper is that, for some SNR configurations of the\nsource--relay links, JDF yields identical maximal two--way rate as the upper\nbound on the rate for DNF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 16:40:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Popovski", "Petar", ""], ["Yomo", "Hiroyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0808", "submitter": "Patrick C.

It has been recently shown that network coding\ntechnique can significantly increase the overall throughput of wireless\nnetworks by taking advantage of their broadcast nature. In wireless networks,\neach transmitted packet is broadcasted within a certain area and can be\noverheard by the neighboring nodes. When a node needs to transmit packets, it\nemploys the opportunistic coding approach that uses the knowledge of what the\nnode's neighbors have heard in order to reduce the number of transmissions.\nWith this approach, each transmitted packet is a linear combination of the\noriginal packets over a certain finite field.\n  In this paper, we focus on the fundamental problem of finding the optimal\nencoding for the broadcasted packets that minimizes the overall number of\ntransmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete over GF(2) and\nestablish several fundamental properties of the optimal solution.
