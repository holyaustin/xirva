Such a sample allows to estimate any user property and some\ntopological properties as well. To this end, first, we consider and compare\nseveral candidate crawling techniques. Two approaches that can produce\napproximately uniform samples are the Metropolis-Hasting random walk (MHRW) and\na re-weighted random walk (RWRW). Both have pros and cons, which we demonstrate\nthrough a comparison to each other as well as to the \"ground truth.\" In\ncontrast, using Breadth-First-Search (BFS) or an unadjusted Random Walk (RW)\nleads to substantially biased results. Second, and in addition to offline\nperformance assessment, we introduce online formal convergence diagnostics to\nassess sample quality during the data collection process. We show how these\ndiagnostics can be used to effectively determine when a random walk sample is\nof adequate size and quality. Third, as a case study, we apply the above\nmethods to Facebook and we collect the first, to the best of our knowledge,\nrepresentative sample of Facebook users.

Despite all the hype, Internet services\nare liable to intrusion attack that could tamper the confidentiality and\nintegrity of important information. An attack started with gathering the\ninformation of the attack target, this gathering of information activity can be\ndone as either fast or slow attack. The defensive measure network administrator\ncan take to overcome this liability is by introducing Intrusion Detection\nSystems (IDSs) in their network. IDS have the capabilities to analyze the\nnetwork traffic and recognize incoming and on-going intrusion. Unfortunately\nthe combination of both modules in real time network traffic slowed down the\ndetection process. In real time network, early detection of fast attack can\nprevent any further attack and reduce the unauthorized access on the targeted\nmachine. The suitable set of feature selection and the correct threshold value,\nadd an extra advantage for IDS to detect anomalies in the network. Therefore\nthis paper discusses a new technique for selecting static threshold value from\na minimum standard features in detecting fast attack from the victim\nperspective. In order to increase the confidence of the threshold value the\nresult is verified using Statistical Process Control (SPC).
