By carefully studying the interaction between the transport and link\nlayers, we identify subtle but important modifications to both, achieving TCP\ngoodput within 25% of an upper bound (5-40x higher than prior results) and\nlow-power operation commensurate to CoAP in a practical LLN application\nscenario. This suggests that a TCP-based transport layer, seamlessly\ninteroperable with existing TCP/IP networks, is viable and performant in LLNs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2018 01:50:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Feb 2020 06:20:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 05:10:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Sam", ""], ["Andersen", "Michael P", ""], ["Kim", "Hyung-Sin", ""], ["Culler", "David E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.02741", "submitter": "Khondokar Fida Hasan", "authors": "Khondokar Fida Hasan, Yanming Feng and Yu-Chu Tian", "title": "GNSS Time Synchronization in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks: Benefits and\n  Feasibility", "comments": "10 pages", "journal-ref": "Hasan, Khondokar Fida, Yanming Feng, and Yu-Chu Tian. \"GNSS Time\n  Synchronization in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks: Benefits and Feasibility.\" IEEE\n  Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (2018)", "doi": "10.1109/TITS.2017.2789291", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Time synchronization is critical for the operation of distributed systems in\nnetworked environments.

For each level, key research topics and remaining\nproblems are identified in order to achieve a concrete step forward. 1. CONTEXT\nAND PROBLEMATICS Through studies on ICT solutions for energy control of\nbuildings, a 3-layers model is proposed to integrate these solutions and\nposition a new way for energy efficiency. The building sector is the largest\nuser of energy and CO 2 emitter in the EU, estimated at approximately 40% of\nthe total consumption (Sharples et al., 1999). According to the International\nPanel on Climate Change (European Union, 2010), 30% of energy used in buildings\ncould be reduced with net economic benefits by 2030. Such a reduction, however,\nis meaningless unless \"sustainability\" is considered. Because of these factors,\nhealthy, sustainable, and energy efficient buildings have become active topics\nin international research; there is an urgent need for a new kind of\nhigh-technology driven and integrative research that should lead to the massive\ndevelopment of smart buildings and, in the medium term, smart cities. From a\nbuilding lifecycle perspective, most of the energy (~80%) is consumed during\nthe operational stage of the building (European Union, 2010) (Bilsen et al.,\n2013). Reducing building energy consumption may be addressed by the physical\nmodifications which can be operated on a building like upgrading windows,\nheating systems or modifying thermic characteristics by insulating. Another\npossible path to reduce the energy consumption of a building is to use\nInformation and Communication Technologies (ICT). According to the\nInternational Panel on Climate Change, a reduction of energy even greater than\nthe 30% can be targeted by 2030 by considering ICT solutions. In support of\nthis claim, some specialists believe that ICT-based solutions have the\npotential to enable 50-80% greenhouse gas reduction globally. In this respect,\nICT innovation opens prospects for the development of a new range of new\nservices highly available, flexible, safe, easy to integrate, and user friendly\n(Bilsen et al., 2013). This, in turn, should foster a sophisticated, reliable\nand fast communication infrastructure for the connection of various distributed\nelements (sensors, generators, substations...) that enables to exchange\nreal-time data, information and knowledge needed to improve efficiency (e.g.,\nto monitor and control energy consumption), reliability (e.g., to facilitate\nmaintenance operations), flexibility (e.g., to integrate new rules to meet new\nconsumer expectations), and investment returns, but also to induce a shift in\nconsumer behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2018 13:07:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["David", "Michael", "", "CRAN"], ["Aubry", "A.", "", "CRAN"], ["Derigent", "W.", "", "CRAN"]]}, {"id": "1811.09221", "submitter": "Benedikt Jahnel", "authors": "Alexander Hinsen, Christian Hirsch, Benedikt Jahnel and Elie Cali", "title": "The typical cell in anisotropic tessellations", "comments": "7 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The typical cell is a key concept for stochastic-geometry based modeling in\ncommunication networks, as it provides a rigorous framework for describing\nproperties of a serving zone associated with a component selected at random in\na large network.

However, the SCH can be used as an\nalternative to transmit high priority safety messages in the event that they\nare invoked during the service channel interval (SCHI).

By empirical\nmeans and statistics, we then show that the regression model generated with a\nfeedforward neural networks trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is not\nonly the best option considering computational resources, but also achieves the\nbest solution quality for relevant applications and large-scale networks.\nKeywords: Vertex Centrality Measures, Neural Networks, Complex Network Models,\nMachine Learning, Regression Model\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Oct 2018 03:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Grando", "Felipe", ""], ["Lamb", "Luis C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12901", "submitter": "Vaneet Aggarwal", "authors": "Yang Zhang and Arnob Ghosh and Vaneet Aggarwal", "title": "Optimized Portfolio Contracts for Bidding the Cloud", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Amazon EC2 provides two most popular pricing schemes--i) the {\\em costly}\non-demand instance where the job is guaranteed to be completed, and ii) the\n{\\em cheap} spot instance where a job may be interrupted. We consider a user\ncan select a combination of on-demand and spot instances to finish a task. Thus\nhe needs to find the optimal bidding price for the spot-instance, and the\nportion of the job to be run on the on-demand instance. We formulate the\nproblem as an optimization problem and seek to find the optimal solution. We\nconsider three bidding strategies: one-time requests with expected guarantee\nand one-time requests with penalty for incomplete job and violating the\ndeadline, and persistent requests. Even without a penalty on incomplete jobs,\nthe optimization problem turns out to be non-convex. Nevertheless, we show that\nthe portion of the job to be run on the on-demand instance is at most half. If\nthe job has a higher execution time or smaller deadline, the bidding price is\nhigher and vice versa. Additionally, the user never selects the on-demand\ninstance if the execution time is smaller than the deadline.\n  The numerical results illustrate the sensitivity of the effective portfolio\nto several of the parameters involved in the model. Our empirical analysis on\nthe Amazon EC2 data shows that our strategies can be employed on the real\ninstances, where the expected total cost of the proposed scheme decreases over\n45\\% compared to the baseline strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 17:25:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yang", ""], ["Ghosh", "Arnob", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.12924", "submitter": "Vaneet Aggarwal", "authors": "Abubakr Alabbasi and Vaneet Aggarwal", "title": "Joint Information Freshness and Completion Time Optimization for\n  Vehicular Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The demand for real-time cloud applications has seen an unprecedented growth\nover the past decade. These applications require rapidly data transfer and fast\ncomputations. This paper considers a scenario where multiple IoT devices update\ninformation on the cloud, and request a computation from the cloud at certain\ntimes. The time required to complete the request for computation includes the\ntime to wait for computation to start on busy virtual machines, performing the\ncomputation, waiting and service in the networking stage for delivering the\noutput to the end user. In this context, the freshness of the information is an\nimportant concern and is different from the completion time. This paper\nproposes novel scheduling strategies for both computation and networking\nstages. Based on these strategies, the age-of-information (AoI) metric and the\ncompletion time are characterized. A convex combination of the two metrics is\noptimized over the scheduling parameters. The problem is shown to be convex and\nthus can be solved optimally. Moreover, based on the offline policy, an online\nalgorithm for job scheduling is developed. Numerical results demonstrate\nsignificant improvement as compared to the considered baselines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 18:23:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Alabbasi", "Abubakr", ""], ["Aggarwal", "Vaneet", ""]]}]
