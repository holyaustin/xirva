A practical solution to the\nproblem has been proposed aggregating the bandwidth of 802.11 Access Points\n(APs) backhauls in range via 802.11 connections. Since 802.11 devices are\nusually single-radio, the communication to multiple APs on different\nradio-channels requires the introduction of a time-division multiple access\n(TDMA) policy at the client station. Current investigation in this area\nsupposes that there is a sufficient number of TCP flows to saturate the\nAsymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) behind the APs. However, this may be\nnot guaranteed according to the user traffic pattern. As a consequence, a TDMA\npolicy introduces additional delays in the end-to-end transmissions that will\ncause degradation of the TCP throughput and an under-utilization of the AP\nbackhauls. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth experimental analysis\nwith a customized 802.11 driver of how the usage of multi-AP TDMA affects the\nobserved Round-Trip-Time (RTT) of TCP flows. Then, we introduce a simple\nanalytical model that accurately predicts the TCP RTT when accessing the\nwireless medium with a Multi-AP TDMA policy. Based on this model, we propose a\nresource allocation algorithm that runs locally at the station and it greatly\nreduces the observed TCP RTT with a very low computational cost. Our proposed\nscheme can improve up to 1:5 times the aggregate throughput observed by the\nstation compared to state-of-the-art multi-AP TDMA allocations.

We have considered these problems in theory and practice and\nreached the following conclusion; in order to build an ideal system for\nautonomic communication, there are three key problems to be solved.

Differing from the\ntraditional hierarchical P2P (i.e. tree-like structure) overlay, (1) MPO is\ncomposed of levels and layers, which uses small world characteristic to improve\nefficiency, and the maintenance cost is decreased because update and backup\nonly take place in two neighboring levels or layers instead of recursively\nperform in higher levels. (2) Unlike normal redundant mechanisms for solving\nthe single fault problem: Tri-Information Center (Tri-IC) mechanism is\npresented in order to improve robustness by alleviating the load of cluster\nheads in a hierarchical P2P overlay.

In actual fact, about 90% of connections on the internet use TCP to\ncommunicate. Through several upgrades and improvements, TCP became well\noptimized for the very reliable wired networks. As a result, TCP considers all\npacket timeouts in wired networks as due to network congestion and not to bit\nerrors. However, with networking becoming more heterogeneous, providing wired\nas well as wireless topologies, TCP suffers from performance degradation over\nerror-prone wireless links as it has no mechanism to differentiate error losses\nfrom congestion losses. It therefore considers all packet losses as due to\ncongestion and consequently reduces the burst of packet, diminishing at the\nsame time the network throughput. This paper proposes a new TCP congestion\ncontrol scheme appropriate for wireless as well as wired networks and is\ncapable of distinguishing congestion losses from error losses. The proposed\nscheme is based on using the reserved field of the TCP header to indicate\nwhether the established connection is over a wired or a wireless link.\nAdditionally, the proposed scheme leverages the SNR ratio to detect the\nreliability of the link and decide whether to reduce packet burst or retransmit\na timed-out packet. Experiments conducted, revealed that the proposed scheme\nproved to behave correctly in situations where timeouts were due to error and\nnot to congestion.

Our simulations show that MDF\nsignificantly reduces the expected time required for all the chunks (or\nequivalently, all the message packets) to be decodable compared to the existing\nscheduling policies for line networks with feedback. The improvements are\nparticularly profound (up to about 46% for the tested cases) for smaller chunks\nand larger networks which are of more practical interest. The improvement in\nthe performance of the proposed scheduling policy comes at the cost of more\ncomputations, and a slight increase in the amount of feedback. We also propose\na low-complexity version of MDF with a rather small loss in the performance,\nreferred to as minimumcurrent-metric-first (MCMF). The MCMF policy is based on\nthe expected number of innovative packet transmissions prior to the \"current\"\ntransmission time, as opposed to the next transmission time, used in MDF. Our\nsimulations (over line networks) demonstrate that MCMF is always superior to RP\nand LRF policies, and the superiority becomes more pronounced for smaller\nchunks and larger networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 15:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Heidarzadeh", "Anoosheh", ""], ["Banihashemi", "Amir H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5138", "submitter": "Raja Jitendra Nayaka Mr.", "authors": "Raja Jitendra Nayaka, R.

This paper is an\nattempt to fill this gap. We put forth two ideas: 1) A general network can be\ndecomposed into small building blocks of PNC, referred to as the PNC atoms, for\nscheduling of PNC transmissions. 2) We identify nine PNC atoms, with TWRC being\none of them. Three major results are as follows. First, using the decomposition\nframework, the throughput performance of PNC is shown to be significantly\nbetter than those of the traditional multi-hop scheme and the conventional\nnetwork coding scheme. For example, under heavy traffic volume, PNC can achieve\n100% throughput gain relative to the traditional multi-hop scheme. Second, PNC\ndecomposition based on a variety of different PNC atoms can yield much better\nperformance than PNC decomposition based on the TWRC atom alone. Third, three\nout of the nine atoms are most important to good performance.

We formulate the robust minimum relay placement problem and the robust\nmaximum utility relay placement problem with the objective to minimize the\nnumber of relays deployed and maximize the network utility, respectively.\nEfficient algorithms are developed to solve both problems and have been shown\nto incur less service disruption in presence of moving subjects that may block\nthe LOS paths in the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2012 10:02:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 02:08:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 15 Dec 2012 08:19:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Guanbo", ""], ["Hua", "Cunqing", ""], ["Zheng", "Rong", ""], ["Wang", "Qixin", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6603", "submitter": "Shuang Li", "authors": "Shuang Li, Zizhan Zheng, Eylem Ekici, Ness Shroff", "title": "Maximizing Social Welfare in Operator-based Cognitive Radio Networks\n  under Spectrum Uncertainty and Sensing Inaccuracy", "comments": "submitted to Infocom 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  In Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs), secondary users (SUs) are allowed to\nopportunistically access the unused/under-utilized channels of primary users\n(PUs).

Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for different\nvalues of the coding block size K as a function of n, as n approaches infinity.\nFor finite values of K and n, under the more restrictive assumption of\nGilbert-Elliott channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximum\nachievable throughput. Using simulations we show the tightness of the bound\nwith respect to system parameters n and K, and find that its performance is\nsignificantly better than the previously known lower bounds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 15:58:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yang", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7304", "submitter": "Hanen Idoudi Dr.", "authors": "Hanen Idoudi, Chiraz Houaidia, Leila Azouz Saidane, Pascale Minet", "title": "Robots-Assisted Redeployment in Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": "Journal of Networking Technology, Dline, Vol. 3, No. 1, March 2012", "journal-ref": "Journal of Networking Technology, Dline, Vol. 3, No. 1, March 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Connectivity and coverage are two crucial problems for wireless sensor\nnetworks.

In our work, we propose a new hierarchical architecture for sensor\nnetworks that facilitates the gathering of redundancy information of the\ntopology. Several mobile robots must then relocate, in an optimized way,\nredundant sensors to achieve optimal connectivity and coverage of the network.\nMobile robots have to cooperate and coordinate their movement.
