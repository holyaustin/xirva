We show that mixing operations in network coding can induce\npacket anonymity that allows the inter-connections in a network to be\ndecoupled. This enables each intermediate node to consider complex network\ninter-connections as a node-environment interaction such that the Markov\ndecision process (MDP) can be employed at each intermediate node. The optimal\npolicy that can be obtained by solving the MDP provides each node with optimal\namount of changes in transmission range given network dynamics (e.g., the\nnumber of nodes in the range and channel condition).

Experimental\nresults for the performance of building/floor estimation and floor-level\ncoordinates estimation of a given location demonstrate the feasibility of the\nproposed DNN-based indoor localization system, which can provide near\nstate-of-the-art performance using a single DNN, for the implementation with\nlower complexity and energy consumption at mobile devices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Dec 2017 01:06:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Kyeong Soo", ""], ["Lee", "Sanghyuk", ""], ["Huang", "Kaizhu", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.02055", "submitter": "Mikhail Vilgelm", "authors": "Mikhail Vilgelm, Sebastian Schiessl, Hussein Al-Zubaidy, Wolfgang\n  Kellerer, James Gross", "title": "On the Reliability of LTE Random Access: Performance Bounds for\n  Machine-to-Machine Burst Resolution Time", "comments": "Presented at IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC),\n  2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Random Access Channel (RACH) has been identified as one of the major\nbottlenecks for accommodating massive number of machine-to-machine (M2M) users\nin LTE networks, especially for the case of burst arrival of connection\nrequests.

To tackle this\nchallenge, mobile edge caching has emerged as a promising paradigm recently, in\nwhich the service providers (SPs) prefetch some popular contents in advance and\ncache them locally at the network edge. When requested, those locally cached\ncontents can be directly delivered to users with low latency, thus alleviating\nthe traffic load over backhaul channels during peak hours and enhancing the\nquality-of-experience (QoE) of users simultaneously. Due to the limited\navailable cache space, it makes sense for the SP to cache the most profitable\ncontents. Nevertheless, users' true valuations of contents are their private\nknowledge, which is unknown to the SP in general. This information asymmetry\nposes a significant challenge for effective caching at the SP side. Further,\nthe cached contents can be delivered with different quality, which needs to be\nchosen judiciously to balance delivery costs and user satisfaction. To tackle\nthese difficulties, in this paper, we propose an optimal auction mechanism from\nthe perspective of the SP. In the auction, the SP determines the cache space\nallocation over contents and user payments based on the users' (possibly\nuntruthful) reports of their valuations so that the SP's expected revenue is\nmaximized. The advocated mechanism is designed to elicit true valuations from\nthe users (incentive compatibility) and to incentivize user participation\n(individual rationality). In addition, we devise a computationally efficient\nmethod for calculating the optimal cache space allocation and user payments. We\nfurther examine the optimal choice of the content delivery quality for the case\nwith a large number of users and derive a closed-form solution to compute the\noptimal delivery quality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Dec 2017 02:46:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Xuanyu", ""], ["Zhang", "Junshan", ""], ["Poor", "H.

With a\ngreatly increased data rate from huge bandwidth of mmWave communications,\nenergy consumption should be mitigated for higher energy efficiency. Due to\ncontent popularity, many content-based mobile applications can be supported by\nthe multicast service. mmWave communications exploit directional antennas to\novercome high path loss, and concurrent transmissions can be enabled for better\nmulticast service.

In\nthis paper, we propose an energy efficient multicast scheduling scheme,\nreferred to as EMS, which utilizes both D2D communications and concurrent\ntransmissions to achieve high energy efficiency. In EMS, a D2D path planning\nalgorithm establishes multi-hop D2D transmission paths, and a concurrent\nscheduling algorithm allocates the links on the D2D paths into different\npairings.

Our second algorithm, called BFF (best first fit), is the\nfirst hybrid switching solution that exploits the potential partial\nreconfiguration capability of the circuit switch for performance gains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Dec 2017 19:24:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Liang", ""], ["Gong", "Long", ""], ["Yang", "Sen", ""], ["Xu", "Jun", ""], ["Fortnow", "Lance", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.06676", "submitter": "Haitham Afifi", "authors": "Haitham Afifi, Sebastien Auroux, Holger Karl", "title": "MARVELO: Wireless Virtual Network Embedding for Overlay Graphs with\n  Loops", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When deploying resource-intensive signal processing applications in wireless\nsensor or mesh networks, distributing processing blocks over multiple nodes\nbecomes promising.

Thus, any\nsoftware and hardware element in that cycle can be a potential cause of\nunderlying network problems. In this paper, we present and solve a network\npolicy fault localization problem that arises in operating policy management\nframeworks for a production network. We formulate our problem via risk modeling\nand propose a greedy algorithm that quickly localizes faulty policy objects in\nthe network policy. We then design and develop SCOUT---a fully-automated system\nthat produces faulty policy objects and further pinpoints physical-level\nfailures which made the objects faulty. Evaluation results using a real testbed\nand extensive simulations demonstrate that SCOUT detects faulty objects with\nsmall false positives and false negatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Dec 2017 18:06:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Tammana", "Praveen", ""], ["Nagarajan", "Chandra", ""], ["Mamillapalli", "Pavan", ""], ["Kompella", "Ramana Rao", ""], ["Lee", "Myungjin", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.08221", "submitter": "St\\'ephane Delbruel", "authors": "St\\'ephane Delbruel, Nicolas Small, Emekcan Aras, Jonathan Oostvogels,\n  Danny Hughes", "title": "Tackling Contention Through Cooperation: A Distributed Federation in\n  LoRaWAN Space", "comments": "proceedings of EWSN 2020", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN) play a key role in the IoT marketplace\nwherein LoRaWAN is considered a leading solution.

In this\nwork, we present an algorithm to approximate the failure frequency for any\ngiven multiplicative error factor that runs in polynomial time in the number of\n(minimal) cutsets. Moreover, for the special case of all-terminal reliability\nsystems, i.e., where all nodes are terminals, we propose an algorithm for\napproximating the failure frequency within an arbitrary multiplicative error\nthat runs in polynomial time in the number of nodes (which can be much smaller\nthan the number of cutsets). In addition, our simulation results confirm that\nthe proposed method is much faster and more accurate than the Monte Carlo\nsimulation technique for approximating the failure frequency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 20:05:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Heidarzadeh", "Anoosheh", ""], ["Sprintson", "Alex", ""], ["Singh", "Chanan", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.09721", "submitter": "SeungGwan Hong", "authors": "Seung Gwan Hong, Yu Min Hwang, Sun Yui Lee, Yoan Shin, Dong In Kim,\n  and Jin Young Kim", "title": "Analysis of the Game-Theoretic Modeling of Backscatter Wireless Sensor\n  Networks under Smart Interference", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.GT math.FA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study an interference avoidance scenario in the presence of\na smart interferer which can rapidly observe the transmit power of a\nbackscatter wireless sensor network (WSN) and effectively interrupt backscatter\nsignals.
