However, state-of-the-art techniques fall short of\ndetecting more elaborate types of attack. To study such attacks, we devise a\nnovel formalization of Internet routing, and apply this model to routing\nanomalies in order to establish a comprehensive attacker model. We use this\nmodel to precisely classify attacks and to evaluate their impact and\ndetectability. We analyze the eligibility of attack tactics that suit an\nattacker's goals and demonstrate that related work mostly focuses on less\nimpactful kinds of attacks.\n  We further propose, implement and test the Hijacking Event Analysis Program\n(HEAP), a new approach to investigate hijacking alarms. Our approachis designed\nto seamlessly integrate with previous work in order to reduce the high rates of\nfalse alarms inherent to these techniques. We leverage several unique data\nsources that can reliably disprove malicious intent. First, we make use of an\nInternet Routing Registry to derive business or organisational relationships\nbetween the parties involved in an event. Second, we use a topology-based\nreasoning algorithm to rule out events caused by legitimate operational\npractice. Finally, we use Internet-wide network scans to identify\nSSL/TLS-enabled hosts, which helps to identify non-malicious events by\ncomparing public keys prior to and during an event. In our evaluation, we prove\nthe effectiveness of our approach, and show that day-to-day routing anomalies\nare harmless for the most part. More importantly, we use HEAP to assess the\nvalidity of publicly reported alarms. We invite researchers to interface with\nHEAP in order to cross-check and narrow down their hijacking alerts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 02:05:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Schlamp", "Johann", ""], ["Holz", "Ralph", ""], ["Jacquemart", "Quentin", ""], ["Carle", "Georg", ""], ["Biersack", "Ernst W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00298", "submitter": "Christoph Lenzen", "authors": "Christoph Lenzen and Roger Wattenhofer", "title": "CLEX: Yet Another Supercomputer Architecture?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose the CLEX supercomputer topology and routing scheme.

In this paper, we characterize the exact\nsecrecy capacity of the MIMO wiretap channel under transmitter and\nreceiver-side power constraints.

We present\ntwo achievable schemes that achieve the secrecy capacity: the first achievable\nscheme uses a Gaussian codebook with a fixed mean, and the second achievable\nscheme uses artificial noise (or cooperative jamming) together with a Gaussian\ncodebook. The role of the mean or the artificial noise is to enable energy\ntransfer without sacrificing from the secure rate. This is the first instance\nof a channel model where either the use of a mean signal or the use of channel\nprefixing via artificial noise is strictly necessary for the MIMO wiretap\nchannel.

In this paper, we show how to increase NoC resilience against a\nconcrete type of security attack, named side-channel attack, which exploit the\ncorrelation between specific non-functional properties (such as packet\nlatencies and routes, in the case of NoCs) to infer the functional behaviour of\nsecure applications. For instance, the transmission of a packet over a given\nlink of the NoC may hint on a cache miss, which can be used by an attacker to\nguess specific parts of a secret cryptographic key, effectively weakening it.\n  We therefore propose packet route randomisation as a mechanism to increase\nNoC resilience against side-channel attacks, focusing specifically on the\npotential impact of such an approach upon hard real-time systems, where\nschedulability is a vital design requirement. Using an evolutionary\noptimisation approach, we show how to effectively apply route randomisation in\nsuch a way that it can increase NoC security while controlling its impact on\nhard real-time performance guarantees. Extensive experimental evidence based on\nanalytical and simulation models supports our findings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 18:04:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Indrusiak", "Leandro Soares", ""], ["Harbin", "James", ""], ["Sepulveda", "Martha Johanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.03571", "submitter": "Chun-Hung Liu", "authors": "Chun-Hung Liu and Hong-Cheng Tsai", "title": "Traffic Management for Heterogeneous Networks with Opportunistic\n  Unlicensed Spectrum Sharing", "comments": "30 pages, 6 figures, journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies how to maximize the per-user-based throughput in an M-tier\nheterogeneous wireless network (HetNet) by optimally managing traffic flows\nbetween the access points (APs) in the HetNet.
