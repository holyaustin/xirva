This\npaper studies the case of a relay channel, where the source's objective is to\ndeliver a given number of data packets to a receiver with the aid of a relay.\nThe source broadcasts to both the receiver and the relay using one frequency,\nwhile the relay uses another frequency for transmissions to the receiver,\nallowing for a full-duplex operation of the relay. We analyze the decoding\ncomplexity and delay performance of two types of relays: one that preserves the\nsystematic structure of the code from the source; another that does not. A\nsystematic relay forwards uncoded packets upon reception, but transmits coded\npackets to the receiver after receiving the first coded packet from the source.\nOn the other hand, a non-systematic relay always transmits linear combinations\nof previously received packets. We compare the performance of these two\nalternatives by analytically characterizing the expected transmission\ncompletion time as well as the number of uncoded packets forwarded by the\nrelay. Our numerical results show that, for a poor channel between the source\nand the receiver, preserving the systematic structure at the relay (i) allows a\nsignificant increase in the number of uncoded packets received by the receiver,\nthus reducing the decoding complexity, and (ii) preserves close to optimal\ndelay performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Mar 2012 21:41:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Giacaglia", "Giuliano", ""], ["Shi", "Xiaomeng", ""], ["Kim", "MinJi", ""], ["Lucani", "Daniel E.", ""], ["Medard", "Muriel", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0094", "submitter": "Nikzad Babaii-Rizvandi", "authors": "Thava Iyer, Robert Hsieh, Nikzad Babaii Rizvandi, Benoy Varghese,\n  Roksana Boreli", "title": "Mobile P2P Trusted On-Demand Video Streaming", "comments": "Published as demo in Local Computer Network conference (LCN 2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose to demonstrate a mobile server assisted P2P system for on-demand\nvideo streaming.

To achieve this issue, this paper proposes an intelligent\nnetwork selection strategy which combines two multi attribute decision making\n(MADM) methods such as analytic network process (ANP) and the technique for\norder preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method. The ANP\nmethod is used to find the differentiate weights of available networks by\nconsidering each criterion and the TOPSIS method is applied to rank the\nalternatives. Our new strategy for network selection can dealing with the\nlimitations of MADM methods which are the ranking abnormality and the ping-ponf\neffect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 00:19:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Lahby", "Mohamed", ""], ["Cherkaoui", "Leghris", ""], ["Adib", "Abdellah", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.1400", "submitter": "Guoqiang Mao Dr", "authors": "Guoqiang Mao and Brian Do Anderson", "title": "Connectivity of Large Wireless Networks under A Generic Connection Model", "comments": "accepted to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory. arXiv\n  admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1103.1994, arXiv:1012.5693,\n  arXiv:1103.1991, arXiv:1012.5723", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper provides a necessary and sufficient condition for a random network\nwith nodes Poissonly distributed on a unit square and a pair of nodes directly\nconnected following a generic random connection model to be asymptotically\nalmost surely connected.

In that context, voting systems represent\nan interesting alternative that, to our knowledge, has not yet been considered.\nThey allow competing entities to decide among different options. Strong\ntheoretical results showed that all voting systems are susceptible to be\nmanipulated by one single voter, except for some \"degenerated\" and\nnon-acceptable cases. However, very little is known about how much a voting\nsystem is manipulable in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate\nempirically the use of voting systems for choosing end-to-end paths in\nmulti-carrier networks, analyzing their manipulability and their economical\nefficiency. We show that one particular system, called \\Single Transferable\nVote (STV), is largely more resistant to manipulability than the natural system\nwhich tries to get the economical optimum. Moreover, STV manages to select\npaths close to the economical optimum, whether the participants try to cheat or\nnot.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2012 05:30:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Durand", "Fran\u00e7ois", "", "LINCS, INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Mathieu", "Fabien", "", "LINCS, INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Noirie", "Ludovic", "", "LINCS"]]}, {"id": "1204.6537", "submitter": "Gonzalo Mateos", "authors": "Morteza Mardani, Gonzalo Mateos, and Georgios B.

This fundamental identifiability issue\narises with traffic anomaly detection in backbone networks, and subsumes\ncompressed sensing as well as the timely low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery\ntasks encountered in matrix decomposition problems. Leveraging the ability of\n$\\ell_1$- and nuclear norms to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convex\nprogram is formulated to estimate the unknowns. Analysis and simulations\nconfirm that the said convex program can recover the unknowns for sufficiently\nlow-rank and sparse enough components, along with a compression matrix\npossessing an isometry property when restricted to operate on sparse vectors.\nWhen the low-rank, sparse, and compression matrices are drawn from certain\nrandom ensembles, it is established that exact recovery is possible with high\nprobability. First-order algorithms are developed to solve the nonsmooth convex\noptimization problem with provable iteration complexity guarantees. Insightful\ntests with synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the\nnovel approach in unveiling traffic anomalies across flows and time, and its\nability to outperform existing alternatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 02:39:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mardani", "Morteza", ""], ["Mateos", "Gonzalo", ""], ["Giannakis", "Georgios B.", ""]]}]
