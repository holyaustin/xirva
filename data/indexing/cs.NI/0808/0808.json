More specifically, in\nthis paper we seek to answer the following question: Given a network in which\nthe majority of nodes are controlled by a malicious adversary and whose\ntopology is changing every round, is it possible to develop a protocol with\npolynomially-bounded memory per processor that guarantees throughput-efficient\nand correct end-to-end communication? We answer the question affirmatively for\nextremely general corruption patterns: we only request that the topology of the\nnetwork and the corruption pattern of the adversary leaves at least one path\neach round connecting the sender and receiver through honest nodes (though this\npath may change at every round). Out construction works in the public-key\nsetting and enjoys bounded memory per processor (that does not depend on the\namount of traffic and is polynomial in the network size.) Our protocol achieves\noptimal transfer rate with negligible decoding error. We stress that our\nprotocol assumes no knowledge of which nodes are corrupted nor which path is\nreliable at any round, and is also fully distributed with nodes making\ndecisions locally, so that they need not know the topology of the network at\nany time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2008 19:11:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2008 15:27:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 3 Jan 2009 23:25:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Amir", "Yair", ""], ["Bunn", "Paul", ""], ["Ostrovksy", "Rafail", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0202", "submitter": "Yong Gao", "authors": "Yong Gao", "title": "The Degree Distribution of Random k-Trees", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.tcs.2008.10.015", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A power law degree distribution is established for a graph evolution model\nbased on the graph class of k-trees.

We identify another type of\nparadox in cooperation scenario. We identify that when we increase the degree\nof cooperation of a user while other users keep unchanged their degree of\ncooperation, leads to an improvement in performance of that user. We then\npursue the exploration and carry it on to the setting of Mixed equilibrium\n(i.e. some users are non atomic-they have infinitesimally small demand, and\nother have finite fixed demand). We finally obtain some theoretical results\nthat show that for low degree of cooperation the equilibrium is unique,\nconfirming the results of our numerical study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 12:49:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 22:39:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Oct 2008 16:34:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Azad", "Amar Prakash", ""], ["Altman", "Eitan", ""], ["El-Azouzi", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4104", "submitter": "Dominik Schatzmann", "authors": "Dominik Schatzmann, Martin Burkhart, Thrasyvoulos Spyropoulos", "title": "Flow-level Characteristics of Spam and Ham", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "TIK-Report No. 291", "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite a large amount of effort devoted in the past years trying to limit\nunsolicited mail, spam is still a major global concern. Content-analysis\ntechniques and blacklists, the most popular methods used to identify and block\nspam, are beginning to lose their edge in the battle. We argue here that one\nnot only needs to look into the network-related characteristics of spam\ntraffic, as has been recently suggested, but also to look deeper into the\nnetwork core, in order to counter the increasing sophistication of spam-ing\nmethods. Yet, at the same time, local knowledge available at a given server can\noften be irreplaceable in identifying specific spammers. To this end, in this\npaper we show how the local intelligence of mail servers can be gathered and\ncorrelated pas- sively at the ISP-level providing valuable network-wide\ninformation. Specifically, we use first a large network flow trace from a\nmedium size, national ISP, to demonstrate that the pre-filtering decisions of\nindividual mail servers can be tracked and combined at the flow level. Then, we\nargue that such aggregated knowledge not only can allow ISPs to develop and\nevaluate powerful new methods for fighting spam, but also to monitor remotely\nwhat their own servers are doing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 14:34:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Schatzmann", "Dominik", ""], ["Burkhart", "Martin", ""], ["Spyropoulos", "Thrasyvoulos", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4146", "submitter": "RadhaKrishna Ganti", "authors": "RadhaKrishna Ganti and Martin Haenggi", "title": "Dynamic Connectivity in ALOHA Ad Hoc Networks", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a wireless network the set of transmitting nodes changes frequently\nbecause of the MAC scheduler and the traffic load. Previously, connectivity in\nwireless networks was analyzed using static geometric graphs, and as we show\nleads to an overly constrained design criterion. The dynamic nature of the\ntransmitting set introduces additional randomness in a wireless system that\nimproves the connectivity, and this additional randomness is not captured by a\nstatic connectivity graph. In this paper, we consider an ad hoc network with\nhalf-duplex radios that uses multihop routing and slotted ALOHA for the MAC\ncontention and introduce a random dynamic multi-digraph to model its\nconnectivity. We first provide analytical results about the degree distribution\nof the graph. Next, defining the path formation time as the minimum time\nrequired for a causal path to form between the source and destination on the\ndynamic graph, we derive the distributional properties of the connection delay\nusing techniques from first-passage percolation and epidemic processes. We\nconsider the giant component of the network formed when communication is\nnoise-limited (by neglecting interference). Then, in the presence of\ninterference, we prove that the delay scales linearly with the\nsource-destination distance on this giant component. We also provide simulation\nresults to support the theoretical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 18:24:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Mar 2010 22:12:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ganti", "RadhaKrishna", ""], ["Haenggi", "Martin", ""]]}]
