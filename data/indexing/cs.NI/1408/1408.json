Such\nsolutions envision non-traditional communication scenarios, such as disaster\nareas and development regions. Several forwarding algorithms have been\ninvestigated, aiming to offer the best trade-off between cost (number of\nmessage replicas) and rate of successful message delivery. Among such\nproposals, there has been an effort to employ social similarity inferred from\nuser mobility patterns in opportunistic routing solutions to improve\nforwarding. However, these research effort presents two major limitations:\nfirst, it is focused on distribution of the intercontact time over the complete\nnetwork structure, ignoring the impact that human behavior has on the dynamics\nof the network; and second, most of the proposed solutions look at challenging\nnetworking environments where networks have low density, ignoring the potential\nuse of delay-tolerant networking to support low cost communications in networks\nwith higher density, such as urban scenarios. This paper presents a study of\nthe impact that human behavior has on opportunistic forwarding. Our goal is\ntwofold: i) to show that performance in low and high density networks can be\nimproved by taking the dynamics of the network into account; and ii) to show\nthat the delay-tolerant networking can be used to reduce communication costs in\nnetworks with higher density by taking the behavior of the user into account.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 09:04:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moreira", "Waldir", ""], ["Mendes", "Paulo", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0391", "submitter": "Matthias W\\\"ahlisch", "authors": "Matthias W\\\"ahlisch and Robert Schmidt and Thomas C.

Advanced nodes use a separate probability\nbased scheme for cluster head election and they will further act as a gateway\nfor normal cluster heads and transmit their data load to base station when they\nare not doing the duty of a cluster head.

However, centralized control may face\nscalability issues when the network size or the number of traffic flows\nincreases. Also, a centralized controller may form a single point of failure,\nthereby affecting the network resilience.\n  This article provides an overview of SDN that focuses on (1) scalability\nconcerning the increased control overhead faced by a central controller, and\n(2) resiliency in terms of protection against controller failure, network\ntopology failure and security in terms of malicious attacks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 15:58:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["van Asten", "Benjamin J.", ""], ["van Adrichem", "Niels L.

It however may be vulnerable to security\nproblems as the primary and secondary network access the same resource.\nTherefore, in this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of a cognitive\nradio network in the presence of an eavesdropper (EAV) who illegally listens to\nthe primary user (PU) communication in which the transmit power of the\nsecondary transmitter (SU-Tx) is subject to the joint constraint of peak\ntransmit power of the SU-Tx and outage probability of the PU. Accordingly, an\nadaptive transmit power policy and an analytical expression of symbol error\nprobability are derived for the SU. Most importantly, security evaluations of\nprimary network in terms of the probability of existence of non-zero secrecy\ncapacity and outage probability of secrecy capacity are obtained. Numerical\nresults reveal a fact that the security of the primary network does not only\ndepends on the channel mean powers between primary and secondary networks, but\nalso strongly depends on the channel condition of the SU-Tx to EAV link and\ntransmit power policy of the SU-Tx.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 11:42:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sibomana", "Louis", ""], ["Tran", "Hung", ""], ["Tran", "Quang Anh", ""]]}]
