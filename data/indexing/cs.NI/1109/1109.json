We propose an optimal offline algorithm\nand an online algorithm to extract energy savings both at the level of local\nload balancing within a data center and global load balancing across data\ncenters.

Our results show that it is possible to reduce the\nenergy consumption of a CDN by more than 55% while ensuring a high level of\navailability that meets customer SLA requirements and incurring an average of\none on-off transition per server per day.
