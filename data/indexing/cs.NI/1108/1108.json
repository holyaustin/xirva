In this context, we\npropose a framework for the Distributed Assessment of Network Centralities\n(DANCE) in complex networks. DANCE offers a single environment that allows the\nuse of different localized centrality proposals, which can be tailored to\nspecific applications. This environment can be thus useful given the vast\npotential applicability of centrality-based analysis on large-scale complex\nnetworks found in different areas, such as Biology, Physics, Sociology, or\nComputer Science. Since the localized centrality proposals DANCE implements\nemploy only localized information, DANCE can easily benefit from parallel\nprocessing environments and run on different computing architectures. To\nillustrate this, we present a parallel implementation of DANCE and show how it\ncan be applied to the analysis of large-scale complex networks using different\nkinds of network centralities. This implementation is made available to complex\nnetwork researchers and practitioners interested in using it through a\nscientific web portal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2011 12:34:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 19:38:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wehmuth", "Klaus", ""], ["Gomes", "Antonio Tadeu A.", ""], ["Ziviani", "Artur", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1257", "submitter": "Yi Zhong", "authors": "Yi Zhong, Wenyi Zhang", "title": "Multi-channel Hybrid Access Femtocells: A Stochastic Geometric Analysis", "comments": "This is the final version, which was accepted in IEEE Transactions on\n  Communications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCOMM.2013.050813.110508", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  For two-tier networks consisting of macrocells and femtocells, the channel\naccess mechanism can be configured to be open access, closed access, or hybrid\naccess.

In- ner/Outer Locator Construction Routers (I/O\nLCTR) are two functions introduced in NetInf mobile nodes to operate between\nNetInf and non- NetInf sites.

It is well-known that the\nperformance of scheduling over fading channels relies heavily on the accuracy\nof the available Channel State Information (CSI), which is costly to acquire.\nThus, we consider the CSI acquisition via a practical ARQ-based feedback\nmechanism whereby channel states are revealed at the end of only scheduled\nusers' transmissions. In the assumed presence of temporally-correlated channel\nevolutions, the desired scheduler must optimally balance the\nexploitation-exploration trade-off, whereby it schedules transmissions both to\nexploit those channels with up-to-date CSI and to explore the current state of\nthose with outdated CSI.\n  In earlier works, Whittle's Index Policy had been suggested as a\nlow-complexity and high-performance solution to this problem.

Several self-healing algorithms\nhave been suggested recently [IPDPS'08, PODC'08, PODC'09, PODC'11] in a line of\nwork that has yielded gradual improvements in the properties ensured on the\ngraph. This work motivates a strong general phenomenon of edge-preserving\nhealing that aims at obtaining self-healing algorithms with the constraint that\nall original edges in the graph (not deleted by the adversary), be retained in\nevery intermediate graph.\n  The previous algorithms, in their nascent form, are not explicitly edge\npreserving.

Towards this end, we\npresent a general self-healing model that unifies the previous models. The main\ncontribution of this paper is not in the technical complexity, rather in the\nsimplicity with which the edge-preserving property can be ensured and the\nmessage that this is a crucial property with several benefits. In particular,\nwe highlight this by showing that, almost as an immediate corollary, subgraph\ndensities are preserved or increased. Maintaining density is a notion motivated\nby the fact that in certain distributed networks, certain nodes may require and\ninitially have a larger number of inter-connections. It is vital that a healing\nalgorithm, even amidst failures, respect these requirements. Our suggested\nmodifications yield such subgraph density preservation as a by product.

This is especially true with the invention of\nportable mobile and laptop devices that can be connected almost everywhere at\nany time. However, the recent explosion on the usage of mobile and laptop\ndevices has also generated several issues in terms of performance and quality\nof service. Nowadays, mobile users demand high quality performance, best\nquality of services and seamless connections that support real-time application\nsuch as audio and video streaming. The goal of this paper is to study the\nimpact and evaluate the mobility management protocols under micro mobility\ndomain on link layer and network layer handover performance. Therefore, this\npaper proposes an integration solution of network-based mobility management\nframework, based on Proxy Mobile IPv6, to alleviate handover latency, packet\nloss and increase throughput and the performance of video transmission when\nmobile host moves to new network during handover on high speed mobility.\nSimulations are conducted to analyze the relationship between the network\nperformances with the moving speed of mobile host over mobility protocols.\nBased on simulation results, we presented and analyzed the results of mobility\nprotocols under intra-domain traffics in micro mobility domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 15:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "Md.

However, it is often\nconceptually and practically useful to be able to associate separate data\nstreams with each source-sink pair, with only routing and no coding performed\nat the network nodes. This raises the question of whether there is a nontrivial\nclass of network topologies for which achievability is always equivalent to\nroutability, for any combination of source signals and positive channel\ncapacities. This chapter considers possibly cyclic, directed, errorless\nnetworks with n source-sink pairs and mutually independent source signals. The\nconcept of downward dominance is introduced and it is shown that, if the\nnetwork topology is downward dominated, then the achievability of a given\ncombination of source signals and channel capacities implies the existence of a\nfeasible multicommodity flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2011 15:16:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 09:31:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 13:41:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 11 Jan 2014 16:44:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Nair", "Girish N.", ""]]}]
