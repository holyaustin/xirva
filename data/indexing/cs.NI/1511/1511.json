The\ncomparison was performed in an environment which emulated two systems: a Wi-Fi\nnetwork with a single immobile node and HSPA (High Speed Packet Access) network\nwith a mobile node. The evaluation shows that the hybrid approach in most cases\nachieves better results compared to its competitors, being able to stream the\nvideo more smoothly without unnecessary bit-rate switches.

This approach ensures that the\npriority is given to real-time applications over delay-tolerant applications.\nIn our system model, we include realistic channel effects of Long Term\nEvolution (LTE) system. Our application-aware scheduler runs in two stages, the\nfirst stage is resource block allocation and the second stage is power\nallocation. In the optimal solution of resource block allocation problem, each\nuser is inherently guaranteed a minimum Quality of Experience (QoE) while\nensuring priority given to users with real-time applications. In the power\nallocation problem, a new power allocation method is proposed which utilizes\nthe optimal solution of the application-aware resource block scheduling\nproblem. As a proof of concept, we run a simulation comparison between a\nconventional proportional fairness scheduler and the application-aware\nscheduler. The simulation results show better QoE with the application-aware\nscheduler.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 03:56:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Erpek", "Tugba", ""], ["Abdelhadi", "Ahmed", ""], ["Clancy", "T.

Numerical results show that\nthe QoS can be greatly enhanced with the assistance of Internet cloud when the\nlocal cloud is overloaded. Better QoS is achieved if the local cloud order\ntasks according to their delay requirements, where delay-sensitive applications\nare executed ahead of delay-tolerant applications.

A dynamic mechanism is\nproposed to group locally-coupled small cell base stations (SBSs) into clusters\nbased on location and traffic load. Within each formed cluster, SBSs coordinate\ntheir transmission parameters to minimize a cost function which captures the\ntradeoffs between energy efficiency and flow level performance, while\nsatisfying their users' quality-of-service requirements. Due to the lack of\ninter-cluster communications, clusters compete with one another in order to\nimprove the overall network's energy efficiency. This inter-cluster competition\nis formulated as a noncooperative game between clusters that seek to minimize\ntheir respective cost functions. To solve this game, a distributed learning\nalgorithm is proposed using which clusters autonomously choose their optimal\ntransmission strategies based on local information. It is shown that the\nproposed algorithm converges to a stationary mixed-strategy distribution which\nconstitutes an epsilon-coarse correlated equilibrium for the studied game.\nSimulation results show that the proposed approach yields significant\nperformance gains reaching up to 36% of reduced energy expenditures and up to\n41% of reduced fractional transfer time compared to conventional approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 11:52:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Samarakoon", "Sumudu", ""], ["Bennis", "Mehdi", ""], ["Saad", "Walid", ""], ["Latva-aho", "Matti", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08689", "submitter": "Ekram Hossain", "authors": "K.

In this regard, the massive multiple-input\nmultiple-output (MIMO) technology, where the base stations (BSs) are equipped\nwith a large number of antennas so as to achieve multiple orders of spectral\nand energy efficiency gains, will be a key technology enabler for 5G. In this\narticle, we present a comprehensive discussion on state-of-the-art techniques\nwhich further enhance the EE gains offered by massive MIMO (MM). We begin with\nan overview of MM systems and discuss how realistic power consumption models\ncan be developed for these systems. Thereby, we discuss and identify few\nshortcomings of some of the most prominent EE-maximization techniques present\nin the current literature. Then, we discuss \"hybrid MM systems\" operating in a\n5G architecture, where MM operates in conjunction with other potential\ntechnology enablers, such as millimetre wave, heterogenous networks, and energy\nharvesting networks. Multiple opportunities and challenges arise in such a 5G\narchitecture because these technologies benefit mutually from each other and\ntheir coexistence introduces several new constraints on the design of\nenergy-efficient systems. Despite clear evidence that hybrid MM systems can\nachieve significantly higher EE gains than conventional MM systems, several\nopen research problems continue to roadblock system designers from fully\nharnessing the EE gains offered by hybrid MM systems.

MPTCP provides the ability to split a flow\ninto multiple paths thus providing better performance and resilience to\nfailures. Usually, MPTCP is combined with flow-based Equal-Cost Multi-Path\nRouting (ECMP), which uses random hashing to split the MPTCP subflows over\ndifferent paths. However, random hashing can be suboptimal as distinct subflows\nmay end up using the same paths, while other available paths remain unutilized.\nIn this paper, we explore an MPTCP-aware SDN controller that facilitates an\nalternative routing mechanism for the MPTCP subflows. The controller uses\npacket inspection to provide deterministic subflow assignment to paths. Using\nthe controller, we show that MPTCP can deliver significantly improved\nperformance when connections are not limited by the access links of hosts. To\nlessen the effect of throughput limitation due to access links, we also\ninvestigate the usage of multiple interfaces at the hosts.
