In most cases, each node has finite-mean geometric random delay\nand thus a positive next hop throughput. However, the spatial (or large\npopulation) averaging of these individual finite mean-delays leads to infinite\nvalues in several practical cases, including the Rayleigh fading and positive\nthermal noise case. In some cases it exhibits an interesting phase transition\nphenomenon where the spatial average is finite when certain model parameters\nare below a threshold and infinite above. We call this phenomenon, contention\nphase transition. We argue that the spatial average of the mean local delays is\ninfinite primarily because of the outage logic, where one transmits full\npackets at time slots when the receiver is covered at the required SINR and\nwhere one wastes all the other time slots. This results in the \"RESTART\"\nmechanism, which in turn explains why we have infinite spatial average.\nAdaptive coding offers a nice way of breaking the outage/RESTART logic. We show\nexamples where the average delays are finite in the adaptive coding case,\nwhereas they are infinite in the outage case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 21:18:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Baccelli", "Fran\u00e7ois", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Blaszczyszyn", "Bartek", "", "INRIA\n  Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "1002.0937", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Francisco Martins (University of Lisbon), Lu\\'is Lopes (University of\n  Porto), Jo\\~ao Barros (University of Porto)", "title": "Towards the Safe Programming of Wireless Sensor Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 17, 2010, pp. 49-62", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.17.5", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.PL cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sensor networks are rather challenging to deploy, program, and debug.

Clients initially attach to an\narbitrary server, but may switch server independently at random instants of\ntime in an attempt to improve their service rate. This approach to load\nbalancing contrasts with traditional approaches where clients make smart server\nselections upon arrival (e.g., Join-the-Shortest-Queue policy and variants\nthereof). Load resampling is particularly relevant in scenarios where clients\ncannot predict the load of a server before being actually attached to it. An\nimportant example is in wireless spectrum sharing where clients try to share a\nset of frequency bands in a distributed manner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2010 12:06:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Apr 2010 13:28:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ganesh", "A.", ""], ["Lilienthal", "S.", ""], ["Manjunath", "D.", ""], ["Proutiere", "A.", ""], ["Simatos", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4583", "submitter": "Dima Shepelyansky L", "authors": "D.L.Shepelyansky and O.V.Zhirov (CNRS, Toulouse & BINP, Novosibirsk)", "title": "Towards Google matrix of brain", "comments": "revtex 5 pages, 7 figs, data added, research at\n  http://www.quantware.ups-tlse.fr", "journal-ref": "Phys.
