All routing protocols are the same in this goal, but the way\nthey adopt to achieve it is different, so routing strategy has an egregious\nrole on the performance of an ad hoc network. Most of routing protocols\nproposed for ad hoc networks have a flat structure. These protocols expand the\ncontrol overhead packets to discover or maintain a route. On the other hand a\nnumber of hierarchical-based routing protocols have been developed, mostly are\nbased on layered design. These protocols improve network performances\nespecially when the network size grows up since details about remote portion of\nnetwork can be handled in an aggregate manner. Although, there is another\napproach to design a protocol called cross-layer design. Using this approach\ninformation can exchange between different layer of protocol stack, result in\noptimizing network performances.\n  In this paper, we intend to exert cross-layer design to optimize Cluster\nBased Routing Protocol (Cross-CBRP). Using NS-2 network simulator we evaluate\nrate of cluster head changes, throughput and packet delivery ratio.

To date, Internet models have\ntypically attempted to explain a subset of the following characteristics:\nnetwork structure, traffic flow, geography, and economy. In this paper we\npresent a discrete, agent-based model, that integrates all of them. We show\nthat the model generates networks with topologies, dynamics, and (more\nspeculatively) spatial distributions that are similar to the Internet.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2008 20:53:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Holme", "Petter", ""], ["Karlin", "Josh", ""], ["Forrest", "Stephanie", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3448", "submitter": "Haim Kaplan", "authors": "Edith Cohen and Haim Kaplan", "title": "Sketch-Based Estimation of Subpopulation-Weight", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.DS cs.NI cs.PF", "license": null, "abstract": "  Summaries of massive data sets support approximate query processing over the\noriginal data.

To address this need, MIMO techniques, which are\ncapable of offering several-fold increase in capacity, hold significant\npromise. Most previous work on capacity analysis of ad-hoc networks is based on\nan implicit assumption that each node has only one antenna. Core to the\nanalysis therein is the characterization of a geometric area, referred to as\nthe exclusion region, which quantizes the amount of spatial resource occupied\nby a link. When multiple antennas are deployed at each node, however, multiple\nlinks can transmit in the vicinity of each other simultaneously, as\ninterference can now be suppressed by spatial signal processing. As such, a\nlink no longer exclusively occupies a geometric area, making the concept of\n\"exclusion region\" not applicable any more. In this paper, we investigate\nlink-layer throughput capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks. In contrast to previous\nwork, the amount of spatial resource occupied by each link is characterized by\nthe actual interference it imposes on other links. To calculate the link-layer\ncapacity, we first derive the probability distribution of post-detection SINR\nat a receiver. The result is then used to calculate the number of active links\nand the corresponding data rates that can be sustained within an area. Our\nanalysis will serve as a guideline for the design of medium access protocols\nfor MIMO ad-hoc networks. To the best of knowledge, this paper is the first\nattempt to characterize the capacity of MIMO ad-hoc networks by considering the\nactual PHY-layer signal and interference model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2008 05:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Jing", ""], ["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3554", "submitter": "Reginald Smith", "authors": "Reginald D.

This work is an attempt to understand the fundamental\nperformance of WLANs under unsaturated condition. In particular, we are\ninterested in the delay performance when collisions of packets are resolved by\nan exponential backoff mechanism. Using a multiple-vacation queueing model, we\nderive an explicit expression for packet delay distribution, from which\nnecessary conditions for finite mean delay and delay jitter are established. It\nis found that under some circumstances, mean delay and delay jitter may\napproach infinity even when the traffic load is way below the saturation\nthroughput. Saturation throughput is therefore not a sound measure of WLAN\ncapacity when the underlying applications are delay sensitive. To bridge the\ngap, we define safe-bounded-mean-delay (SBMD) throughput and\nsafe-bounded-delay-jitter (SBDJ) throughput that reflect the actual network\ncapacity users can enjoy when they require bounded mean delay and delay jitter,\nrespectively. The analytical model in this paper is general enough to cover\nboth single-packet reception (SPR) and multi-packet reception (MPR) WLANs, as\nwell as carrier-sensing and non-carrier-sensing networks. We show that the SBMD\nand SBDJ throughputs scale super-linearly with the MPR capability of a network.\nTogether with our earlier work that proves super-linear throughput scaling\nunder saturation condition, our results here complete the demonstration of MPR\nas a powerful capacity-enhancement technique for both delay-sensitive and\ndelay-tolerant applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2008 08:44:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Ying Jun", ""], ["Liew", "Soung Chang", ""], ["Chen", "Darui", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3634", "submitter": "Bernard Kujawski", "authors": "B.
