However, WSNs system\ndesigners must fulfill the Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements imposed by the\napplications (and users). Very harsh and dynamic physical environments and\nextremely limited energy/computing/memory/communication node resources are\nmajor obstacles for satisfying QoS metrics such as reliability, timeliness and\nsystem lifetime. The limited communication range of WSN nodes, link asymmetry\nand the characteristics of the physical environment lead to a major source of\nQoS degradation in WSNs. This paper proposes a Link Reliability based Two-Hop\nRouting protocol for wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The protocol achieves to\nreduce packet deadline miss ratio while consid- ering link reliability, two-hop\nvelocity and power efficiency and utilizes memory and computational effective\nmethods for estimating the link metrics. Numerical results provide insights\nthat the protocol has a lower packet deadline miss ratio and longer sensor\nnetwork lifetime. The results show that the proposed protocol is a feasible\nsolution to the QoS routing problem in wireless sensor networks that support\nreal-time applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 11:02:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Prakash", "T Shiva", ""], ["Raja", "K B", ""], ["Venugopal", "K R", ""], ["Iyengar", "S S", ""], ["Patnaik", "L M", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.0157", "submitter": "Tara Babaie", "authors": "Tahereh Babaie, Sanjay Chawla, Sebastien Ardon", "title": "Network Traffic Decomposition for Anomaly Detection", "comments": "Submitted to The Journal of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery\n  (DAMI)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we focus on the detection of network anomalies like Denial of\nService (DoS) attacks and port scans in a unified manner.

One such mobile network that has drawn\nattention of researchers in the past few years is the Airborne Networks (AN)\ndue to its importance in civil and military purpose and due to the several\ncomplex issues in these domains. Since the nodes in an airborne network (AN)\nare heterogeneous and mobile, the design of a reliable and robust AN is highly\ncomplex and challenging. In this paper a persistent backbone based architecture\nfor an AN has been considered where a set of airborne networking platforms\n(ANPs - aircrafts, UAVs and satellites) form the backbone of the AN. End to end\nconnectivity of the backbone nodes is crucial in providing the communication\namong the hosts. Since ANPs are prone to failure because of attacks like EMP\nattack or jamming, another important issue is to improve the robustness of the\nbackbone network against these attacks. Such attacks will impact specific\ngeographic regions at specific times and if an ANP is within the fault region\nduring the time of attack, it will fail. This paper focuses on connectivity and\nfault-tolerance issues in ANs and studies algorithms to compute the minimum\ntransmission range of ANPs in fault free and faulty scenarios to ensure network\nconnectivity all the times. It also considers the scenario where the network\nmay have to operate in a disconnected mode for some part of time and data\ntransmissions may be tolerant to some amount of delay.

BLE is described as a new\nprotocol in the official Bluetooth 4.0 specification. To design\nenergy-efficient devices, the protocol provides a number of parameters that\nneed to be optimized within an energy, latency and throughput design space. To\nminimize power consumption, the protocol parameters have to be optimized for a\ngiven application. Therefore, an energy-model that can predict the energy\nconsumption of a BLE-based wireless device for different parameter value\nsettings, is needed. As BLE differs from the original Bluetooth significantly,\nmodels for Bluetooth cannot be easily applied to the BLE protocol. Since the\nlast one year, there have been a couple of proposals on energy models for BLE.\nHowever, none of them can model all the operating modes of the protocol. This\npaper presents a precise energy model of the BLE protocol, that allows the\ncomputation of a device's power consumption in all possible operating modes.

This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more\nsophisticated methods to mask their traffic. A secure overlay services (SOS)\narchitecture has been proposed to provide reliable communication between\nclients and a target under DoS attacks.

The\narchitecture uses a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via\nconsistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful\nattacks by: 1) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges,\npushing the attack point into the core of the network, where high-speed routers\ncan handle the volume of attack traffic and 2) introducing randomness and\nanonymity into the forwarding architecture, making it difficult for an attacker\nto target nodes along the path to a specific SOSprotected destination.

We model this\nproblem under the framework of a Partially Observable Markov Decision\nProcesses.\n  In recent work, a low-complexity optimal solution was developed for this\nproblem under a long-term time-average resource constraint. However, in real\nsystems with instantaneous resource constraints, how to optimally exploit the\ntemporal correlation and satisfy realistic stringent constraint on the\ninstantaneous service remains elusive. In this work, we incorporate a stringent\nconstraint on the simultaneously scheduled users and propose a low-complexity\nscheduling algorithm that dynamically implements user scheduling and dummy\npacket broadcasting. We show that the throughput region of the optimal policy\nunder the long-term average resource constraint can be asymptotically achieved\nin the stringent constrained scenario by the proposed algorithm, in the many\nusers limiting regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Mar 2014 15:36:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ouyang", "Wenzhuo", ""], ["Eryilmaz", "Atilla", ""], ["Shroff", "Ness B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7774", "submitter": "Kritika Sengar", "authors": "Kritika Sengar, Nishu Rani, Ankita Singhal, Dolly Sharma, Seema Verma,\n  Tanya Singh", "title": "Study and Capacity Evaluation of SISO, MISO and MIMO RF Wireless\n  Communication Systems", "comments": "5 pages, 9 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The wireless communication systems has gone from different generations from\nSISO systems to MIMO systems.

Using\nstochastic geometry, this paper lays down a theoretical foundation for the\nperformance evaluation of heterogeneous networks with reduced power subframes\nand range expansion bias. The analytic expressions for average capacity and 5th\npercentile throughput are derived as a function of transmit powers, node\ndensities, and interference coordination parameters in a heterogeneous network\nscenario, and are validated through Monte Carlo simulations. Joint optimization\nof range expansion bias, power reduction factor, scheduling thresholds, and\nduty cycle of reduced power subframes are performed to study the trade-offs\nbetween aggregate capacity of a cell and fairness among the users.
