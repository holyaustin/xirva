First, we\nprove that the NbAFL can satisfy DP under distinct protection levels by\nproperly adapting different variances of artificial noises. Then we develop a\ntheoretical convergence bound of the loss function of the trained FL model in\nthe NbAFL. Specifically, the theoretical bound reveals the following three key\nproperties: 1) There is a tradeoff between the convergence performance and\nprivacy protection levels, i.e., a better convergence performance leads to a\nlower protection level; 2) Given a fixed privacy protection level, increasing\nthe number $N$ of overall clients participating in FL can improve the\nconvergence performance; 3) There is an optimal number of maximum aggregation\ntimes (communication rounds) in terms of convergence performance for a given\nprotection level. Furthermore, we propose a $K$-random scheduling strategy,\nwhere $K$ ($1<K<N$) clients are randomly selected from the $N$ overall clients\nto participate in each aggregation. We also develop the corresponding\nconvergence bound of the loss function in this case and the $K$-random\nscheduling strategy can also retain the above three properties.

The system is based on\nwhitelisting, as in the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) framework,\nimplemented as a VNF. Unlike common MUD suggestions that place the whitelist\napplication at the home/enterprise network, our approach is to place the\nenforcement upstream at the provider network, combining an NFV (Network\nFunction Virtualization) with router/switching filtering capabilities, e.g.,\nACLs. The VNF monitors many home networks simultaneously, and therefore, is a\nhighly-scalable managed service solution that provides both the end customers\nand the ISP with excellent visibility and security of the IoT devices at the\ncustomer premises.\n  The system includes a mechanism to distinguish between flows of different\ndevices at the ISP level despite the fact that most home networks (and their\nIoT devices) are behind a NAT and all the flows from the same home come out\nwith the same source IP address. Moreover, the NFV system needs to receive only\nthe first packet of each connection at the VNF, and rules space is proportional\nto the number of unique types of IoT devices rather than the number of IoT\ndevices. The monitoring part of the solution is off the critical path and can\nalso uniquely protect from incoming DDoS attacks.\n  To cope with internal traffic, that is not visible outside the customer\npremise and often consists of P2P communication, we suggest a hybrid approach,\nwhere we deploy a lightweight component at the CPE, whose sole purpose is to\nmonitor P2P communication. As current MUD solution does not provide a secure\nsolution to P2P communication, we also extend the MUD protocol to deal also\nwith peer-to-peer communicating devices.

In this network, we study two\nscenarios; i) the transmitting nodes do not need an incentive for transmission\nand ii) they do need an incentive and are paid by their corresponding receiving\nnodes by virtual tokens. We investigate two problems; P1) network power\nminimization for the first scenario and P2) social cost minimization for the\nsecond scenario, defined as the total cost paid by the nodes of the network for\nreceiving data.

In particular, in order to enable the\ndeep-RL framework to account for extreme network conditions and operate in\nhighly reliable systems, a new approach based on generative adversarial\nnetworks (GANs) is proposed.

To solve\nthis problem using experienced deep-RL, first, the rate of each user is\ndetermined. Then, these rates are mapped to the resource block and power\nallocation vectors of the studied wireless system. Finally, the end-to-end\nreliability and latency of each user are used as feedback to the deep-RL\nframework.

Then, to make the real-time decision while taking into account\nthe dynamics of the environment (i.e., UAV may take off from different\nlocations), we propose a deep Reinforcement leArning based Trajectory control\nalgorithm (RAT). In RAT, we apply the Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to\nimprove the convergence of the training procedure. Different from the convex\noptimization based algorithm which may be susceptible to the initial points and\nrequires iterations, RAT can be adapted to any taking off points of the UAVs\nand can obtain the solution more rapidly than CAT once training process has\nbeen completed. Simulation results show that the proposed CAT and RAT achieve\nthe similar performance and both outperform traditional algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Nov 2019 10:24:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 15:42:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Liang", ""], ["Wang", "Kezhi", ""], ["Pan", "Cunhua", ""], ["Xu", "Wei", ""], ["Aslam", "Nauman", ""], ["Nallanathan", "Arumugam", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.03916", "submitter": "Changsheng You", "authors": "Changsheng You, Beixiong Zheng, and Rui Zhang", "title": "Intelligent Reflecting Surface with Discrete Phase Shifts: Channel\n  Estimation and Passive Beamforming", "comments": "Submitted to IEEE conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.NI math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided\nsingle-user system where an IRS with discrete phase shifts is deployed to\nassist the uplink communication.

Part of these\nadvancements is the need for additional spectrum, namely moving toward the\nterahertz (THz) range. To compensate for the high path loss in THz, narrow\nbeamwidths are used to improve antenna gains. However, with narrow beamwidths,\neven minor fluctuations in device location (such as through body movement) can\ncause frequent link failures due to beam misalignment.

This geography requires a\nmultidisciplinary dialogue associating geopolitics, computer science and\nmathematics. Cyberspace is represented as three superposed and interacting\nlayers: the physical, logical, and informational layers. This paper focuses on\nthe logical layer through an analysis of the structure of connectivity and the\nBorder Gateway Protocol (BGP). This protocol determines the routes taken by the\ndata. It has been leveraged by countries to control the flow of information,\nand to block the access to contents (going up to full disruption of the\ninternet) or for active strategic purposes such as hijacking traffic or\nattacking infrastructures. Several countries have opted for a BGP strategy. The\ngoal of this study is to characterize these strategies, to link them to current\narchitectures and to understand their resilience in times of crisis. Our\nhypothesis is that there are connections between the network architecture\nshaped through BGP, and strategy of stakeholders at a national level. We chose\nto focus on the case of Iran because, Iran presents an interesting BGP\narchitecture and holds a central position in the connectivity of the Middle\nEast. Moreover, Iran is at the center of several ongoing geopolitical rifts.\nOur observations make it possible to infer three ways in which Iran could have\nused BGP to achieve its strategic goals: the pursuit of a self-sustaining\nnational Internet with controlled borders; the will to set up an Iranian\nIntranet to facilitate censorship; and the leverage of connectivity as a tool\nof regional influence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:47:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2019 08:26:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Salamatian", "Loqman", ""], ["Douzet", "Frederick", ""], ["Limonier", "Kevin", ""], ["Salamatian", "Kav\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.07738", "submitter": "Steven Van Rossem", "authors": "Steven Van Rossem, Wouter Tavernier, Didier Colle, Mario Pickavet,\n  Piet Demeester", "title": "Profile-based Resource Allocation for Virtualized Network Functions", "comments": "accepted in IEEE TNSM journal", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management, 2019, Early\n  Access", "doi": "10.1109/TNSM.2019.2943779", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI cs.LG cs.PF stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The virtualization of compute and network resources enables an unseen\nflexibility for deploying network services.

In addition, ICS\nsettings normally involve various cyber and physical security measures that\nsimultaneously protect multiple ICS components in overlapping manners, which\nmakes this problem even harder.
