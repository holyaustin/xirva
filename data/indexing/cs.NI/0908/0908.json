However,\ninternet access from mobile devices is very expensive due to limited bandwidth\navailable on wireless links and high mobility rate of mobile hosts. When a user\nexecutes a transaction with a web portal from a mobile device, the\ndisconnection necessitates failure of the transaction or redoing all the steps\nafter reconnection, to get back into consistent application state. Thus\nconsidering challenges in wireless mobile networks, a new log management scheme\nis proposed for recovery of mobile transactions.\n  In this proposed approach, the model parameters that affect application state\nrecovery are analyzed. The proposed scheme is compared with the existing Lazy\nand Pessimistic scheme and a trade off analysis between the cost invested to\nmanage log and the return of investment in terms of improved failure\nrecoverability is made. From the analysis, the best checkpoint interval period\nthat yields the best return of investment is identified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2009 13:32:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Pamila", "J.

The\nmajority of research in the context of wireless-based localization systems has\nfocused on device-based active localization, in which a device is attached to\ntracked entities. Recently, device-free passive localization (DfP) has been\nproposed where the tracked entity is neither required to carry devices nor\nparticipate actively in the localization process. DfP systems are based on the\nfact that RF signals are affected by the presence of people and objects in the\nenvironment. The DfP concept enables a wide range of applications including\nintrusion detection and tracking, border protection, and smart buildings\nautomation. Previous studies have focused on small areas with direct line of\nsight and/or controlled environments. In this paper, we present the design,\nimplementation and analysis of Nuzzer, a large-scale device-free passive\nlocalization system for real environments.\n  Without any additional hardware, it makes use of the already installed\nwireless data networks to monitor and process changes in the received signal\nstrength (RSS) transmitted from access points at one or more monitoring points.\nWe present probabilistic techniques for DfP localization and evaluate their\nperformance in a typical office building, rich in multipath, with an area of\n1500 square meters. Our results show that the Nuzzer system gives device-free\nlocation estimates with less than 2 meters median distance error using only two\nmonitoring laptops and three access points. This indicates the suitability of\nNuzzer to a large number of application domains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2009 15:31:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Seifeldin", "Moustafa", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0980", "submitter": "R Doomun", "authors": "Syed S.

However, supporting a MANET is a cost-intensive activity\nfor a mobile node. From a single mobile node perspective, the detection of\nroutes as well as forwarding packets consume local CPU time, memory,\nnetwork-bandwidth, and last but not least energy. We believe that this is one\nof the main factors that strongly motivate a mobile node to deny packet\nforwarding for others, while at the same time use their services to deliver its\nown data. This behavior of an independent mobile node is commonly known as\nmisbehaving or selfishness. A vast amount of research has already been done for\nminimizing malicious behavior of mobile nodes.

Our measures (i) reveal patterns common to each\nclass, (ii) separate networks that have been previously classified together,\nand (iii) expose limitations of several existing theoretical models. We reject\nthe standard classification of directed networks as purely assortative or\ndisassortative. Many display a class-specific mixture, likely reflecting\nfunctional or historical constraints, contingencies, and forces guiding the\nsystem's evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Aug 2009 00:25:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Nov 2010 04:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Foster", "Jacob G.", ""], ["Foster", "David V.", ""], ["Grassberger", "Peter", ""], ["Paczuski", "Maya", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.4325", "submitter": "Bela Genge", "authors": "Bela Genge, Iosif Ignat and Piroska Haller", "title": "Automated Composition of Security Protocols", "comments": "2009 IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Communication and\n  Processing (ICCP 2009), Cluj-Napoca, Romania, pp. 251-258 (ISBN\n  978-1-4244-5007-7)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CR cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Determining if two protocols can be securely composed requires analyzing not\nonly their additive properties but also their destructive properties.

The non-destructive property of the final composed\nprotocol is verified by analyzing the independence of the involved protocols, a\nmethod proposed by the authors in their previous work. The fully automatized\nproperty is ensured by constructing a rich protocol model that contains\nexplicit description of protocol preconditions, effects, generated terms and\nexchanged messages.

Assume a wireless sensor network with $n$\nnodes that have limited power, memory, and bandwidth. Each node is capable of\nboth sensing and storing data. Such sensor nodes might disappear from the\nnetwork due to failures or battery depletion. Hence it is desired to design\nefficient schemes to collect data from these $n$ nodes. We propose two\ndistributed storage algorithms (DSA's) that utilize network flooding to solve\nthis problem. In the first algorithm, DSA-I, we assume that every node utilizes\nnetwork flooding to disseminate its data throughout the network using a mixing\ntime of approximately O(n). We show that this algorithm is efficient in terms\nof the encoding and decoding operations. In the second algorithm, DSA-II, we\nassume that the total number of nodes is not known to every sensor; hence\ndissemination of the data does not depend on $n$. The encoding operations in\nthis case take $O(C\\mu^2)$, where $\\mu$ is the mean degree of the network graph\nand $C$ is a system parameter. We evaluate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithms through analysis and simulation, and show that their performance\nmatches the derived theoretical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 20:16:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Salah A.", ""], ["Darwish", "Hager S.", ""], ["Youssef", "Moustafa", ""], ["Zidan", "Mahmoud", ""]]}]
