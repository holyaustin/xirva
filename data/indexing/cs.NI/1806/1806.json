Operators of DNS recursive resolvers---the machines that\nreceive a client's query for a domain name and resolve it to a corresponding IP\naddress---can learn significant information about client activity. Past work,\nfor example, indicates that DNS queries reveal information ranging from web\nbrowsing activity to the types of devices that a user has in their home.\nRecognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries, various\nthird parties have created alternate DNS services that obscure a user's DNS\nqueries from his or her Internet service provider. Yet, these systems merely\ntransfer trust to a different third party. We argue that no single party ought\nto be able to associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those\nqueries. To this end, we present Oblivious DNS (ODNS), which introduces an\nadditional layer of obfuscation between clients and their queries. To do so,\nODNS uses its own authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the\nODNS namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they\nreceive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that initiated\nthese queries. We present an initial deployment of ODNS; our experiments show\nthat ODNS introduces minimal performance overhead, both for individual queries\nand for web page loads. We design ODNS to be compatible with existing DNS\nprotocols and infrastructure, and we are actively working on an open standard\nwith the IETF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2018 10:35:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 17:32:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitt", "Paul", ""], ["Edmundson", "Anne", ""], ["Feamster", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.00459", "submitter": "Michael Tschantz", "authors": "Sadia Afroz, Mobin Javed, Vern Paxson, Shoaib Asif Qazi, Shaarif\n  Sajid, and Michael Carl Tschantz", "title": "A Bestiary of Blocking: The Motivations and Modes behind Website\n  Unavailability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper examines different reasons the websites may vary in their\navailability by location.

On the other hand, when illumination\nis not required from the light source, the energy consumed by VLC could be more\nthan that consumed by the RF. By capitalizing on the above properties, the\nproposed hybrid RF-VLC system is more energy efficient and more adaptive to the\nillumination conditions than the individual VLC or RF systems. To demonstrate\nthe viability of the proposed system, we first formulate the problem of\nminimizing the power consumption of the hybrid RF-VLC system while satisfying\nthe users requests and maintaining acceptable level of illumination, which is\nNP-complete.

The sensor is equipped with a battery of finite size\nto save its incoming energy, and consumes one unit of energy per status update\ntransmission, which is delivered to the destination instantly over an\nerror-free channel. The setting is online in which the harvested energy is\nrevealed to the sensor causally over time, and the goal is to design status\nupdate transmission policy such that the long term average age of information\n(AoI) is minimized. AoI is defined as the time elapsed since the latest update\nhas reached at the destination. Two energy arrival models are considered: a\nrandom battery recharge (RBR) model, and an incremental battery recharge (IBR)\nmodel. In both models, energy arrives according to a Poisson process with unit\nrate, with values that completely fill up the battery in the RBR model, and\nwith values that fill up the battery incrementally, unit-by-unit, in the IBR\nmodel. The key approach to characterizing the optimal status update policy for\nboth models is showing the optimality of renewal policies, in which the\ninter-update times follow a specific renewal process that depends on the energy\narrival model and the battery size. It is then shown that the optimal renewal\npolicy has an energy-dependent threshold structure, in which the sensor sends a\nstatus update only if the AoI grows above a certain threshold that depends on\nthe energy available. For both the RBR and the IBR models, the optimal\nenergy-dependent thresholds are characterized explicitly, i.e., in closed-form,\nin terms of the optimal long term average AoI. It is also shown that the\noptimal thresholds are monotonically decreasing in the energy available in the\nbattery, and that the smallest threshold, which comes in effect when the\nbattery is full, is equal to the optimal long term average AoI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jun 2018 17:50:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2019 15:05:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Arafa", "Ahmed", ""], ["Yang", "Jing", ""], ["Ulukus", "Sennur", ""], ["Poor", "H.

Our key\nfindings are: (1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to\nreduction in availabil- ity due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN,\nCA services that they exclusively rely on; (2) the use of third-party services\nis concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services\ngo down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web\nservices; (3) transitive depen- dencies significantly increase the set of\nwebservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers,\nin some cases by ten times (4) targeting even less popular webservices can\npotentially cause signifi- cant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the\ntop- 100K webservices due to their shared dependencies.

We finally compare the\nabove mMIMO-based s-BH approach to a mMIMO direct access (DA) architecture\naccounting for the effects of pilot reuse schemes, together with their\nassociated overhead and contamination mitigation effects. The results show that\ndense SCs deployments supported by mMIMO s-BH provide significant rate\nimprovements for cell-edge users (UEs) in ultra-dense deployments with respect\nto mMIMO DA, while the latter outperforms mMIMO s-BH from the median UEs'\nstandpoint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 13:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bonfante", "Andrea", ""], ["Giordano", "Lorenzo Galati", ""], ["L\u00f3pez-P\u00e9rez", "David", ""], ["Garcia-Rodriguez", "Adrian", ""], ["Geraci", "Giovanni", ""], ["Baracca", "Paolo", ""], ["Butt", "M.

These challenges are addressed in this paper by\npresenting a fully autonomous and distributed underlay DSA scheme where each CR\noperates based on predicting its transmission effect on the PN. The scheme is\nbased on a cognitive engine with an artificial neural network that predicts,\nwithout exchanging information between the networks, the adaptive modulation\nand coding configuration for the primary link nearest to a transmitting CR. By\nmanaging the effect of the SN on the PN, the presented technique maintains the\nrelative average throughput change in the PN within a prescribed maximum value,\nwhile also finding transmit settings for the CRs that result in throughput as\nlarge as allowed by the PN interference limit. Simulation results show that the\nability of the cognitive engine in estimating the effect of a CR transmission\non the full adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) mode leads to a much more fine\nunderlay transmit power control. This ability also provides higher transmission\nopportunities for the CRs, compared to a scheme that can only estimate the\nmodulation scheme used at the PN link.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2018 15:35:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2018 17:08:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Jan 2019 02:12:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 21:02:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2020 00:44:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Shah-Mohammadi", "Fatemeh", ""], ["Kwasinski", "Andres", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.11047", "submitter": "Antonia Affinito", "authors": "Antonia Affinito, Alessio Botta, Luigi Gallo, Mauro Garofalo, Giorgio\n  Ventre", "title": "Spark-Based Anomaly Detection: the Case of Port and Net Scan", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The two most spread network anomalies are port and net scan.
