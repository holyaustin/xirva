We show that peering between CDNs\nupholds user perceived performance by satisfying the target QoS. The\nmethodology presented in this paper provides CDNs a way to dynamically\ndistribute user requests to other peers according to different\nrequest-redirection policies. The model-based approach helps an overloaded CDN\nto return to a normal state by offloading excess requests to the peers. It also\nassists in making concrete QoS guarantee for a CDN provider. Our approach\nendeavors to achieve scalability and resource sharing among CDNs through\neffective peering in a user transparent manner, thus evolving past the current\nlandscape where non-cooperative and distinct CDNs exist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2009 10:02:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Pathan", "Mukaddim", ""], ["Buyya", "Rajkumar", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4878", "submitter": "Rajkumar Buyya", "authors": "Rajkumar Buyya, Rajiv Ranjan and Rodrigo N.

Due to the shared wireless channel and dynamic topology,\npacket transmissions suffer from interference and fading. In heterogeneous ad\nhoc networks, throughput via a given route is depending on the minimum data\nrate of all its links. In a route of links with various data rates, if a high\ndata rate node forwards more traffic to a low data rate node, there is a chance\nof congestion, which leads to long queuing delays in such routes. Since hop\ncount is used as a routing metric in traditional routing, it do not adapt well\nto mobile nodes. A congestion-aware routing metric for MANETs should\nincorporate transmission capability, reliability, and congestion around a link.\nIn this paper, we propose to develop a hop-by-hop congestion aware routing\nprotocol which employs a combined weight value as a routing metric, based on\nthe data rate, queuing delay, link quality and MAC overhead. Among the\ndiscovered routes, the route with minimum cost index is selected, which is\nbased on the node weight of all the in-network nodes.
