These objects will produce a significant amount of data. The\ntraditional cloud computing architecture aims to process data in the cloud. As\na result, a significant amount of data needs to be communicated to the cloud.\nThis creates a number of challenges, such as high communication latency between\nthe devices and the cloud, increased energy consumption of devices during\nfrequent data upload to the cloud, high bandwidth consumption, while making the\nnetwork busy by sending the data continuously, and less privacy because of less\ncontrol on the transmitted data to the server. Fog computing has been proposed\nto counter these weaknesses. Fog computing aims to process data at the edge and\nsubstantially eliminate the necessity of sending data to the cloud. However,\ncombining the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) with the fog computing\narchitecture is still an open challenge.

Linked-microservices allow distributing the computation across\ndifferent computing nodes in the IoT architecture. Using four different types\nof architectures namely cloud, fog, hybrid and fog+cloud, we explore and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of service decomposition by applying four\nexperiments to three different type of datasets. Evaluation of the four\narchitectures shows that decomposing services into nodes reduce the data\nconsumption over the network by 10% - 70%.

In order to fully realize\nthe potential of vehicular networks, the challenges of efficient communication\nand computation need to be addressed.

Bringing together the latest\nadvances in neural network architectures and ambient backscattering\ncommunications, this work allows wireless nodes to effectively \"face\" the\njammer by first learning its jamming strategy, then adapting the rate or\ntransmitting information right on the jamming signal. Specifically, to deal\nwith unknown jamming attacks, existing work often relies on reinforcement\nlearning algorithms, e.g., Q-learning.

In this work, we face\nthe issue of achieving accurate vehicle position estimation and prediction in a\nVANET scenario.

To address this problem, we\npropose to use the Quality of Information (QoI) as the decision factor for\nbroadcasting. We implement a threshold-based strategy to distribute position\ninformation whenever the positioning error passes a reference value, thereby\nshifting the objective of the network to limiting the actual positioning error\nand guaranteeing quality across the VANET. The threshold-based strategy can\nreduce the network load by avoiding the transmission of redundant messages, as\nwell as improving the overall positioning accuracy by more than 20% in\nrealistic urban scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2019 13:45:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mason", "Federico", ""], ["Giordani", "Marco", ""], ["Chiariotti", "Federico", ""], ["Zanella", "Andrea", ""], ["Zorzi", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.04181", "submitter": "Kaige Qu", "authors": "Kaige Qu, Weihua Zhuang, Qiang Ye, Xuemin (Sherman) Shen, Xu Li, and\n  Jaya Rao", "title": "Delay-Aware Flow Migration for Embedded Services in 5G Core Networks", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures, ICC 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Service-oriented virtual network deployment is based on statistical resource\ndemands of different services, while data traffic from each service fluctuates\nover time.

We prove\nthe stability of mode-suppression using Lyapunov techniques, and use a Kingman\nbound argument to show that the total download time does not increase with peer\narrival rate.

The RSS value is then integrated to the utility based three-way handshake\nprocess used by the MAC protocol (VL-MAC) to mitigate the effects of deafness,\nblockage, hidden node, and maximize the probability of establishing full-duplex\nlinks. All these factors contribute towards maximizing the network throughput.\nExtensive simulation of VL-ROUTE shows 124% improvement in network throughput\nover a network that uses Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance\n(CSMA/CA) along with shortest path routing. Additionally, VL-ROUTE also showed\nup to 21% improvement in throughput over the network that uses VL-MAC along\nwith a geographic routing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 13:31:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Jagannath", "Jithin", ""], ["Melodia", "Tommaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.05202", "submitter": "Tamara Radivilova A", "authors": "Yousef Daradkeh Eid Mubarak, Lyudmyla Kirichenko and Tamara Radivilova", "title": "Development of QoS methods in the information networks with fractal\n  traffic", "comments": "6", "journal-ref": "Intl.

We propose a more\nefficient scheme, in which a single copy of each block header is multicasted,\ntogether with the signatures of servers. In addition, if IoT devices tolerate a\ndelay, we exploit the blockchain structure to amortize the authentication in\ntime, by transmitting only a subset of signature in each block period. Finally,\nthe BS sends redundant information, via a repetition code, to deal with the\nunreliable wireless channel, with the aim of decreasing the amount of feedback\nrequired from IoT devices. Our analysis shows the trade-off between timely\nauthentication of blocks and reliability of the communication, depending on the\npacket loss rate offered by the channel. The numerical results show that the\nperformance benefits of the proposed scheme makes it a viable starting point\nfor designing new lightweight protocols for blockchains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2019 14:21:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2019 21:29:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2019 16:25:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Danzi", "Pietro", ""], ["Kal\u00f8r", "Anders E.", ""], ["Stefanovi\u0107", "\u010cedomir", ""], ["Popovski", "Petar", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.07079", "submitter": "Bob Briscoe", "authors": "Bob Briscoe", "title": "The Native AQM for L4S Traffic", "comments": "bobbriscoe.net Technical Report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "TR-BB-2017-002", "categories": "cs.NI cs.SY", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This memo focuses solely on the native AQM of Low Latency Low Loss Scalable\nthroughput (L4S) traffic and proposes various improvements to the original step\ndesign.

Two modern AQMs (PIE and CoDel) are\ndesigned to keep queuing delay to a target by dropping packets as load varies.\nThis memo uses Curvy RED and an idealised but sufficient model of TCP traffic\nto explain why attempting to keep delay constant is a bad idea, because it\nrequires excessively high drop at high loads. This high drop itself takes over\nfrom queuing delay as the dominant cause of delay, particularly for short\nflows. At high load, a link is better able to preserve reasonable performance\nif the delay target is softened into a curve rather than a hard cap. The\nanalysis proves that the same AQM can be deployed in different parts of a\nnetwork whatever the capacity with the same optimal configuration. A surprising\ncorollary of this analysis concerns cases with a highly aggregated number of\nflows through a bottleneck. Although aggregation reduces queue variation, if\nthe target queuing delay of the AQM at that bottleneck is reduced to take\nadvantage of this aggregation, TCP will still increase the loss level because\nof the reduction in round trip time. The way to resolve this dilemma is to\noverprovision (a formula is provided).

Two of the most\npopular innovative data plans are rollover and shared data plans, where the\nformer plan allows a user to keep his unused data quota to next month and the\nlatter plan allows users in a family to share unused data. As a pioneer to\nprovide such data plans, a WSP faces immediate revenue loss from existing users\nwho pay less overage charges due to less data over-usage, but his market share\nincreases gradually by attracting new users and those under the other WSPs. In\nsome countries, WSPs have asymmetric timing for providing such innovative data\nplans, while some other markets' WSPs have symmetric timing or no planning.\nThis raises the question of why and when the competitive WSPs should offer the\nnew data plans. This paper provides game theoretic modelling and analysis of\nthe WSPs' timing of offering innovative data plans, by considering new user\narrival and dynamic user churn between WSPs. Our equilibrium analysis shows\nthat the WSP with small market share prefers to announce the innovative data\nplan first to attract more users, while the WSP with large market share prefers\nto announce later to avoid the immediate revenue loss. In a market with many\nnew users, WSPs with similar market shares will offer the data plans\nsimultaneously, but these WSPs facing few new users may not offer any new plan.\nPerhaps surprisingly, WSPs' profits can decrease with new user number and they\nmay not benefit from the option of innovative data plans.

This process has not been extended so far to\nsoftware. Nonetheless, the development of software follows the same phases, and\nalso entails the use-and waste-of considerable resources. This include human\neffort, as well as human and infrastructure sustenance products such as food,\ntraveling and energy. This paper introduces circular economy principles to the\nsoftware development, and particularly to network management logic and\nsecurity. It employs a recently proposed concept-the Socket Store-which is an\nonline store distributing end-user network logic in modular form. The Store\nmodules act as mediators between the end-user network logic and the network\nresources. It is shown that the Socket Store can implement all circular economy\nprinciples to the software life-cycle, with considerable gains in resource\nwaste.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2019 07:58:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Liaskos", "Christos", ""], ["Tsioliaridou", "Ageliki", ""], ["Ioannidis", "Sotiris", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.10697", "submitter": "Girma Mamuye Yilma", "authors": "Girma M.

Because of\nthe non-convex nature of the optimization problem, it is computationally\ndemanding to obtain the optimal resource allocation. Recently, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising technique in solving\nnon-convex optimization problems. Unlike deep learning (DL), DRL does not\nrequire any optimal/ near-optimal training dataset which is either unavailable\nor computationally expensive in generating synthetic data.

These data centers\nare usually connected to each other using long-distance and high-speed\nnetworks. As known, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is the predominant\nprotocol used to provide such connectivity among these data centers.\nUnfortunately, the huge bandwidth-delay product (BDP) of these networks hinders\nTCP from achieving full bandwidth utilization. In order to increase TCP\nflexibility to adapt for high-BDP networks, we propose a new delay-based and\nRTT-independent congestion control algorithm (CCA), namely Elastic-TCP. It\nmainly contributes the novel window-correlated weighting function (WWF) to\nincrease TCP bandwidth utilization over high-BDP networks. Extensive simulation\nand testbed experiments have been carried out to evaluate the proposed\nElastic-TCP by comparing its performance to the commonly used TCPs developed by\nMicrosoft, Linux, and Google. The results show that the proposed Elastic-TCP\nachieves higher average throughput than the other TCPs, while it maintains the\nsharing fairness and the loss ratio. Moreover, it is worth noting that the new\nElastic-TCP presents lower sensitivity to the variation of buffer size and\npacket error rate than the other TCPs, which grants high efficiency and\nstability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 08:51:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Alrshah", "Mohamed A.", ""], ["Al-Maqri", "Mohamed A.", ""], ["Othman", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.13108", "submitter": "Ghizlane Mountaser Ms", "authors": "Ghizlane Mountaser, Maliheh Mahlouji, Toktam Mahmoodi", "title": "Latency Bounds of Packet-Based Fronthaul for Cloud-RAN with\n  Functionality Split", "comments": "6 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables, conference paper (ICC19)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The emerging Cloud-RAN architecture within the fifth generation (5G) of\nwireless networks plays a vital role in enabling higher flexibility and\ngranularity.
