At the same time, ZC is not a CSMA; in its steady\nstate, it is completely collision-free. The stations transmit repeatedly in a\nround-robin order once the convergence state is reached. If some stations skip\ntheir turn, their transmissions are replaced by idle $20 \\mu$-second mini-slots\nthat enable the other stations to keep track of their order. Because of its\nshort medium access delay and its efficiency, the protocol supports both\nreal-time and elastic applications. The protocol allows for nodes leaving and\njoining the network; it can allocate more throughput to specific nodes (such as\nan access point). The protocol is robust against carrier sensing errors or\nclock drift. While collision avoidance is guaranteed in a single collision\ndomain, it is not the case in a multiple collision one.
