Common security protocols for aggregated WSNs are\neither hop-by-hop or end-to-end, each of which has its own encryption schemes\nconsidering different security primitives. End-to-end encrypted data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data secrecy with in-efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to active attacks, while hop-by-hop data\naggregation protocols introduce maximum data integrity with efficient data\naggregation and more vulnerability to passive attacks.\n  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol for aggregated WSNs\ndeployed in hostile environments in which dual attack modes are present. Our\nproposed protocol is a blend of flexible data aggregation as in hop-by-hop\nprotocols and optimal data confidentiality as in end-to-end protocols. Our\nprotocol introduces an efficient O(1) heuristic for checking data integrity\nalong with cost-effective heuristic-based divide and conquer attestation\nprocess which is $O(\\ln{n})$ in average -O(n) in the worst scenario- for\nfurther verification of aggregated results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 18:08:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mlaih", "Esam", ""], ["Aly", "Salah A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3455", "submitter": "Marc Lelarge", "authors": "Marc Lelarge and Jean Bolot", "title": "A Local Mean Field Analysis of Security Investments in Networks", "comments": "Proofs added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Getting agents in the Internet, and in networks in general, to invest in and\ndeploy security features and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of\neconomic reasons arising from the presence of network externalities. Our goal\nin this paper is to carefully model and quantify the impact of such\nexternalities on the investment in, and deployment of, security features and\nprotocols in a network.\n  Specifically, we study a network of interconnected agents, which are subject\nto epidemic risks such as those caused by propagating viruses and worms, and\nwhich can decide whether or not to invest some amount to self-protect and\ndeploy security solutions. We make three contributions in the paper. First, we\nintroduce a general model which combines an epidemic propagation model with an\neconomic model for agents which captures network effects and externalities.\nSecond, borrowing ideas and techniques used in statistical physics, we\nintroduce a Local Mean Field (LMF) model, which extends the standard mean-field\napproximation to take into account the correlation structure on local\nneighborhoods. Third, we solve the LMF model in a network with externalities,\nand we derive analytic solutions for sparse random graphs, for which we obtain\nasymptotic results. We explicitly identify the impact of network externalities\non the decision to invest in and deploy security features. In other words, we\nidentify both the economic and network properties that determine the adoption\nof security technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 18:29:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Jun 2008 09:59:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lelarge", "Marc", ""], ["Bolot", "Jean", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3742", "submitter": "Costas Constantinou", "authors": "C.

However, the performance of geographic routing is impacted by\nphysical voids, and localization errors. Accordingly, virtual coordinate\nsystems (VCS) were proposed as an alternative approach that is resilient to\nlocalization errors and that naturally routes around physical voids. However,\nVCS also faces virtual anomalies, causing their performance to trail geographic\nrouting. In existing VCS routing protocols, there is a lack of an effective\nstateless and delivery guaranteed complementary routing algorithm that can be\nused to traverse voids. Most proposed solutions use variants of flooding or\nblind searching when a void is encountered. In this paper, we propose a\nspanning-path virtual coordinate system which can be used as a complete routing\nalgorithm or as the complementary algorithm to greedy forwarding that is\ninvoked when voids are encountered. With this approach, and for the first time,\nwe demonstrate a stateless and delivery guaranteed geometric routing algorithm\non VCS.

Data volumes of\nhundreds of Terabytes will be shipped to Tier-2 centres for analysis by the LHC\nexperiments using the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG).\n  In many countries Tier-2 centres are distributed between a number of\ninstitutes, e.g., the geographically spread Tier-2s of GridPP in the UK. This\npresents a number of challenges for experiments to utilise these centres\nefficaciously, as CPU and storage resources may be sub-divided and exposed in\nsmaller units than the experiment would ideally want to work with. In addition,\nunhelpful mismatches between storage and CPU at the individual centres may be\nseen, which make efficient exploitation of a Tier-2's resources difficult.\n  One method of addressing this is to unify the storage across a distributed\nTier-2, presenting the centres' aggregated storage as a single system. This\ngreatly simplifies data management for the VO, which then can access a greater\namount of data across the Tier-2. However, such an approach will lead to\nscenarios where analysis jobs on one site's batch system must access data\nhosted on another site.\n  We investigate this situation using the Glasgow and Edinburgh clusters, which\nare part of the ScotGrid distributed Tier-2. In particular we look at how to\nmitigate the problems associated with ``distant'' data access and discuss the\nsecurity implications of having LAN access protocols traverse the WAN between\ncentres.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Mar 2008 23:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cowan", "Greig A.", ""], ["Stewart", "Graeme A.", ""], ["Elwell", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.4311", "submitter": "Victor Grishchenko", "authors": "Victor Grishchenko", "title": "Locator/identifier split using the data link layer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The locator/identifier split approach assumes separating functions of a\nlocator (i.e. topology--dependent attachment point address) and identifier\n(topology-independent unique identifier) currently both served by an IP\naddress.
