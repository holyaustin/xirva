This shift in network\narchitecture requires network devices to become more autonomous and,\npotentially, cooperate with one another. Such cooperation can, for example,\ntake place between interfering small access points that seek to coordinate\ntheir radio resource allocation, nearby single-antenna users that can\ncooperatively perform virtual MIMO communications, or even unlicensed users\nthat wish to cooperatively sense the spectrum of the licensed users. Such\ncooperative mechanisms involve the simultaneous sharing and distribution of\nresources among a number of overlapping cooperative groups or coalitions. In\nthis paper, a novel mathematical framework from cooperative games, dubbed\n\\emph{overlapping coalition formation games} (OCF games), is introduced to\nmodel and solve such cooperative scenarios. First, the concepts of OCF games\nare presented, and then, several algorithmic aspects are studied for two main\nclasses of OCF games.

We propose DA-DNUM algorithm, as a\ndual-based solution, which allocates source rates for the next time interval in\na distributed fashion, given the knowledge of network parameters in advance.\nThrough numerical experiments, we show that DA-DNUM gains higher average link\nutilization and a wider range of feasible scenarios in comparison with the\nbest, to our knowledge, rate control schemes that may guarantee such\nconstraints on delay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 02:18:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:44:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hajiesmaili", "Mohammad H.", ""], ["Talebi", "Mohammad Sadegh", ""], ["Khonsari", "Ahmad", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.03548", "submitter": "Michael Kirsche", "authors": "Georg M\\\"ostl and Andreas Springer", "title": "MiXiM, PAWiS, and STEAM-Sim Integration - Combining Channel Models,\n  Energy Awareness, and Real-life Application Code", "comments": "Published in: A.

In this regard, we\ninvestigate the problem of secure communication between a source and a\ndestination via a wireless energy harvesting untrusted node which acts as a\nhelper to relay the information; however, the source and destination nodes wish\nto keep the information confidential from the relay node. To realize the\npositive secrecy rate, we use destination-assisted jamming. Being an\nenergy-starved node, the untrusted relay harvests energy from the received\nradio frequency signals, which include the source's information signal and the\ndestination's jamming signal. Thus, we utilize the jamming signal efficiently\nby leveraging it as a useful energy source. At the relay, to enable energy\nharvesting and information processing, we adopt power splitting (PS) and time\nswitching (TS) policies.

In this paper, we investigate how the mobile users (MUs) can\neffectively offload traffic by taking advantage of the capability of\ndual-connectivity, which enables an MU to simultaneously communicate with a\nmacro base station (BS) and a small-cell access point (AP) via two\nradio-interfaces. Offloading traffic to the AP usually reduces the MUs' mobile\ndata cost, but often at the expense of suffering increased interferences from\nother MUs at the same AP. We thus formulate an optimization problem that\njointly determines each MU's traffic schedule (between the BS and AP) and power\ncontrol (between two radio-interfaces).

The results also show that the proposed adaptive\noffloading can significantly reduce the MUs' cost, i.e., save more than 75% of\nthe cost without offloading traffic and 65% of the cost with a fixed\noffloading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 16:21:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Yuan", "", "Sherman"], ["He", "Yanfei", "", "Sherman"], ["Qian", "Liping", "", "Sherman"], ["Huang", "Jianwei", "", "Sherman"], ["Xuemin", "", "", "Sherman"], ["Shen", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09299", "submitter": "Sergey Andreev", "authors": "Sergey Andreev, Olga Galinina, Alexander Pyattaev, Mikhail\n  Gerasimenko, Tuomas Tirronen, Johan Torsner, Joachim Sachs, Mischa Dohler,\n  Yevgeni Koucheryavy", "title": "Understanding the IoT Connectivity Landscape: A Contemporary M2M Radio\n  Technology Roadmap", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures, 15 references", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Magazine, Volume: 53, Issue: 9, Pages: 32 --\n  40, 2015", "doi": "10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263370", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article addresses the market-changing phenomenon of the Internet of\nThings (IoT), which relies on the underlying paradigm of machine-to-machine\n(M2M) communications to integrate a plethora of various sensors, actuators, and\nsmart meters across a wide spectrum of businesses. The M2M landscape features\ntoday an extreme diversity of available connectivity solutions which -- due to\nthe enormous economic promise of the IoT -- need to be harmonized across\nmultiple industries. To this end, we comprehensively review the most prominent\nexisting and novel M2M radio technologies, as well as share our first-hand\nreal-world deployment experiences, with the goal to provide a unified insight\ninto enabling M2M architectures, unique technology features, expected\nperformance, and related standardization developments. We pay particular\nattention to the cellular M2M sector employing 3GPP LTE technology.
