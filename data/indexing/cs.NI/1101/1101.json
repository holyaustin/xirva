Target\noutflow profiles specify the desirable inter-departure times of packets leaving\nthe switch from each traffic stream. The goal of the switch scheduler is to\ndynamically select service configurations of the switch, so that actual outflow\nstreams (\"pulled\" through the switch) adhere to their desired target profiles\nas accurately as possible. Dynamic service controls (schedules) are developed\nto minimize deviation of actual outflow streams from their targets and suppress\nstream \"distortion\". Using appropriately selected subsets of service\nconfigurations of the switch, efficient schedules are designed, which deliver\nhigh performance at relatively low complexity. Some of these schedules are\nprovably shown to achieve 100% pull-throughput. Moreover, simulations\ndemonstrate that for even substantial contention of streams through the switch,\ndue to stringent/intense target outflow profiles, the proposed schedules\nachieve closely their target profiles and suppress stream distortion. The\nswitch model investigated here deviates from the classical switching paradigm.\nIn the latter, the goal of packet scheduling is primarily to \"push\" as much\ntraffic load through the switch as possible, while controlling delay to\ntraverse the switch and keeping congestion/backlogs from exploding. In the\nmodel presented here, however, the goal of packet scheduling is to \"pull\"\ntraffic streams through the switch, maintaining desirable (target) outflow\nprofiles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Dec 2010 21:44:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Dua", "Aditya", ""], ["Bambos", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0133", "submitter": "Nihar Shah", "authors": "K.

The set of M sensor nodes\nforms a cluster with fully connected network and remaining set of sensor nodes\ncontinue to be in sleep mode. One sensor node is elected randomly as a cluster\nhead (CH) node which can estimate the data accuracy for the cluster before data\naggregation and finally send the data to the sink node. Findings - Since we\nsimulate the data accuracy for the cluster (M set of sensor nodes) at CH node,\nthere exist P minimal set of sensor nodes which give approximately the same\ndata accuracy level achieve by M set of sensor nodes .Moreover we find that as\nthe distance from the point event to the number of sensor nodes increases, the\ndata accuracy also get decreases.

Applications of WSNs are numerous\nand growing, and range from indoor deployment scenarios in the home and office\nto outdoor deployment scenarios in adversary's territory in a tactical\nbattleground (Akyildiz et al., 2002). For military environment, dispersal of\nWSNs into an adversary's territory enables the detection and tracking of enemy\nsoldiers and vehicles. For home/office environments, indoor sensor networks\noffer the ability to monitor the health of the elderly and to detect intruders\nvia a wireless home security system. In each of these scenarios, lives and\nlivelihoods may depend on the timeliness and correctness of the sensor data\nobtained from dispersed sensor nodes. As a result, such WSNs must be secured to\nprevent an intruder from obstructing the delivery of correct sensor data and\nfrom forging sensor data. To address the latter problem, end-to-end data\nintegrity checksums and post-processing of senor data can be used to identify\nforged sensor data (Estrin et al., 1999; Hu et al., 2003a; Ye et al., 2004).\nThe focus of this chapter is on routing security in WSNs. Most of the currently\nexisting routing protocols for WSNs make an optimization on the limited\ncapabilities of the nodes and the application-specific nature of the network,\nbut do not any the security aspects of the protocols. Although these protocols\nhave not been designed with security as a goal, it is extremely important to\nanalyze their security properties. When the defender has the liabilities of\ninsecure wireless communication, limited node capabilities, and possible\ninsider threats, and the adversaries can use powerful laptops with high energy\nand long range communication to attack the network, designing a secure routing\nprotocol for WSNs is obviously a non-trivial task.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jan 2011 10:23:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.3067", "submitter": "Sandor P.

When a node (referred to as\nthe source) gets a packet to forward, either by detecting an event or from an\nupstream node, it has to wait for its neighbors in a forwarding set (referred\nto as relays) to wake-up. Each of the relays is associated with a random reward\n(e.g., the progress made towards the sink) that is iid. To begin with, the\nsource is uncertain about the number of relays, their wake-up times and the\nreward values, but knows their distributions. At each relay wake-up instant,\nwhen a relay reveals its reward value, the source's problem is to forward the\npacket or to wait for further relays to wake-up. In this setting, we seek to\nminimize the expected waiting time at the source subject to a lower bound on\nthe average reward. In terms of the operations research literature, our work\ncan be considered as a variant of the asset selling problem.

Our goal is to design\nscheduling schemes that do not use per-flow or per-destination information,\nmaintain a single data queue for each link, and exploit only local information,\nwhile guaranteeing throughput optimality. Although the celebrated back-pressure\nalgorithm maximizes throughput, it requires per-flow or per-destination\ninformation.

Several different approaches exist to solve such class of problems,\ne.g., Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multiparty Computation (SMC) based\non Shamir's Secret Sharing algorithm (SSS). Such techniques are complete from a\ncomputation-theoretic perspective: given a set of private inputs, it is\npossible to perform arbitrary computation tasks without revealing any of the\nintermediate results. In fact, HE and SSS can operate also on secret inputs\nand/or provide secret outputs.

In this paper we advocate the use of \"elementary\" (as opposite to\n\"complete\") Secure Multiparty Computation (E-SMC) procedures for traffic\nmonitoring. E-SMC supports only simple computations with private input and\npublic output, i.e., it can not handle secret input nor secret (intermediate)\noutput. Such a simplification brings a dramatic reduction in complexity and\nenables massive-scale implementation with acceptable delay and overhead.\nNotwithstanding its simplicity, we claim that an E-SMC scheme is sufficient to\nperform a great variety of computation tasks of practical relevance to\ncollaborative network monitoring, including, e.g., anonymous publishing and set\noperations. This is achieved by combining a E-SMC scheme with data structures\nlike Bloom Filters and bitmap strings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 11:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ricciato", "Fabio", ""], ["Burkhart", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5613", "submitter": "Syed (Shawon) Rahman", "authors": "Anthony Bisong and Syed (Shawon) M.

Successful implementation of cloud computing in an\nenterprise requires proper planning and understanding of emerging risks,\nthreats, vulnerabilities, and possible countermeasures.

A key\nfeature of our model is that consumers experience a (positive) local network\neffect. In particular, each consumer's usage level depends directly on the\nusage of her neighbors in the social network structure. Thus, the monopolist's\noptimal pricing strategy may involve offering discounts to certain agents, who\nhave a central position in the underlying network.\n  First, we consider a setting where the monopolist can offer individualized\nprices and derive an explicit characterization of the optimal price for each\nconsumer as a function of her network position. In particular, we show that it\nis optimal for the monopolist to charge each agent a price that is proportional\nto her Bonacich centrality in the social network. In the second part of the\npaper, we discuss the optimal strategy of a monopolist that can only choose a\nsingle uniform price for the good and derive an algorithm polynomial in the\nnumber of agents to compute such a price. Thirdly, we assume that the\nmonopolist can offer the good in two prices, full and discounted, and study the\nproblem of determining which set of consumers should be given the discount. We\nshow that the problem is NP-hard, however we provide an explicit\ncharacterization of the set of agents that should be offered the discounted\nprice. Next, we describe an approximation algorithm for finding the optimal set\nof agents. We show that if the profit is nonnegative under any feasible price\nallocation, the algorithm guarantees at least 88% of the optimal profit.\nFinally, we highlight the value of network information by comparing the profits\nof a monopolist that does not take into account the network effects when\nchoosing her pricing policy to those of a monopolist that uses this information\noptimally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 20:31:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Candogan", "Ozan", ""], ["Bimpikis", "Kostas", ""], ["Ozdaglar", "Asuman", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5779", "submitter": "Jason Cloud", "authors": "Jason Cloud, Linda Zeger, Muriel M\\'edard", "title": "Co-Designing Multi-Packet Reception, Network Coding, and MAC Using a\n  Simple Predictive Model", "comments": "8 Pages, 10 Figures, Submitted to WiOpt 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We design a cross-layer approach to optimize the joint use of multi-packet\nreception and network coding, in order to relieve congestion.

We apply evolutionary game theory to model the spectrum access problem\nand develop distributed spectrum access policies based on imitation, a behavior\nrule widely applied in human societies consisting of imitating successful\nbehavior.
