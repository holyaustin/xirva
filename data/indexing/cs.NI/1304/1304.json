Quantum cryptography and particularly quantum key distribution is\nsuch a technique that allocates secure keys only for short distances. While not\ncompletely secure, it offers huge advantages over traditional methods by the\nuse of entanglement swapping and quantum teleportation. Reversible logic gates\nlike CNOT, Toffoli, Fredkin etc. are of basic importance in Quantum Computing.\nIn our research, we adopted a EPR-pair allocation scheme in terms of these\nquantum gates to overcome the susceptibility caused by malicious nodes. As the\nqubits stored in a sensor node can be used only once and cannot be duplicated,\nhence risk of information leakage reduced even if the node are compromised.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 15:18:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "S.", ""], ["Javaid", "N.", ""], ["Bouk", "S.

The\nfamily of $\\beta$-Ginibre processes is formed by determinantal point processes,\nwith different degree of repulsiveness, which converge in law to a homogeneous\nPoisson process, as $\\beta \\to 0$. In this sense the Poisson network model may\nbe considered as the limiting uncorrelated case of the $\\beta$-Ginibre network\nmodel. Our results indicate the existence of two different regimes. When the\nfading random variables are bounded or Weibull superexponential, large values\nof the interference are typically originated by the sum of several equivalent\ninterfering contributions due to nodes in the vicinity of the receiver.\n  In this case, the tail of the interference has, on the log-scale, the same\nasymptotic behavior for any value of $0<\\beta\\le 1$, but it differs (again on a\nlog-scale) from the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the interference in the\nPoisson network model.\n  When the fading random variables are exponential or subexponential, instead,\nlarge values of the interference are typically originated by a single\ndominating interferer node and, on the log-scale, the asymptotic behavior of\nthe tail of the interference is essentially insensitive to the distribution of\nthe nodes. As a consequence, on the log-scale, the asymptotic behavior of the\ntail of the interference in any $\\beta$-Ginibre network model, $0<\\beta\\le 1$,\nis the same as in the Poisson network model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 15:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2013 14:11:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:34:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Torrisi", "Giovanni Luca", ""], ["Leonardi", "Emilio", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.2454", "submitter": "Paul Bunn", "authors": "Paul Bunn and Rafail Ostrovsky", "title": "Secure End-to-End Communication with Optimal Throughput in Unreliable\n  Networks", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": "Distributed Computing, Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume\n  8205, pp. 403-417. 2013", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate the feasibility of end-to-end communication in highly\nunreliable networks.

Since the capabilities and the performances of mobile\ndevices (e.g., smart phone, PDA, handheld media player) have improved, a mobile\ndevice can be utilized to interact with external mobile service providers\ntowards providing composite Web service to remote clients. Existing approaches\non mobile-hosted service composition are usually platform dependent, and rely\non centralized infrastructure. Such approaches are not feasible in an open,\nmobile infrastructure-less environment, in which networked services are\nimplemented using different technologies, devices are capable of dynamically\njoining or leaving the network, and a centralized management entity is\nnonexistent. This paper proposes a solution to enable mobile Web service\ncomposition in an open, infrastructure-less environment based on loosely\ncoupled SOA techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 08:10:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Chii", ""], ["Ling", "Sea", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.5088", "submitter": "Przemyslaw Pawelczak", "authors": "Meng Zheng, Przemys{\\l}aw Pawe{\\l}czak, S{\\l}awomir Sta\\'nczak, Haibin\n  Yu", "title": "Planning of Cellular Networks Enhanced by Energy Harvesting", "comments": "accepted to IEEE Communications Letters [source code available]", "journal-ref": "IEEE Communications Letters, vol.:17, no: 6, pp.: 1092-1095, 2013", "doi": "10.1109/LCOMM.2013.043013.122667", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.ET cs.NI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We pose a novel cellular network planning problem, considering the use of\nrenewable energy sources and a fundamentally new concept of energy balancing,\nand propose a novel algorithm to solve it.

It is challenging to figure out the formation mechanism of such a\nSocial-InterestCast, since it involves multiple interrelated factors such as\nusers' social relationships, users' interests, and content semantics.

To answer this question, a number of important, inter-related\ndecisions, including job scheduling, server provisioning and resource pricing,\nshould be dynamically and jointly made, while the long-term profit optimality\nis pursued. In this work, we design efficient algorithms for inter-cloud\nvirtual machine (VM) trading and scheduling in a cloud federation.

A feature\nof such networks is that any user is typically in the range of multiple\nhelpers. Hence, in order to cope with user-helper association, load balancing\nand inter-cell interference, an efficient streaming policy should allow the\nusers to dynamically select the helper node to download from, and determine\nadaptively the video quality level of the download. In order to obtain a\ntractable formulation, we follow a \"divide and conquer\" approach: i) Assuming\nthat each video packet (chunk) is delivered within its playback delay (\"smooth\nstreaming regime\"), the problem is formulated as a network utility maximization\n(NUM), subject to queue stability, where the network utility function is a\nconcave and componentwise non-decreasing function of the users' video quality\nmeasure. ii) We solve the NUM problem by using a Lyapunov Drift Plus Penalty\napproach, obtaining a scheme that naturally decomposes into two sub-policies\nreferred to as \"congestion control\" (adaptive video quality and helper station\nselection) and \"transmission scheduling\" (dynamic allocation of the helper-user\nphysical layer transmission rates).Our solution is provably optimal with\nrespect to the proposed NUM problem, in a strong per-sample path sense. iii)\nFinally, we propose a method to adaptively estimate the maximum queuing delays,\nsuch that each user can calculate its pre-buffering and re-buffering time in\norder to cope with the fluctuations of the queuing delays.
