In this model, agents are faced\nwith production decisions that have to be evaluated based on their expectations\nabout the future utility of the produced entity which in turn depends on the\nglobal production level via a trading mechanism. While the original dynamical\nsystems formulation assumes an infinite number of homogeneously adapting agents\nobeying strong rationality conditions, the agent-based setting allows to\ndiscuss the effects of heterogeneous and adaptive expectations and enables the\nanalysis of non-equilibrium trajectories. Starting from a baseline\nimplementation that matches the asymptotic behavior of the original model, we\nshow how agent heterogeneity can be accounted for in the aggregate dynamical\nequations. We then show that when agents adapt their strategies by a simple\ntemporal difference learning scheme, the system converges to one of the fixed\npoints of the original system. Systematic simulations reveal that this is the\nonly stable equilibrium solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 12:24:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Banisch", "Sven", ""], ["Olbrich", "Eckehard", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00833", "submitter": "Seyyed Ali Zeytoon Nejad Moosavian", "authors": "Mahmood Mahmoudzadeh, Seyyed Ali Zeytoon Nejad Moosavian", "title": "Measuring and Analyzing the Shares of Economic Growth Sources in the\n  Mining Sector of Iran: A Neoclassical Growth Accounting Approach", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": "Iranian Economic Journal - Macroeconomics (IEJM), No. 13, pp.\n  121-142", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this study is to measure the Total Factor Productivity (TFP)\ngrowth and determine the share of each of the economic growth sources in the\nmining sector of Iran.

In this paper, the shares of total factor productivity\ngrowth (TFPG) and factors' accumulations in the economic growth of the mining\nsector are estimated using a neoclassical growth accounting approach. Based on\nthe estimated restricted Cobb-Douglas production function and the results\nobtained from the Solow residual equation, the annual growth rates of TFP were\nmeasured for each year. According to the findings, the average annual growth\nrate of TFP has been 2.94% during the time period of the present study. The\nother findings of this study indicate that the average contributions of TFPG,\nlabor accumulation and capital accumulation in the economic growth of the\nmining sector have been 56%, 23%, and 21%, respectively, during the time period\nof the study. As such, it can be concluded that the policy of benefiting from\navailable factors in the mining sector together with the policy of accumulating\nfactors have simultaneously caused the value-added growth of this sector.\nTherefore, considering the desired performance of the mining sector in terms of\nits sizable productivity growth, it can be argued that the mining sector can\naid Iran's economic development plans to achieve their assigned economic\nobjectives, one of which is to increase the share of total factor productivity\ngrowth in economic growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:49:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mahmoudzadeh", "Mahmood", ""], ["Moosavian", "Seyyed Ali Zeytoon Nejad", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.01624", "submitter": "Victor M.

In continuous time\napproach the memory is described by fractional-order differential equations. In\ndiscrete time approach the accelerators with memory are described by discrete\nmaps with memory, which are derived from the fractional-order differential\nequation without approximations. In order to derive these maps we use the\nequivalence of fractional-order differential equations and the Volterra\nintegral equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 09:36:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Jul 2017 07:09:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Tarasova", "Valentina V.", ""], ["Tarasov", "Vasily E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08111", "submitter": "Tobias Galla", "authors": "James B.

The payoffs of the\ngames are randomly generated and then held fixed. The strategies of the players\nevolve through time as the players learn. The trajectories in the strategy\nspace display a range of qualitatively different behaviors, with attractors\nthat include unique fixed points, multiple fixed points, limit cycles and\nchaos. In the limit where the game is complicated, in the sense that the\nplayers can take many possible actions, we use a generating-functional approach\nto establish the parameter range in which learning dynamics converge to a\nstable fixed point. The size of this region goes to zero as the number of\nplayers goes to infinity, suggesting that complex non-equilibrium behavior,\nexemplified by chaos, may be the norm for complicated games with many players.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 23:03:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Sanders", "James B.

However, its\nsubjective probability formulation, first elaborated by Savage, is linked to\nEllsberg-like paradoxes and ambiguity aversion. This has led various scholars\nto work out non-Bayesian extensions of EUT which cope with its paradoxes and\nincorporate attitudes toward ambiguity. A variant of the Ellsberg paradox,\nrecently proposed by Mark Machina and confirmed experimentally, challenges\nexisting non-Bayesian models of decision-making under uncertainty. Relying on a\ndecade of research which has successfully applied the formalism of quantum\ntheory to model cognitive entities and fallacies of human reasoning, we put\nforward a non-Bayesian extension of EUT in which subjective probabilities are\nrepresented by quantum probabilities, while the preference relation between\nacts depends on the state of the situation that is the object of the decision.\nWe show that the benefits of using the quantum theoretical framework enables\nthe modeling of the Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes, as the representation of\nambiguity and behavioral attitudes toward it. The theoretical framework\npresented here is a first step toward the development of a `state-dependent\nnon-Bayesian extension of EUT' and it has potential applications in economic\nmodeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2016 11:43:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Haven", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09060", "submitter": "Vasily E.

For the\nmathematical description of the economic process with power-law memory we used\nthe theory of derivatives of non-integer order and fractional-order\ndifferential equation. We propose equations take into account the effects of\nmemory with one-parameter power-law damping. Solutions of these fractional\ndifferential equations are suggested. We proved that the growth and downturn of\noutput depend on the memory effects. We demonstrate that the memory effect can\nlead to decrease of output instead of its growth, which is described by model\nwithout memory effect.
