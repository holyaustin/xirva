The use of the phrase 'tipping points' in this context can be\nmisleading. In popular and social scientific discourse, 'tipping points'\ninvolve abrupt state changes. For some climatic 'tipping points,' the\ncommitment to a state change may occur abruptly, but the change itself may be\nrate-limited and take centuries or longer to realize. Additionally, the\nconnection between climatic 'tipping points' and economic losses is tenuous,\nthough emerging empirical and process-model-based tools provide pathways for\ninvestigating it. We propose terminology to clarify the distinction between\n'tipping points' in the popular sense, the critical thresholds exhibited by\nclimatic and social 'tipping elements,' and 'economic shocks'. The last may be\nassociated with tipping elements, gradual climate change, or non-climatic\ntriggers. We illustrate our proposed distinctions by surveying the literature\non climatic tipping elements, climatically sensitive social tipping elements,\nand climate-economic shocks, and we propose a research agenda to advance the\nintegrated assessment of all three.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 20:16:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2016 17:50:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 14:33:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kopp", "Robert E.", ""], ["Shwom", "Rachael", ""], ["Wagner", "Gernot", ""], ["Yuan", "Jiacan", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00991", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "Financial Services, Economic Growth and Well-Being: A Four-Pronged Study", "comments": "Contains Supplementary Material (Research Questions, Methodology and\n  Data Sources) in the Appendix", "journal-ref": "Indian Journal of Finance, Vol. 9, No. 1 (2015), pp. 9-22", "doi": "10.17010//2015/v9i1/71531", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A four-pronged approach to dealing with Social Science Phenomenon is\noutlined.

These represent, respectively, the scientific\nconsensus and a hypothesis advanced by prominent skeptics. We conduct\nsensitivity analyses to determine how a variety of factors describing both the\nmarket and the physical climate may affect traders' beliefs about the cause of\nglobal climate change. Market participation causes most traders to converge\nquickly toward believing the \"true\" climate model, suggesting that a climate\nmarket could be useful for building public consensus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 20:53:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 19:13:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 22:16:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nay", "John J.", ""], ["Van der Linden", "Martin", ""], ["Gilligan", "Jonathan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09060", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "The Perfect Marriage and Much More: Combining Dimension Reduction,\n  Distance Measures and Covariance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.174", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.PR math.ST q-fin.EC stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a novel methodology based on the marriage between the\nBhattacharyya distance, a measure of similarity across distributions of random\nvariables, and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, a technique for dimension\nreduction. The resulting technique is a simple yet powerful tool that allows\ncomparisons between data-sets representing any two distributions. The degree to\nwhich different entities, (markets, universities, hospitals, cities, groups of\nsecurities, etc.), have different distance measures of their corresponding\ndistributions tells us the extent to which they are different, aiding\nparticipants looking for diversification or looking for more of the same thing.\nWe demonstrate a relationship between covariance and distance measures based on\na generic extension of Stein's Lemma. We consider an asset pricing application\nand then briefly discuss how this methodology lends itself to numerous\nmarket-structure studies and even applications outside the realm of finance /\nsocial sciences by illustrating a biological application. We provide numerical\nillustrations using security prices, volumes and volatilities of both these\nvariables from six different countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 07:36:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 02:43:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 04:30:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 05:14:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 01:36:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 12 Jul 2019 15:12:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}]
