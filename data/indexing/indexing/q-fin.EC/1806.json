This is a fundamental problem in\nthe field of social studies of science. The paper confronts this question here\nby showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power\nand wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general\ndefinition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous\nconcepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of\nphenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new\neconomic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,\napplying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to\nsatisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to\ncope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research\nare driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns\nand interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to\nthe rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced\nfor social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,\ntechnological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main\nimplication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern\nsociety is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social\nefforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope\nwith environmental threats, such as war. Empirical evidence endeavors to\nsupport the sources of scientific research for nations, described here.\nFinally, relationships between R&D investment and productivity, and research\npolicy implications are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:33:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Coccia", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.05262", "submitter": "Venkat Venkatasubramanian", "authors": "Venkat Venkatasubramanian and Yu Luo", "title": "How much income inequality is fair?

However, BEVs, unlike ICEVs, are still not\nwidely accepted in the automobile market but continuing technological change\ncould overcome this barrier. The aim of this study is to assess and forecast\nwhether and when design changes and technological improvements related to major\nchallenges in driving range and battery cost will make the user value of BEVs\ngreater than the user value of ICEVs. Specifically, we estimate the relative\nuser value of BEVs and ICEVs resulting after design modifications to achieve\ndifferent driving ranges by considering the engineering trade-offs based on a\nvehicle simulation. Then, we analyze when the relative user value of BEVs is\nexpected to exceed ICEVs as the energy density and cost of batteries improve\nbecause of ongoing technological change. Our analysis demonstrates that the\nrelative value of BEVs is lower than that of ICEVs because BEVs have high\nbattery cost and high cost of time spent recharging despite high torque, high\nfuel efficiency, and low fuel cost. Moreover, we found the relative value\ndifferences between BEVs and ICEVs are found to be less in high performance\nlarge cars than in low performance compact cars because BEVs can achieve high\nacceleration performance more easily than ICEVs. In addition, this study\npredicts that in approximately 2050, high performance large BEVs could have\nhigher relative value than high performance large ICEVs because of\ntechnological improvements in batteries; however low performance compact BEVs\nare still very likely to have significantly lower user value than comparable\nICEVs until well beyond 2050.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 04:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Woo", "JongRoul", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.07436", "submitter": "David Walwyn Dr", "authors": "Anthony D Stephens and David R Walwyn", "title": "Two Different Methods for Modelling the Likely Upper Economic Limit of\n  the Future United Kingdom Wind Fleet", "comments": "20 pages; 13 figures; 7 tables; 2 models", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Methods for predicting the likely upper economic limit for the wind fleet in\nthe United Kingdom should be simple to use whilst being able to cope with\nevolving technologies, costs and grid management strategies.
