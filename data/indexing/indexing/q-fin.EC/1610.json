We\ncouple the new economic dimension Complexity, which captures how sophisticated\nproducts are, with an index called logPRODY, a measure of the income of the\nrespective exporters. Products' aggregate motion is treated as a 2-dimensional\ndynamical system in the Complexity-logPRODY plane. We find that this motion can\nbe explained by a quantitative model involving the competition on the markets,\nthat can be mapped as a scalar field on the Complexity-logPRODY plane and acts\nin a way akin to a potential. This explains the movement of products towards\nareas of the plane in which the competition is higher. We analyse market\ncomposition in more detail, finding that for most products it tends, over time,\nto a characteristic configuration, which depends on the Complexity of the\nproducts. This market configuration, which we called asymptotic, is\ncharacterized by higher levels of competition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2016 13:01:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 May 2017 19:34:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Angelini", "Orazio", ""], ["Cristelli", "Matthieu", ""], ["Zaccaria", "Andrea", ""], ["Pietronero", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.05171", "submitter": "Ling-Yun He", "authors": "Jian-Xin Wu and Ling-Yun He", "title": "Urban-rural gap and poverty traps in China: A prefecture level analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Urban-rural gap and regional inequality are long standing problems in China\nand result in considerable number of studies. This paper examines the dynamic\nbehaviors of incomes for both urban and rural areas with a prefectural data\nset. The analysis is conducted by using a distribution dynamics approach, which\nhave advantages in examination on persistence, polarization and convergence\nclubs. The results show that persistence and immobility are the dominant\ncharacteristics in the income distribution dynamics. The prefectural urban and\nrural areas converge into their own steady states differentiated in income\nlevels. This pattern of urban-rural gap also exists in three regional groups,\nnamely the eastern, central and western regions. Examination on the dynamics of\nthe poorest areas shows that geographical poverty traps exist in both urban and\nrural prefectural areas. Our results indicate that more policy interventions\nare required to narrow down the urban-rural gap and to eliminate the poverty\ntraps in China.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 15:39:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Jian-Xin", ""], ["He", "Ling-Yun", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.05448", "submitter": "Ning Xu", "authors": "Ning Xu, Jian Hong, Timothy C.G.

We believe that GA is one way formally to\naddress concerns about the external validity of a model. The GA of a model\nestimated on a sample can be measured by its empirical out-of-sample errors,\ncalled the generalization errors (GE). We derive upper bounds for the GE, which\ndepend on sample sizes, model complexity and the distribution of the loss\nfunction. The upper bounds can be used to evaluate the GA of a model, ex ante.\nWe propose using generalization error minimization (GEM) as a framework for\nmodel selection. Using GEM, we are able to unify a big class of penalized\nregression estimators, including lasso, ridge and bridge, under the same set of\nassumptions. We establish finite-sample and asymptotic properties (including\n$\\mathcal{L}_2$-consistency) of the GEM estimator for both the $n \\geqslant p$\nand the $n < p$ cases. We also derive the $\\mathcal{L}_2$-distance between the\npenalized and corresponding unpenalized regression estimates. In practice, GEM\ncan be implemented by validation or cross-validation. We show that the GE\nbounds can be used for selecting the optimal number of folds in $K$-fold\ncross-validation. We propose a variant of $R^2$, the $GR^2$, as a measure of\nGA, which considers both both in-sample and out-of-sample goodness of fit.\nSimulations are used to demonstrate our key results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 06:26:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Ning", ""], ["Hong", "Jian", ""], ["Fisher", "Timothy C.

In the canonical\nArrow-Debreu framework, equilibrium prices are set by a fictitious auctioneer.\nRemoving that fiction raises the question of how prices are set and adjusted by\ndecentralised actors with incomplete information. We investigate this question\nthrough a very basic model where a unique factor of production, labour,\nproduces a single consumption good, called jelly for brevity. The point of the\nmodel is to study a price dynamics based on the firm's expectations about jelly\ndemand and labour supply. The system tends towards economic equilibrium,\nhowever, depending on the initial conditions it might not get there. In\ndifferent model versions, different kinds of money are introduced. Compared to\nthe case of no money, the introduction of money as a store of value facilitates\nthe system reaching economic equilibrium. If money is introduced as a third\ncommodity, i.e. there is also a demand for money, the system dynamics in\ngeneral becomes more complex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 12:50:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 14:23:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 10:45:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Steudle", "Gesine A.", ""], ["Yang", "Saini", ""], ["Jaeger", "Carlo C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.05703", "submitter": "Egorova Lyudmila", "authors": "A.

Simulation results imply that the choice of\nhousing tax tools depends on the kind of shock that housing market faces. In\nthe situation where the housing price volatility is caused by the population\ngrowth shock, the flow tax can reduce the volatility of housing price while the\nstock tax makes no difference to it.
