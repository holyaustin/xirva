These quantities are called respectively Fitness F\nand Complexity Q. The algorithm was originally based on the adjacency matrix M\nof the bipartite network connecting countries with the products they export,\nbut can be applied to any bipartite network. The structure of the adjacency\nmatrix turns to be essential to determine which countries and products converge\nto non zero values of F and Q. Also the speed of convergence to zero depends on\nthe matrix structure. A major role is played by the shape of the ordered matrix\nand, in particular, only those matrices whose diagonal does not cross the empty\npart are guaranteed to have non zero values as outputs when the algorithm\nreaches the fixed point. We prove this result analytically for simplified\nstructures of the matrix, and numerically for real cases. Finally, we propose\nsome practical indications to take into account our results when the algorithm\nis applied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 14:57:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:35:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pugliese", "Emanuele", ""], ["Zaccaria", "Andrea", ""], ["Pietronero", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.4922", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Roy Cerqueti and Marcel Ausloos", "title": "Assessing the Inequalities of Wealth in Regions: the Italian Case", "comments": "to be published in Quality and Quantity; 23 pages; 1 figure; 23\n  tables; 19 references", "journal-ref": "Quality and Quantity, 49(6), 2307-2323 (2015)", "doi": "10.1007/s11135-014-0111-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper discusses region wealth size distributions, through their member\ncities aggregated tax income.
