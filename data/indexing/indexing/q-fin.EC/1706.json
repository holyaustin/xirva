We discuss four-parameter estimation methods including the\nquantiles, logarithmic moments method, maximum likelihood (ML), and the\nempirical characteristics function (ECF) method. The contribution of the paper\nis two-fold: first, we discuss the above parametric approaches and investigate\ntheir performance through error analysis. Moreover, we argue that the ECF\nperforms better than the ML over a wide range of shape parameter values,\n{\\alpha}{\\alpha} including values closest to 0 and 2 and that the ECF has a\nbetter convergence rate than the ML. Secondly, we compare the t location-scale\ndistribution to the general stable distribution and show that the former fails\nto capture skewness which might exist in the data. This is observed through\napplying the ECF to commodity futures log-returns data to obtain the skewness\nparameter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 20:53:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kateregga", "Michael", ""], ["Mataramvura", "Sure", ""], ["Taylor", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.09763", "submitter": "Robin Nicole Mr", "authors": "Robin Nicole and Peter Sollich", "title": "Dynamical selection of Nash equilibria using Experience Weighted\n  Attraction Learning: emergence of heterogeneous mixed equilibria", "comments": "35 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0196577", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the distribution of strategies in a large game that models how\nagents choose among different double auction markets. We classify the possible\nmean field Nash equilibria, which include potentially segregated states where\nan agent population can split into subpopulations adopting different\nstrategies. As the game is aggregative, the actual equilibrium strategy\ndistributions remain undetermined, however. We therefore compare with the\nresults of Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA) learning, which at long times\nleads to Nash equilibria in the appropriate limits of large intensity of\nchoice, low noise (long agent memory) and perfect imputation of missing scores\n(fictitious play). The learning dynamics breaks the indeterminacy of the Nash\nequilibria. Non-trivially, depending on how the relevant limits are taken, more\nthan one type of equilibrium can be selected. These include the standard\nhomogeneous mixed and heterogeneous pure states, but also \\emph{heterogeneous\nmixed} states where different agents play different strategies that are not all\npure. The analysis of the EWA learning involves Fokker-Planck modeling combined\nwith large deviation methods.

Although these datasets can be fitted by\ndifferent functions at different income ranges, the Tsallis distribution has\nrecently been found capable of fitting the whole distribution by means of only\ntwo parameters. This procedure showed clearly such oscillatory feature in the\nentire income range feature, but made it particularly visible at the tail of\nthe distribution. Although log-periodic functions fitted to the data are\ncapable of describing this behavior, a different approach to naturally disclose\nsuch oscillatory characteristics is to allow the Tsallis $q$-parameter to\nbecome complex. In this paper we use this idea in order to describe the\nbehavior of the CCDF of the Brazilian personal income recently studied\nempirically by Soares et al.\\ (2016). Typical elements of periodic motion, such\nas amplitude and angular frequency coupled to this income analysis, were\nobtained by means of this approach. A highly non-linear function for the CCDF\nwas obtained through this methodology and a numerical test showed it capable of\nrecovering the main oscillatory feature of the original CCDF of the personal\nincome data of Brazil.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 16:25:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 14 Jul 2019 16:05:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Abreu", "Everton M.
