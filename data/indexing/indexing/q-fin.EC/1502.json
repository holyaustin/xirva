Using the average linkage clustering, we uncover a well-defined\nhierarchy in the relationships among countries. Four main clusters are\nidentified and they suggest that countries worldwide can be quite well\nseparated according to their perception of corruption. Moreover, we find a\nstrong connection between corruption levels and a stage of development inside\nthe clusters. The ranking of countries according to their corruption perfectly\ncopies the ranking according to the economic performance measured by the gross\ndomestic product per capita of the member states.
