Utility functions aim to capture individual psychological\ncharacteristics, but their generality limits predictive power. Expectation\nvalue maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values\nare only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic\nproperties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the\nvariables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the\nrelevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of\nutility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging\nwealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be\nspecified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic \"utility functions\"\nappear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive\nand purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively. We highlight inconsistencies\nthroughout the development of decision theory, whose correction clarifies that\nour perspective is legitimate. These invalidate a commonly cited argument for\nbounded utility functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 May 2014 13:35:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 13:03:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Ole", ""], ["Gell-Mann", "Murray", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.0733", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Marcel Ausloos (Liege & Amsterdam), Herbert Dawid (Bielefeld), and Ugo\n  Merlone (Torino)", "title": "Spatial interactions in agent-based modeling", "comments": "26 pages, 5 figures, 105 references; a chapter prepared for the book\n  \"Complexity and Geographical Economics - Topics and Tools\", P.

In such an approach, higher-order\nvariables such as commodity prices, population dynamics or even institutions,\nare not exogenously specified but instead are seen as the results of\ninteractions. It is highlighted in the chapter that the understanding of\npatterns emerging from such spatial interaction between agents is a key problem\nas much as their description through analytical or simulation means.\n  The chapter reviews different approaches for modeling agents' behavior,\ntaking into account either explicit spatial (lattice based) structures or\nnetworks. Some emphasis is placed on recent ABM as applied to the description\nof the dynamics of the geographical distribution of economic activities, - out\nof equilibrium. The Eurace@Unibi Model, an agent-based macroeconomic model with\nspatial structure, is used to illustrate the potential of such an approach for\nspatial policy analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 May 2014 19:21:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "Marcel", "", "Liege & Amsterdam"], ["Dawid", "Herbert", "", "Bielefeld"], ["Merlone", "Ugo", "", "Torino"]]}, {"id": "1405.2051", "submitter": "Laurent Fournier", "authors": "Laurent Fournier", "title": "Merchant Sharing Towards a Zero Marginal Cost Economy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cs.CE q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is the first attempt to formalize a new field of economics;\nstudding the Intangibles Goods available on the Internet.

The model assumes that all the processes start from\na common value $x_0>0$ and the symmetric Nash equilibrium is for each agent to\nutilise a stopping rule which yields a randomised value for the stopped\nprocess. In the two-player contest, this randomised value has a uniform\ndistribution on $[0,2x_0]$. In this paper, we consider a variant of the problem\nwhereby the starting values of the Brownian motions are independent,\nnonnegative random variables that have a common law $\\mu$. We consider a\ntwo-player contest and prove the existence and uniqueness of a symmetric Nash\nequilibrium for the problem. The solution is that each agent should aim for the\ntarget law $\\nu$, where $\\nu$ is greater than or equal to $\\mu$ in convex\norder; $\\nu$ has an atom at zero of the same size as any atom of $\\mu$ at zero,\nand otherwise is atom free; on $(0,\\infty)$ $\\nu$ has a decreasing density; and\nthe density of $\\nu$ only decreases at points where the convex order constraint\nis binding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 09:03:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 14:23:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Han", ""], ["Hobson", "David", ""]]}]
