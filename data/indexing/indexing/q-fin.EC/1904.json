The\nstudy panel included 2,619 hospitals. Changes in 30-day AMI mortality rate\nfollowing a hospital data breach were estimated using a multivariate regression\nmodel based on a difference-in-differences approach.\n  Results: A data breach was associated with a 0.338[95% CI, 0.101-0.576]\npercentage point increase in the 30-day AMI mortality rate in the year\nfollowing the breach and a 0.446[95% CI, 0.164-0.729] percentage point increase\ntwo years after the breach. For comparison, the median 30-day AMI mortality\nrate has been decreasing about 0.4 percentage points annually since 2011 due to\nprogress in care. The magnitude of the breach impact on hospitals' AMI\nmortality rates was comparable to a year's worth historical progress in\nreducing AMI mortality rates.\n  Conclusion: Hospital data breaches significantly increased the 30-day\nmortality rate for AMI. Data breaches may disrupt the processes of care that\nrely on health information technology. Financial costs to repair a breach may\nalso divert resources away from patient care. Thus breached hospitals should\ncarefully focus investments in security procedures, processes, and health\ninformation technology that jointly lead to better data security and improved\npatient outcomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 15:26:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Sung J.", ""], ["Johnson", "M.

The theory\nassumes that customers infer less than rationally: when a price rises due to a\ncost increase, customers partially misattribute the higher price to a higher\nmarkup---which they find unfair.

Adding to the evidence for this\npuzzle, I include an empirical analysis focusing on whether liquidity\nconstraints can explain this bunching and find they cannot. The nature of this\npuzzle is clarified by exploring a life-cycle model with rational agents that\nmatches aggregate profiles. This model succeeds in matching aggregates by\noverestimating the impact of the SPA on poorer individuals whilst\nunderestimating its impact on wealthier people. The second puzzle is people are\noften mistaken about their own pension provisions. Concerning the second\npuzzle, I incorporate rational inattention to the SPA into the aforementioned\nlife-cycle model, allowing for mistaken beliefs. To the best of my knowledge,\nthis paper is the first not only to incorporate rational inattention into a\nlife-cycle model but also to assess a rationally inattentive model against\nnon-experimental individual choice data. This facilitates another important\ncontribution: discipling the cost of attention with subjective belief data.\nPreliminary results indicate rational inattention improves the aggregate fit\nand better matches the response of participation to the SPA across the wealth\ndistribution, hence offering a resolution to the first puzzle. The third puzzle\nis despite actuarially advantageous options to defer receipt of pension\nbenefits, take up is extremely low. An extension of the model generates an\nexplanation of this last puzzle: the actuarial calculations implying deferral\nis preferable ignore the utility cost of tracking your pension which can be\navoided by claiming.
