These metrics are based on mapping issuance\nfractions to their long-term, asymptotic portfolio implications for cost and\nrisk under mechanical debt-rolling dynamics. The resulting mapping enables one\nto visualize tradeoffs involved in contemplated issuance reallocation, and\nidentify an efficient frontier and optimal tenor. Historical Treasury issuance\nstrategy is analyzed empirically using these cost and risk metrics to\nillustrate how changes in issuance needs and strategy have translated into\nstructural shifts in the cost and risk stance of Treasury issuance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Feb 2018 18:32:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 20:17:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 15:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Cameron", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.03756", "submitter": "Jerzy Rydlewski", "authors": "Tadeusz Klecha, Daniel Kosiorowski, Dominik Mielczarek, Jerzy P.\n  Rydlewski", "title": "New Proposals of a Stress Measure in a Capital and its Robust Estimator", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper a novel approach for a measurement of stresses in a capital,\nwhich induce the capital flows between economic systems, is proposed.

We also propose methods of\ndescribing changes in an amount and a structure of stresses in a capital\nappealing, among others, to a Bookstein's pair of thin plain spline\ndeformation, and a measure of a shape variability. We apply our approach to an\nindirect verification of the hypothesis according to which a capital flow\nbetween economic systems is related to an activity of an inner force related to\nstresses in a capital. We indicate, that the stresses create a phenomenon\nanalogous to the heat, which may be interpreted in terms of a positive economic\nexternal effect, which attracts a capital from environment of a system to the\nsystem.

However, if you want to understand how projects \"typically\" work, as\nHirschman said he did, then the theories of the planning fallacy, optimism\nbias, and strategic misrepresentation - according to which cost overruns and\nbenefit shortfalls are the norm - will serve you significantly better than the\nprinciple of the Hiding Hand.
