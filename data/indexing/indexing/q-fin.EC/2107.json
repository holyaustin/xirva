Methods: Beyond summary statistics, the\nmonthly (May, 1976 to December, 2020) number of observed FDA MD Applications\nare investigated via an assortment of time series techniques (including:\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform, Running Moving Average Filter (RMAF), Complete\nEnsemble Empirical Mode with Adaptive Noise decomposition (CEEMDAN), and\nSeasonal Trend Loess (STL) decomposition) to exhaustively search and\ncharacterize such periodicities.

However, most of the\nstudies are focused on estimating energy consumption, not in exploring the\nfactors that determine it.\n  Goal: To explore the factors that determine maximum energy consumption of\nBitcoin miners. In particular, analyze the limits of energy consumption, and to\nwhich extent variations of the factors could produce its reduction.\n  Method: Estimate the overall profit of all Bitcoin miners during a certain\nperiod of time, and the costs (including energy) that they face during that\ntime, because of the mining activity. The underlying assumptions is that miners\nwill only consume energy to mine Bitcoin if they have the expectation of\nprofit, and at the same time they are competitive with respect of each other.\nTherefore, they will operate as a group in the point where profits balance\nexpenditures.\n  Results: We show a basic equation that determines energy consumption based on\nsome specific factors: minting, transaction fees, exchange rate, energy price,\nand amortization cost. We also define the Amortization Factor, which can be\ncomputed for mining devices based on their cost and energy consumption, helps\nto understand how the cost of equipment influences total energy consumption.\n  Conclusions: The factors driving energy consumption are identified, and from\nthem, some ways in which Bitcoin energy consumption could be reduced are\ndiscussed. Some of these ways do not reduce the most important properties of\nBitcoin, such as the chances of control of the aggregated hashpower, or the\nfundamentals of the proof of work mechanism.

In Bangladesh, where bureaucracy and legislature\noperate with little effective accountability or checks and balances,\ntraditional horizontal or vertical accountability proved to be very blunt and\nweak. In the presence of such faulty mechanisms, ordinary citizens access to\ninformation is frequently denied, and their voices are kept mute. It impasses\nthe formation of an enabling environment, where activists and civil society\ninstitutions representing the ordinary peoples interest are actively\ndiscouraged. They become vulnerable to retribution. Social accountability, on\nthe other hand, provides an enabling environment for activists and civil\nsociety institutions to operate freely. Thus, leaders and administration become\nmore accountable to people. An enabling environment means providing legal\nprotection, enhancing the availability of information and increasing citizen\nvoice, strengthening institutional and public service capacities and directing\nincentives that foster accountability. Donors allocate significant shares of\nresources to encouraging civil society to partner with elites rather than\nholding them accountable.

Do these\neconomic and structural characteristics drive the transmission mechanism of the\ntax changes at the state level at different horizons? This study employs a\npanel factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVAR) technique to answer these\nissues. The findings show that state economies respond homogeneously in terms\nof employment and price levels; however, they react heterogeneously in real GDP\nand personal income growth. In most states, these reactions are statistically\nsignificant, and the heterogeneity in the effects of tax cuts is significantly\nrelated to the state's fiscal structure, manufacturing and financial\ncomposition, and the labor market's rigidity. A cross-state regression analysis\nshows that states with higher tax elasticity, higher personal income tax,\nstrict labor market regulation, and economic policy uncertainties are\nrelatively less responsive to federal tax changes. In contrast, the magnitude\nof the response in real GDP, personal income, and employment to tax cuts is\nrelatively higher in states with a larger share of finance, manufacturing,\nlower tax burdens, and flexible credit markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "Masud", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13716", "submitter": "Hossain Ahmed Taufiq", "authors": "Hossain Ahmed Taufiq", "title": "Role of NGOs in fostering equity and social inclusion in cities of\n  Bangladesh: The Case of Dhaka", "comments": "Proceedings: Fifth Annual International Conference on Sustainable\n  Development (ICSD), The Earth Institute, Columbia University, New York, USA", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Non-governmental organisations have made a significant contribution in the\ndevelopment of Bangladesh.
