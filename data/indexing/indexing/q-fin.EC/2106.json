Therefore, it is\ncrucial to identify the strategic phenomena that determine when ODRP systems\ncan run efficiently. In this paper, we analyze the performance of an ODRP\nsystem, in which the fleet of low-capacity vehicles is endogenously adapted to\nthe demand, and operated in a zone covered by a single transit line. The\nrouting of the on-demand fleet follows some of the rules of public transport\nsystems; namely, it is not-for-profit, some users can be required to walk, and\nall requests must be served. Considering both users' and operators' costs we\nidentify two sources of scale economies: when demand grows, the average cost is\nreduced due to a) an equivalent of the Mohring Effect (also present in public\ntransport), and b) due to matching users with more similar routes when they are\nassigned to the vehicles, which we call Better-matching Effect. A\ncounter-balance force, called Flex-route Effect, is observed when the vehicle\nloads increase and users face longer detours. We find a specific demand range\nin which the latter effect dominates the others, imposing diseconomies of scale\nwhen only users' costs are considered. Such a phenomenon emerges because the\nroutes are not fixed; hence, it is not observed in traditional public transport\nsystems. However, when considering both users' and operators' costs, scale\neconomies prevail. Our simulations show that relaxing door-to-door vehicle\nrequirements to allow short walks is crucial for the performance of ODRP. In\nfact, we observe that an ODRP system with human-driven vehicles and walks\nallowed has a total cost at a similar level to that of a door-to-door ODRP\nsystem with driverless vehicles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2021 14:56:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2021 11:21:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Fielbaum", "Andres", ""], ["Tirachini", "Alejandro", ""], ["Alonso-Mora", "Javier", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15376", "submitter": "Prakash Shukla", "authors": "Athary Janiso (1), Prakash Kumar Shukla (1), Bheemeshwar Reddy A (1)\n  ((1) BITS-PILANI, Hyderabad Campus)", "title": "What Explains Gender Gap in Unpaid Household and Care Work in India?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the unavailability of nationally representative data on time use, a\nsystematic analysis of the gender gap in unpaid household and care work has not\nbeen undertaken in the context of India.
