We model a simple financial system in which banks\ndecide about their investment strategy based on a private belief about the\nstate of the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of\npeers. Observing a larger group of peers conveys more information and thus\nleads to a stronger social belief. Extending the standard model of Bayesian\nupdating in social networks, we show that the probability that banks\nsynchronize their investment strategy on a state non-matching action critically\ndepends on the weighting between private and social belief. This effect is\nalleviated when banks choose their peers endogenously in a network formation\nprocess, internalizing the externalities arising from social learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 00:02:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aymanns", "Christoph", ""], ["Georg", "Co-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1022", "submitter": "Gaurab Aryal", "authors": "Gaurab Aryal and Ronald Stauber", "title": "A Note on Kuhn's Theorem with Ambiguity Averse Players", "comments": "7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.econlet.2014.08.018", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cs.GT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Kuhn's Theorem shows that extensive games with perfect recall can\nequivalently be analyzed using mixed or behavioral strategies, as long as\nplayers are expected utility maximizers.

This\nnovel version of the previously introduced TOP method alleviates some\ninconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant\nwith respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This\nmeans that, if `$X$ comes before $Y$', this transforms into `$Y$ comes before\n$X$' under a time reversal. We show that previously proposed bootstrap test\nlacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there\nis no lead-lag correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel\ntests. The first the free energy p-value $\\rho$ criterion quantifies the\nprobability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random time\nseries with similar characteristics except for the lead-lag information. The\nsecond self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to be\nsignificant, synchronizing the two time series using the time varying lead-lag\npath should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform\nintensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations.\nFinally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time dependent\nlead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom\n(UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. The TOPS approach stresses the\nimportance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of\ninformation or policies may have drastically different impacts and\ndevelopments, conditional on the economic, financial and geopolitical\nconditions. This study reinforces the view that the hypothesis of statistical\nstationarity is highly questionable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Aug 2014 16:20:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Feb 2018 23:21:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Hao", "", "ECUST"], ["Xu", "Hai-Chuan", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Sornette", "Didier", "", "ETH Zurich"]]}, {"id": "1408.5951", "submitter": "Ashish Hota", "authors": "Ashish R.
