Changes in Age Pension policy impose difficulties in retirement\nmodelling due to policy risk, but any major changes tend to be `grandfathered'\nmeaning that current retirees are exempt from the new changes. In 2015, two\nimportant changes were made in regards to allocated pension accounts -- the\nincome means-test is now based on deemed income rather than account\nwithdrawals, and the income-test deduction no longer applies. We examine the\nimplications of the new changes in regards to optimal decisions for\nconsumption, investment, and housing. We account for regulatory minimum\nwithdrawal rules that are imposed by regulations on allocated pension accounts,\nas well as the 2017 asset-test rebalancing. The new policy changes are modelled\nin a utility maximizing lifecycle model and solved as an optimal stochastic\ncontrol problem. We find that the new rules decrease the benefits from planning\nthe consumption in relation to the means-test, while the housing allocation\nincreases slightly in order to receive additional Age Pension. The difference\nin optimal drawdown between the old and new policy are only noticeable early in\nretirement until regulatory minimum withdrawal rates are enforced. However, the\namount of extra Age Pension received for many households is now significantly\ndifferent due to the new deeming income rules, which benefit slightly wealthier\nhouseholds who previously would receive no Age Pension due to the income-test\nand minimum withdrawals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 00:43:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Andreasson", "Johan G.", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09926", "submitter": "Mikhail Timonin", "authors": "Mikhail Timonin", "title": "Choquet integral in decision analysis - lessons from the axiomatization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cs.AI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Choquet integral is a powerful aggregation operator which lists many\nwell-known models as its special cases.

In cases where an axiomatization has been\npreviously given in the literature, we connect the existing results with the\nframework that we have developed. Next we turn to the question of learning,\nwhich is especially important for the practical applications of the model. So\nfar, learning of the Choquet integral has been mostly confined to the learning\nof the capacity. Such an approach requires making a powerful assumption that\nall dimensions (e.g. criteria) are evaluated on the same scale, which is rarely\njustified in practice. Too often categorical data is given arbitrary numerical\nlabels (e.g. AHP), and numerical data is considered cardinally and ordinally\ncommensurate, sometimes after a simple normalization. Such approaches clearly\nlack scientific rigour, and yet they are commonly seen in all kinds of\napplications. We discuss the pros and cons of making such an assumption and\nlook at the consequences which axiomatization uniqueness results have for the\nlearning problems. Finally, we review some of the applications of the Choquet\nintegral in decision analysis. Apart from MCDA, which is the main area of\ninterest for our results, we also discuss how the model can be interpreted in\nthe social choice context. We look in detail at the state-dependent utility,\nand show how comonotonicity, central to the previous axiomatizations, actually\nimplies state-independency in the Choquet integral model.
