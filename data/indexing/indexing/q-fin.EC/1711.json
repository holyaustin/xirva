The\ncrisis literature has so far identified a number of distinct effects or\nchannels that can propagate distress contagiously both directly within the\nbanking network itself and indirectly, between the network and the external\neconomy. These contagious effects, and the potential events that trigger these\neffects, can explain most aspects of past crises, and are thought to be likely\nto dominate future financial crises. Since the current international financial\nregulatory regime based on the Basel III Accord does a good job of ensuring\nthat banks are resilient to such contagion effects taken one at a time,\nsystemic risk theorists increasingly understand that future crises are likely\nto be dominated by the spillovers between distinct contagion channels. The\npresent paper aims to provide a model for systemic risk that is comprehensive\nenough to include the important contagion channels identified in the\nliterature. In such a model one can hope to understand the dangerous spillover\neffects that are expected to dominate future crises. To rein in the number and\ncomplexity of the modelling assumptions, two requirements are imposed, neither\nof which is yet well-known or established in the main stream of systemic risk\nresearch. The first, called stock-flow consistency, demands that the financial\nsystem follows a rigorous set of rules based on accounting principles. The\nsecond requirement, called Asset-Liability symmetry, implies that every\nproposed contagion channel has a dual channel obtained by interchanging assets\nand liabilities, and that these dual channel pairs have a symmetric\nmathematical representation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "T.

The properties of food trade networks\nare still poorly documented, especially from a multi-network perspective. In\nparticular, nothing is known about the community structure of food networks,\nwhich is key to understanding how major disruptions or 'shocks' would impact\nthe global food system.

We also fit econometric models to identify social,\neconomic and geographic factors explaining the probability that any two\ncountries are co-present in the same community. Our estimates indicate that the\nprobability of country pairs belonging to the same food trade community depends\nmore on geopolitical and economic factors -- such as geographical proximity and\ntrade agreements co-membership -- than on country economic size and/or income.\nThis is in sharp contrast with what we know about bilateral-trade determinants\nand suggests that food country communities behave in ways that can be very\ndifferent from their non-food counterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Nov 2017 20:10:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Torreggiani", "Sofia", ""], ["Mangioni", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Puma", "Michael J.", ""], ["Fagiolo", "Giorgio", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.08245", "submitter": "Penny Mealy", "authors": "Penny Mealy, J.
