It shows that\nthe vast majority of models used for assessing climate policy use assumptions\nabout the financial system that sit at odds with the observed reality. In\nparticular, the models' assumptions lead to `crowding out' of capital, which\ncause them to show negative impacts from climate policy in virtually all cases.\nWe compare this approach with that of the E3ME model, which follows\nnon-equilibrium economic theory and adopts a more empirical approach. While the\nnon-equilibrium model also has limitations, its treatment of the financial\nsystem is more consistent with reality and it shows that green investment need\nnot crowd out investment in other parts of the economy -- and may therefore\noffer an economic stimulus.\n  The implication of this finding is that standard CGE models consistently\nover-estimate the costs of climate policy in terms of GDP and welfare,\npotentially by a substantial amount. These findings overly restrict the range\nof possible emission pathways accessible using climate policy from the\nviewpoint of the decision-maker, and may also lead to misleading information\nused for policy making. Improvements in both modelling approaches should be\nsought with some urgency -- both to provide a better assessment of potential\nclimate policy and to improve understanding of the dynamics of the global\nfinancial system more generally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 15:53:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pollitt", "H.", ""], ["Mercure", "J. -F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03164", "submitter": "Ron Nielsen", "authors": "Ron W Nielsen", "title": "Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Economic Growth in Africa", "comments": "4 figures, 8 pages, 2990 words", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the fundamental postulates of the Unified Growth Theory is the claimed\nexistence of three distinctly different regimes of economic growth governed by\nthree distinctly different mechanisms of growth.

Our first notable finding is the mechanism\nof reward/penalty associated with patience, as quantified by the return on\nassets. In regular economies where the EBITA/Assets ratio is larger than the\ncost of debt, starting with a trust higher than leverage results in the highest\nlong-term return on assets (which can be seen as a proxy for economic growth).\nOur second main finding concerns a recommendation for the reaction of a central\nbank to an external shock that affects negatively the economic growth. We find\nthat late policy intervention in the model economy results in the highest\nlong-term return on assets and largest asset value. But this comes at the cost\nof suffering longer from the crisis until the intervention occurs. The\nphenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that postponing intervention allows\ntrust to increase first, and it is most effective to intervene when trust is\nhigh. These results derive from two fundamental assumptions underlying our\nmodel: (a) trust tends to increase when it is above leverage; (b) economic\nagents learn optimally to adjust debt for a given level of trust and amount of\nassets. Using a Markov Switching Model for the EBITA/Assets ratio, we have\nsuccessfully calibrated our model to the empirical data of the return on equity\nof the EURO STOXX 50 for the time period 2000-2013.

We find that wholesale prices decrease slightly and converge at\nWestern European levels, the potential of suppliers to exert market power\ndecreases significantly, and consumer surplus increases by 15.9% in the EU. Our\nresults allow us to distinguish three categories of projects: (i) New gas\nsources developed and brought to the EU markets.
