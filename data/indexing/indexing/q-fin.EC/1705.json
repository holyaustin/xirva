In our\nmodel, there is a representative consumer who can satisfy her electricity\ndemand by investing in distributed generation (solar panels) and by buying\npower from a centralised firm at a price the firm sets. Distributed generation\nis intermittent and induces an externality cost to the consumer. The firm\nprovides non-random electricity generation subject to a carbon tax and to\ntransmission costs. The objective of the consumer is to satisfy her demand\nwhile mini\\-mising investment costs, payments to the firm and intermittency\ncosts. The objective of the firm is to satisfy the consumer's residual demand\nwhile minimising investment costs, demand deviation costs, and maximising the\npayments from the consumer. We formulate the investment decisions as\nMcKean-Vlasov control problems with stochastic coefficients. We provide\nexplicit, price model-free solutions to the optimal decision problems faced by\neach player, the solution of the Pareto optimum, and the Stackelberg\nequilibrium where the firm is the leader. We find that, from the social\nplanner's point of view, the carbon tax or transmission costs are necessary to\njustify a positive share of distributed capacity in the long-term, whatever the\nrespective investment costs of both technologies are. The Stackelberg\nequilibrium is far from the Pareto equilibrium and leads to an over-investment\nin distributed energy and to a much higher price for centralised energy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 08:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Mar 2018 19:44:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:31:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["A\u00efd", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Basei", "Matteo", ""], ["Pham", "Huy\u00ean", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.01454", "submitter": "Yu-Sung Tu", "authors": "Yu-Sung Tu, Wei-Torng Juang", "title": "The Payoff Region of a Strategic Game and Its Extreme Points", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The range of a payoff function for an $n$-player finite strategic game is\ninvestigated using a novel approach, the notion of extreme points of a\nnon-convex set.
