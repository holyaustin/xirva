In this paper, we fill\nthis gap by quantifying the economic complexity of China's provinces through\nanalyzing 25 years' firm data. First, we estimate the regional economic\ncomplexity index (ECI), and show that the overall time evolution of provinces'\nECI is relatively stable and slow. Then, after linking ECI to the economic\ndevelopment and the income inequality, we find that the explanatory power of\nECI is positive for the former but negative for the latter. Next, we compare\ndifferent measures of economic diversity and explore their relationships with\nmonetary macroeconomic indicators. Results show that the ECI index and the\nnon-linear iteration based Fitness index are comparative, and they both have\nstronger explanatory power than other benchmark measures. Further multivariate\nregressions suggest the robustness of our results after controlling other\nsocioeconomic factors. Our work moves forward a step towards better\nunderstanding China's regional economic development and non-monetary\nmacroeconomic indicators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Mar 2017 02:22:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 01:49:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Jian", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01369", "submitter": "Jian Gao", "authors": "Jian Gao, Bogang Jun, Alex \"Sandy\" Pentland, Tao Zhou, Cesar A.\n  Hidalgo", "title": "Collective Learning in China's Regional Economic Development", "comments": "29 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Industrial development is the process by which economies learn how to produce\nnew products and services. But how do economies learn? And who do they learn\nfrom? The literature on economic geography and economic development has\nemphasized two learning channels: inter-industry learning, which involves\nlearning from related industries; and inter-regional learning, which involves\nlearning from neighboring regions. Here we use 25 years of data describing the\nevolution of China's economy between 1990 and 2015--a period when China\nmultiplied its GDP per capita by a factor of ten--to explore how Chinese\nprovinces diversified their economies. First, we show that the probability that\na province will develop a new industry increases with the number of related\nindustries that are already present in that province, a fact that is suggestive\nof inter-industry learning. Also, we show that the probability that a province\nwill develop an industry increases with the number of neighboring provinces\nthat are developed in that industry, a fact suggestive of inter-regional\nlearning. Moreover, we find that the combination of these two channels exhibit\ndiminishing returns, meaning that the contribution of either of these learning\nchannels is redundant when the other one is present. Finally, we address\nendogeneity concerns by using the introduction of high-speed rail as an\ninstrument to isolate the effects of inter-regional learning. Our\ndifferences-in-differences (DID) analysis reveals that the introduction of high\nspeed-rail increased the industrial similarity of pairs of provinces connected\nby high-speed rail. Also, industries in provinces that were connected by rail\nincreased their productivity when they were connected by rail to other\nprovinces where that industry was already present. These findings suggest that\ninter-regional and inter-industry learning played a role in China's great\neconomic expansion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 00:57:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Jian", ""], ["Jun", "Bogang", ""], ["Pentland", "Alex \"Sandy\"", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""], ["Hidalgo", "Cesar A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.02104", "submitter": "Francois Lafond", "authors": "Francois Lafond and Daniel Kim", "title": "Long-run dynamics of the U.S. patent classification system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00191-018-0603-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Almost by definition, radical innovations create a need to revise existing\nclassification systems. In this paper, we argue that classification system\nchanges and patent reclassification are common and reveal interesting\ninformation about technological evolution. To support our argument, we present\nthree sets of findings regarding classification volatility in the U.S. patent\nclassification system. First, we study the evolution of the number of distinct\nclasses. Reconstructed time series based on the current classification scheme\nare very different from historical data. This suggests that using the current\nclassification to analyze the past produces a distorted view of the evolution\nof the system. Second, we study the relative sizes of classes. The size\ndistribution is exponential so classes are of quite different sizes, but the\nlargest classes are not necessarily the oldest. To explain this pattern with a\nsimple stochastic growth model, we introduce the assumption that classes have a\nregular chance to be split. Third, we study reclassification. The share of\npatents that are in a different class now than they were at birth can be quite\nhigh. Reclassification mostly occurs across classes belonging to the same\n1-digit NBER category, but not always. We also document that reclassified\npatents tend to be more cited than non-reclassified ones, even after\ncontrolling for grant year and class of origin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 10:29:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 12:30:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lafond", "Francois", ""], ["Kim", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.02105", "submitter": "Kevin He", "authors": "Krishna Dasaratha, Kevin He", "title": "Network Structure and Naive Sequential Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Theoretical Economics 15(2):415-444, 2020", "doi": "10.3982/TE3388", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cs.SI econ.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a sequential-learning model featuring a network of naive agents with\nGaussian information structures.

We provide a\nsimple linear formula expressing agents' actions in terms of network paths and\nuse this formula to characterize the set of networks where naive agents\neventually learn correctly. This characterization implies that, on all networks\nwhere later agents observe more than one neighbor, there exist\ndisproportionately influential early agents who can cause herding on incorrect\nactions. Going beyond existing social-learning results, we compute the\nprobability of such mislearning exactly. This allows us to compare likelihoods\nof incorrect herding, and hence expected welfare losses, across network\nstructures.
