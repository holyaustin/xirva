The main result is that the system is\noverall MPSS if and only if it is MPSS in each subsystem.

In the R&D value chain, profitability and marketability stages are\nconnected in series, where the profitability stage is composed of operation and\nR&D efforts connected in parallel. The MPSS network model provides not only the\nMPSS measurement but also values that indicate the appropriate degree of\nintermediate measures for the two stages. Improvement strategy is given for\neach region based on the gap between the current and the appropriate level of\nintermediate measures. Our findings show that the marketability efficiency\nvalues of Chinese R&D regions were low, and no regions are operated under the\nMPSS. As a result, most Chinese regions performed inefficiently regarding both\nprofitability and marketability. This finding provides initial evidence that\nthe generally lower profitability and marketability efficiency of Chinese\nregions is a severe problem that may be due to wasted resources on production\nand R&D.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2019 06:20:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Assani", "Saeed", ""], ["Jiang", "Jianlin", ""], ["Assani", "Ahmad", ""], ["Yang", "Feng", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.04083", "submitter": "Mattathias Lerner", "authors": "Mattathias Lerner", "title": "The Impacts of the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on High School Status\n  Completion Rates", "comments": "Written as M.A. thesis for QMSS program at Columbia University", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Direct cash transfer programs have shown success as poverty interventions in\nboth the developing and developed world, yet little research exists examining\nthe society-wide outcomes of an unconditional cash transfer program disbursed\nwithout means-testing.
