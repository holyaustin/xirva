The model is expressed by a system of several nonlinear\ndifferential equations which involve parameters defined by probabilities.\nSociety is described as an ensemble of individuals divided into income classes;\nthe individuals exchange money through binary and ternary interactions, leaving\nthe total wealth unchanged. The ternary interactions represent taxation and\nredistribution effects. Dynamics is investigated through computational\nsimulations, the focus being on the effects that different fiscal policies and\ndifferently weighted welfare policies have on the long-run income\ndistributions. The model provides a tool which may contribute to the\nidentification of the most effective actions towards a reduction of economic\ninequality. We find for instance that, under certain hypotheses, the Gini index\nis more affected by a policy of reduction of the welfare and subsidies for the\nrich classes than by an increase of the upper tax rate. Such a policy also has\nthe effect of slightly increasing the total tax revenue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 14:48:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 10:03:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bertotti", "Maria Letizia", ""], ["Modanese", "Giovanni", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5305", "submitter": "Christoph Aymanns", "authors": "Christoph Aymanns, J.

The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,\nleverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical\nleverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in\nwhich gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic\nmarket collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using\nsimplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the\nnature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.\nWe introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to\ncontinuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the\npolicy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the\nendogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there\nis always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,\ncountercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the\nimpact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness\nvia the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator\nrelaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and\ntightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the\namplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nchoice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show\nhow they can control the leverage cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 16:28:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Aug 2014 15:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Aymanns", "Christoph", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
