Assessing cities'\nlong term trends remains challenging. The first part of this chapter describes\nthe short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices and\nprice-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip-level evidence\nsuggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization, and some impacts of urban\nprotests on house prices. The second part of the chapter analyzes the long-run\ndynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban\ngrowth, is explained by short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as\neducation, industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban\nsegregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter's original results as\nwell as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are\nthe key drivers of growth. The chapter illustrates this finding with two case\nstudies: the New York City housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San\nFrancisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both\nareas rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the\nurban metropolis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 13:59:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2020 03:35:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ouazad", "Amine", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.01043", "submitter": "Peng-Fei Dai", "authors": "Zhifeng Liu, Toan Luu Duc Huynh, Jianjun Sun, Peng-Fei Dai", "title": "COVID-19, economic policy uncertainty and stock market crash risk", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on\nthe crash risk of US stock market during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using Rational Choice Theory\n(RCT), neoclassical economics assumes that exchange between two individuals\nwill occur when resources are scarce and that these individuals interact\nrationally to satisfy their requirements (i.e., preferences). While RCT is\nuseful to characterize interaction in closed and stylized systems, it proves\ninsufficient to capture social and psychological reality where culture,\nemotions, and habits play an integral part in resource exchange. Social\nResource Theory (SRT) improves on RCT in several respects by making the social\nnature of resources the object of study. SRT shows how human interaction is\ndriven by an array of psychological mechanisms, from emotions to heuristics.\nThus, SRT provides a more realistic foundation for analyzing and explaining\nsocial exchange than the stylized instrumental rationality of RCT. Yet SRT has\nno clear place for events of abundance and sufficiency as additional\nmotivations to exchange resources.

In July 2020, each expert estimated the median, 5th percentile\nand 95th percentile quantiles of changes in price to April 2022 for ten food\ncategories under three end-2020 settlement Brexit scenarios: A: full WTO terms;\nB: a moderately disruptive trade agreement (better than WTO); C: a minimally\ndisruptive trade agreement. When combined in proportions for calculate Consumer\nPrices Index food basket costs, the median food price change under full WTO\nterms is expected to be +17.9% [90% credible interval:+5.2%, +35.1%]; with\nmoderately disruptive trade agreement: +13.2% [+2.6%, +26.4%] and with a\nminimally disruptive trade agreement +9.3% [+0.8%, +21.9%]. The number of\nhouseholds experiencing food insecurity and its severity are likely to increase\nbecause of expected sizeable increases in median food prices in the months\nafter Brexit, whereas low income group spending on food is unlikely to\nincrease, and may be further eroded by other factors not considered here (e.g.\nCOVID-19). Higher increases are more likely than lower rises and towards the\nupper limits, these would entail severe impacts. Research showing a low food\nbudget leads to increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services\nin both the short and longer term is likely to increase due to the effects of\nfood insecurity on the incidence and management of diet-sensitive conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 11:00:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Barons", "Martine J", ""], ["Aspinall", "Willy", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15889", "submitter": "Amanda Stathopoulos", "authors": "Elisa Borowski and Jason Soria and Joseph Schofer and Amanda\n  Stathopoulos", "title": "Disparities in ridesourcing demand for mobility resilience: A multilevel\n  analysis of neighborhood effects in Chicago, Illinois", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mobility resilience refers to the ability of individuals to complete their\ndesired travel despite unplanned disruptions to the transportation system. The\npotential of new on-demand mobility options, such as ridesourcing services, to\nfill unpredicted gaps in mobility is an underexplored source of adaptive\ncapacity. Applying a natural experiment approach to newly released ridesourcing\ndata, we examine variation in the gap-filling role of on-demand mobility during\nsudden shocks to a transportation system by analyzing the change in use of\nridesourcing during unexpected rail transit service disruptions across the\nracially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Using a multilevel mixed\nmodel, we control not only for the immediate station attributes where the\ndisruption occurs, but also for the broader context of the community area and\ncity quadrant in a three-level structure. Thereby the unobserved variability\nacross neighborhoods can be associated with differences in factors such as\ntransit ridership, or socio-economic status of residents, in addition to\ncontrolling for station level effects. Our findings reveal that individuals use\nridesourcing as a gap-filling mechanism during rail transit disruptions, but\nthere is strong variation across situational and locational contexts.\nSpecifically, our results show larger increases in transit disruption\nresponsive ridesourcing during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe\ndisruptions, as well as in community areas that have higher percentages of\nWhite residents and transit commuters, and on the more affluent northside of\nthe city. These findings point to new insights with far-reaching implications\non how ridesourcing complements existing transport networks by providing added\ncapacity during disruptions but does not appear to bring equitable gap-filling\nbenefits to low-income communities of color that typically have more limited\nmobility options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2020 19:06:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Borowski", "Elisa", ""], ["Soria", "Jason", ""], ["Schofer", "Joseph", ""], ["Stathopoulos", "Amanda", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.15907", "submitter": "Jasper Verschuur", "authors": "Jasper Verschuur, Elco Koks, Jim Hall", "title": "The implications of large-scale containment policies on global maritime\n  trade during the COVID-19 pandemic", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The implementation of large-scale containment measures by governments to\ncontain the spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in a large supply and\ndemand shock throughout the global economy.
