Digraph games are transferable utility (TU) games with limited\ncooperation among players, where players are represented by nodes. A\nrestrictive relation between two adjacent players is established by a directed\nline segment. Directed path, connecting the initial player with the terminal\nplayer, form the coalition among players. A dominance relation is established\nbetween players and this relation determines whether or not a player wants to\ncooperate. To cooperate, we assume that a player joins a coalition where he/she\nis not dominated by any other players.The Shapley value is defined as the\naverage of marginal contribution vectors corresponding to all permutations that\ndo not violate the subordination of players. The Shapley value for cyclic\ndigraph games is calculated and analyzed.

Suppose that we know for the coming years, economy\nof the US will experience a real growth rate equal to \\%3 and economy of China\nwill experience a real growth as of \\%6. Now, the question is how long does it\ntake for economy of China to catch the economy of the United States. The early\nimpression is that the desired time is the answer of the equation\n$11\\times1.06^X=18\\times1.03^X$. The correct answer however is quite different.\nGDP is not a simple number and the gap between two countries can not be\naddressed simply through their sizes. It is rather a geometrical object.\nCountries pass different paths in the space of production. The gaps between GDP\nof different countries depend on the path that each country passes through and\nlocal metric. To address distance between economies of China and of the US we\nneed to know their utility preferences and the path that China passes to reach\nthe US size. The true gap then can be found if we calculate local metric along\nthis path. It resembles impressions about measurements in the General Theory of\nRelativity. Path dependency of aggregate indexes is widely discussed in the\nIndex Number Theory. Our aim is to stick to the geometrical view presented in\nthe General Relativity to provide a visual understanding of the matter. We show\nthat different elements in the general relativity have their own counterparts\nin economics. We claim that national agencies who provide aggregate data\nresemble falling observers into a curved space time. It is while the World Bank\nor international organizations are outside observers.

We discuss to build a unified theory of\nrisky choice, which would explain both of compensatory and non-compensatory\ntheories. For risky choice, according to cognition ability, we argue that\npeople could not build a continuous and accurate subjective probability world,\nbut several order concepts, such as small, middle and large probability. People\nmake decisions based on information, experience, imagination and other things.\nAll of these things are so huge that people have to prepare some strategies.\nThat is, people have different strategies when facing to different situations.\nThe distributions of these things have different decision structures. More\nprecisely, decision making is a process of simplifying the decision structure.\nHowever, the process of decision structure simplifying is not stuck in a rut,\nbut through different path when facing problems repeatedly. It is why\npreference reversal always happens when making decisions. The most efficient\nway to simplify the decision structure is calculating expected value or making\ndecisions based on one or two dimensions. We also argue that the deliberation\ntime at least has four parts, which are consist of substitution time, first\norder time, second order time and calculation time. Decision structure also can\nsimply explain the phenomenon of paradoxes and anomalies.

The primary reason behind this stubborn food inflation is mismatch in\nsupply-demand, as domestic agricultural production has failed to keep up with\nrising demand owing to a number of proximate factors. The relative significance\nof these factors in determining the change in food prices have been analysed\nusing gradient boosted regression trees (BRT), a machine learning technique.\nThe results from BRT indicates all predictor variables to be fairly significant\nin explaining the change in food prices, with MSP and farm wages being\nrelatively more important than others.
