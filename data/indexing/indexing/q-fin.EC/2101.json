In TMC\nschemes, a regulator provides an initial endowment of mobility credits (or\ntokens) to all potential travelers. In order to use the transportation system,\ntravelers need to spend a certain amount of tokens (tariff) that could vary\nwith their choice of mode, route, departure time etc. The tokens can be bought\nand sold in a market that is managed by and operated by a regulator at a price\nthat is dynamically determined by the demand and supply of tokens. This paper\nproposes and analyzes alternative market models for a TMC system (focusing on\nmarket design aspects such as allocation/expiration of credits, rules governing\ntrading, transaction costs, regulator intervention, price dynamics), and\ndevelops a methodology to explicitly model the disaggregate behavior of\nindividuals within the market. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted\nwithin a departure time context for the morning commute problem to compare the\nperformance of the alternative designs relative to congestion pricing and a no\ncontrol scenario. The simulation experiments employ a day to day assignment\nframework wherein transportation demand is modeled using a logit-mixture model\nand supply is modeled using a standard bottleneck model.

Should this happen, it is likely that vehicles\npresently powered by hydrocarbons will be progressively replaced by Battery\nElectric Vehicles (BEVs). This paper describes the use of mathematical\nmodelling, drawing on real time records of the UK electricity grid, to\ninvestigate the likely performance of the grid when supplying power to a fleet\nof up to 35 million BEVs. The model highlights the importance of understanding\nhow the grid will cope when powering a BEV fleet under conditions similar to\nthose experienced during an extended wind lull during the 3rd week of January\n2017. Allowing a two-way flow of electricity between the BEVs and the grid,\nknown as the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) configuration, turns out to be of key\nimportance in minimising the need for additional gas turbine generation or\nenergy storage during wind lulls. This study has shown that with the use of\nV2G, it should be possible to provide power to about 15 million BEVs with the\ngas turbine capacity currently available. Without V2G, it is likely that the\ncurrent capacity of the gas turbines and associated gas infrastructure might be\noverwhelmed by even a relatively small BEV fleet. Since it is anticipated that\n80% of BEV owners will be able to park the vehicles at their residences,\nwidespread V2G will enable both the powering of residences when supply from the\ngrid is constrained and the charging of BEVs when supply is in excess. The\nmodel shows that this configuration will maintain a constant load on the grid\nand avoid the use of either expensive alternative storage or hydrogen obtained\nby reforming methane. There should be no insuperable problem in providing power\nto the 20% of BEV owners who do not have parking at their residences; their\npower could come directly from the grid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2020 03:40:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Stephens", "Anthony D", ""], ["Walwyn", "David R", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.01085", "submitter": "Michele Cantarella", "authors": "Michele Cantarella, Andrea Neri and Maria Giovanna Ranalli", "title": "Mind the wealth gap: a new allocation method to match micro and macro\n  statistics for household wealth", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.ME", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  The financial and economic crisis recently experienced by many European\ncountries has increased demand for timely, coherent and consistent\ndistributional information for the household sector.

Double-blind peer review, in which the authors' identities are\nmasked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer bias.\nAlthough intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review\nin reducing bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of\ndouble-blind peer review on prestige bias by analyzing the peer review files of\n5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning\nRepresentations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its\nreviewing policy from single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in\n2018. We find that after switching to double-blind review, the scores given to\nthe most prestigious authors significantly decreased. However, because many of\nthese papers were above the threshold for acceptance, the change did not affect\npaper acceptance decisions significantly. Nevertheless, we show that\ndouble-blind peer review may have improved the quality of the selections by\nlimiting other (non-author-prestige) biases. Specifically, papers rejected in\nthe single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the\ndouble-blind format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies\npoorer quality papers. Interestingly, an apparently unrelated change - the\nchange of rating scale from 10 to 4 points - likely reduced prestige bias\nsignificantly, to an extent that affected papers' acceptance. These results\nprovide some support for the effectiveness of double-blind review in reducing\nprestige bias, while opening new research directions on the impact of peer\nreview formats.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 18:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Mengyi", ""], ["Danfa", "Jainabou Barry", ""], ["Teplitskiy", "Misha", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.02857", "submitter": "Matthew Olckers", "authors": "Francis Bloch, Matthew Olckers", "title": "Friend-Based Ranking in Practice", "comments": "Forthcoming in AEA Papers & Proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A planner aims to target individuals who exceed a threshold in a\ncharacteristic, such as wealth or ability.

The\nequation so obtained is used to compute evolution of this joint distribution in\na society with initially low variation of wealth and contentment over a long\nperiod time. As illustration of this model capabilities, effects of the wealth\ntax rate are simulated and it is shown that a higher taxation in the longer run\nmay lead to a wealthier and more content society. It is also shown that lower\nrates of the wealth tax lead to pronounced stratification of the society in\nterms of both wealth and contentment and that there is no direct relationship\nbetween the average values of these two variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:08:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Burluka", "Alexey A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.05744", "submitter": "L\\'aszl\\'o Csat\\'o", "authors": "L\\'aszl\\'o Csat\\'o", "title": "A comparative study of scoring systems by simulations", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT cs.GT econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Scoring rules aggregate individual rankings by assigning some points to each\nposition in each ranking such that the total sum of points provides the overall\nranking of the alternatives.

The results indicate that individuals in ZIP codes with\npopulations of higher income experienced more severe disaster impact and\nrecovered more quickly than those located in lower-income ZIP codes for most\nbusiness sectors. Our findings not only enhance the understanding of spatial\npatterns and disparities in disaster impacts and recovery for better community\nresilience assessment, but also could benefit emergency managers, city\nplanners, and public officials in harnessing population activity data, using\ncredit card transactions as a proxy for activity, to improve situational\nawareness and resource allocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2021 16:06:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Yuan", "Faxi", ""], ["Esmalian", "Amir", ""], ["Oztekin", "Bora", ""], ["Mostafavi", "Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.10151", "submitter": "Cong Chen", "authors": "Cong Chen, Lang Tong, and Ye Guo", "title": "Pricing Energy Storage in Real-time Market", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SY cs.SY econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The problem of pricing utility-scale energy storage resources (ESRs) in the\nreal-time electricity market is considered. Under a rolling-window dispatch\nmodel where the operator centrally dispatches generation and consumption under\nforecasting uncertainty, it is shown that almost all uniform pricing schemes,\nincluding the standard locational marginal pricing (LMP), result in lost\nopportunity costs that require out-of-the-market settlements.

Temporal locational marginal\npricing (TLMP) is proposed for ESRs as a generalization of LMP to an in-market\ndiscriminative form. TLMP is a sum of the system-wide energy price, LMP, and\nthe individual state-of-charge price. It is shown that, under arbitrary\nforecasting errors, the rolling-window implementation of TLMP eliminates the\nlost opportunity costs and provides incentives to price-taking firms to bid\ntruthfully with their marginal costs.

Initially, I make a small introduction on hardware\nattacks on smart cards and some of the reasons behind them.

I proceed to identify how\nadding security features on such integrated circuits may affect the costs of\ntheir development and production. I then make a more thorough investigation on\nthe costs of developing a hardware attack for such chips and try to estimate\nthe potential damages and losses of such an attack. I also go on to examine\npotential ways of reducing the cost of production for secure chips, while\nidentifying the difficulties in adopting them.\n  This essay ends with the conclusion that adding security features to chips\nmeant to be used for secure applications is well worth it, because the costs of\ndeveloping attacks are of comparable amounts to the costs of developing and\nproducing a chip and the potential damages and losses caused by such attacks\ncan be way higher than these costs. Therefore, although the production and\ndevelopment of integrated circuits come at a certain cost and security\nintroduces further additional costs, security is inherently unavoidable in such\nchips. Finally, I additionally identify that security is an evolving concept\nand does not aim to make a chip totally impenetrable, as this may be\nimpossible, but to lower the potential risks, including that of being\ncompromised, to acceptable levels. Thus, a balance needs be found between the\nlevel of security and the levels of cost and risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2021 18:22:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Anagnostopoulos", "Nikolaos Athanasios", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.10408", "submitter": "Eiji Yamamura", "authors": "Eiji Yamamura and Yoshiro Tsutsui", "title": "How COVID-19 influences healthcare workers' happiness: Panel data\n  analysis in Japan", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Healthcare workers are more likely to be infected with the 2019 novel\ncoronavirus (COVID-19) because of unavoidable contact with infected people.\nAlthough they are equipped to reduce the likelihood of infection, their\ndistress has increased.
