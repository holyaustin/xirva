Moreover,\nfor ethical reasons, data access is often granted only to particular subsets,\nrestricting analyses to cover single days, weeks, or geographical areas.\nConsequently, it is frequently impossible to set a particular analysis or event\nin its context and know how typical it is, compared to other days, weeks or\nmonths. This is important for academic referees questioning research on mobile\nphone data and for the analysts in deciding how to sample, how much data to\nprocess, and which events are anomalous. All these issues require an\nunderstanding of variability in Big Data to answer the question of how average\nis average? This paper provides a method, using a large mobile phone dataset,\nto answer these basic but necessary questions. We show that file size is a\nrobust proxy for the activity level of phone users by profiling the temporal\nvariability of the data at an hourly, daily and monthly level. We then apply\ntime-series analysis to isolate temporal periodicity. Finally, we discuss\nconfidence limits to anomalous events in the data. We recommend an analytical\napproach to mobile phone data selection which suggests that ideally data should\nbe sampled across days, across working weeks, and across the year, to obtain a\nrepresentative average. However, where this is impossible, the temporal\nvariability is such that specific weekdays' data can provide a fair picture of\nother days in their general structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 23:06:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Toger", "Marina", ""], ["Shuttleworth", "Ian", ""], ["\u00d6sth", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.01273", "submitter": "Ritwik Banerjee", "authors": "Ritwik Banerjee, Joydeep Bhattacharya, Priyama Majumdar", "title": "Exponential-growth prediction bias and compliance with safety measures\n  in the times of COVID-19", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We conduct a unique, Amazon MTurk-based global experiment to investigate the\nimportance of an exponential-growth prediction bias (EGPB) in understanding why\nthe COVID-19 outbreak has exploded.

The Euclidean index is proposed to reward\nquality over quantity, while the rectangle index can be an appropriate measure\nof core performance. Their differences are highlighted through an axiomatic\nanalysis and several examples. Our approach also requires a weighting scheme to\ncompare different achievements. The methodology is illustrated by studying the\nknockout stage of the UEFA Champions League in the 16 seasons played between\n2003 and 2019: club and country performances as well as three types of\ncompetitive balance are considered. Measuring competition at the level of\nnational associations is a novelty. All results are remarkably robust\nconcerning the bibliometric index and the assigned weights. Inequality has not\nincreased among the elite clubs and between the national associations, however,\nit has changed within some countries. Since the performances of national\nassociations are more stable than the results of individual clubs, it would be\nbetter to build the seeding in the UEFA Champions League group stage upon\nassociation coefficients adjusted for league finishing positions rather than\nclub coefficients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 15:20:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2020 10:41:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Csat\u00f3", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", ""], ["Petr\u00f3czy", "D\u00f3ra Gr\u00e9ta", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13722", "submitter": "Ian Trotter", "authors": "Ian M.

However, the consequences of widespread use of these\nunprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the\nunderstanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures,\nwe therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a\npandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the\nimpact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large\nnumber of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy\nintervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy\nintervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is\ngrowing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most\nsevere measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently\nspread. The intensity of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not\nappear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the\nstrongly concave relationship that we identify between production shortfall and\ninfection rate reductions. Our experiments further suggest that the\nintervention should last until after the peak established by the reduced\ninfection rate, which implies that stricter policies should last longer. The\nmodel and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy\nexperiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses\nin the face of a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the\nrelationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2020 01:03:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2020 19:02:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 11:33:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Trotter", "Ian M.", ""], ["Schmidt", "Lu\u00eds A.
