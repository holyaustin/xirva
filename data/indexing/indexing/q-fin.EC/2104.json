In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense.

On\nthis account, we incorporate household travels into the work starting time\nchoice model in this study. Both short-run travel behaviours and long-run work\nstart time selection of heterogenous commuters are examined under agglomeration\neconomies. If flextime is not flexible enough, commuters tend to agglomerate in\nwork schedule choice at long-run equilibrium. Further, we analyze optimal\nschedule choices with two system performance indicators. For total commuting\ncost, it is found that the rigid school schedule for households may impede the\nbenefits of flextime in commuting cost saving. In terms of total net benefit,\nwhile work schedule agglomeration of all commuters leads to the maximum in some\ncases, the polarized agglomeration of the two heterogenous groups can never\nachieve the optimum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2021 08:37:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Su", "Qida", ""], ["Wang", "David Z.

The central problem is to use the limited\nnumber of vaccines in a country to reduce the risk of infection and mitigate\neconomic uncertainty at the same time. In this paper, we propose a simple\neconomic model for vaccine allocation across two types of workers:\nwhite-collars can work from home; while blue-collars must work on site. These\nworker types are complementary to each other, thus a negative shock to the\nsupply of either one decreases the demand for the other that leads to\nunemployment. Using parameters of blue and white-collar labor supply, their\ninfection risks, productivity losses at home office during lock-down, and\navailable vaccines, we express the optimal share of vaccines allocated to\nblue-collars. The model points to the dominance of blue-collar vaccination,\nespecially during waves when their relative infection risks increase and when\nthe number of available vaccines is limited. Taking labor supply data from 28\nEuropean countries, we quantify blue-collar vaccine allocation that minimizes\nunemployment across levels of blue- and white-collar infection risks. The model\nfavours blue-collar vaccination identically across European countries in case\nof vaccine scarcity. As more vaccines become available, economies that host\nlarge-shares of employees in home-office shall increasingly immunize them in\ncase blue-collar infection risks can be kept down.

In this study,\nwe look at the impact of the presence of related MNE industries on the entry\nand exit of domestic export industries in Irish regions before, during, and\nafter the 2008 financial crisis. Specifically, we are interested in whether the\npresence of MNEs in a region results in knowledge spillovers and the creation\nof new domestic export activities in related sectors. To quantify how related\nan industry is to a region's current export basket we deploy an existing\ncohesion variable, closeness, that measures the relatedness of a new industry\nto existing industries within a region. We also introduce a new variable,\nstrategic closeness, which captures not only the relatedness of industries\nwithin a region but their own connectivity or embeddedness. We use a dataset\ncontaining all government-supported export firms in Ireland between 2006-2018.\nWe find that the presence of related MNE industries is associated with the\nentry of new domestic activity, suggesting that Irish regions benefited from\ndomestic-MNE linkages.

To provide some\nquantitative elements of response to these questions, we consider the\nwell-known SEIR model for the Covid-19 epidemic propagation and propose a\npragmatic model of the government decision-making operation. Although simple\nand obviously improvable, the proposed model allows us to study the tradeoff\nbetween health and economic aspects in a pragmatic and insightful way. Assuming\na given number of phases for the epidemic and a desired tradeoff between health\nand economic aspects, it is then possible to determine the optimal duration of\neach phase and the optimal severity level for each of them. The numerical\nanalysis is performed for the case of France but the adopted approach can be\napplied to any country. One of the takeaway messages of this analysis is that\nbeing able to implement the optimal 4-phase epidemic management strategy in\nFrance would have led to 1.05 million infected people and a GDP loss of 231\nbillion euro instead of 6.88 million of infected and a loss of 241 billion\neuro.

In this\nresearch study, which selected a population from the LinkedIn platform,\nstatistical differences between gender, age, education-level, and income-level\nwere confirmed. These differences helped to confirm prior research in this\nfield of study. Practical opportunities for commercial outreach to specific\npopulations became evident through this type of research. Providers of\ninvestment and financial planning information can access their targeted\naudience more effectively by understanding the demographic profile of the\naudience, as well as the propensity of the demographic profile of the audience\nto respond. As this type of research is relatively easy to construct and\nadminister, commercial outreach for providers of investment and financial\nplanning information can be conducted in a cost-efficient and effective manner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 01:59:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Bechly", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.10973", "submitter": "Sanmay Shelat", "authors": "Sanmay Shelat, Oded Cats, Sander van Cranenburgh", "title": "Avoiding the Crowd: Traveller Behaviour in Public Transport in the Age\n  of COVID-19", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Public transport ridership around the world has been hit hard by the COVID-19\npandemic.

Classical economic theory, according\nto which a specific behavior becomes more prevalent when it is rewarded,\nstruggles to explain why incentives sometimes backfire. More recent theories\ntherefore posit a reputational cost offsetting the benefits of receiving an\nincentive -- yet unexplained effects of incentives remain, for instance across\nincentive types and countries. We propose that social norms can offer an\nexplanation for these inconsistencies. Ultimately, social norms determine the\nreputational costs or benefits resulting from a given behavior, and thus\nvariation in the effect of incentives may reflect variation in norms. We\nimplemented a formal model of prosocial behavior integrating social norms,\nwhich we empirically tested on the real-world prosocial behavior of blood\ndonation. Blood donation is essential for many life-saving medical procedures,\nbut also presents an ideal testing ground for our theory: Various incentive\npolicies for blood donors exist across countries, enabling a comparative\napproach. Our preregistered analyses reveal that social norms can indeed\naccount for the varying effects of financial and time incentives on\nindividual-level blood donation behavior across 28 European countries.\nIncentives are associated with higher levels of prosociality when norms\nregarding the incentive are more positive. The results indicate that social\nnorms play an important role in explaining the relationship between incentives\nand prosocial behavior.
