Agents have homophilous preferences and limited capacity,\nso they maintain links with others who are learned to be similar to themselves\nand cut links to others who are learned to be dissimilar to themselves. Thus\nlearning influences the evolution of the network, but learning is imperfect so\nthe evolution is stochastic. Homophily matters. Higher levels of homophily\ndecrease the (average) number of links that agents form. However, the effect of\nhomophily is anomalous: mutually beneficial links may be dropped before\nlearning is completed, thereby resulting in sparser networks and less\nclustering than under complete information. There may be big differences\nbetween the networks that emerge under complete and incomplete information.\nHomophily matters here as well: initially, greater levels of homophily increase\nthe difference between the complete and incomplete information networks, but\nsufficiently high levels of homophily eventually decrease the difference.\nComplete and incomplete information networks differ the most when the degree of\nhomophily is intermediate. With multiple stages of life, the effects of\nincomplete information are large initially but fade somewhat over time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 21:34:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["van der Schaar", "Mihaela", ""], ["Zhang", "Simpson", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08335", "submitter": "Kibaek Kim", "authors": "Victor M.

We extend and analyze the stochastic\nclearing formulation proposed by Pritchard et al. (2010) in which the social\nsurplus function induces penalties between day-ahead and real-time quantities.\nWe prove that the formulation yields price distortions that are bounded by the\nbid prices, and we show that adding a similar penalty term to transmission\nflows and phase angles ensures boundedness throughout the network. We prove\nthat when the price distortions are zero, day-ahead quantities converge to the\nquantile of real-time counterparts. The undesired effects of price distortions\nsuggest that stochastic settings provide significant benefits over\ndeterministic ones that go beyond social surplus improvements. We propose\nadditional metrics to evaluate these benefits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 15:02:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zavala", "Victor M.", ""], ["Kim", "Kibaek", ""], ["Anitescu", "Mihai", ""], ["Birge", "John", ""]]}]
