Therefore, the enterprises, which plan to act on\nterms of social and ethical marketing, should monitor the social responsibility\nof consumers in the relevant markets. At the same time, special attention\nshould be paid to the analysis of factors that prevent consumers from\nimplementing their socially responsible intentions in the regions with a low\nlevel of social activity of consumers. The purpose of the article is to develop\nmethodological guidelines that determine the tasks and directions of conducting\nempirical studies aimed at assessing the gap between the socially responsible\nintentions of consumers and the actual implementation of these intentions, as\nwell as to identify the causes of this gap. An empirical survey of the sampled\nconsumers in Kharkiv was carried out in terms of the proposed methodological\nprovisions. It revealed a rather high level of respondents' willingness to\nsupport socially responsible enterprises and a rather low level of\nimplementation of these intentions due to the lack of consumers awareness. To\ntest the proposed methodological guidelines, an empirical study of the\nconsumers social responsibility was conducted in 2017 on a sample of students\nand professors of the Semen Kuznets Kharkiv National University of Economics\n(120 people). Questioning of the respondents was carried out using the Google\nForms. The finding allowed to make conclusion for existence of a high level of\nrespondents' willingness to support socially responsible and socially active\nenterprises. However, the study also revealed the existence of a significant\ngap between the intentions and actions of consumers, caused by the lack of\nawareness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jan 2019 18:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Potrashkova", "Lyudmyla", ""], ["Raiko", "Diana", ""], ["Tseitlin", "Leonid", ""], ["Savchenko", "Olga", ""], ["Nagy", "Szabolcs", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00227", "submitter": "Shenhao Wang", "authors": "Shenhao Wang, Qingyi Wang, Jinhua Zhao", "title": "Multitask Learning Deep Neural Networks to Combine Revealed and Stated\n  Preference Data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN cs.LG q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is an enduring question how to combine revealed preference (RP) and stated\npreference (SP) data to analyze travel behavior. This study presents a\nframework of multitask learning deep neural networks (MTLDNNs) for this\nquestion, and demonstrates that MTLDNNs are more generic than the traditional\nnested logit (NL) method, due to its capacity of automatic feature learning and\nsoft constraints. About 1,500 MTLDNN models are designed and applied to the\nsurvey data that was collected in Singapore and focused on the RP of four\ncurrent travel modes and the SP with autonomous vehicles (AV) as the one new\ntravel mode in addition to those in RP. We found that MTLDNNs consistently\noutperform six benchmark models and particularly the classical NL models by\nabout 5% prediction accuracy in both RP and SP datasets. This performance\nimprovement can be mainly attributed to the soft constraints specific to\nMTLDNNs, including its innovative architectural design and regularization\nmethods, but not much to the generic capacity of automatic feature learning\nendowed by a standard feedforward DNN architecture. Besides prediction, MTLDNNs\nare also interpretable. The empirical results show that AV is mainly the\nsubstitute of driving and AV alternative-specific variables are more important\nthan the socio-economic variables in determining AV adoption. Overall, this\nstudy introduces a new MTLDNN framework to combine RP and SP, and demonstrates\nits theoretical flexibility and empirical power for prediction and\ninterpretation. Future studies can design new MTLDNN architectures to reflect\nthe speciality of RP and SP and extend this work to other behavioral analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2019 01:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Aug 2019 22:26:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shenhao", ""], ["Wang", "Qingyi", ""], ["Zhao", "Jinhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00283", "submitter": "Szabolcs Nagy Dr.", "authors": "Szabolcs Nagy", "title": "Digital Economy And Society.
