The\nopportunity cost is defined as the difference between the profit when the\ninstructions of the market operator are followed and when the market\nparticipants can freely make their own decisions based on the market prices. We\nuse the minimum complementarity approximation to the minimum total opportunity\ncost (MTOC) model, from previous research, with tests on a much more realistic\nunit commitment (UC) model than in previous research, including features such\nas reserve requirements, ramping constraints, and minimum up and down times.\nThe developed model incorporates flexible price responsive demand, as in\nprevious research, but since not all demand is price responsive, we consider\nthe more realistic case that total demand is a mixture of fixed and flexible.\nAnother improvement over previous MTOC research is computational: whereas the\nprevious research had nonconvex terms among the objective function's continuous\nvariables, we convert the objective to an equivalent form that contains only\nlinear and convex quadratic terms in the continuous variables. We compare the\nunit commitment model with the standard social welfare optimization version of\nUC, in a series of sensitivity analyses, varying flexible demand to represent\nvarying degrees of future penetration of electric vehicles and smart\nappliances, different ratios of generation availability, and different values\nof transmission line capacities to consider possible congestion. The minimum\ntotal opportunity cost and social welfare solutions are mostly very close in\ndifferent scenarios, except in some extreme cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2018 21:26:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shavandi", "Hassan", ""], ["Pirnia", "Mehrdad", ""], ["Fuller", "J.
