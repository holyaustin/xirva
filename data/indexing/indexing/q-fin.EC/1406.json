We propose a game theoretic framework that\naddresses these questions and show that the lognormal distribution is the\nfairest inequality of pay in an organization comprising of homogenous agents,\nachieved at equilibrium, under ideal free market conditions. We also show that\nfor a population of two different classes of agents, the final distribution is\na combination of two different lognormal distributions where one of them,\ncorresponding to the top 3-5% of the population, can be misidentified as a\nPareto distribution. Our theory also shows the deep and direct connection\nbetween potential game theory and statistical mechanics through entropy, which\nis a measure of fairness in a distribution.
