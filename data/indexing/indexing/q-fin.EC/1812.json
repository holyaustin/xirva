It is the multi-dimensional nature of\nmigration that underlines its significance in the process of human development.\nHuman mobility extends in the spatial domain from local travel to international\nmigration, and in the temporal dimension from short-term stays to permanent\nrelocations. Classification and measurement of such phenomena is inevitably\ncomplex, which has severely hindered progress in comparative research, with\nvery few large-scale cross-national comparisons of migration. The linkages\nbetween migration and education have been explored in a separate line of\ninquiry that has predominantly focused on country-specific analyses as to the\nways in which migration affects educational outcomes and how educational\nattainment affects migration behaviour. A recurrent theme has been the\neducational selectivity of migrants, which in turn leads to an increase of\nhuman capital in some regions, primarily cities, at the expense of others.\nQuestions have long been raised as to the links between education and migration\nin response to educational expansion, but have not yet been fully answered\nbecause of the absence, until recently, of adequate data for comparative\nanalysis of migration.

To simplify their choice problem, individuals may pay\nattention to only a subset of available alternatives. We design and implement a\nnovel online experiment that exogenously varies choice sets and consideration\ncosts for a large sample of individuals. We provide a theoretical and\nstatistical framework that allows us to test random consideration at the\npopulation level. Within this framework, we compare competing models of random\nconsideration. We find that the standard random utility model fails to explain\nthe population behavior. However, our results suggest that a model of random\nconsideration with logit attention and heterogeneous preferences provides a\ngood explanation for the population behavior. Finally, we find that the random\nconsideration rule that subjects use is different for different consideration\ncosts while preferences are not. We observe that the higher the consideration\ncost the further behavior is from the full-consideration benchmark, which\nsupports the hypothesis that hard choices have a substantial negative impact on\nwelfare via limited consideration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Dec 2018 23:01:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2019 13:08:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Aguiar", "Victor H.", ""], ["Boccardi", "Maria Jose", ""], ["Kashaev", "Nail", ""], ["Kim", "Jeongbin", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.10108", "submitter": "Yaryna Kolomiytseva", "authors": "Yaryna Kolomiytseva", "title": "Revisiting Transformation and Directional Technology Distance Functions", "comments": "25 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the first part of the paper, we prove the equivalence of the unsymmetric\ntransformation function and an efficient joint production function (JPF) under\nstrong monotonicity conditions imposed on input and output correspondences.\nMonotonicity, continuity, and convexity properties sufficient for a symmetric\ntransformation function to be an efficient JPF are also stated.
