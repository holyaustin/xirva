To develop a better understanding of this mechanism we approach a\ntechnology as a body of knowledge consisting of interlinked inventions.\nTechnological cumulativeness can then be understood as the extent to which\ninventions build on other inventions within that same body of knowledge. The\ncumulativeness of a technology is therefore characterized by the structure of\nits knowledge base, which is different from, but closely related to, the size\nof its knowledge base. We analytically derive equations describing the relation\nbetween the cumulativeness and the size of the knowledge base. In addition, we\nempirically test our ideas for a number of selected technologies, using patent\ndata. Our results suggest that cumulativeness increases proportionally with the\nsize of the knowledge base, at a rate which varies considerably across\ntechnologies. At the same time we find that across technologies, this rate is\ninversely related to the rate of invention over time. This suggests that the\ncumulativeness increases relatively slow in rapidly growing technologies. In\nsum, the presented approach allows for an in-depth, systematic analysis of\ncumulativeness variations across technologies and the knowledge dynamics\nunderlying technology development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 21:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2021 13:36:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Persoon", "P.

In the latter case, the population of traders is\nfragmented across the markets. For the more general case of markets with\ndifferent biases, we note that market dominance is the more typical scenario.\nThese results are interesting because previously either strong differentiation\nof markets or heterogeneity in the needs of traders was found to be a necessary\ncondition for market coexistence.

The objective of this manuscript is to\nprovide an accessible introduction to this emerging field for economists that\nis centered around quantum computing and quantum money. We proceed in three\nsteps. First, we discuss basic concepts in quantum computing and quantum\ncommunication, assuming knowledge of linear algebra and statistics, but not of\ncomputer science or physics. This covers fundamental topics, such as qubits,\nsuperposition, entanglement, quantum circuits, oracles, and the no-cloning\ntheorem. Second, we provide an overview of quantum money, an early invention of\nthe quantum communication literature that has recently been partially\nimplemented in an experimental setting. One form of quantum money offers the\nprivacy and anonymity of physical cash, the option to transact without the\ninvolvement of a third party, and the efficiency and convenience of a debit\ncard payment. Such features cannot be achieved in combination with any other\nform of money. Finally, we review all existing quantum speedups that have been\nidentified for algorithms used to solve and estimate economic models. This\nincludes function approximation, linear systems analysis, Monte Carlo\nsimulation, matrix inversion, principal component analysis, linear regression,\ninterpolation, numerical differentiation, and true random number generation.
