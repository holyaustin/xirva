A\nvariety of regression machine learning algorithms are known to be effective for\nhealth care cost predictions. The purpose of this experiment was to build an\nAzure Machine Learning Studio tool for rapid assessment of multiple types of\nregression models. The tool offers environment for comparing 14 types of\nregression models in a unified experiment: linear regression, Bayesian linear\nregression, decision forest regression, boosted decision tree regression,\nneural network regression, Poisson regression, Gaussian processes for\nregression, gradient boosted machine, nonlinear least squares regression,\nprojection pursuit regression, random forest regression, robust regression,\nrobust regression with mm-type estimators, support vector regression. The tool\npresents assessment results arranged by model accuracy in a single table using\nfive performance metrics. Evaluation of regression machine learning models for\nperforming hospital case cost prediction demonstrated advantage of robust\nregression model, boosted decision tree regression and decision forest\nregression. The operational tool has been published to the web and openly\navailable for experiments and extensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 02:40:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2018 04:00:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Botchkarev", "Alexei", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02333", "submitter": "Oleg Malafeyev", "authors": "Oleg Malafeyev, Olga Koroleva, Dmitriy Prusskiy, Olga Zenovich", "title": "Corruption-free scheme of entering into contract: mathematical model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main purpose of this paper is to formalize the modelling process,\nanalysis and mathematical definition of corruption when entering into a\ncontract between principal agent and producers.

This paper presents the business cycle model without using general\nequilibrium framework. We treat agents risk assessments as their coordinates x\non economic space and establish distribution of all economic agents by their\nrisk coordinates. We suggest aggregation of agents and their variables by\nscales large to compare with risk scales of single agents and small to compare\nwith economic domain on economic space. Such model is alike to transition from\nkinetic description of multi-particle system to hydrodynamic approximation.\nAggregates of agents extensive variables with risk coordinate x determine macro\nvariables as functions of x alike to hydrodynamic variables. Economic and\nfinancial transactions between agents define evolution of their variables.\nAggregation of transactions between agents with risk coordinates x and y\ndetermine macro transactions as functions of x and y and define evolution of\nmacro variables at points x and y. We describe evolution and interactions\nbetween macro transactions by hydrodynamic-like system of economic equations.\nWe show that business cycles are described as consequence of the system of\neconomic equations on macro transactions. As example we describe Credit\ntransactions CL(tax,y) that provide Loans from Creditors at point x to\nBorrowers at point y and Loan-Repayment transactions LR(t,x,y) that describe\nrepayments from Borrowers at point y to Creditors at point x. We use\nhydrodynamic-like economic equations and derive from them the system of\nordinary differential equations that describe business cycle fluctuations of\nmacro Credits C(t) and macro Loan-Repayments LR(t) of the entire economics. The\nnature of business cycle fluctuations is explained as oscillations of \"mean\nrisk\" of economic variables on bounded economic domain of economic space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Mar 2018 12:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Olkhov", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.09532", "submitter": "Henry Ngongo Muganza", "authors": "Antoine Kamiantako Miyamueni, Henry Ngongo Muganza", "title": "Chocs technologiques, chocs des prix et fluctuations du ch\\^omage en\n  R\\'epublique D\\'emocratique du Congo", "comments": "in French", "journal-ref": "Revue congolaise d'\\'economie et de gestion, vol. 12, num\\'ero 12,\n  Universit\\'e Protestante au Congo, avril 2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The main purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of macroeconomic\nshocks on unemployment fluctuations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).\nUsing the SVECM model on DRC data for the period 1960 to 2014, the conclusion\nis that the high and persistent level of unemployment is mainly explained\npermanently by technological and price shocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Apr 2018 11:20:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Miyamueni", "Antoine Kamiantako", ""], ["Muganza", "Henry Ngongo", ""]]}]
