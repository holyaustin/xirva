Originally a single-objective optimal\ncontrol problem has been defined on DICE dynamics, which is aimed to maximize\nthe social welfare. In this paper, a bi-objective optimal control problem\ndefined on DICE model, objectives of which are maximizing social welfare and\nminimizing the temperature deviation of atmosphere. This multi-objective\noptimal control problem solved using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II\n(NSGA-II) also it is compared to previous works on single-objective version of\nthe problem. The resulting Pareto front rediscovers the previous results and\ngeneralizes to a wide range of non-dominant solutions to minimize the global\ntemperature deviation while optimizing the economic welfare. The previously\nused single-objective approach is unable to create such a variety of\npossibilities, hence, its offered solution is limited in vision and reachable\nperformance. Beside this, resulting Pareto-optimal set reveals the fact that\ntemperature deviation cannot go below a certain lower limit, unless we have\nsignificant technology advancement or positive change in global conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 20:41:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Heris", "Mostapha Kalami", ""], ["Rahnamayan", "Shahryar", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.00486", "submitter": "Yu Hu", "authors": "Yu Hu, David Soler Soneira, Mar\\'ia Jes\\'us S\\'anchez", "title": "Barriers to grid-connected battery systems: Evidence from the Spanish\n  electricity market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electrical energy storage is considered essential for the future energy\nsystems. Among all the energy storage technologies, battery systems may provide\nflexibility to the power grid in a more distributed and decentralized way. In\ncountries with deregulated electricity markets, grid-connected battery systems\nshould be operated under the specific market design of the country. In this\nwork, using the Spanish electricity market as an example, the barriers to\ngrid-connected battery systems are investigated using utilization analysis. The\nconcept of \"potentially profitable utilization time\" is proposed and introduced\nto identify and evaluate future potential grid applications for battery\nsystems. The numerical and empirical analysis suggests that the high cycle cost\nfor battery systems is still the main barrier for grid-connected battery\nsystems. In Spain, for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market, it is\nrequired that the battery wear cost decreases to 15 Euro/MWh to make the\npotentially profitable utilization rate higher than 20%. Nevertheless, the\npotentially profitable utilization of batteries is much higher in the\napplications when higher flexibility is demanded. The minimum required battery\nwear cost corresponding to 20% potentially profitable utilization time\nincreases to 35 Euro/MWh for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market and\nancillary services, and 50 Euro/MWh for upward secondary reserve.

A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active\nmonetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing\nor Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the\nshort-term.

Outbreaks in\nU.S. nursing homes have persisted despite nationwide visitor restrictions\nbeginning in mid-March. An early report issued by the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention identified staff members working in multiple nursing\nhomes as a likely source of spread from the Life Care Center in Kirkland,\nWashington to other skilled nursing facilities. The full extent of staff\nconnections between nursing homes---and the crucial role these connections\nserve in spreading a highly contagious respiratory infection---is currently\nunknown given the lack of centralized data on cross-facility nursing home\nemployment. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale analysis of nursing\nhome connections via shared staff using device-level geolocation data from 30\nmillion smartphones, and find that 7 percent of smartphones appearing in a\nnursing home also appeared in at least one other facility---even after visitor\nrestrictions were imposed.

Research suggests that an immigrant's\ninitial arrival location plays a key role in shaping their economic success.\nYet immigrants currently lack access to personalized information that would\nhelp them identify optimal destinations. Instead, they often rely on\navailability heuristics, which can lead to the selection of sub-optimal landing\nlocations, lower earnings, elevated outmigration rates, and concentration in\nthe most well-known locations. To address this issue and counteract the effects\nof cognitive biases and limited information, we propose a data-driven decision\nhelper that draws on behavioral insights, administrative data, and machine\nlearning methods to inform immigrants' location decisions. The decision helper\nprovides personalized location recommendations that reflect immigrants'\npreferences as well as data-driven predictions of the locations where they\nmaximize their expected earnings given their profile. We illustrate the\npotential impact of our approach using backtests conducted with administrative\ndata that links landing data of recent economic immigrants from Canada's\nExpress Entry system with their earnings retrieved from tax records.\nSimulations across various scenarios suggest that providing location\nrecommendations to incoming economic immigrants can increase their initial\nearnings and lead to a mild shift away from the most populous landing\ndestinations. Our approach can be implemented within existing institutional\nstructures at minimal cost, and offers governments an opportunity to harness\ntheir administrative data to improve outcomes for economic immigrants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2020 23:02:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ferwerda", "Jeremy", ""], ["Adams-Cohen", "Nicholas", ""], ["Bansak", "Kirk", ""], ["Fei", "Jennifer", ""], ["Lawrence", "Duncan", ""], ["Weinstein", "Jeremy M.", ""], ["Hainmueller", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.14022", "submitter": "Andreas Tryphonides", "authors": "Andreas Tryphonides", "title": "Heterogeneity and the Dynamic Effects of Aggregate Shocks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using a semi-structural approach, the paper identifies how heterogeneity and\nfinancial frictions affect the transmission of aggregate shocks.
