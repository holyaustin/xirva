Not surprisingly, the optimal\nwealth tax rate is either 0% for a deeply dysfunctional government and/or\nhighly productive private sector, or 100 % for a highly efficient public sector\nand/or debilitated/risk averse private investors. If the gap between the\npublic/private performance is moderate, there is an optimal positive wealth tax\nrate maximizing economic growth, even -- counter-intuitively -- when the\nprivate sector generates more growth. The compromise between profitable private\ninvestments and taxation however leads to a residual level of inequalities.

Whether a product is selected in a market crucially relates to\nits competitiveness, but the selection in turn affects the landscape of\ncompetition. Such a feedback mechanism has been illustrated in a duopoly model\nby Lambert et al., in which a buyer's satisfaction is updated depending on the\n{\\em freshness} of a purchased product. The probability for buyer $n$ to select\nseller $i$ is assumed to be $p_{n,i} \\propto e^{ S_{n,i}/T}$, where $S_{n,i}$\nis the buyer's satisfaction and $T$ is an effective temperature to introduce\nstochasticity. If $T$ decreases below a critical point $T_c$, the system\nundergoes a transition from a symmetric phase to an asymmetric one, in which\nonly one of the two sellers is selected. In this work, we extend the model by\nincorporating a simple price system. By considering a greed factor $g$ to\ncontrol how the satisfaction depends on the price, we argue the existence of an\noscillatory phase in addition to the symmetric and asymmetric ones in the\n$(T,g)$ plane, and estimate the phase boundaries through mean-field\napproximations. The analytic results show that the market preserves the\ninherent symmetry between the sellers for lower $T$ in the presence of the\nprice system, which is confirmed by our numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2015 05:19:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 04:29:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Yi", "Su Do", ""], ["Baek", "Seung Ki", ""], ["Chevereau", "Guillaume", ""], ["Bertin", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02056", "submitter": "Sharif Mukul Mr.", "authors": "S.A.

For each of them, we prove that the\nMinimax social choice correspondence is immune to it if and only if the number\nof voters and the number of alternatives satisfy suitable arithmetical\nconditions. We prove those facts thanks to a new characterization of the\nMinimax social choice correspondence and using a graph theory approach. We\ndiscuss the same issue for the Borda and Copeland social choice\ncorrespondences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 11:06:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 14:11:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bubboloni", "Daniela", ""], ["Gori", "Michele", ""]]}]
