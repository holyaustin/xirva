Following Chichilnisky, we introduce an additional term, which models\nconcern for the well-being of future generations. We show that there are no\noptimal solutions, but that there are equilibrium strateges, i.e. Nash\nequilibria of the leader-follower game between successive generations. To solve\nthe problem, we approximate the Chichilnisky criterion by a biexponential\ncriterion, we characterize its equilibria by a pair of coupled differential\nequations of HJB type, and we go to the limit. We find all the equilibrium\nstrategies for the Chichilnisky criterion. The mathematical analysis is\ndifficult because one has to solve an implicit differential equation in the\nsense of Thom. Our analysis extends earlier work by Ekeland and Lazrak. It is\nshown that optimal solutions a class of problems raising from time\ninconsistency problems in the framework of the neoclassical one-sector model of\neconomic growth, and contains new results in environment economics. Without\nexogenous commitment mechanism, a notion of the equilibrium strategies instead\nof the optimal strategies is introduced. We characterized the equilibrium\nstrategies by an integro-differential equation system. For two special\ncriteria, the bi-exponential criteria and the Chichilnisky criteria, we\nestablished the existence of the equilibrium strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 03:30:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ekeland", "Ivar", ""], ["Long", "Yiming", ""], ["Zhou", "Qinglong", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.02229", "submitter": "Dhafer Malouche", "authors": "Hela Jeddi, Dhafer Malouche", "title": "Wage gap between men and women in Tunisia", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on estimating wage differences between males and females\nin Tunisia by using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, a technical that isolates\nwage gap due to characteristics, from wage gap due to discrimination against\nwomen.

Regional water scarcity is driven by climate\nvariability and change, as well as by multi-sector water demand. While a\nplanning horizon of zero to about thirty years is occasionally prescribed by\nstakeholders, the challenges to risk assessment at these scales include the\ndifficulty in delineating decadal climate trends from intrinsic natural or\nmultiple model variability. Current generation global climate or earth system\nmodels are not credible at the spatial resolutions of power plants, especially\nfor surface water quantity and stream temperatures, which further exacerbates\nthe assessment challenge. Population changes, which are difficult to project,\ncannot serve as adequate proxies for changes in the water demand across\nsectors. The hypothesis that robust assessments of power production at risk are\npossible, despite the uncertainties, has been examined as a proof of concept.\nAn approach is presented for delineating water scarcity and temperature from\nclimate models, observations and population storylines, as well as for\nassessing power production at risk by examining geospatial correlations of\npower plant locations within regions where the usable water supply for energy\nproduction happens to be scarcer and warmer. Our analyses showed that in the\nnear term, more than 200 counties are likely to be exposed to water scarcity in\nthe next three decades. Further, we noticed that stream gauges in more than\nfive counties in the 2030s and ten counties in the 2040s showed a significant\nincrease in water temperature, which exceeded the power plant effluent\ntemperature threshold set by the EPA. Power plants in South Carolina,\nLouisiana, and Texas are likely to be vulnerable owing to climate-driven water\nstresses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 16:51:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ganguli", "Poulomi", ""], ["Kumar", "Devashish", ""], ["Ganguly", "Auroop R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08591", "submitter": "Stefan Rass", "authors": "Stefan Rass", "title": "On Game-Theoretic Risk Management (Part Two) -- Algorithms to Compute\n  Nash-Equilibria in Games with Distributions as Payoffs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN cs.GT math.ST q-fin.EC q-fin.RM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The game-theoretic risk management framework put forth in the precursor work\n\"Towards a Theory of Games with Payoffs that are Probability-Distributions\"\n(arXiv:1506.07368 [q-fin.EC]) is herein extended by algorithmic details on how\nto compute equilibria in games where the payoffs are probability distributions.\nOur approach is \"data driven\" in the sense that we assume empirical data\n(measurements, simulation, etc.) to be available that can be compiled into\ndistribution models, which are suitable for efficient decisions about\npreferences, and setting up and solving games using these as payoffs.
