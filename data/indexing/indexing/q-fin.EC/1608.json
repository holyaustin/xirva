Formally, $N$\nagents play a coordination game repeatedly which has exactly $N$ Nash\nequilibria and all of the equilibria are equally preferred by the agents. The\nproblem is to select one equilibrium out of $N$ possible equilibria in the\nleast number of attempts. We propose a number of heuristic rules based on\nreinforcement learning to solve the coordination problem. We see that the\nagents self-organize into clusters with varying intensities depending on the\nheuristic rule applied although all clusters but one are transitory in most\ncases. Finally, we characterize a trade-off in terms of the time requirement to\nachieve a degree of stability in strategies and the efficiency of such a\nsolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2016 12:48:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Agarwal", "S.", ""], ["Ghosh", "D.", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "A.

In this paper we consider a network of firms\nand corporations and study its metastable features in an Ising based model. In\nour model, we observe that if in a recession the government imposes a demand\nshock to stimulate the network, metastable features shape its response.\nActually we find that there is a minimum bound where demand shocks with a size\nbelow it are unable to trigger the market out from recession. We then\ninvestigate the impact of network characteristics on this minimum bound. We\nsurprisingly observe that in a Watts-Strogatz network though the minimum bound\ndepends on the average of the degrees, when translated into the economics\nlanguage, such a bound is independent of the average degrees. This bound is\nabout $0.44 \\Delta$GDP, where $\\Delta$GDP is the gap of GDP between recession\nand expansion. We examine our suggestions for the cases of the United States\nand the European Union in the recent recession, and compare them with the\nimposed stimulations. While stimulation in the US has been above our threshold,\nin the EU it has been far below our threshold. Beside providing a minimum bound\nfor a successful stimulation, our study on the metastable features suggests\nthat in the time of crisis there is a \"golden time passage\" in which the\nminimum bound for successful stimulation can be much lower. So, our study\nstrongly suggests stimulations to be started within this time passage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2016 22:37:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseiny", "Ali", ""], ["Bahrami", "Mohammad", ""], ["Palestrini", "Antonio", ""], ["Gallegati", "Mauro", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.00878", "submitter": "Ross King", "authors": "Ross D.

Over history money\nhas become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the\nlike, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I\npropose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the\nmost general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that\nusing programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is\nagency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics\nas economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to\nimplement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously\ndescribe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational\ncryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are\nperformed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can\nexecute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has\nalready been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility\nfrom human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic\nadvantages over the current passive form of money. For example in\nmicroeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,\nensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of\ncontracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example\nthe control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to\nmoney. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external\nhuman agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic\nsystems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,\nthereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 15:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Ross D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.01351", "submitter": "Fuad Aleskerov", "authors": "Fuad Aleskerov, Victoria Oleynik", "title": "Multidimensional Polarization Index and its Application to an Analysis\n  of the Russian State Duma", "comments": "52 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The multidimensional extension of the Aleskerov-Golubenko polarization index\nis developed.

This study refutes this. The author mathematically defines the\nstability and rigidity of electoral systems comprised of any quantity of\nelectors and parties. In fact, stability is a function of the quantity of\nelectors - i.e., the number of occupied seats at the table. As the number of\nelectors increases, the properties of an electorate are increasingly well\nresolved, and well described by those of an electorate that is least excessive\n-- that is to say an electorate that is closest to equilibrium. Further,\nelectoral rigidity is a function of the quantity of parties and their\nprobabilities of representation. An absolutely rigid system admits no\nfluctuations -- whatever happens to one elector will happen to all electors. As\nthe quantity of parties increases so does the number of party lines, and with\nit the quantity of alternatives with which to respond to an external stimulus.\nRigidity is significant in a social system that places high value on party\nloyalty. In conclusion, (i) electoral stability is best served by increasing\nthe quantity of electors; (ii) electoral rigidity is best served by decreasing\nthe quantity of parties, and by increasing the representation of some parties\nat the expense of others; and (iii) the less stable a branch of government, the\nmore concern is placed on those who would hold those offices for the people.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 05:17:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Levy", "Michael Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.05597", "submitter": "Richard Tol", "authors": "Richard S.J.
