We model macroeconomics as\nensemble of economic agents on economic space and agent's risk ratings play\nrole of their coordinates. Sum of economic variables of agents with coordinate\nx define macroeconomic variables as functions of time and coordinates x. We\ndescribe evolution and interactions between macro variables on economic space\nby hydrodynamic-like equations. Integral of macro variables over economic space\ndefines aggregate economic or financial variables as functions of time t only.\nHydrodynamic-like equations define fluctuations of aggregate variables. Motion\nof agents from low risk to high risk area and back define the origin for\nrepeated fluctuations of aggregate variables. Economic or financial variables\non economic space may define statistical moments like mean risk, mean square\nrisk and higher. Fluctuations of statistical moments describe phases of\nfinancial and economic cycles. As example we present a simple model relations\nbetween Assets and Revenue-on-Assets and derive hydrodynamic-like equations\nthat describe evolution and interaction between these variables.\nHydrodynamic-like equations permit derive systems of ordinary differential\nequations that describe fluctuations of aggregate Assets, Assets mean risks and\nAssets mean square risks. Our approach allows describe business cycle aggregate\nfluctuations induced by interactions between any number of economic or\nfinancial variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 13:11:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Olkhov", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03535", "submitter": "Yu-Jui Huang", "authors": "Yu-Jui Huang, Adrien Nguyen-Huu, Xun Yu Zhou", "title": "General Stopping Behaviors of Naive and Non-Committed Sophisticated\n  Agents, with Application to Probability Distortion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mathematical Finance, Vol. 30 (2020), Issue 1, pp 310-340", "doi": "10.1111/mafi.12224", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of stopping a diffusion process with a payoff\nfunctional that renders the problem time-inconsistent.

They should realize that this eliminates any\ncredibility to their numerical methods and therefore also to their new\nanalysis, in which they consider many algorithms [2]. Since by their own\nadmission the best algorithm is the Fitness one, their new claim became that\nthe search for the best algorithm is pointless and all algorithms are alike.\nThis is exactly the opposite of what they claimed a few days ago and it does\nnot deserve much comments.

First, countries trade more with those\nwith whom they share history, language, and culture, suggesting that trade is\nlimited by information frictions. Second, countries are more likely to start\nexporting products that are similar to their current exports, suggesting that\nknowledge diffusion among related industries is a key constrain shaping the\ndiversification of exports. But does knowledge about how to export to a\ndestination also diffuses among related products and geographic neighbors? Do\ncountries need to learn how to trade each product to each destination? Here, we\nuse bilateral trade data from 2000 to 2015 to show that countries are more\nlikely to increase their exports of a product to a destination when: (i) they\nexport related products to it, (ii) they export the same product to the\nneighbor of a destination, (iii) they have neighbors who export the same\nproduct to that destination. Then, we explore the magnitude of these effects\nfor new, nascent, and experienced exporters, (exporters with and without\ncomparative advantage in a product) and also for groups of products with\ndifferent level of technological sophistication. We find that the effects of\nproduct and geographic relatedness are stronger for new exporters, and also,\nthat the effect of product relatedness is stronger for more technologically\nsophisticated products. These findings support the idea that international\ntrade is shaped by information frictions that are reduced in the presence of\nrelated products and experienced geographic neighbors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 20:36:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Jun", "Bogang", ""], ["Alshamsi", "Aamena", ""], ["Gao", "Jian", ""], ["Hidalgo", "Cesar A", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06380", "submitter": "Oleg Malafeyev", "authors": "I.D.
