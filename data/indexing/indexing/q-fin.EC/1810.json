To analyze the impacts of introducing the\nHSR on the intercity travel behavior, this research develops an integrated\nintercity demand forecasting model to represent trip generation and frequency,\ndestination choice and travel mode choice behavior. For this purpose, a\ncomprehensive questionnaire survey with both Revealed Preference (RP)\ninformation (an inter-city trip diary) and Stated Preference (SP) information\nwas conducted in Hanoi in 2011. In the SP part, not only HSR, but also Low Cost\nCarrier is included in the choice set, together with other existing inter-city\ntravel modes. To make full use of the advantages of each type of data and to\novercome their disadvantages, RP and SP data are combined to describe the\ndestination choice and mode choice behavior, while trip generation and\nfrequency are represented by using the RP data. The model estimation results\nshow the inter-relationship between trip generation and frequency, destination\nchoice and travel mode choice, and confirm that those components should not\ndealt with separately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2018 06:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Le", "Tho V.", ""], ["Zhang", "Junyi", ""], ["Chikaraishi", "Makoto", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Akimasa", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.00516", "submitter": "Brian Hanley", "authors": "Brian P Hanley", "title": "A New Form of Banking -- Concept and Mathematical Model of Venture\n  Banking", "comments": "32 pages, 24 figures, 2 tables, 27 equations (This version includes\n  clarifications of banking loan/deposit operation citing Bank of England)\n  Added preamble section, fixed a figure numbering problem", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This theoretical model contains concept, equations, and graphical results for\nventure banking.

This formalism does not seek to aggregate agents. It rather\nreplaces the standard optimization approach by a probabilistic description of\nboth the entire system and agents'behaviors. This is done in two distinct\nsteps. A first step considers an interacting system involving an arbitrary\nnumber of agents, where each agent's utility function is subject to\nunpredictable shocks. In such a setting, individual optimization problems need\nnot be resolved. Each agent is described by a time-dependent probability\ndistribution centered around his utility optimum. The entire system of agents\nis thus defined by a composite probability depending on time, agents'\ninteractions and forward-looking behaviors. This dynamic system is described by\na path integral formalism in an abstract space-the space of the agents'\nactions-and is very similar to a statistical physics or quantum mechanics\nsystem. We show that this description, applied to the space of agents'actions,\nreduces to the usual optimization results in simple cases. Compared to a\nstandard optimization, such a description markedly eases the treatment of\nsystems with small number of agents. It becomes however useless for a large\nnumber of agents. In a second step therefore, we show that for a large number\nof agents, the previous description is equivalent to a more compact description\nin terms of field theory. This yields an analytical though approximate\ntreatment of the system. This field theory does not model the aggregation of a\nmicroeconomic system in the usual sense. It rather describes an environment of\na large number of interacting agents. From this description, various phases or\nequilibria may be retrieved, along with individual agents' behaviors and their\ninteractions with the environment.

We introduce and\nanalyze a framework to operate a community microgrid, and to share the\nresulting revenues and costs among its members. A market-oriented pricing of\nenergy exchanges within the community is obtained by implementing an internal\nlocal market based on the marginal pricing scheme. The market aims at\nmaximizing the social welfare of the community, thanks to the more efficient\nallocation of resources, the reduction of the peak power to be paid, and the\nincreased amount of reserve, achieved at an aggregate level. A community\nmicrogrid operator, acting as a benevolent planner, redistributes revenues and\ncosts among the members, in such a way that the solution achieved by each\nmember within the community is not worse than the solution it would achieve by\nacting individually. In this way, each member is incentivized to participate in\nthe community on a voluntary basis. The overall framework is formulated in the\nform of a bilevel model, where the lower level problem clears the market, while\nthe upper level problem plays the role of the community microgrid operator.\nNumerical results obtained on a real test case implemented in Belgium show\naround 54% cost savings on a yearly scale for the community, as compared to the\ncase when its members act individually.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2018 12:05:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2019 09:39:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2019 17:43:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Corn\u00e9lusse", "Bertrand", ""], ["Savelli", "Iacopo", ""], ["Paoletti", "Simone", ""], ["Giannitrapani", "Antonio", ""], ["Vicino", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.09869", "submitter": "Anthony Strittmatter", "authors": "Roland Hodler, Paul Raschky, Anthony Strittmatter", "title": "Religion and Terrorism: Evidence from Ramadan Fasting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study the effect of religion and intense religious experiences on\nterrorism by focusing on one of the five pillars of Islam: Ramadan fasting.

By using statistical learning theory, this study\npresents a framework to examine the tradeoff between estimation and\napproximation errors, and between prediction and interpretation losses. It\noperationalizes the DNN interpretability in the choice analysis by formulating\nthe metrics of interpretation loss as the difference between true and estimated\nchoice probability functions. This study also uses the statistical learning\ntheory to upper bound the estimation error of both prediction and\ninterpretation losses in DNN, shedding light on why DNN does not have the\noverfitting issue. Three scenarios are then simulated to compare DNN to binary\nlogit model (BNL). We found that DNN outperforms BNL in terms of both\nprediction and interpretation for most of the scenarios, and larger sample size\nunleashes the predictive power of DNN but not BNL. DNN is also used to analyze\nthe choice of trip purposes and travel modes based on the National Household\nTravel Survey 2017 (NHTS2017) dataset. These experiments indicate that DNN can\nbe used for choice analysis beyond the current practice of demand forecasting\nbecause it has the inherent utility interpretation, the flexibility of\naccommodating various information formats, and the power of automatically\nlearning utility specification. DNN is both more predictive and interpretable\nthan BNL unless the modelers have complete knowledge about the choice task, and\nthe sample size is small. Overall, statistical learning theory can be a\nfoundation for future studies in the non-asymptotic data regime or using\nhigh-dimensional statistical models in choice analysis, and the experiments\nshow the feasibility and effectiveness of DNN for its wide applications to\npolicy and behavioral analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2018 15:57:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2019 19:57:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shenhao", ""], ["Wang", "Qingyi", ""], ["Bailey", "Nate", ""], ["Zhao", "Jinhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.10660", "submitter": "Abhinav Sridhar", "authors": "Debasis Mitra, Abhinav Sridhar", "title": "The Case for Formation of ISP-Content Providers Consortiums by Nash\n  Bargaining for Internet Content Delivery", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The formation of consortiums of a broadband access Internet Service Provider\n(ISP) and multiple Content Providers (CP) is considered for large-scale content\ncaching.
