Thus, understanding its causes has become a\npriority of scholars across many disciplines. Here we demonstrate that shifts\nin socialization strategies analogous to political polarization and identity\npolitics can arise as a locally-beneficial response to both rising wealth\ninequality and economic decline. Adopting a perspective of cultural evolution,\nwe develop a framework to study the emergence of polarization under shifting\neconomic environments. In many contexts, interacting with diverse out-groups\nconfers benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise\nfrom interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when the\neconomic environment favors risk-aversion, a strategy of seeking low-risk\ninteractions can be important to maintaining individual solvency. To capture\nthis dynamic, we assume that in-group interactions have a lower expected\noutcome, but a more certain one. Thus in-group interactions are less risky than\nout-group interactions. Our model shows that under conditions of economic\ndecline or increasing wealth inequality, some members of the population benefit\nfrom adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we show that\nsuch in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole population and\npersist even when the conditions that produced it have reversed. Finally we\noffer empirical support for the role of income inequality as a driver of\naffective polarization in the United States, mirroring findings on a panel of\ndeveloped democracies.
