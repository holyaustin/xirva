In this highly interconnected\nenvironment, local financial shocks and events can be easily amplified and\nturned into global events. This paper analyzes the dependencies among nearly\n4,000 stocks from 15 countries. The returns are normalized by the estimated\nvolatility using a GARCH model and a robust regression process estimates\npairwise statistical relationships between stocks from different markets. The\nestimation results are used as a measure of statistical interconnectedness, and\nto derive network representations, both by country and by sector. The results\nshow that countries like the United States and Germany are in the core of the\nglobal stock market. The energy, materials, and financial sectors play an\nimportant role in connecting markets, and this role has increased over time for\nthe energy and materials sectors. Our results confirm the role of global\nsectoral factors in stock market dependence. Moreover, our results show that\nthe dependencies are rather volatile and that heterogeneity among stocks is a\nnon-negligible aspect of this volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 14:11:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2020 14:10:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Raddant", "Matthias", ""], ["Kenett", "Dror Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01316", "submitter": "Pawan Kumar Dr.", "authors": "Dr. Pawan Kumar", "title": "ICT and Employment in India: A Sectoral Level Analysis", "comments": "21", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  How technology affects growth or employment has long been debated.

Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical basis and\nfocuses upon empirical tests of this effect across multiple products and their\nunderlying technologies. The results for 18 different diffusing products show\nthe expected relationship-faster diffusion for products based on more rapidly\nimproving technological domains- between technological improvement and\ndiffusion with strong statistical significance. The empirical examination also\ndemonstrates that technological improvement does not slow down in the latter\nparts of diffusion when penetration does slow down. This finding indicates that\ndiffusion slow down in the latter stages is due to market saturation effects\nand is not due to slowdown of performance improvement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 02:07:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 16:28:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 04:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Woo", "JongRoul", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04442", "submitter": "Aurelio Fernandez Bariviera", "authors": "Aurelio F.

It is common practice to assume that players\nquickly converge to an equilibrium, e.g. a Nash equilibrium. This can be\nstudied in terms of best reply dynamics, in which each player myopically uses\nthe best response to her opponent's last move. Existing research shows that\nconvergence can be problematic when there are best reply cycles. Here we\ncalculate how typical this is by studying the space of all possible two-player\nnormal form games and counting the frequency of best reply cycles. The two key\nparameters are the number of moves, which defines how complicated the game is,\nand the anti-correlation of the payoffs, which determines how competitive it\nis. We find that as games get more complicated and more competitive, best reply\ncycles become dominant. The existence of best reply cycles predicts\nnon-convergence of six different learning algorithms that have support from\nhuman experiments. Our results imply that for complicated and competitive games\nequilibrium is typically an unrealistic assumption. Alternatively, if for some\nreason \"real\" games are special and do not possess cycles, we raise the\ninteresting question of why this should be so.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 11:27:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Dec 2017 16:44:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 17 Mar 2018 16:34:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2018 09:51:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2018 21:49:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Pangallo", "Marco", ""], ["Heinrich", "Torsten", ""], ["Farmer", "J Doyne", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.06429", "submitter": "Henri Benisty", "authors": "Henri Benisty", "title": "Simple wealth distribution model causing inequality-induced crisis\n  without external shocks", "comments": "15 pages, 11 figures.

Our general framework is that of pure or modified\nmultiplicative processes, basically geometric Brownian motions. In contrast\nwith the usual approach of injecting into such stochastic agent models either\nspecific, idiosyncratic internal nonlinear interaction patterns, or macroscopic\ndisruptive features, we propose a dynamic inequality model where the attainment\nof a sizable fraction of the total wealth by very few agents induces a crisis\nregime with strong intermittency, the explicit coupling between the richest and\nthe rest being a mere normalization mechanism, hence with minimal extrinsic\nassumptions. The model thus harnesses the recognized lack of ergodicity of\ngeometric Brownian motions. It also provides a statistical intuition to the\nconsequences of Thomas Piketty's recent \"$r>g$\" (return rate $>$ growth rate)\nparadigmatic analysis of very-long-term wealth trends. We suggest that the\n\"water-divide\" of wealth flow may define effective classes, making an objective\nentry point to calibrate the model. Consistently, we check that a tax mechanism\nassociated to a few percent relative bias on elementary daily transactions is\nable to slow or stop the build-up of large wealth. When extreme fluctuations\nare tamed down to a stationary regime with sizable but steadier inequalities,\nit should still offer opportunities to study the dynamics of crisis and the\ninner effective classes induced through external or internal factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:50:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Benisty", "Henri", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.06508", "submitter": "R\\'emi Lemoy", "authors": "R\\'emi Lemoy and Geoffrey Caruso", "title": "Scaling evidence of the homothetic nature of cities", "comments": "19 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we analyse the profile of land use and population density with\nrespect to the distance to the city centre for the European city.

In short, European cities of different sizes are\nhomothetic in terms of land use and population density. While earlier\nliterature documented the scaling of average densities (total surface and\npopulation) with city size, we document the scaling of the whole radial\ndistance profile with city size, thus liaising intra-urban radial analysis and\nsystems of cities.

This question has been explored on a few different macroeconomic\nmodels, and both `yes' and `no' answers have been obtained. However, economies\ncan become unstable whether or not there is ongoing underlying growth in\nproductivity with which to sustain growth in output. Here we attempt, for the\nfirst time, to assess via a model the relative stability of growth versus\nno-growth scenarios. The model employed draws from Keen's model of the Minsky\nfinancial instability hypothesis. The analysis focuses on dynamics as opposed\nto equilibrium, and scenarios of growth and no-growth of output (GDP) are\nobtained by tweaking a productivity growth input parameter. We confirm that,\nwith or without growth, there can be both stable and unstable scenarios. To\nmaintain stability, firms must not change their debt levels or target debt\nlevels too quickly. Further, according to the model, the wages share is higher\nfor zero-growth scenarios, although there are more frequent substantial drops\nin employment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:27:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 13:41:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Nov 2017 15:45:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Barrett", "Adam B.", ""]]}]
