They imply\na strong reduction in carbon footprint inequality by 2030 that effectively\nhalves the Gini coefficient to about 0.25. This paper examines feasibility of\nthese scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted\ninternational inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global\ninequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a\nnew dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In\nboth cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially\nattributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the\ndistribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These\nresults show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an\nunprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels.\nMoreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to\n2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5.\nThis observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy\nreasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This\nsaturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios,\nwhich are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon\nfootprint inequality under global capitalism. One way out of this conundrum is\na fast decarbonization of the global energy supply in order to decrease global\ncarbon emissions without relying crucially on carbon inequality reduction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:51:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Semieniuk", "Gregor", ""], ["Yakovenko", "Victor M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00493", "submitter": "Claudius Gros", "authors": "Claudius Gros, Roser Valenti, Lukas Schneider, Kilian Valenti, Daniel\n  Gros", "title": "Containment efficiency and control strategies for the Corona pandemic\n  costs", "comments": "Scientific Reports, in press", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports 11, 6848 (2021)", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-021-86072-x", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph econ.GN q-bio.PE q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rapid spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) confronts policy makers with\nthe problem of measuring the effectiveness of containment strategies, balancing\npublic health considerations with the economic costs of social distancing\nmeasures.

Poorer people are less willing to make those economic\nsacrifices. They place relatively greater value on their livelihood concerns\ncompared to contracting COVID-19. Not only are the epidemiological and economic\nbenefits of social distancing much smaller in poorer countries, such policies\nmay exact a heavy toll on the poorest and most vulnerable. Workers in the\ninformal sector lack the resources and social protections to isolate themselves\nand sacrifice economic opportunities until the virus passes.

Second, to what extent\nthe QE may also alter the pattern of intra-financial exposures among financial\nactors (including banks, investment funds, insurance corporations, and pension\nfunds) and what are the implications in terms of financial stability. Here, we\naddress these two questions by developing a methodology to map the\nmacro-network of financial exposures among institutional sectors across\nfinancial instruments (e.g., equity, bonds, and loans) and we illustrate our\napproach on recently available data (i.e., data on loans and private and public\nsecurities purchased within the QE). We then test the effect of the\nimplementation of ECB's QE on the time evolution of the financial linkages in\nthe macro-network of the euro area, as well as the effect on macroeconomic\nvariables, such as output and prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 19:23:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Perillo", "Chiara", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.09421", "submitter": "Federico Fioravanti", "authors": "Fernando Delbianco, Federico Fioravanti and Fernando Tohm\\'e", "title": "The Impact of Birth Order on Behavior in Contact Team Sports: the\n  Evidence of Rugby Teams in Argentina", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Several studies have shown that birth order and the sex of siblings may have\nan influence on individual behavioral traits.

We set a hypothetical airline\nshutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal\nrestrictions under the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we\ncalculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity cost under the\ncancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under\nsuch a scenario, if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to\n9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to 365g/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes\nmuch smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated total dose goes down\nfrom 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general\npublic. In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth\n484g/cm$^{2}$), the estimated total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we\nassume the increase of fuel cost is proportional to the increase in atmospheric\ndepth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying at 9.5\nkm and at 7 km, respectively.

More specifically, we survey estimated yearly\nperformance improvement rates for nearly all definable technologies for the\nfirst time. We do this by creating a correspondence of all patents within the\nUS patent system to a set of technology domains. A technology domain is a body\nof patented inventions achieving the same technological function using the same\nknowledge and scientific principles. We obtain a set of 1757 domains using an\nextension of the previously defined classification overlap method (COM). These\ndomains contain 97.14% of all patents within the entire US patent system. From\nthe identified patent sets, we calculated the average centrality of the patents\nin each domain to estimate their improvement rates, following a methodology\ntested in prior work. The estimated improvement rates vary from a low of 1.9%\nper year for the Mechanical Skin treatment - Hair Removal and wrinkles domain\nto a high of 228.8% per year for the Network management - client-server\napplications domain. We developed a one-line descriptor identifying the\ntechnological function achieved and the underlying knowledge base for the\nlargest 50, fastest 20 as well as slowest 20 of these domains, which cover more\nthan forty percent of the patent system. In general, the rates of improvement\nwere not a strong function of the patent set size and the fastest improving\ndomains are predominantly software-based. We make available an online system\nthat allows for automated searching for domains and improvement rates\ncorresponding to any technology of interest to researchers, strategists and\npolicy formulators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Apr 2020 01:54:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Anuraag", ""], ["Triulzi", "Giorgio", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14485", "submitter": "Anirban Chakraborti", "authors": "Ashish Kumar, Anindya S.

To study this, we choose economic production\nnetworks as a paradigm. An economic network can be examined at many levels:\nlinkages among individual agents (microscopic), among firms/sectors\n(mesoscopic) or among countries (macroscopic). New emergent dynamical\nproperties appear at every level, so the granularity matters. For viral\nepidemics, even an individual node may act as an epicenter of distress and\npotentially affect the entire network. Economic networks, however, are known to\nbe immune at the micro-levels and more prone to failure in the\nmeso/macro-levels. We propose a dynamical interaction model to characterize the\nmechanism of distress propagation, across different modules of a network,\ninitiated at different epicenters. Vulnerable modules often lead to large\ndegrees of destabilization. We demonstrate our methodology using a unique\nempirical data-set of input-output linkages across 0.14 million firms in one\nadministrative state of India, a developing economy. The network has multiple\nhub-and-spoke structures that exhibits moderate disassortativity, which varies\nwith the level of coarse-graining. The novelty lies in characterizing the\nproduction network at different levels of granularity or modularity, and\nfinding `too-big-to-fail' modules supersede `too-central-to-fail' modules in\ndistress propagation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Apr 2020 21:18:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Ashish", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "Anindya S.", ""], ["Chakraborti", "Anirban", ""], ["Nandi", "Tushar", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14953", "submitter": "Daniel Fershtman", "authors": "Daniel Fershtman, Alessandro Pavan", "title": "Soft Affirmative Action and Minority Recruitment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.TH econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study search, evaluation, and selection of candidates of unknown quality\nfor a position.
