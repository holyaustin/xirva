(2012) develop an analytical model to examine the emergent\ndynamic properties of share market price formation over time, capable to\ncapture important stylized facts. These latter properties prove to be sensitive\nto regulatory regimes for fundamental information provision, as well as to\nmarket confidence conditions among actual and potential investors. Regimes\nbased upon mark-to-market (fair value) measurement of traded security, while\ngenerating higher linear correlation between market prices and fundamental\nsignals, also involve higher market instability and volatility. These regimes\nalso incur more relevant episodes of market exuberance and vagary in some\nregions of the market confidence space, where lower market liquidity further\noccurs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Dec 2013 18:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Biondi", "Yuri", ""], ["Righi", "Simone", ""]]}]
