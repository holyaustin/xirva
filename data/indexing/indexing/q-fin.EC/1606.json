Recently the least\nabsolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) has been applied in the\nstatistical and econometric literature. Consis- tency of Lasso has been\nestablished under various conditions, some of which are difficult to verify in\npractice. In this paper, we study model selection from the perspective of\ngeneralization ability, under the framework of structural risk minimization\n(SRM) and Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theory. The approach emphasizes the balance\nbetween the in-sample and out-of-sample fit, which can be achieved by using\ncross-validation to select a penalty on model complexity. We show that an exact\nrelationship exists between the generalization ability of a model and model\nselection consistency. By implementing SRM and the VC inequality, we show that\nLasso is L2-consistent for model selection under assumptions similar to those\nimposed on OLS. Furthermore, we derive a probabilistic bound for the distance\nbetween the penalized extremum estimator and the extremum estimator without\npenalty, which is dominated by overfitting. We also propose a new measurement\nof overfitting, GR2, based on generalization ability, that converges to zero if\nmodel selection is consistent. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the\nproposed CV-Lasso algorithm performs well in terms of model selection and\noverfitting control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 07:22:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Ning", ""], ["Hong", "Jian", ""], ["Fisher", "Timothy C.

This is especially true in poor\ncountries, where basic needs are frequently threatened by economic,\nenvironmental, and health shocks. An empirically sound formalization of the\nconcept of food security resilience, however, is lacking. Here we introduce a\ngeneral framework for quantifying resilience based on a simple definition: a\nunit is resilient if $(a)$ its long-term food security trend is not\ndeteriorating and $(b)$ the effects of shocks on this trend do not persist over\ntime. Our approach can be applied to any food security variable for which\nhigh-frequency time-series data is available, can accommodate any unit of\nanalysis (e.g., individuals, households, countries), and is especially useful\nin rapidly changing contexts wherein standard equilibrium-based economic models\nare ineffective. We illustrate our method with an analysis of per capita\nkilocalorie availability for 161 countries between 1961 and 2011. We find that\nresilient countries are not necessarily those that are characterized by high\nlevels or less volatile fluctuations of kilocalorie intake. Accordingly, food\nsecurity policies and programs will need to be tailored not only to welfare\nlevels at any one time, but also to long-run welfare dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 23:27:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Smerlak", "Matteo", ""], ["Vaitla", "Bapu", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03595", "submitter": "Matt Leduc", "authors": "Matt V.

They create a network of interbank exposures by\nwhich they expose other banks to potential insolvency cascades. In this paper,\nwe show how a regulator can use information about the financial network to\ndevise a transaction-specific tax based on a network centrality measure that\ncaptures systemic importance. Since different transactions have different\nimpact on creating systemic risk, they are taxed differently. We call this tax\na Systemic Risk Tax (SRT). We use an equilibrium concept inspired by the\nmatching markets literature to show analytically that this SRT induces a unique\nequilibrium matching of lenders and borrowers that is systemic-risk efficient,\ni.e. it minimizes systemic risk given a certain transaction volume. On the\nother hand, we show that without this SRT multiple equilibrium matchings exist,\nwhich are generally inefficient. This allows the regulator to effectively\nstimulate a `rewiring' of the equilibrium interbank network so as to make it\nmore resilient to insolvency cascades, without sacrificing transaction volume.\nMoreover, we show that a standard financial transaction tax (e.g. a Tobin-like\ntax) has no impact on reshaping the equilibrium financial network because it\ntaxes all transactions indiscriminately. A Tobin-like tax is indeed shown to\nhave a limited effect on reducing systemic risk while it decreases transaction\nvolume.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 13:47:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:53:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 15:31:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 10:03:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 12:52:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Leduc", "Matt V.", ""], ["Thurner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03709", "submitter": "Daniel Lacker", "authors": "Rene Carmona, Francois Delarue, and Daniel Lacker", "title": "Mean field games of timing and models for bank runs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The goal of the paper is to introduce a set of problems which we call mean\nfield games of timing.
