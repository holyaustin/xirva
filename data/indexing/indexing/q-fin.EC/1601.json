The contributions of each factor to the bid-offer adjustment are computed\nseparately and then consolidated to produce a very adaptive bid-offer\nquotation. The author uses the currency markets to build the sample model\nbecause they are extremely liquid and trading in them is not as transparent as\nother financial instruments, such as equities. Simulating the number of trades\nand the average size of trades from a lognormal distribution, the parameters of\nthe lognormal distributions are chosen such that the total volume in a certain\ninterval matches the volume publicly mentioned by currency trading firms. This\nmethodology can easily be extended to other financial instruments and possibly\nto any product with the ability to make electronic price quotations, or can\neven be used to periodically perform manual price updates on products that are\ntraded non-electronically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2016 15:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 05:29:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00679", "submitter": "Antoine Kornprobst", "authors": "Antoine Kornprobst", "title": "Essay on the State of Research and Innovation in France and the European\n  Union", "comments": "26 pages.

What causes some technologies to improve faster than others do? Previous\nquantitative modeling research has identified artifact interactions, where a\ndesign change in one component influences others, as an important determinant\nof improvement rates. The models predict that improvement rate for a domain is\nproportional to the inverse of the domain interaction parameter. However, no\nempirical research has previously studied and tested the dependence of\nimprovement rates on artifact interactions. A challenge to testing the\ndependence is that any method for measuring interactions has to be applicable\nto a wide variety of technologies. Here we propose a patent-based method that\nis both technology domain-agnostic and less costly than alternative methods. We\nuse textual content from patent sets in 27 domains to find the influence of\ninteractions on improvement rates. Qualitative analysis identified six specific\nkeywords that signal artifact interactions. Patent sets from each domain were\nthen examined to determine the total count of these 6 keywords in each domain,\ngiving an estimate of artifact interactions in each domain. It is found that\nimprovement rates are positively correlated with the inverse of the total count\nof keywords with correlation coefficient of +0.56 with a p-value of 0.002. The\nempirical results agree with model predictions and support the suggestion that\ndomains with higher number of artifacts interactions (higher complexity) will\nimprove at a slower pace.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2016 22:38:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 02:47:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Basnet", "Subarna", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.04028", "submitter": "Peter P\\\"utz", "authors": "Steffen Lange, Peter P\\\"utz and Thomas Kopp", "title": "Do Mature Economies Grow Exponentially?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Ecolocigal Economics 147 (2018) 123-133", "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolecon.2018.01.011", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most models that try to explain economic growth indicate exponential growth\npaths.
