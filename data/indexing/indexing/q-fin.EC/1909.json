This study\ndesigns a particular DNN architecture with alternative-specific utility\nfunctions (ASU-DNN) by using prior behavioral knowledge. Unlike a fully\nconnected DNN (F-DNN), which computes the utility value of an alternative k by\nusing the attributes of all the alternatives, ASU-DNN computes it by using only\nk's own attributes. Theoretically, ASU-DNN can dramatically reduce the\nestimation error of F-DNN because of its lighter architecture and sparser\nconnectivity. Empirically, ASU-DNN has 2-3% higher prediction accuracy than\nF-DNN over the whole hyperparameter space in a private dataset that we\ncollected in Singapore and a public dataset in R mlogit package. The\nalternative-specific connectivity constraint, as a domain-knowledge-based\nregularization method, is more effective than the most popular generic-purpose\nexplicit and implicit regularization methods and architectural hyperparameters.\nASU-DNN is also more interpretable because it provides a more regular\nsubstitution pattern of travel mode choices than F-DNN does. The comparison\nbetween ASU-DNN and F-DNN can also aid in testing the behavioral knowledge. Our\nresults reveal that individuals are more likely to compute utility by using an\nalternative's own attributes, supporting the long-standing practice in choice\nmodeling. Overall, this study demonstrates that prior behavioral knowledge\ncould be used to guide the architecture design of DNN, to function as an\neffective domain-knowledge-based regularization method, and to improve both the\ninterpretability and predictive power of DNN in choice analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Sep 2019 21:01:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2021 22:38:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Shenhao", ""], ["Mo", "Baichuan", ""], ["Zhao", "Jinhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.08564", "submitter": "Juan Bautista Gonz\\'alez Blanco", "authors": "Juan Gonzalez-Blanco", "title": "Informe-pais Brasil", "comments": "in Portuguese", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Structural socioeconomic analysis of Brazil.

We show that the large equity premium that they report can be\nexplained by choosing a more appropriate distribution for the return data. We\ndemonstrate that the high-risk aversion value observed by Mehra and Prescott\nmay be attributable to the problem of fitting a proper distribution to the\nhistorical returns and partly caused by poorly fitting the tail of the return\ndistribution. We describe a new distribution that better fits the return\ndistribution and when used to describe historical returns can explain the large\nequity risk premium and thereby explains the puzzle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Sep 2019 03:57:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2020 00:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Shirvani", "Abootaleb", ""], ["Stoyanov", "Stoyan V.", ""], ["Fabozzi", "Frank J.", ""], ["Rachev", "Svetlozar T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13179", "submitter": "Tony Blakely", "authors": "Tony Blakely, Nhung Nghiem, Murat Genc, Anja Mizdrak, Linda Cobiac,\n  Cliona Ni Mhurchu, Boyd Swinburn, Peter Scarborough, Christine Cleghorn", "title": "Modelling the health impact of food taxes and subsidies with price\n  elasticities: the case for additional scaling of food consumption using the\n  total food expenditure elasticity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0230506", "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background Food taxes and subsidies are one intervention to address poor\ndiets. Price elasticity (PE) matrices are commonly used to model the change in\nfood purchasing. Usually a PE matrix is generated in one setting then applied\nto another setting with differing starting consumption and prices of foods.\nThis violates econometric assumptions resulting in likely misestimation of\ntotal food consumption. We illustrate rescaling all consumption after applying\na PE matrix using a total food expenditure elasticity (TFEe, the expenditure\nelasticity for all food combined given the policy induced change in the total\nprice of food). We use case studies of NZ$2 per 100g saturated fat (SAFA) tax,\nNZ$0.4 per 100g sugar tax, and a 20% fruit and vegetable (F&V) subsidy. Methods\nWe estimated changes in food purchasing using a NZ PE matrix applied\nconventionally, then with TFEe adjustment. Impacts were quantified for total\nfood expenditure and health adjusted life years (HALYs) for the total NZ\npopulation alive in 2011 over the rest of their lifetime using a multistate\nlifetable model. Results Two NZ studies gave TFEes of 0.68 and 0.83, with\ninternational estimates ranging from 0.46 to 0.90. Without TFEe adjustment,\ntotal food expenditure decreased with the tax policies and increased with the\nF&V subsidy, implausible directions of shift given economic theory. After TFEe\nadjustment, HALY gains reduced by a third to a half for the two taxes and\nreversed from an apparent health loss to a health gain for the F&V subsidy.\nWith TFEe adjustment, HALY gains (in 1000s) were 1,805 (95% uncertainty\ninterval 1,337 to 2,340) for the SAFA tax, 1,671 (1,220 to 2,269) for the sugar\ntax, and 953 (453 to 1,308) for the F&V subsidy. Conclusions If PE matrices are\napplied in settings beyond where they were derived, additional scaling is\nlikely required. We suggest that the TFEe is a useful scalar.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Sep 2019 01:31:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Blakely", "Tony", ""], ["Nghiem", "Nhung", ""], ["Genc", "Murat", ""], ["Mizdrak", "Anja", ""], ["Cobiac", "Linda", ""], ["Mhurchu", "Cliona Ni", ""], ["Swinburn", "Boyd", ""], ["Scarborough", "Peter", ""], ["Cleghorn", "Christine", ""]]}]
