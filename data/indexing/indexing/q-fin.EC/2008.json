Each paper produces a similar set of statistics for the\nsame reference population using a different primary data source. Our primary\ndata source is the Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics\n(LEHD) infrastructure files. Using LEHD data from 1998 to 2016, we create a\nwell-defined population frame to facilitate accurate estimation of temporal\nchanges comparable to designed longitudinal samples of people. We show that\nearnings volatility, excluding increases during recessions, has declined over\nthe analysis period, a finding robust to various sensitivity analyses. Although\nwe find volatility is declining, the effect is not homogeneous, particularly\nfor workers with tenuous labor force attachment for whom volatility is\nincreasing. These \"not stable\" workers have earnings volatility approximately\n30 times larger than stable workers, but more important for earnings volatility\ntrends we observe a large increase in the share of stable employment from 60%\nin 1998 to 67% in 2016, which we show to largely be responsible for the decline\nin overall earnings volatility. To further emphasize the importance of not\nstable and/or low earning workers we also conduct comparisons with the PSID and\nshow how changes over time in the share of workers at the bottom tail of the\ncross-sectional earnings distributions can produce either declining or\nincreasing earnings volatility trends.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2020 11:58:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:46:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["McKinney", "Kevin L.", ""], ["Abowd", "John M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00860", "submitter": "Akihiko Noda", "authors": "Kenichi Hirayama, Akihiko Noda", "title": "Evaluating the Financial Market Function in Prewar Japan using a\n  Time-Varying Parameter Model", "comments": "25 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper explores when the financial market lost the price formation\nfunction in prewar Japan in the sense of Fama's (1970) semi-strong form market\nefficiency using a new dataset.

Firstly, their calculations arbitrarily cut\noff after 13 weeks, without costing the epidemic end state. That is, they\nassume indifference between mid-September states of 13 or 7500 weekly deaths\nand corresponding infection rates. This seems indefensible unless one assumes\nthat (a) there is little chance of any effective vaccine or improved medical or\nsocial interventions for the foreseeable future, (b) notwithstanding temporary\nlockdowns, COVID-19 will very likely propagate until herd immunity. Even under\nthese assumptions it is very questionable. Secondly, they ignore the costs of\nserious illness, possible long-term lowering of life quality and expectancy for\nsurvivors. These are uncertain, but plausibly at least as large as the costs in\ndeaths.\n  In summary, policy on tackling COVID-19 cannot be rationally made without\nestimating probabilities of future medical interventions and long-term illness\ncosts.

The Effect of Display Ad Viewability\n  on Advertising Effectiveness", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A large share of all online display advertisements (ads) are never seen by a\nhuman. For instance, an ad could appear below the page fold, where a user never\nscrolls. Yet, an ad is essentially ineffective if it is not at least somewhat\nviewable. Ad viewability - which refers to the pixel percentage-in-view and the\nexposure duration of an online display ad - has recently garnered great\ninterest among digital advertisers and publishers. However, we know very little\nabout the impact of ad viewability on advertising effectiveness. We work to\nclose this gap by analyzing a large-scale observational data set with more than\n350,000 ad impressions similar to the data sets that are typically available to\ndigital advertisers and publishers. This analysis reveals that longer exposure\ndurations (>10 seconds) and 100% visible pixels do not appear to be optimal in\ngenerating view-throughs. The highest view-through rates seem to be generated\nwith relatively lower pixel/second-combinations of 50%/1, 50%/5, 75%/1, and\n75%/5. However, this analysis does not account for user behavior that may be\ncorrelated with or even drive ad viewability and may therefore result in\nendogeneity issues. Consequently, we manipulated ad viewability in a randomized\nonline experiment for a major European news website, finding the highest ad\nrecognition rates among relatively higher pixel/second-combinations of 75%/10,\n100%/5 and 100%/10. Everything below 75\\% or 5 seconds performs worse. Yet, we\nfind that it may be sufficient to have either a long exposure duration or high\npixel percentage-in-view to reach high advertising effectiveness. Our results\nprovide guidance to advertisers enabling them to establish target viewability\nrates more appropriately and to publishers who wish to differentiate their\nviewability products.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 05:49:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Uhl", "Christina", ""], ["Nabout", "Nadia Abou", ""], ["Miller", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.12364", "submitter": "Johannes Wachs", "authors": "J\\'anos Kert\\'esz and Johannes Wachs", "title": "Complexity science approach to economic crime", "comments": "Preprint of published comment in Nat.

However, the evidence revealing the crisis is\noften anecdotal or limited in scope. In this unprecedented longitudinal\nresearch, we draw on data from the Australian journalism jobs market from\nJanuary 2012 until March 2020. Using Data Science and Machine Learning\ntechniques, we analyse two distinct data sets: job advertisements (ads) data\ncomprising 3,698 journalist job ads from a corpus of over 8 million Australian\njob ads; and official employment data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics.\nHaving matched and analysed both sources, we address both the demand for and\nsupply of journalists in Australia over this critical period. The data show\nthat the crisis is real, but there are also surprises. Counter-intuitively, the\nnumber of journalism job ads in Australia rose from 2012 until 2016, before\nfalling into decline. Less surprisingly, for the entire period studied the\nfigures reveal extreme volatility, characterised by large and erratic\nfluctuations. The data also clearly show that COVID-19 has significantly\nworsened the crisis. We then tease out more granular findings, including: that\nthere are now more women than men journalists in Australia, but that gender\ninequity is worsening, with women journalists getting younger and worse-paid\njust as men journalists are, on average, getting older and better-paid; that,\ndespite the crisis besetting the industry, the demand for journalism skills has\nincreased; and that, perhaps concerningly, the skills sought by journalism job\nads increasingly include social media and generalist communications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 03:20:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 23:53:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Dawson", "Nik", ""], ["Molitorisz", "Sacha", ""], ["Rizoiu", "Marian-Andrei", ""], ["Fray", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.12910", "submitter": "Danny Turkson", "authors": "Danny Turkson and Joy Kafui Ahiabor", "title": "Implication of Natal Care and Maternity Leave on Child Morbidity:\n  Evidence from Ghana", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": "Global Journal of Health Science, 12(9) (2020)", "doi": "10.5539/gjhs.v12n9p94", "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Failure to receive post-natal care within first week of delivery causes a 3%\nincrease in the possibility of Acute Respiratory Infection in children under\nfive.

When the base reproduction number of COVID-19 exceeds\n2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the\nspreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically,\nand resumes \"normal\", very strict pre-departure screening and test and\nisolation upon arrival combined with effective contact tracing can only delay\nanother outbreak by 6 months. However, if the total net imported cases are\nnon-increasing, and the entity employs a confining domestic control policy,\nthen the total new cases can be contained even without border control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 15:07:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2021 11:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Zhen", ""], ["Weber", "Enzo", ""], ["Strohsal", "Till", ""], ["Serhan", "Duaa", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13726", "submitter": "Bakhtmina Zia", "authors": "Bakhtmina Zia, Dr Muhammad Rafiq PhD Research Scholar, Institute of\n  Management Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan, Associate Professor, Institute of\n  Management Sciences, Peshawar, Pakistan", "title": "Reviewing climate change and agricultural market competitiveness", "comments": "Paper from my PhD thesis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper is a collection of knowledge regarding the phenomenon of climate\nchange, competitiveness, and literature linking the two phenomena to\nagricultural market competitiveness.
