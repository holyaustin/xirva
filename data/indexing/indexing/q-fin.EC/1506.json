The\ntraditional Gravity Model (GM) successfully reproduces the volume of trade\nbetween connected countries, using macroeconomic properties such as GDP,\ngeographic distance, and possibly other factors. However, it predicts a network\nwith complete or homogeneous topology, thus failing to reproduce the highly\nheterogeneous structure of the ITN. On the other hand, recent maximum-entropy\nnetwork models successfully reproduce the complex topology of the ITN, but\nprovide no information about trade volumes. Here we integrate these two\ncurrently incompatible approaches via the introduction of an Enhanced Gravity\nModel (EGM) of trade. The EGM is the simplest model combining the GM with the\nnetwork approach within a maximum-entropy framework. Via a unified and\nprincipled mechanism that is transparent enough to be generalized to any\neconomic network, the EGM provides a new econometric framework wherein trade\nprobabilities and trade volumes can be separately controlled by any combination\nof dyadic and country-specific macroeconomic variables. The model successfully\nreproduces both the global topology and the local link weights of the ITN,\nparsimoniously reconciling the conflicting approaches. It also indicates that\nthe probability that any two countries trade a certain volume should follow a\ngeometric or exponential distribution with an additional point mass at zero\nvolume.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 04:44:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 00:12:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2019 12:12:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Almog", "Assaf", ""], ["Bird", "Rhys", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.01315", "submitter": "Mario Szegedy", "authors": "Mario Szegedy and Yixin Xu", "title": "Impossibility Theorems and the Universal Algebraic Toolkit", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.LO math.CO q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We elucidate a close connection between the Theory of Judgment Aggregation\n(more generally, Evaluation Aggregation), and a relatively young but rapidly\ngrowing field of universal algebra, that was primarily developed to investigate\nconstraint satisfaction problems.

Although this\nappears to be a most natural approach to risk management too, applications in\ncritical infrastructures often violate the implicit assumption of actions\nleading to deterministic consequences. In that sense, the gameplay in a\ncritical infrastructure risk control competition is intrinsically random in the\nsense of actions having uncertain consequences. Mathematically, this takes us\nto utility functions that are probability-distribution-valued, in which case we\nloose the canonic (in fact every possible) ordering on the space of payoffs,\nand the original techniques of von Neumann and Morgenstern no longer apply.\n  This work introduces a new kind of game in which uncertainty applies to the\npayoff functions rather than the player's actions (a setting that has been\nwidely studied in the literature, yielding to celebrated notions like the\ntrembling hands equilibrium or the purification theorem). In detail, we show\nhow to fix the non-existence of a (canonic) ordering on the space of\nprobability distributions by only mildly restricting the full set to a subset\nthat can be totally ordered. Our vehicle to define the ordering and establish\nbasic game-theory is non-standard analysis and hyperreal numbers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 14:00:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 10:34:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 10:46:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2015 11:58:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 11:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Rass", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.07432", "submitter": "Jean-Francois Mercure", "authors": "J.-F.

We first characterise the uncertainty faced by climate\npolicy-makers and its implications for investment decision-makers. We then\nidentify five shortcomings in the equilibrium and optimisation-based approaches\nmost frequently used to inform sustainability policy: (i) their normative,\noptimisation-based nature, (ii) their unrealistic reliance on the\nfull-rationality of agents, (iii) their inability to account for mutual\ninfluences among agents and capture related self-reinforcing (positive\nfeedback) processes, (iv) their inability to represent multiple solutions and\npath-dependency, and (v) their inability to properly account for agent\nheterogeneity. The aim of this article is to introduce an alternative modelling\napproach based on complexity dynamics and agent heterogeneity, and explore its\nuse in four key areas of sustainability policy, namely (1) technology adoption\nand diffusion, (2) macroeconomic impacts of low-carbon policies, (3)\ninteractions between the socio-economic system and the natural environment, and\n(4) the anticipation of policy outcomes. The practical relevance of the\nproposed methodology is discussed by reference to four applications: the\ndiffusion of transport technology, the impact of low-carbon investment on\nincome and employment, the management of cascading uncertainties, and the\ncross-sectoral impact of biofuels policies. The article calls for a fundamental\nmethodological shift aligning the modelling of the socio-economic system with\nthat of the climatic system, for a combined and realistic understanding of the\nimpact of sustainability policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 15:46:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2015 16:08:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 10:55:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 12:04:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mercure", "J. -F.", ""], ["Pollitt", "H.", ""], ["Bassi", "A.
