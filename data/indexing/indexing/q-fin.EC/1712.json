At each moment of time,\nthe prices of securities change and the investor is interested in constructing\na dynamic portfolio of securities. The investor wishes to maximize the value of\nhis portfolio at the end of time $T$. We use a novel theoretical approach based\non dynamic programming to solve the age old problem of dynamic programming.

The\nconclusion is argued from a study on a selected (and justified) sample of (182)\ncompanies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange\nand which use the same Shanghai Brilliance Credit Rating & Investors Service\nCompany assessment criteria, for their credit ratings, from 2010 to 2015.\nPractically, 3 debt ratios are examined in terms of 11 characteristic\nvariables. Moreover, any relationship between credit rating and corporate\ngovernance can be thought to be an interesting finding. The relationship\nbetween credit rating and leverage is not as evident as that found by other\nresearchers from different countries; it is significantly positively related to\nthe outside director, firm size, tangible assets and firm age, and CEO and\nchairman office plurality. However, leverage is found to be negatively\ncorrelated with board size, profitability, growth opportunity, and non-debt tax\nshield. Credit rating is positively associated with leverage, but in a less\nsignificant way. CEO-Board chairship duality is insignificantly related to\nleverage. The non-debt tax shield is significantly correlated with leverage.\nThe correlation coefficient between CEO duality and auditor is positive but\nweakly significant, but seems not consistent with expectations. Finally,\nprofitability cause could be regarded as an interesting finding. Indeed, there\nis an inverse correlation between profitability and total debt (Notice that the\nresult supports the pecking order theory). In conclusion, it appears that\ncredit rating has less effect on the so listed large Chinese companies than in\nother countries. Nevertheless, the perspective of assessing credit risk rating\nby relevant agencies is indubitably a recommended time dependent leverage\ndeterminant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Dec 2017 12:55:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kang", "ManYing", ""], ["Ausloos", "Marcel", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.02860", "submitter": "Amir Ahmadi Javid", "authors": "Amir Ahmadi-Javid and Mohsen Ebadi", "title": "Remarks on Bayesian Control Charts", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.CE math.OC math.PR q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is a considerable amount of ongoing research on the use of Bayesian\ncontrol charts for detecting a shift from a good quality distribution to a bad\nquality distribution in univariate and multivariate processes.
