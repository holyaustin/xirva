Despite its theoretical appeal, demand for index insurance\nhas remained low in many developing countries, triggering a debate on the\ncauses of the low uptake. Surprisingly, there has been little discussion in\nthis debate about the experience in the United States. The US is an unique case\nas both farm-based and index-based products have been available for more than\ntwo decades.

First, we document substantial propagation\neffects-trade declines even between firms outside the conflict areas if one of\nthem had traded with the conflict areas before the war. Our estimates suggest\nthat the magnitude of the second-degree effect of conflict is one-third of the\nfirst-degree effect. Second, we study firm-level consequences of a change in\nproduction network structure. Firms that, for exogenous reasons, become more\ncentral in the production network after the start of the conflict receive a\nlasting boost to their revenues and a temporary one to their profits. A\ntemporary increase in markups suggests a rise in market power as one of the\nmechanisms. Finally, in a production networks model, we separate the effects of\nexogenous firm removal and subsequent endogenous network adjustment on firm\nrevenue distribution.

To mitigate the spread of the virus, many states in the U.S.\nissued lockdown orders to urge their residents to stay at their homes, avoid\nget-togethers, and minimize physical interactions. While many offline workers\nare experiencing significant challenges performing their duties, digital\ntechnologies have provided ample tools for individuals to continue working and\nto maintain their productivity. Although using digital platforms to build\nresilience in remote work is effective, other aspects of remote work (beyond\nthe continuation of work) should also be considered in gauging true resilience.\nIn this study, we focus on content creators, and investigate how restrictions\nin individual's physical environment impact their online content creation\nbehavior. Exploiting a natural experimental setting wherein four states issued\nstate-wide lockdown orders on the same day whereas five states never issued a\nlockdown order, and using a unique dataset collected from a short video-sharing\nsocial media platform, we study the impact of lockdown orders on content\ncreators' behaviors in terms of content volume, content novelty, and content\noptimism. We combined econometric methods (difference-in-differences\nestimations of a matched sample) with machine learning-based natural language\nprocessing to show that on average, compared to the users residing in\nnon-lockdown states, the users residing in lockdown states create more content\nafter the lockdown order enforcement.
