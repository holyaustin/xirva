As the gross domestic\nproduct (GDP) has been regarded as a dated measure and tool for benchmarking a\nnation's economic performance, there has been a growing consensus for an\nalternative measure---such as a composite `wellbeing' index---to holistically\ncapture a country's socioeconomic health performance. Many conventional ways of\nconstructing wellbeing/health indices involve combining different observable\nmetrics, such as life expectancy and education level, to form an index.\nHowever, health is inherently latent with metrics actually being observable\nindicators of health. In contrast to the GDP or other conventional health\nindices, our approach provides a holistic quantification of the overall\n`health' of a nation. We build upon the latent health factor index (LHFI)\napproach that has been used to assess the unobservable ecological/ecosystem\nhealth. This framework integratively models the relationship between metrics,\nthe latent health, and the covariates that drive the notion of health. In this\npaper, the LHFI structure is integrated with spatial modeling and statistical\ncausal modeling, so as to evaluate the impact of a policy variable (mandatory\nmaternity leave days) on a nation's socioeconomic health, while formally\naccounting for spatial dependency among the nations. We apply our model to\ncountries around the world using data on various metrics and potential\ncovariates pertaining to different aspects of societal health.
