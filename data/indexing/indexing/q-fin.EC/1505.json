We show that\nexisting understanding of the puzzle should be complemented by the distinction\nof different forecast combination scenarios known as combining for adaptation\nand combining for improvement. Applying combining methods without consideration\nof the underlying scenario can itself cause the puzzle. Based on our new\nunderstandings, both simulations and real data evaluations are conducted to\nillustrate the causes of the puzzle. We further propose a multi-level AFTER\nstrategy that can integrate the strengths of different combining methods and\nadapt intelligently to the underlying scenario. In particular, by treating the\nsimple average as a candidate forecast, the proposed strategy is shown to avoid\nthe heavy cost of estimation error and, to a large extent, solve the forecast\ncombination puzzle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 May 2015 20:56:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Wei", ""], ["Rolling", "Craig A.", ""], ["Cheng", "Gang", ""], ["Yang", "Yuhong", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.03874", "submitter": "Nicolas Gu\\'erin", "authors": "Johannes Freiesleben and Nicolas Gu\\'erin", "title": "Homogenization and Clustering as a Non-Statistical Methodology to Assess\n  Multi-Parametrical Chain Problems", "comments": "32 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables, full paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new theoretical and numerical assessment methodology for a\none-dimensional process chain with general applicability to management problems\nsuch as the optimization of decision chains or production chains. The process\nis thereby seen as a chain of subsequently arranged units with random\nparameters influencing the objective function. For solving such complex chain\nproblems, analytical methods usually fail and statistical methods only provide\napproximate solutions while requiring massive computing power. We took insights\nfrom physics to develop a new methodology based on homogenization and\nclustering. The core idea is to replace the complex real chain with a virtual\nchain that homogenizes the involved parameters and clusters the working units\ninto global units to facilitate computation. This methodology drastically\nreduces computing time, allows for the derivation of analytical formulas, and\nprovides fast and objective insights about the optimization problem under\ninvestigation. We illustrate the analytical potency of this methodology by\napplying it to the production problem of selecting the economically superior\nquality maintenance strategy. It can further be applied to all sequential\nmulti-parametrical chain problems commonly found in business.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2015 20:13:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 16:52:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Freiesleben", "Johannes", ""], ["Gu\u00e9rin", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.03956", "submitter": "Dieter Grass", "authors": "Dieter Grass", "title": "From 0D to 1D spatial models using OCMat", "comments": "34 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the standard class of optimal control models in OCMat can be\nused to analyze 1D spatial distributed systems.

Such an\nevolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient\nclimate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for\nenhanced carbon sequestration. With an infinitely long sequence of even-aged\nforest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due\nto the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore\nalso involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and\nallow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of\nforest rotations.\n  Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land,\nthe initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length\nof the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters,\nthe optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is\nreleased to the atmosphere upon harvest. This effect is not, however, entirely\nmonotonous. Consequently, the currently optimal harvest ages are generally\nlower with higher rates of carbon price increase. This creates an interesting\ntemporal aspect, suggesting that the supply of wood and carbon sequestration by\nforests can change considerably during subsequent rotations under an increasing\nprice on carbon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2015 10:38:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 08:23:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ekholm", "Tommi", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.05737", "submitter": "Ngoc Mai Tran", "authors": "Ngoc Mai Tran and Josephine Yu", "title": "Product-Mix Auctions and Tropical Geometry", "comments": "23 pages plus references, 4 figures.

But does this product mix also predict\nincome inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science,\nand economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products (as\nmeasured by the Economic Complexity Index) have lower levels of income\ninequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate\nregression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and\nnegative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to\ncontrolling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export\nconcentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that\nassociates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI\nof the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product\nrepresents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with\nthe network of related products (or product space) to illustrate how the\ndevelopment of new products is associated with changes in income inequality.\nThese findings show that economic complexity captures information about an\neconomy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy\ngenerates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a\ncountry's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality.\nFinally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows\nfor its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries\nand their associated changes in income inequality between 1963 and 2008.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2015 02:18:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2015 21:55:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 09:14:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 21:24:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Hartmann", "D.", ""], ["Guevara", "M.
