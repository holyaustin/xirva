Using a standard model, we\nshow that three factors can shift the Beveridge curve: reduced-form matching\nefficiency, changes in the job separation rate, and out-of-steady-state\ndynamics. We find that the shift in the Beveridge curve during and after the\nGreat Recession was due to all three factors, and each factor taken separately\nhad a large effect. Comparing the pre-2010 period to the post-2010 period, a\nfall in matching efficiency and out-of-steady-state dynamics both pushed the\ncurve upward, while the changes in the separation rate pushed the curve\ndownward. The net effect was the observed upward shift in vacancies given\nunemployment. In previous recessions changes in matching efficiency were\nrelatively unimportant, while dynamics and the separation rate had more impact.\nThus, the unusual feature of the Great Recession was the deterioration in\nmatching efficiency, while separations and dynamics have played significant,\npartially offsetting roles in most downturns. The importance of these latter\ntwo margins contrasts with much of the literature, which abstracts from one or\nboth of them. We show that these factors affect the slope of the empirical\nBeveridge curve, an important quantity in recent welfare analyses estimating\nthe natural rate of unemployment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 19:20:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ahn", "Hie Joo", ""], ["Crane", "Leland D.", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.00129", "submitter": "Duc P.

Instead, they have the indirect objective of reducing emissions. They\nprovide poor future price information. And they have high transaction costs for\nimplementation, requiring treaties and laws. To address these shortcomings,\nthis paper proposes a novel double-sided auction mechanism of emissions permits\nand sequestration contracts tied to temperature. This mechanism constrains\nwarming for many (e.g., 150) years into the future and every auction would\nprovide price information for this time range. In addition, this paper proposes\na set of market rules and a bottom-up implementation path. A coalition of\nbusinesses begin implementation with jurisdictions joining as they are ready.\nThe combination of the selected market rules and the proposed implementation\npath appear to incentivize participation. This design appears to be closer to\n\"first best\" with a lower cost of mitigation than any in the literature, while\nincreasing the certainty of avoiding catastrophic warming. This design should\nalso have a faster pathway to implementation.
