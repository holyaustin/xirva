The rational\nbehaviour of such participant is to bid close to the deadline in order to\nreceive all bids, which allows him to ensure his win at the best price\npossible. While such behaviour does leave detectable traces in the data, the\nabsence of bid leakage labels makes supervised classification impossible.\nInstead, we reduce the problem of the bid leakage detection to a\npositive-unlabeled classification. The key idea is to regard the losing\nparticipants as fair and the winners as possibly corrupted. This allows us to\nestimate the prior probability of bid leakage in the sample, as well as the\nposterior probability of bid leakage for each specific auction.\n  We extract and analyze the data on 600,000 Russian procurement auctions\nbetween 2014 and 2018. We find that around 9% of the auctions are exposed to\nbid leakage, which results in an overall 1.5% price increase. The predicted\nprobability of bid leakage is higher for auctions with a higher reserve price,\nwith too low or too high number of participants, and if the winner has met the\nauctioneer in earlier auctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2019 12:09:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:49:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ivanov", "Dmitry I.", ""], ["Nesterov", "Alexander S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.00631", "submitter": "Pavel Shevchenko V", "authors": "Jin Sun, Ryle S.
