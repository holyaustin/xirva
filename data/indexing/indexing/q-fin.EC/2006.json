However, gravity-based measures often suffer from\nthree main limitations: (1) they are sensitive to the spatial configuration and\nscale of the units of analysis, which are not specifically designed for\ncapturing job accessibility patterns and are often too coarse; (2) they omit\nthe temporal dynamics of job opportunities and workers in the calculation,\ninstead assuming that they remain stable over time; and (3) they do not lend\nthemselves to dynamic geovisualization techniques. In this paper, a new\nmethodological framework for measuring and visualizing place-based job\naccessibility in space and time is presented that overcomes these three\nlimitations. First, discretization and dasymetric mapping approaches are used\nto disaggregate counts of jobs and workers over specific time intervals to a\nfine-scale grid. Second, Shen (1998) gravity-based accessibility measure is\nmodified to account for temporal fluctuations in the spatial distributions of\nthe supply of jobs and the demand of workers and is used to estimate hourly job\naccessibility at each cell. Third, a four-dimensional volumetric rendering\napproach is employed to integrate the hourly job access estimates into a\nspace-time cube environment, which enables the users to interactively visualize\nthe space-time job accessibility patterns. The integrated framework is\ndemonstrated in the context of a case study of the Tampa Bay region of Florida.\nThe findings demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology in job\naccessibility analysis and the policy-making process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 May 2020 13:39:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Yujie", ""], ["Downs", "Joni", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.00279", "submitter": "Simon Pearson", "authors": "Rebecca Mitchell, Roger Maull, Simon Pearson, Steve Brewer and Martin\n  Collison", "title": "The impact of COVID-19 on the UK fresh food supply chain", "comments": "16 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The resilience of the food supply chain is a matter of critical importance,\nboth for national security and broader societal well bring.

Hence, the business is\naiming at maximizing social welfare rather than profits.

In order to evaluate the insurer's loss\nprofile, spatial correlation among insured assets has been evaluated by means\nof the Hoeffding bound for r-dependent random variables. Though earthquakes\ngenerate expected losses that are almost six times greater than floods, we\nfound that the amount of public funds needed to manage the two perils is almost\nthe same. We argue that this result is determined by a combination of the risk\naversion of individuals and the shape of the loss distribution. Lastly, since\nearthquakes and floods are uncorrelated, we tested whether jointly managing the\ntwo perils can counteract the negative impact of spatial correlation. Some\nbenefit from risk diversification emerged, though the probability of the\ngovernment having to inject further capital might be considerable.

This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic.

A baseline model was previously\ndeveloped and calibrated for pre-COVID conditions as MATSim-NYC. A new COVID\nmodel is calibrated that represents travel behavior during the COVID-19\npandemic by recalibrating the population agendas to include work-from-home and\nre-estimating the mode choice model for MATSim-NYC to fit observed traffic and\ntransit ridership data. Assuming the change in behavior exhibits inertia during\nreopening, we analyze the increase in car traffic due to the phased reopen plan\nguided by the state government of New York. Four reopening phases and two\nreopening scenarios (with and without transit capacity restrictions) are\nanalyzed. A Phase 4 reopening with 100% transit capacity may only see as much\nas 73% of pre-COVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as\nmuch as 142% of pre-pandemic levels. Limiting transit capacity to 50% would\ndecrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64% while increasing car trips\nto as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears small,\nthe impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already\nincreased traffic congestion.

Each year since 2018, more than 10,000 UK firms have been\nrequired to disclose publicly their gender pay gap and gender composition along\nthe wage distribution.

Coupled with the potential negative\neffects of unequal pay on firms' reputation, this shock could improve women's\nrelative occupational and pay outcomes. We test these theoretical predictions\nusing a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits variations in the UK\nmandate across firm size and time. This analysis delivers four main findings.\nFirst, pay transparency increases women's probability of working in\nabove-median-wage occupations by 5 percent compared to the pre-policy mean.\nSecond, while this effect has not yet translated into a significant rise in\nwomen's pay, the policy leads to a 2.8 percent decrease in men's real hourly\npay, reducing the pre-policy gender pay gap by 15 percent. Third, combining the\ndifference-in-differences strategy with a text analysis of job listings, we\nfind suggestive evidence that treated firms adopt female-friendly hiring\npractices in ads for high-gender-pay-gap occupations.

This\npaper seeks to find the bridge between artificial intelligence and its impact\non the international policy implementation in the light of geopolitical\ninfluence, global economy and the future of labor markets. We hypothesize that\nthe distortion in the labor markets caused by artificial intelligence can be\nmitigated by a collaborative international foreign policy on the deployment of\nAI in the industrial circles. We, in this paper, then proceed to propose a\ndisposition for the essentials of AI-based foreign policy and implementation,\nwhile asking questions such as 'could AI become the real Invisible Hand\ndiscussed by economists?'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2020 10:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bonsu", "Kwadwo Osei", ""], ["Song", "Jie", ""]]}]
