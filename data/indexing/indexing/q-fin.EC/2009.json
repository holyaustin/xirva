The intensities of the\norders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but also on\nunobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control\nproblem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering,\ncontrol and PDMPs theory. The value function is characterized as the unique\ncontinuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation and\nnumerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal full\ninformation spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is\nunknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty\nin terms of PnL sensitivity and observable order flow volatility.\n  The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic impulse\ncontrol games.

A\npolicy-iteration-type solver is proposed to solve an underlying system of\nquasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated numerically with reassuring\nresults.\n  Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure and an\nimproved algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is\nundertaken with natural assumptions on the players strategies, which admit\ngraph-theoretic interpretations in the context of weakly chained diagonally\ndominant matrices.

First, rates of teacher turnover are high: annually, 20\npercent of teachers separate from their jobs, of which 11 percent exit from the\npublic-sector teaching workforce. Second, the burden of teacher churn is higher\nin schools with low learning levels and, perhaps surprisingly, in low\npupil-teacher-ratio schools. Third, teacher turnover is concentrated among\nearly-career teachers, male teachers, and those assigned to teach Math. Fourth,\nreplacing teachers quickly after they exit is a challenge; 23 percent of\nexiting teachers are not replaced the following year. And fifth, teacher\nturnover is associated with subsequent declines in learning outcomes. On\naverage, the loss of a teacher is associated with a reduction in learning\nlevels of 0.05 standard deviations. In addition to class-size increases, a\npossible mechanism for these learning outcomes is the prevalence of teachers\nteaching outside of their areas of subject expertise: in any given year, at\nleast 21 percent of teachers teach in subjects in which they have not been\ntrained.

Although the\nnational and international strategic development plans may vary, they usually\ntarget the improvement of the quality of living standards through boosting the\nnational GDP per capita and the creation of decent jobs. There is no doubt that\nhuman capacity building, through higher education, is vital to the availability\nof highly qualified workforce supporting the implementation of the\naforementioned strategies. In other words, fulfillment of most strategic\ndevelopment plan goals becomes dependent on the drafting and implementation of\nsuccessful higher education strategies. For MENA region countries, this is\nparticularly crucial due to many specific challenges, some of which are\ndifferent from those facing developed nations. More details on the MENA region\nhigher education strategic planning challenges as well as the proposed higher\neducation strategic requirements to support national economic prosperity and\nfulfill the 2030 UN SDGs are given in the paper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 03:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Adly", "Amr A.", ""]]}]
