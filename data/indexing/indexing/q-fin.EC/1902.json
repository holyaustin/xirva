However, their\nnet effect on energy and environmental outcomes is unclear. Higher fuel economy\nreduces the energy required per mile of travel, but it also reduces the fuel\ncost of travel, incentivizing more travel and causing an energy \"rebound\neffect.\" Moreover, CAVs are predicted to vastly reduce the time cost of travel,\ninducing further increases in travel and energy use. In this paper, we forecast\nthe induced travel and rebound from CAVs using data on existing travel\nbehavior. We develop a microeconomic model of vehicle miles traveled (VMT)\nchoice under income and time constraints; then we use it to estimate\nelasticities of VMT demand with respect to fuel and time costs, with fuel cost\ndata from the 2017 United States National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) and\nwage-derived predictions of travel time cost. Our central estimate of the\ncombined price elasticity of VMT demand is -0.4, which differs substantially\nfrom previous estimates. We also find evidence that wealthier households have\nmore elastic demand, and that households at all income levels are more\nsensitive to time costs than to fuel costs. We use our estimated elasticities\nto simulate VMT and energy use impacts of full, private CAV adoption under a\nrange of possible changes to the fuel and time costs of travel. We forecast a\n2-47% increase in travel demand for an average household. Our results indicate\nthat backfire - i.e., a net rise in energy use - is a possibility, especially\nin higher income groups. This presents a stiff challenge to policy goals for\nreductions in not only energy use but also traffic congestion and local and\nglobal air pollution, as CAV use increases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 17:19:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 23:55:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2019 18:47:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2019 20:16:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Taiebat", "Morteza", ""], ["Stolper", "Samuel", ""], ["Xu", "Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00428", "submitter": "Omar A.

During the 21st century, global\ncooling demand is expected to grow significantly due to the increase in wealth\nand population in sunny nations across the globe and the advance of global\nwarming. The same locations that see high demand for cooling are also ideal for\nelectricity generation via photovoltaics (PV). Despite the apparent synergy\nbetween cooling demand and PV generation, the potential of the cooling sector\nto sustain PV generation has not been assessed on a global scale. Here, we\nperform a global assessment of increased PV electricity adoption enabled by the\nresidential cooling sector during the 21st century. Already today, utilizing PV\nproduction for cooling could facilitate an additional installed PV capacity of\napproximately 540 GW, more than the global PV capacity of today. Using\nestablished scenarios of population and income growth, as well as accounting\nfor future global warming, we further project that the global residential\ncooling sector could sustain an added PV capacity between 20-200 GW each year\nfor most of the 21st century, on par with the current global manufacturing\ncapacity of 100 GW. Furthermore, we find that without storage, PV could\ndirectly power approximately 50% of cooling demand, and that this fraction is\nset to increase from 49% to 56% during the 21st century, as cooling demand\ngrows in locations where PV and cooling have a higher synergy. With this\ngeographic shift in demand, the potential of distributed storage also grows. We\nsimulate that with a 1 m$^3$ water-based latent thermal storage per household,\nthe fraction of cooling demand met with PV would increase from 55% to 70%\nduring the century. These results show that the synergy between cooling and PV\nis notable and could significantly accelerate the growth of the global PV\nindustry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Feb 2019 10:52:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Laine", "Hannu S.", ""], ["Salpakari", "Jyri", ""], ["Looney", "Erin E.", ""], ["Savin", "Hele", ""], ["Peters", "Ian Marius", ""], ["Buonassisi", "Tonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10405", "submitter": "Dylan Possama\\\"i", "authors": "Romuald Elie, Emma Hubert, Thibaut Mastrolia, Dylan Possama\\\"i", "title": "Mean-field moral hazard for optimal energy demand response management", "comments": "54 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR econ.GN math.OC q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the problem of demand response contracts in electricity markets by\nquantifying the impact of considering a mean-field of consumers, whose\nconsumption is impacted by a common noise.
