We did a systematic review and mapping of the costs that\npollution imposes on different sectors and localities in the UARB, and\ninitially found 358 studies, of which 17 were of our particular interest. We\nfocus on estimating the cost of pollution through different valuation methods\nsuch as averted costs, hedonic pricing, and contingent valuation, and for that\nwe only use 10 studies. Costs range from less than a million to over $16\nmillion dollars a year, depending on the sector, with agriculture, industry and\ntourism yielding the highest costs. This exercise is the first of its kind in\nthe UARB that maps costs for sectors and localities affected, and sheds light\non the need of additional research to estimate the total cost of pollution\nthroughout the basin.

All these Parisian modes are assessed for the first time using LCA.\nFinal results estimate that over one year, the FFES generated an extra thirteen\nthousand tons of CO2eq under an assumption of one million users, mainly due to\nmajor shifts coming from lower-emitting modes (60% from the metro and the RER,\n22% from active modes).

Modelling the role of H$_2$ as grid-scale energy storage, often\nreferred as \"power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)\" overlooks the cost-sharing and\nemission benefits from using the deployed H$_2$ production and storage assets\nto also supply H$_2$ for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct\nelectrification may be challenged. Here, we develop a generalized modelling\nframework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment and operation\nacross power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity\nand H$_2$, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and\nsupply. Applying this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a\nrange of technology cost and carbon price scenarios, we find a greater value of\npower-to-H$_2$ (P2G) versus P2G2P routes. P2G provides flexible demand\nresponse, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of P2G2P routes make\nthe solution less attractive for grid balancing. The effects of sector-coupling\nare significant, boosting VRE generation by 12-55% with both increased\ncapacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or\nlevelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. Both\nthe cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with\nH$_2$ demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization\nscenario as H$_2$ demand quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of\ncarbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the H$_2$ sector because\nof the lower cost and higher utilization rate. These findings highlight the\nimportance of using an integrated multi-sector energy system framework with\nmultiple energy vectors in planning energy system decarbonization pathways.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Mar 2021 02:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Guannan", ""], ["Mallapragada", "Dharik S.", ""], ["Bose", "Abhishek", ""], ["Heuberger", "Clara F.", ""], ["Gen\u00e7er", "Emre", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.03632", "submitter": "Michael Pfarrhofer", "authors": "Michael Pfarrhofer", "title": "Tail forecasts of inflation using time-varying parameter quantile\n  regressions", "comments": "JEL: C11, C22, C53, E31; Keywords: state space models, stochastic\n  volatility, unobserved component model, density forecasts, tail risk", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.EM econ.GN q-fin.EC stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes methods for Bayesian inference in time-varying parameter\n(TVP) quantile regression (QR) models.

PPI networks are shaped by complementarity,\nrather than homophily, and we use multi-layer directed configuration models to\nshow that this principle explains the emergence of functional structure in\nproduction networks. Companies are especially similar to their close\ncompetitors, not to their trading partners. Our findings have practical\nimplications for the analysis of production networks and a thorough\nunderstanding of their local connectivity structure will help us better reason\nabout the micro-economic mechanisms behind their routine function, failure, and\ngrowth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:11:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mattsson", "Carolina", ""], ["Takes", "Frank W.", ""], ["Heemskerk", "Eelke M.", ""], ["Diks", "Cees", ""], ["Buiten", "Gert", ""], ["Faber", "Albert", ""], ["Sloot", "Peter M.

The study utilizes secondary data spanning 1990 to 2018.\nThe data is analyzed using cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lags\n(CS-ARDL) and cross-sectional distributed lags (CS-DL) techniques. The study\nfound that technological leapfrogging is a positive driver of manufacturing\nvalue-added in SSA. This implies that SSA can copy the foreign technologies and\nadapt them for domestic uses, rather than going through the evolutionary\nprocess of the old technologies that are relatively less efficient. If the\ngovernments of SSA could reinforce their absorptive capacity and beef up\nproductivity through proper utilization of the existing technology. The\nproductive activities of the domestic firms will stir new innovations and\ndiscoveries that will eventually translate into indigenous technology\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Mar 2021 03:31:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ojo", "Segun Michael", ""], ["Ogunleye", "Edward Oladipo", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16977", "submitter": "Ed Hill", "authors": "Edward Hill, Marco Bardoscia and Arthur Turrell", "title": "Solving Heterogeneous General Equilibrium Economic Models with Deep\n  Reinforcement Learning", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN cs.LG cs.MA q-fin.EC stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  General equilibrium macroeconomic models are a core tool used by policymakers\nto understand a nation's economy. They represent the economy as a collection of\nforward-looking actors whose behaviours combine, possibly with stochastic\neffects, to determine global variables (such as prices) in a dynamic\nequilibrium. However, standard semi-analytical techniques for solving these\nmodels make it difficult to include the important effects of heterogeneous\neconomic actors. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the importance\nof heterogeneity, for example in age and sector of employment, in macroeconomic\noutcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it. We use\ntechniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating\nheterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally\nefficient. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and stability on a toy problem\nfor which there is a known analytical solution, its versatility by solving a\ngeneral equilibrium problem that includes global stochasticity, and its\nflexibility by solving a combined macroeconomic and epidemiological model to\nexplore the economic and health implications of a pandemic. The latter\nsuccessfully captures plausible economic behaviours induced by differential\nhealth risks by age.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 10:55:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hill", "Edward", ""], ["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Turrell", "Arthur", ""]]}]
