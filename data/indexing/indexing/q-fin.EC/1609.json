China is\nespecially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its\nkind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates\neconomic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.\nFar from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure\ninvestment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's\ntrack record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich\ndemocracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive\nprojects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in\nfinancial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We\nconclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation\nof surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless\nChina shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the\ncountry is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic\ncrisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.\nChina's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other\ncountries but one to avoid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 22:18:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ansar", "Atif", ""], ["Flyvbjerg", "Bent", ""], ["Budzier", "Alexander", ""], ["Lunn", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.01274", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "Securities Lending Strategies: Valuation of Term Loans using Option\n  Theory", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1603.00987", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.EC q-fin.PM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop models to price long term loans in the securities lending\nbusiness.

We run\nnumerical simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability of these\nmodels. These models are part of one of the least explored yet profit laden\nareas of modern investment management.\n  We develop a heuristic that can mitigate the loss of information that sets in\nwhen parameters are estimated first and then the valuation is performed by\ndirectly calculating the valuation using the historical time series. This can\nlead to reduced models errors and greater financial stability. We illustrate\nhow the methodologies developed here could be useful for inventory management.\nAll these techniques could have applications for dealing with other financial\ninstruments, non-financial commodities and many forms of uncertainty. An\nunintended consequence of our efforts, has become a review of the vast\nliterature on options pricing, which can be useful for anyone that attempts to\napply the corresponding techniques to the problems mentioned here.\n  Admittedly, our initial ambitions to produce a normative theory on long term\nloan valuations are undone by the present state of affairs in social science\nmodeling.

For each country we employ a panel\ngravitational model for the bilateral trade and FDI, considering its\ninteractions with the other three countries in the sample on the one hand, and\nwith the three EU main commercial partners on the other hand. We investigate\ndifferent facets of the trade -- FDI nexus, resorting to a fixed effects model,\na random effects model, as well as to an instrumental variable estimator, over\nthe period 2000-2013. Our results suggest that outward FDI sustains the CEE\ncountries' commercial integration, while inward FDI has no significant effect.\nIn all the cases a complementarity effect between trade and FDI is documented,\nwhich is stronger for the CEE countries' historical trade partners.\nConsequently, these findings show that CEE countries' policymakers are\ninterested in encouraging the outward FDI toward their neighbour countries in\norder to increase the commercial integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 09:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Albulescu", "Claudiu Tiberiu", "", "UPT"], ["Goyeau", "Daniel", "", "CRIEF"]]}, {"id": "1609.03223", "submitter": "Bruce Knuteson", "authors": "Bruce Knuteson", "title": "The Solution to Science's Replication Crisis", "comments": "2 pages (main text) + 5 pages (references)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The solution to science's replication crisis is a new ecosystem in which\nscientists sell what they learn from their research.
