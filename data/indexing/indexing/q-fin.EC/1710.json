Data are found to be in a clear contradiction\nof the currently accepted explanations of the mechanism of growth, which\nrevolve around two fundamental but incorrect doctrines: (1) the doctrine of\nstagnation (inappropriately labelled also as Malthusian stagnation, because\nMalthus never claimed that his positive checks would cause a long-lasting and\nwide-spread stagnation) and (2) the doctrine of explosion described also as a\ntakeoff, sprint, spike or by other similar attributes. These doctrines and\nother related postulates are contradicted even by precisely the same data,\nwhich are used in the economic research and by the research results published\nin a prestigious scientific journal as early as in 1960. The generally accepted\nexplanations are not based on a rigorous analysis of data but on impressions\ncreated by the easily misleading features of hyperbolic distributions. Two\nleading theories: the Demographic Transitions Theory (or Model) and the Unified\nGrowth Theory are fundamentally incorrect. Descriptions of the past\nsocio-economic conditions are not questioned. They might have been harsh,\ndifficult and primitive but they are not reflected in the growth trajectories.\nThey did not create stagnation in the economic growth and in the growth of\npopulation. Likewise, impacts of the Industrial Revolution on many aspects of\nlife are not questioned. It is only demonstrated that this event had absolutely\nno impact on shaping growth trajectories. A general law of growth is formulated\nand used to explain the mechanism of growth of human population and of economic\ngrowth. The growth was predominantly hyperbolic. Such a growth is described by\nexceptionally simple mathematical function and the explanation of the mechanism\nof growth turns out to be also simple.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 06:07:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nielsen", "Ron W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.02669", "submitter": "Jerzy Rydlewski", "authors": "Daniel Kosiorowski, Dominik Mielczarek, Jerzy P.

Here we lay out a program\nof research into monetary and economic dynamics and preliminary steps toward\nits execution. We use principles of response theory to derive implications for\npolicy. We find that the current approach, which considers the overall money\nsupply, is insufficient to regulate economic growth. While it can achieve some\ndegree of control, optimizing growth also requires a fiscal policy balancing\nmonetary injection between two dominant loop flows, the consumption and wages\nloop, and investment and returns loop. The balance arises from a composite of\ngovernment tax, entitlement, subsidy policies, corporate policies, as well as\nmonetary policy. We show empirically that a transition occurred in 1980 between\ntwo regimes--an oversupply to the consumption and wages loop, to an oversupply\nof the investment and returns loop. The imbalance is manifest in savings and\nborrowing by consumers and investors, and in inflation. The latter increased\nuntil 1980, and decreased subsequently, resulting in a zero rate largely\nunrelated to the financial crisis. Three recessions and the financial crisis\nare part of this dynamic. Optimizing growth now requires shifting the balance.\nOur analysis supports advocates of greater income and / or government support\nfor the poor who use a larger fraction of income for consumption. This promotes\ninvestment due to growth in demand. Otherwise, investment opportunities are\nlimited, capital remains uninvested, and does not contribute to growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 13:54:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Dec 2017 15:33:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""], ["Langlois-Meurinne", "Jean", ""], ["Kawakatsu", "Mari", ""], ["Garcia", "Rodolfo", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.06526", "submitter": "John Stachurski", "authors": "Jaroslav Borovicka and John Stachurski", "title": "Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Existence and Uniqueness of\n  Recursive Utilities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study existence, uniqueness and computability of solutions for a class of\ndiscrete time recursive utilities models.

We take a modelling-based approach for simulating which\npolicy measures could induce an almost-complete decarbonisation of residential\nheating, the by far largest source of direct emissions in residential\nbuildings. Under which assumptions is it possible, and how long would it take?\nPolicy effectiveness highly depends on behavioural decision- making by\nhouseholds, especially in a context of deep decarbonisation and rapid\ntransformation. We therefore use the non-equilibrium bottom-up model FTT:Heat\nto simulate policies for a transition towards low-carbon heating in a context\nof inertia and bounded rationality, focusing on the uptake of heating\ntechnologies. Results indicate that the near-zero decarbonisation is achievable\nby 2050, but requires substantial policy efforts. Policy mixes are projected to\nbe more effective and robust for driving the market of efficient low-carbon\ntechnologies, compared to the reliance on a carbon tax as the only policy\ninstrument. In combination with subsidies for renewables, near-complete\ndecarbonisation could be achieved with a residential carbon tax of\n50-200Euro/tCO2.
