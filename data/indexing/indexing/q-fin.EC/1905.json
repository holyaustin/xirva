The product is either good or\nbad but its true value is not known to the players. Instead, each player has\nher own private information on its quality. Each player can observe the\nprevious actions of other players and estimate the quality of the product. A\nclassic result in the literature shows that in similar settings information\ncascades occur where learning stops for the whole network and players repeat\nthe actions of their predecessors. In contrast to the existing literature on\ninformational cascades, in this work, players get more than one opportunity to\nact. In each turn, a player is chosen uniformly at random and can decide to buy\nthe product and leave the market or to wait. We provide a characterization of\nstructured perfect Bayesian equilibria (sPBE) with forward-looking strategies\nthrough a fixed-point equation of dimensionality that grows only quadratically\nwith the number of players. In particular, a sufficient state for players'\nstrategies at each time instance is a pair of two integers, the first\ncorresponding to the estimated quality of the good and the second indicating\nthe number of players that cannot offer additional information about the good\nto the rest of the players. Based on this characterization we study\ninformational cascades in two regimes. First, we show that for a discount\nfactor strictly smaller than one, informational cascades happen with high\nprobability as the number of players increases. Furthermore, only a small\nportion of the total information in the system is revealed before a cascade\noccurs. Secondly, and more surprisingly, we show that for a fixed number of\nplayers, as the discount factor approaches one, bad informational cascades are\nbenign when the product is bad, and are completely eliminated when the discount\nfactor equals one.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 18:07:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Sep 2019 18:34:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2020 17:14:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bistritz", "Ilai", ""], ["Heydaribeni", "Nasimeh", ""], ["Anastasopoulos", "Achilleas", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.01617", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Marcel Ausloos, Ali Eskandary, Parmjit Kaur, Gurjeet Dhesi", "title": "Evidence for Gross Domestic Product growth time delay dependence over\n  Foreign Direct Investment.

We suggest\nthat the main determinants of broadband diffusion and the population density\nfollow a spatial pattern that is either concentric with a weak/medium/strong\nstrength or non-concentric convex/concave.

Spectrum auctions facilitated infrastructure-based competition\nvia equitable spectrum allocation and coverage obligation delivery via low-fee\nlicenses. However, state subsidies for fiber deployment did not attract\ninvestment from nationwide operators due to mobile preference. These subsidies\nencouraged demand-driven investment, leading to the emergence of fiber consumer\ncooperatives. To explain this emergence, we show that when population density\ndecreases, the level of mobile service quality decreases and community\ncommitment increases. Hence, we recommend regulators implementing market-driven\nstrategies for 5G to stimulate local investment.
