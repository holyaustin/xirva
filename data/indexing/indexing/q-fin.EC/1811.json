During 2014-2016, China energy\nintensity (energy consumption per unit of GDP) and total CO2 emissions has\ndecreased driven by energy and economic structure optimization. However, the\ndecrease in emissions is now offset by stimulates of heavy industry production\nunder economic downturn that driving coal consumption (+5% in 2018), as well as\nthe surging of natural gas consumption (+18% in 2018) due to the government led\ncoal-to-gas energy transition to reduce local air pollutions. Timing policy and\nactions are urgent needed to address on these new drivers to turn down the\ntotal emission growth trend.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Nov 2018 13:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Zhu", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""], ["Zhang", "Qiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.09622", "submitter": "Jos\\'e  Javier Cerda Hern\\'andez", "authors": "J.

The\nstochastic mortality model was introduced by Lee and Carter (1992) and has been\nused by many authors for fitting and forecasting the human mortality rates. The\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) approach is used for estimation of the\nparameters of the LC model. Utilizing the best fitted auto regressive\nintegrated moving average (ARIMA) model we forecast the values of the time\ndependent parameter of the LC model for the next thirty years. The forecasted\nvalues of life expectancy at different age group with $95\\%$ confidence\nintervals are also reported for the next thirty years.

These channel choices are the result of a recursive\nprocess of social interactions and determine the observable trading networks.\nThey are characterized by feedback mechanisms due to peer interaction and\ntherefore need to be understood as complex adaptive systems (CAS). When\nmodelling CAS, conventional approaches like regression analyses face severe\ndrawbacks since endogeneity is omnipresent. As an alternative, process-based\nanalyses allow researchers to capture these endogenous processes and multiple\nfeedback loops. This paper applies an agent-based modelling approach (ABM) to\nthe empirical example of the Indonesian rubber trade. The feedback mechanisms\nare modelled via an innovative approach of a social matrix, which allows\ndecisions made in a specific period to feed back into the decision processes in\nsubsequent periods, and allows agents to systematically assign different\nweights to the decision parameters based on their individual characteristics.\nIn the validation against the observed network, uncertainty in the found\nestimates, as well as under determination of the model, are dealt with via an\napproach of evolutionary calibration: a genetic algorithm finds the combination\nof parameters that maximizes the similarity between the simulated and the\nobserved network. Results indicate that the sellers' channel choice decisions\nare mostly driven by physical distance and debt obligations, as well as\npeer-interaction. Within the social matrix, the most influential individuals\nare sellers that live close by to other traders, are active in social groups\nand belong to the ethnic majority in their village.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2018 10:10:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kopp", "Thomas", ""], ["Salecker", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.11664", "submitter": "Mark Whitmeyer", "authors": "Mark Whitmeyer", "title": "Dynamic Competitive Persuasion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cs.GT econ.GN econ.TH q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine a dynamic game of competitive persuasion played between two\nlong-lived sellers over $T \\leq \\infty$ periods.
