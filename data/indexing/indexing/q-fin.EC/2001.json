In a setting in which individuals' utility function is a\nconvex combination of a heuristic function \u007fa la Schelling, of the distance to\nfriends, and of the cost of moving, the prediction of the original model gets\nattenuated: the segregation equilibria are not the unique solutions. While the\ncost of distance has a monotonic pro-status-quo effect, equivalent to that of\nmodels of migration and gravity models, if friends and neighbours are formed\nfollowing independent processes the location of friends in space generates an\nexternality that reinforces the initial configuration if the distance to\nfriends is minimal, and if the degree of each agent is high. The effect on\nsegregation equilibria crucially depends on the role played by network\nexternalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jan 2020 13:14:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cerqueti", "Roy", ""], ["De Benedictis", "Luca", ""], ["Sciabolazza", "Valerio Leone", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.03043", "submitter": "Mukaramah Harun", "authors": "Mukaramah Harun", "title": "Determinants of Social-economic Mobility in the Northern Region of\n  Malaysia", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Colleting the data through a survey in the Northern region of Malaysia;\nKedah, Perlis, Penang and Perak, this study investigates intergenerational\nsocial mobility in Malaysia.

However,\ndespite that the technological change affected similarly the majority of the\ndeveloped countries, nevertheless, the level of the increase of wage inequality\nwasn't similar. Following the predictions of the SBTC theory, the different\nlevels of inequality could be due to varying degrees of skill inequality\nbetween economies, possibly caused by variations in the number of skilled\nworkers available. However, recent research shows that the difference mentioned\nabove can explain a small percentage of the difference between countries.\nTherefore, most of the resulting inequality could be due to the different ways\nin which the higher level of skills is valued in each labor market. The\nposition advocated in this article is that technological change is largely\ngiven for all countries without much scope to reverse. Therefore, in order to\nillustrate the changes in the structure of wage distribution that cause wage\ninequality, we need to understand how technology affects labor market\ninstitutions.In this sense, the pay inequality caused by technological progress\nis not a phenomenon we passively accept.

Consequently,\neconomic globalization forms a massive and complex economic network with strong\nlinks, that is, interactions arising from increasing trade. Various interesting\ncollective motions are expected to emerge from strong economic interactions in\na global economy under trade liberalization. Among the various economic\ncollective motions, economic crises are our most intriguing problem. In our\nprevious studies, we have revealed that the Kuramoto's coupled limit-cycle\noscillator model and the Ising-like spin model on networks are invaluable tools\nfor characterizing the economic crises. In this study, we develop a\nmathematical theory to describe an interacting agent model that derives the\nKuramoto model and the Ising-like spin model by using appropriate\napproximations. Our interacting agent model suggests phase synchronization and\nspin ordering during economic crises. We confirm the emergence of the phase\nsynchronization and spin ordering during economic crises by analyzing various\neconomic time series data. We also develop a network reconstruction model based\non entropy maximization that considers the sparsity of the network. Here\nnetwork reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a\nnode's local information. The interbank network is reconstructed using the\ndeveloped model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the\nactual data. We successfully reproduce the interbank network and the known\nstylized facts. In addition, the exogenous shock acting on an industry\ncommunity in a supply chain network and financial sector are estimated.\nEstimation of exogenous shocks acting on communities of in the real economy in\nthe supply chain network provide evidence of the channels of distress\npropagating from the financial sector to the real economy through the supply\nchain network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 04:53:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ikeda", "Yuichi", ""]]}]
