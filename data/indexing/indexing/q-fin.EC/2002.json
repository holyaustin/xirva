We consider a nonparametric, nonseparable choice\nmodel that places no restrictions on the functional form of utilities or the\ndistribution of unobserved heterogeneity. We exploit the insight that the\nwelfare parameters in this model can be expressed as functions of the demand\nfor the different schools. However, while the random allocation of the voucher\nreveals the value of demand at two prices, the parameters generally depend on\nits values beyond these prices. We show how to sharply characterize what we can\nlearn when demand is specified to be entirely nonparametric or to be\nparameterized in a flexible manner, both of which imply that the parameters are\nnot necessarily point identified. We use our tools to analyze the welfare\neffects of voucher provision in the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, a\nschool voucher program in Washington, DC. We find that the provision of both\nthe status-quo voucher and a wide range of counterfactual vouchers of different\namounts have positive benefits net of costs. In comparison, traditional logit\nmodels produce estimates towards the lower end of our bounds, and hence may\nunderstate the benefits. We also find that the positive results can be\nexplained by the popularity of low-tuition schools in the program; removing\nthem from the program can result in a negative net benefit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 23:46:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Nov 2020 10:30:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:38:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kamat", "Vishal", ""], ["Norris", "Samuel", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00948", "submitter": "Daniele Rinaldo", "authors": "Jean-Louis Arcand, Max-Olivier Hongler, Shekhar Hari Kumar, Daniele\n  Rinaldo", "title": "Can one hear the shape of a target zone?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop an exchange rate target zone model with finite exit time and\nnon-Gaussian tails.

Correlated generation from variable renewable sources\ndepresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their\nown revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This\ncannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and\nthus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here\nwe show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact\nwith prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline\nin average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy\nassumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with\nsubsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of\nwhether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving\npolicy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without\ncannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar\nabove 80%. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means\nthat market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market\nintegration.

We\nproposed a hypothesis that interprets choice of action as the X-point for\nindividual utility function that increases with actions and social norm\nfunction that decreases with actions. This hypothesis is based on humans\npsychologically balancing the value of utility and norms in selecting actions.\nUsing the hypothesis and approximation, we were able to isolate and infer\nutility function and norm function from real-world measurement data of actions\non environmental conditions and elucidate the interaction between the both\nfunctions that led from current status to target actions. As examples of\ncollective data that aggregate decision-making of individuals, we looked at the\nchanges in power usage before and after the Great East Japan Earthquake and the\ncorrelation between national GDP and CO2 emission in different countries. The\nfirst example showed that the perceived benefits of power (i.e., utility of\npower usage) was stronger than the power usage restrictions imposed by norms\nafter the earthquake, contrary to our expectation. The second example showed\nthat a reduction of CO2 emission in each country was not related to utility\nderived from GDP but to norms related to CO2 emission. Going forward, we will\napply this new X-point model to actual social practices involving normative\nproblems, and design the approaches for the diagnosis, prognosis and\nintervention of social systems by IT systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2020 10:14:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2020 03:54:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kato", "Takeshi", ""], ["Kudo", "Yasuyuki", ""], ["Miyakoshi", "Junichi", ""], ["Otsuka", "Jun", ""], ["Saigo", "Hayato", ""], ["Karasawa", "Kaori", ""], ["Yamaguchi", "Hiroyuki", ""], ["Deguchi", "Yasuo", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.09037", "submitter": "Takeshi Kato", "authors": "Takeshi Kato, Yasuyuki Kudo, Junichi Miyakoshi, Jun Otsuka, Hayato\n  Saigo, Kaori Karasawa, Hiroyuki Yamaguchi, Yoshinori Hiroi and Yasuo Deguchi", "title": "Sustainability and Fairness Simulations Based on Decision-Making Model\n  of Utility Function and Norm Function", "comments": "19 pages, 12 figures.
