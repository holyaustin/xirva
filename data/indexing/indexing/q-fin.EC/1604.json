On the other hand, Phillips in his fundamental paper\nused a power function in the model definition. Considering that the ordinary as\nwell as generalised Mittag-Leffler function behaves between a purely\nexponential function and a power function it is natural to implement it in the\ndefinition of the model used to describe the relation between the data\nrepresenting the Phillips curve. For the modelling purposes the data of two\ndifferent European economies, France and Switzerland, were used and an\n\"out-of-sample\" forecast was done to compare the performance of the\nMittag-Leffler model to the performance of the power-type and exponential-type\nmodel. The results demonstrate that the ability of the Mittag-Leffler function\nto fit data that manifest signs of stretched exponentials, oscillations or even\ndamped oscillations can be of use when describing economic relations and\nphenomenons, such as the Phillips curve.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 19:28:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Nov 2017 09:28:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2019 09:34:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Skovranek", "Tomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00976", "submitter": "Yaneer Bar-Yam", "authors": "Yaneer Bar-Yam", "title": "From Big Data To Important Information", "comments": "24 pages, 7 figures (Complexity, in press), New England Complex\n  Systems Institute Report 04-01-2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph nlin.AO q-bio.PE q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Advances in science are being sought in newly available opportunities to\ncollect massive quantities of data about complex systems.
