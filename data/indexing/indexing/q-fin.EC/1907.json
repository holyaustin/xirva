While international accounting standards\nfor recognizing provisions (incurred loss model) would presumably be\npro-cyclical, accentuating the effects of the current economic cycle, an\nalternative model, the expected loss model, has countercyclical\ncharacteristics, acting as a buffer against economic imbalances caused by\nexpansionary or contractionary phases in the economy. In Brazil, a mixed\naccounting model exists, whose behavior is not known to be pro-cyclical or\ncountercyclical. The aim of this research is to analyze the behavior of these\naccounting models in relation to the business cycle, using an econometric model\nconsisting of financial and macroeconomic variables. The study allowed us to\nidentify the impact of credit risk behavior, earnings management, capital\nmanagement, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) behavior, and the behavior of the\nunemployment rate on provisions in countries that use different accounting\nmodels. Data from commercial banks in the United Kingdom (incurred loss), in\nSpain (expected loss), and in Brazil (mixed model) were used, covering the\nperiod from 2001 to 2012. Despite the accounting models of the three countries\nbeing formed by very different rules regarding possible effects on the business\ncycles, the results revealed a pro-cyclical behavior of provisions in each\ncountry, indicating that when GDP grows, provisions tend to fall and vice\nversa. The results also revealed other factors influencing the behavior of loan\nloss provisions, such as earning management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jul 2019 13:12:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Araujo", "A.

Specifically, we compare\nthe multivariate normal (MVN), finite mixture of normals (F-MON) and Dirichlet\nprocess mixture of normals (DP-MON) mixing distributions. The latter promises\nto be particularly flexible in respect to the shapes it can assume and unlike\nother semi-parametric approaches does not require that its complexity is fixed\nprior to estimation. However, its properties relative to simpler mixing\ndistributions are not well understood. In this paper, we evaluate the\nperformance of the MVN, F-MON and DP-MON mixing distributions using simulated\ndata and real data sourced from a stated choice study on preferences for SAV\nservices in New York City. Our analysis shows that the DP-MON mixing\ndistribution provides superior fit to the data and performs at least as well as\nthe competing methods at out-of-sample prediction. The DP-MON mixing\ndistribution also offers substantive behavioural insights into the adoption of\nSAVs. We find that preferences for in-vehicle travel time by SAV with\nride-splitting are strongly polarised. Whereas one third of the sample is\nwilling to pay between 10 and 80 USD/h to avoid sharing a vehicle with\nstrangers, the remainder of the sample is either indifferent to ride-splitting\nor even desires it. Moreover, we estimate that new technologies such as vehicle\nautomation and electrification are relatively unimportant to travellers. This\nsuggests that travellers may primarily derive indirect, rather than immediate\nbenefits from these new technologies through increases in operational\nefficiency and lower operating costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2019 00:29:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Krueger", "Rico", ""], ["Rashidi", "Taha H.", ""], ["Vij", "Akshay", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.09855", "submitter": "Alexander Zerrahn", "authors": "Claudia G\\\"unther and Wolf-Peter Schill and Alexander Zerrahn", "title": "Prosumage of solar electricity: tariff design, capacity investments, and\n  power system effects", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze how tariff design incentivizes households to invest in residential\nphotovoltaic and battery systems, and explore selected power sector effects.
