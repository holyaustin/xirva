However, the production of hydrogen through\nelectrolysis creates interdependencies between hydrogen supply chains and\nelectricity systems. Therefore, as governments worldwide are planning\nconsiderable financial subsidies and new regulation to promote hydrogen\ninfrastructure investments in the next years, energy policy research is needed\nto guide such policies with holistic analyses. In this study, we link a\nelectrolytic hydrogen supply chain model with an electricity system dispatch\nmodel. We use this methodology for a cross-sectoral case study of Germany in\n2030. We find that hydrogen infrastructure investments and their effects on the\nelectricity system are strongly influenced by electricity prices. Given current\nuniform zonal prices, hydrogen production increases congestion costs in the\nelectricity grid by 11%. In contrast, passing spatially resolved electricity\nprice signals leads to electrolyzers being placed at low-cost grid nodes and\nfurther away from consumption centers. This causes lower end-use costs for\nhydrogen. Moreover, congestion management costs decrease substantially, by 24%\ncompared to the benchmark case without hydrogen. These savings could be\ntransferred into according subsidies for hydrogen production. Thus, our study\ndemonstrates the benefits of differentiating subsidies for hydrogen production\nbased on spatial criteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 May 2021 00:36:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Scheidt", "Frederik vom", ""], ["Qu", "Jingyi", ""], ["Staudt", "Philipp", ""], ["Mallapragada", "Dharik S.", ""], ["Weinhardt", "Christof", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.00204", "submitter": "Mikhail Freer", "authors": "Ahrash Dianat and Mikhail Freer", "title": "Credibility in Second-Price Auctions: An Experimental Test", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We provide the first direct test of how the credibility of an auction format\naffects bidding behavior and final outcomes.

Empirical evidence indicates that\nthe impacts of inter-subjective exchanges are dependent on the subjective\nmutual evaluation of the interlocutors. This paper aims to quantify, how\nsubjective evaluations of peers affect peer effects across different stages of\nPV adoption decision-making. The findings of a survey among potential and\ncurrent adopters in Germany(N=1,165)confirm two hypotheses. First, peer effects\nplay a role in residential PV adoption: the number of peer adopters in the\ndecision-maker's social circle has a positive effect on the decision-maker's\nbelief that their social network supports PV adoption; their ascription of\ncredibility on PV-related topics to their peers; and their interest in actively\nseeking information from their peers in all decision-making stages. Second,\nthere is a correlation between the perceived positive attributes of a given\npeer and the reported influence of said peer within the decision-making\nprocess, suggesting that decision-makers' subjective evaluations of peers play\nan important role in active peer effects. Decision-makers are significantly\nmore likely to engage in and be influenced by interactions with peers who they\nperceive as competent, trustworthy, and likeable. In contrast, attributes such\nas physical closeness and availability have a less significant effect. From a\npolicymaking perspective, this study suggests that the density and quality of\npeer connections empower potential adopters. Accordingly, peer consultation and\ncommunity-led outreach initiatives should be promoted to accelerate residential\nPV adoption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2021 12:48:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Scheller", "Fabian", ""], ["Graupner", "S\u00f6ren", ""], ["Edwards", "James", ""], ["Weinand", "Jann", ""], ["Bruckner", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.00939", "submitter": "Justin Loye", "authors": "Justin Loye, Katia Jaffr\\`es-Runser and Dima Shepelyansky", "title": "Post-Brexit power of European Union from the world trade network\n  analysis", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures + Supplementary Material", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI econ.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop the Google matrix analysis of the multiproduct world trade network\nobtained from the UN COMTRADE database in recent years.

This paper proposes a novel game-theoretical model\naccounting for the relationship between retailers (leaders) and consumers\n(followers) in a dynamic price environment where both players optimize their\nrespective economic goals under uncertainty. The model is solved under two\nframeworks. First by considering retailer's market power and second by\naccounting for an equilibrium setting based on a Cournot game. These are\nformulated in terms of a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints\n(MPEC) and with a mixed-integer linear program (MILP), respectively. In\nparticular, the retailers' market power model is first formulated as a bi-level\noptimization problem, and the MPEC is subsequently derived by replacing the\nconsumers' problem (lower level) with its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality\nconditions. In contrast, the Cournot equilibrium model is solved as a MILP by\nconcatenating the retailer's and consumers' KKT optimality conditions. The\nsolution sets, the practical approaches for solutions, the required techniques\nto test and compare the performance of the model are undertaken with realistic\ndata. Numerical simulations confirm the applicability and effectiveness of the\nproposed model to explore the interactions of markets power and DR programs.\nThe results confirm that consumers are better off in an equilibrium framework\nwhile the retailer increases its expected profit when the market power is\nconsidered.

Increasing attention is being paid to\nridehailing platforms and connections between demand and continuous innovation\nin service features; one of these features is dynamic ride-pooling. To\ndisentangle how ridehailing impacts existing transportation networks and its\nability to support economic vitality and community livability it is essential\nto consider the distribution of demand across diverse communities. In this\npaper we expand the literature on ridehailing demand by exploring community\nvariation and spatial dependence in ridehailing use. Specifically, we\ninvestigate the diffusion and role of solo requests versus ride-pooling to shed\nlight on how different mobility services, with different environmental and\naccessibility implications, are used by diverse communities. This paper employs\na Social Disadvantage Index, Transit Access Analysis, and a Spatial Durbin\nModel to investigate the influence of both local and spatial spillover effects\non the demand for shared and solo ridehailing. The analysis of 127 million\nridehailing rides, of which 15% are pooled, confirms the presence of spatial\neffects. Results indicate that density and vibrancy variables have analogue\neffects, both direct and indirect, on demand for solo vs pooled rides. Instead,\nour analysis reveals significant contrasting effects for socio-economic\ndisadvantage, which is positively correlated with ride-pooling and negatively\nwith solo rides. Additionally, we find that higher rail transit access is\nassociated with higher demand for both solo and pooled ridehailing along with\nsubstantial spatial spillovers. We discuss implications for policy, operations\nand research related to the novel insight on how pooled ridesourcing relate to\ngeography, living conditions, and transit interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 May 2021 21:20:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Soria", "Jason", ""], ["Stathopoulos", "Amanda", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.03562", "submitter": "Takuro Kobashi", "authors": "Takuro Kobashi, Younghun Choi, Yujiro Hirano, Yoshiki Yamagata, Kelvin\n  Say", "title": "Deeply decarbonizing residential and urban central districts through\n  photovoltaics plus electric vehicle applications", "comments": "40 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  With the costs of renewable energy technologies declining, new forms of urban\nenergy systems are emerging that can be established in a cost-effective way.\nThe SolarEV City concept has been proposed that uses rooftop Photovoltaics (PV)\nto its maximum extent, combined with Electric Vehicle (EV) with bi-directional\ncharging for energy storage.

How much is the economic loss due to MF? What will\nbe the efficiency gain if MF is prevented at the advent of a technology? We\nanswer these questions using survey data and official statistics employing\neconomic surplus model. MF incidence in sample buffaloes and cows was 19% and\n28%, respectively. Total economic losses were calculated as a sum total of\nlosses from milk production, mortality of animals and treatment costs. Yearly\neconomic loss due to MF was estimated to be INR 1000 crores (US$ 137 million)\nin Haryana. Value of milk lost had the highest share in total economic losses\n(58%), followed by losses due to mortality (29%) and treatment costs (13%).\nDespite lower MF incidence, losses were higher in buffaloes due to higher milk\nprices and market value of animals. The efficiency gain accruing to producers\nif MF is prevented, resulting from increased milk production at decreased costs\nwas estimated at INR 10990 crores (US$ 1.5 billion). As the potential gain if\nprevented is around 10 times the economic losses, this study calls for the use\nof preventive technology against MF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 May 2021 14:31:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 May 2021 11:54:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Cariappa", "A.

However, it is important to consider the issues of democracy versus\nauthoritarianism, and state fragility, when examining official Covid-19 death\ncounts in research, because these factors can influence the accurate reporting\nof pandemic deaths by governments. In contrast, excess deaths are less prone to\nvariability in differences in definitions of Covid-19 deaths and testing\ncapacities across countries. Here we use excess pandemic deaths to explore\npotential relationships between political systems and public health outcomes.\n  Methods: We address these issues by comparing the official government\nCovid-19 death counts in a well-established John Hopkins database to the\ngenerally more reliable excess mortality measure of Covid-19 deaths, taken from\nthe recently released World Mortality Dataset. We put the comparison in the\ncontext of the political and fragile state dimensions.\n  Findings: We find (1) significant potential underreporting of Covid-19 deaths\nby authoritarian governments and governments with high state fragility and (2)\nsubstantial geographic variation among countries and regions with regard to\nstandard democracy indices. Additionally, we find that more authoritarian\ngovernments are (weakly) associated with more excess deaths during the pandemic\nthan democratic governments.\n  Interpretations: The inhibition and censorship of information flows, inherent\nto authoritarian states, likely results in major inaccuracies in pandemic\nstatistics that confound global public health analyses. Thus, both excess\npandemic deaths and official Covid-19 death counts should be examined in\nstudies using death as an outcome variable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 May 2021 06:52:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Badman", "Ryan P.", ""], ["Wu", "Yunxin", ""], ["Inukai", "Keigo", ""], ["Akaishi", "Rei", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.10965", "submitter": "Demian Pouzo", "authors": "Marina Dias and Demian Pouzo", "title": "Inference for multi-valued heterogeneous treatment effects when the\n  number of treated units is small", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.EM econ.GN math.ST q-fin.EC stat.AP stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a method for conducting asymptotically valid inference for\ntreatment effects in a multi-valued treatment framework where the number of\nunits in the treatment arms can be small and do not grow with the sample size.\nWe accomplish this by casting the model as a semi-/non-parametric conditional\nquantile model and using known finite sample results about the law of the\nindicator function that defines the conditional quantile.

We\nimplemented a data-based research analysis where, for each country, we analyzed\nthe related data for fifty-six years, from 1960 to 2016, to assess the\nrelationship between the carbon emission and income level. After performing the\nrelated data analysis for each country, we concluded whether the results for\nthat country were in line with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)\nhypothesis. The EKC hypothesis suggests that the carbon emission per capita\nstarts a declining trend when the country-specific high level of income is\nreached. The results of our data analyses show that the EKC hypothesis is valid\nfor high-income countries and the declining trends of carbon emission are\nclearly observed when the income level reaches a specific high enough level. On\nthe other hand, for the non-high income countries, our analysis results show\nthat it is too early to make an assessment at this growth stage of their\neconomies because they have not reached their related high-enough income per\ncapita levels yet.

Second, the first-order condition of utility\nmax used to derive main CAPM equation should be complemented by the second one\nthat requires negative utility second derivative. Both define the amount of\nassets ${\\xi}_{max}$ that delivers max to utility. Expansions of the utility in\na Taylor series by price and payoff variations give approximations for\n${\\xi}_{max}$ and uncover equations on price, payoff, volatility, skewness,\ntheir covariance's and etc. We discuss why market price-volume positive\ncorrelations may prohibit existence of ${\\xi}_{max}$ and main CAPM equation.\nThird, we argue that the economic sense of the conventional frequency-based\nprice probability may be poor. To overcome this trouble we propose new price\nprobability measure based on widely used volume weighted average price (VWAP).\nTo forecast price volatility one should predict evolution of squares of the\nvalue and the volume of market trades aggregated during averaging interval\n${\\Delta}$. The forecast of the new price probability measure may be the main\ntough puzzle for CAPM and finance.

We believe that one of the\nfactors affecting this outcome is that that they exhibit a higher government\ndebt position in domestic currency denomination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 13:45:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tevdovski", "Dragan", ""], ["Jolakoski", "Petar", ""], ["Stojkoski", "Viktor", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.14996", "submitter": "Stefano Ghinoi", "authors": "Valdemar J.

Despite the\nimportance of these policies for the development of family farming, there is a\nlack of empirical studies investigating their impact on commercialization of\nfood products. By considering household-level data from the 2014 Brazilian\nNational Household Sample Survey, we use propensity score matching techniques\naccounting for the interaction effects between policies to compare the\ncommercialisation behaviour of recipients with non recipients. We find that\nPronaf has a significant positive impact on family farmers propensity to engage\nin commercialisation, and this effect increases if farmers have also access to\nATER. Receiving technical assistance alone has a positive effect, but this is\nmostly limited to smaller farms. In turn, seed distribution appears not to\nincrease commercialization significantly. A well balanced policy mix could\nensure that, in a country subject to the pressure of international food\nmarkets, increased commercialisation does not result in reduced food security\nfor rural dwellers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2021 14:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Junior", "Valdemar J.
