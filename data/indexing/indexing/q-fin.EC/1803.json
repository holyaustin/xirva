Two parameters depend only on the expected unit prices of\nelectricity and the distributions of prediction errors for the electricity\ndemand traded in two markets.

The\nstudy here starts by establishing a conceptual framework of technological\nevolution based on the theory of technological parasitism, in broad analogy\nwith biology. Then, the measurement of the evolution of technology is modelled\nin terms of morphological changes within complex systems considering the\ninteraction between a host technology and its subsystems of technology. The\ncoefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the grade and\ntype of the evolutionary route of a technology. This coefficient is quantified\nin real instances using historical data of farm tractor, freight locomotive and\nelectricity generation technology in steam-powered plants and\ninternal-combustion plants.
