At first we explore these relations on a global scale over the time\nperiod 1990--2008 focusing on two different dimensions of inequality: the\ncapital share of income and a Theil measure of wage inequality. In both cases,\nthe movement of inequality follows a pattern similar to the one theorized by\nKuznets in the fifties. We then narrow down the object of study ad we\nconcentrate on wage inequality within the United States. By employing data on\nwages and employment on the approximately 3100 US counties for the time\ninterval 1990--2014, we generalize the Fitness-Complexity algorithm for\ncounties and NAICS sectors, and we investigate wage inequality between\nindustrial sectors within counties. At this scale, in the early nineties we\nrecover a behavior similar to the global one. While, in more recent years, we\nuncover a trend reversal: wage inequality monotonically increases as\nindustrialization levels grow. Hence at a county level, at net of the social\nand institutional factors that differ among countries, we not only observe an\nupturn in inequality but also a change in the structure of the relation between\nwage inequality and development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2016 18:09:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sbardella", "Angelica", ""], ["Pugliese", "Emanuele", ""], ["Pietronero", "Luciano", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.03653", "submitter": "Erhan Bayraktar", "authors": "Erhan Bayraktar and Alexander Munk", "title": "High-Roller Impact: A Large Generalized Game Model of Parimutuel\n  Wagering", "comments": "Final version.
