Dematerialization fundamentally derives\nfrom ongoing increases in technical performance but it can be counteracted by\ndemand rebound - increases in usage because of increased value (or decreased\ncost) that also results from increasing technical performance. A major question\nthen is to what extent technological performance improvement can offset and is\noffsetting continuously increasing economic consumption. This paper contributes\nto answering this question by offering some simple quantitative extensions to\nthe theory of dematerialization. The paper then empirically examines the\nmaterials consumption trends as well as cost trends for a large set of\nmaterials and a few modern artifacts over the past decades. In each of 57 cases\nexamined, the particular combinations of demand elasticity and technical\nperformance rate improvement are not consistent with dematerialization.\nOverall, the theory extension and empirical examination indicate that there is\nno dematerialization occurring even for cases of information technology with\nrapid technical progress. Thus, a fully passive policy stance that relies on\nunfettered technological change is not supported by our results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 08:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""], ["Devezas", "Tessaleno C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.00159", "submitter": "Ricardo Fernholz", "authors": "Ricardo T.
