Is there, as\nmainstream economic theory asserts it, an homogeneous labor market with\nmechanisms which govern supply and demand for work, producing an equilibrium\nwith its remarkable properties? Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)\ncollected on the period 1984-2003, we study the situations of American workers\nwith respect to employment. The data include all heads of household (men or\nwomen) as well as the partners who are on the labor market, working or not.\nThey are extracted from the complete survey and we compute a few relevant\nfeatures which characterize the worker's situations. To perform this analysis,\nwe suggest using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM, Kohonen algorithm) with specific\nstructure based on planar graphs, with disconnected components (called D-SOM),\nespecially interesting for clustering. We compare the results to those obtained\nwith a classical SOM grid and a star-shaped map (called SOS). Each component of\nD-SOM takes the form of a string and corresponds to an organized cluster. From\nthis clustering, we study the trajectories of the individuals among the classes\nby using the transition probability matrices for each period and the\ncorresponding stationary distributions. As a matter of fact, we find clear\nevidence of heterogeneous parts, each one with high homo-geneity, representing\nsituations well identified in terms of activity and wage levels and in degree\nof stability in the workplace. These results and their interpretation in\neconomic terms contribute to the debate about flexibility which is commonly\nseen as a way to obtain a better level of equilibrium on the labor market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 06:17:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["C\u00f4me", "Etienne", "", "IFSTTAR/COSYS/GRETTIA"], ["Cottrell", "Marie", "", "SAMM"], ["Gaubert", "Patrice", "", "ERUDITE"]]}, {"id": "1507.00894", "submitter": "Eleonora Perversi", "authors": "Eleonora Perversi, Eugenio Regazzini", "title": "Inequality and risk aversion in economies open to altruistic attitudes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper attempts to find a relationship between agents' risk aversion and\ninequality of incomes.

The examples of intransitivity are drawn from different fields,\nsuch as law, biology, game theory, economics and competitive evolutionary\ndynamic. This work is intended as a common platform that allows us to discuss\nintransitivity in the context of different disciplines. The basic concepts and\nterms that are needed for consistent treatment of intransitivity in various\napplications are presented and analysed in a unified manner. The analysis\npoints out conditions that necessitate appearance of intransitivity, such as\nmultiplicity of preference criteria and imperfect (i.e. approximate)\ndiscrimination of different cases. The present work observes that with\nincreasing presence and strength of intransitivity, thermodynamics gradually\nfades away leaving space for more general kinetic considerations.\nIntransitivity in competitive systems is linked to complex phenomena that would\nbe difficult or impossible to explain on the basis of transitive assumptions.\nHuman preferences that seem irrational from the perspective of the conventional\nutility theory, become perfectly logical in the intransitive and relativistic\nframework suggested here. The example of competitive simulations for the\nrisk/benefit dilemma demonstrates the significance of intransitivity in cyclic\nbehaviour and abrupt changes in the system.

We investigate a simple dynamical model\nfor understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target\nand an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with\nclustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable\nregion, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a\nlocally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and\n(iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data\nputs the model in region (ii).

We propose\na criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to\nminimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family\nof leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of\nBasel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to\ncountercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.\nWe find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average\nleverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the\nfundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal\nwhen the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the\nopposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy\nis closer to constant leverage.

Wouldn't it be\ngreat if the quality of financial products became just as apparent? This paper\nis addressed to financial practitioners. It provides an informal introduction\nto Quantitative Structuring -- a technology of manufacturing quality financial\nproducts (information derivatives). The presentation is arranged in three\nparts: the main text assumes no prior knowledge of the topic; important\ndetailed discussions are arranged as a set of appendices; finally, a list of\nreferences provides further details including applications beyond product\ndesign: from model risk to economics and statistics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 16:34:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 07:05:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 13:54:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 7 Sep 2020 03:50:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Soklakov", "Andrei N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08863", "submitter": "Fabio Sabatini", "authors": "Fabio Sabatini, Francesco Sarracino", "title": "Keeping up with the e-Joneses: Do online social networks raise social\n  comparisons?", "comments": "25 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY cs.SI physics.soc-ph q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Online social networks such as Facebook disclose an unprecedented volume of\npersonal information amplifying the occasions for social comparisons. We test\nthe hypothesis that the use of social networking sites (SNS) increases people's\ndissatisfaction with their income. After addressing endogeneity issues, our\nresults suggest that SNS users have a higher probability to compare their\nachievements with those of others. This effect seems stronger than the one\nexerted by TV watching, it is particularly strong for younger people, and it\naffects men and women in a similar way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 13:05:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sabatini", "Fabio", ""], ["Sarracino", "Francesco", ""]]}]
