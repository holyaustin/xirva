The article is organized as: (I) Definition; (II)\nRegression Models; (III) Discussion. Additionally, I discovered a unique\ninteraction between GDP and GCEGI in both the short-run and the long-run and\nprovided policy makers with some suggestions. For example in the short run, GDP\nresponded positively and very significantly (0.00248) to GCEGI, while GCEGI\nreacted positively but not too significantly (0.08051) to GDP. In the long run,\ncurrent GDP responded negatively and permanently (0.09229) to a shock in past\nGCEGI, while current GCEGI reacted negatively yet temporarily (0.29821) to a\nshock in past GDP. Therefore, policy makers should not adjust current GCEGI\nbased merely on the condition of current and past GDP. Although increasing\nGCEGI does help GDP in the short-term, significantly abrupt increase in GCEGI\nmight not be good to the long-term health of GDP. Instead, a balanced,\nsustainable, and economically viable solution is recommended, so that the\nshort-term benefits to the current economy from increasing GCEGI often largely\nsecured by the long-term loan outweigh or at least equal to the negative effect\nto the future economy from the long-term debt incurred by the loan. Finally, I\nfound that non-normally distributed volatility models generally perform better\nthan normally distributed ones. More specifically, TARCH-GED performs the best\nin the group of non-normally distributed, while GARCH-M does the best in the\ngroup of normally distributed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 14:03:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 02:11:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 17 Aug 2019 05:58:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shi", "Juehui", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5452", "submitter": "Peter Sarlin", "authors": "Jozsef Mezei and Peter Sarlin", "title": "Aggregation operators for the measurement of systemic risk", "comments": "Submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.CE q-fin.EC q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The policy objective of safeguarding financial stability has stimulated a\nwave of research on systemic risk analytics, yet it still faces challenges in\nmeasurability. This paper models systemic risk by tapping into expert knowledge\nof financial supervisors. We decompose systemic risk into a number of\ninterconnected segments, for which the level of vulnerability is measured. The\nsystem is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes\nrepresent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main\nproblem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different\ninterrelated nodes of the network to obtain an estimate systemic risk. To this\nend, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating expert evaluations of\nmeasures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in\nthe aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications\nin a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a\nof pan-European set-up. Second, we estimate country-level risks, allowing for a\nmore granular decomposition. This sets a starting point for the use of the\nrich, oftentimes tacit, knowledge in policy organizations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 15:55:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 00:00:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mezei", "Jozsef", ""], ["Sarlin", "Peter", ""]]}]
