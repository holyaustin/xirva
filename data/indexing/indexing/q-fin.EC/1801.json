Many well-known\ndecision theories have been defined to help people either to make rational\ndecisions or to interpret people's behaviors, such as expected utility theory,\nregret theory, prospect theory, and so on. The paper argues that none of these\ndecision theories are designed to provide practical, normative and quantitative\napproaches for multiple mutually exclusive decisions. Different decision-makers\nshould naturally make different choices for the same decision question, as they\nhave different understandings and feelings on the same possible outcomes.The\nauthor tries to capture the different understandings and feelings from\ndifferent decision-makers, and model them into a quantitative decision\nevaluation process, which everyone could benefit from. The basic elements in\nclassic expected utility theory are kept in the new decision theory, but the\ninfluences from mutually exclusive decisions will also be modeled into the\nevaluation process. This may sound like regret theory, but the new approach is\ndesigned to fit multiple mutually exclusive decision scenarios, and it does not\nrequire a definition of probability weighting function. The new theory is\ndesigned to be simple and straightforward to use, and the results are expected\nto be rational for each decision-maker.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jan 2018 13:59:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Pengyu", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.02444", "submitter": "Robert Simon", "authors": "R.

We study\nseveral stylized facts on the distribution of Chinese firms trade and growth\nrates, and we analyze whether firms have diversified or specialized their trade\npatterns between 2000 and 2006. We show that Chinese export patterns are very\nheterogeneous, that the volatility of growth rates depends on the level of\nexports, and that volatility is stronger after trade liberalization. Both,\ndiversification in products and destinations have a positive impact on trade\ngrowth, but diversification of destinations has a stronger effect.

However, it is\nsilent about how these profiles scale with population, thus preventing\nempirical scaling studies to anchor in a strong micro-economic theory. This\npaper bridges this gap by introducing power laws for land, income and transport\ncost in the Alonso model. From this augmented model, we derive the conditions\nat which the equilibrium urban structure matches recent empirical findings\nabout the scaling of urban land and population density profiles in European\ncities. We find that the Alonso model is theoretically compatible with the\nobserved scaling of population density profiles and satisfactorily represents\nEuropean cities. This compatibility however challenges current empirical\nunderstanding of wage and transport cost elasticities with population, and\nrequires a scaling of the housing land profile that is different from the\nobserved.

To address this problem, we propose a\nnovel approach that combines a probabilistic physical damage catastrophe model\nwith a new generation of macroeconomic agent-based models (ABMs). The ABM moves\nbeyond the state of the art by exploiting large data sets from detailed\nnational accounts, census data, and business information, etc., to simulate\ninteractions of millions of agents representing \\emph{each} natural person or\nlegal entity in a national economy. The catastrophe model introduces a copula\napproach to assess flood losses, considering spatial dependencies of the flood\nhazard. These loss estimates are used in a damage scenario generator that\nprovides input for the ABM, which then estimates indirect economic losses due\nto the event. For the first time, we are able to link environmental and\neconomic processes in a computer simulation at this level of detail. We show\nthat moderate disasters induce comparably small but positive short- to\nmedium-term, and negative long-term economic impacts. Large-scale events,\nhowever, trigger a pronounced negative economic response immediately after the\nevent and in the long term, while exhibiting a temporary short- to medium-term\neconomic boost. We identify winners and losers in different economic sectors,\nincluding the fiscal consequences for the government. We quantify the critical\ndisaster size beyond which the resilience of an economy to rebuild reaches its\nlimits.
