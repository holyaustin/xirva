However, this\nmasks diverging trends in subsectors, which saw reduction in hospital based\nhiring attempts, increases towards outpatient facilities, and changes in\noccupational hiring demand shifting from medical personnel towards counselors\nand social workers. Although Medicaid expansion did not lead to any\nstatistically significant or meaningful change in overall hiring attempts,\nthere was a shift in the hiring landscape.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 05:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Scrivner", "Olga", ""], ["Nguyen", "Thuy", ""], ["Simon", "Kosali", ""], ["Middaugh", "Esm\u00e9", ""], ["Taska", "Bledi", ""], ["B\u00f6rner", "Katy", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.01142", "submitter": "Anna Denkowska", "authors": "Anna Denkowska, Stanis{\\l}aw Wanat", "title": "Linkages and systemic risk in the European insurance sector: Some new\n  evidence based on dynamic spanning trees", "comments": "JEL: G22", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is part of the research on the interlinkages between insurers and\ntheir contribution to systemic risk on the insurance market.

One probable reason for low reproducibility is\ninsufficient sample size, resulting in low power and low positive predictive\nvalue. It has been suggested that insufficient sample-size choice is driven by\na combination of scientific competition and 'positive publication bias'. Here\nwe formalize this intuition in a simple model, in which scientists choose\neconomically rational sample sizes, balancing the cost of experimentation with\nincome from publication. Specifically, assuming that a scientist's income\nderives only from 'positive' findings (positive publication bias) and that\nindividual samples cost a fixed amount, allows to leverage basic statistical\nformulas into an economic optimality prediction. We find that if effects have\ni) low base probability, ii) small effect size or iii) low grant income per\npublication, then the rational (economically optimal) sample size is small.\nFurthermore, for plausible distributions of these parameters we find a robust\nemergence of a bimodal distribution of obtained statistical power and low\noverall reproducibility rates, both matching empirical findings. Finally, we\nexplore conditional equivalence testing as a means to align economic incentives\nwith adequate sample sizes. Overall, the model describes a simple mechanism\nexplaining both the prevalence and the persistence of small sample sizes, and\nis well suited for empirical validation. It proposes economic rationality, or\neconomic pressures, as a principal driver of irreproducibility and suggests\nstrategies to change this.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Aug 2019 07:45:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Sep 2019 08:59:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2019 14:27:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 13 Feb 2020 09:22:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Braganza", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.08721", "submitter": "Anthony Strittmatter", "authors": "Anthony Strittmatter", "title": "Heterogeneous Earnings Effects of the Job Corps by Gender Earnings: A\n  Translated Quantile Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Labour Economics, 2019, 61", "doi": "10.1016/j.labeco.2019.101760", "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.EM econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Several studies of the Job Corps tend to nd more positive earnings effects\nfor males than for females.

Heavy-duty\nvehicles (HDV) emit a large share of GHG emissions in the transport sector and\nare therefore the subject of growing attention from global regulators.

Moreover, the application of green hydrogen in\ntransport could enable more effective integration of renewable energies (RE)\nacross different energy sectors. This paper explores the interplay between HDV\nHydrogen Refueling Stations (HRS) that produce hydrogen locally and the power\nsystem by combining an infrastructure location planning model and an energy\nsystem optimization model that takes grid expansion options into account. Two\nscenarios - one sizing refueling stations in symbiosis with the power system\nand one sizing them independently of it - are assessed regarding their impacts\non the total annual energy system costs, regional RE integration and the\nlevelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH). The impacts are calculated based on\nlocational marginal pricing for 2050. Depending on the integration scenario, we\nfind average LCOH of between 5.66 euro/kg and 6.20 euro/kg, for which nodal\nelectricity prices are the main determining factor as well as a strong\ndifference in LCOH between north and south Germany. From a system perspective,\ninvesting in HDV-HRS in symbiosis with the power system rather than\nindependently promises cost savings of around one billion-euros per annum. We\ntherefore conclude that the co-optimization of multiple energy sectors is\nimportant for investment planning and has the potential to exploit synergies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2019 10:26:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Kluschke", "Philipp", ""], ["Neumann", "Fabian", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.10557", "submitter": "Junnan Zhang", "authors": "Tomoo Kikuchi, Kazuo Nishimura, John Stachurski, Junnan Zhang", "title": "Coase Meets Bellman: Dynamic Programming for Production Networks", "comments": "32 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that competitive equilibria in a range of models related to\nproduction networks can be recovered as solutions to dynamic programs.
