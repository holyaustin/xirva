In particular, we focus on understanding the\ndevelopment of new risks types and the evolution of current risk types as new\ncomponents of financial institutions arise to cater for an increasing demand\nfor electronic money, micro-payment systems, Virtual money and cryptographic\n(Crypto) currencies. In particular, this paper proposes a framework of risk\nidentification and assessment applied to Virtual and Crypto currencies from a\nbanking regulation perspective. In doing so, it addresses the topical issues of\nunderstanding important key Operational Risk vulnerabilities and exposure risk\ndrivers under the framework of the Basel II/III banking regulation,\nspecifically associated with Virtual and Crypto currencies. This is critical to\nconsider should such alternative currencies continue to grow in utilisation to\nthe point that they enter into the banking sector, through commercial banks and\nfinancial institutions who are beginning to contemplate their recognition in\nterms of deposits, transactions and exchangeability for fiat currencies.\n  We highlight how some of the features of Virtual and Crypto currencies are\nimportant drivers of Operational Risk, posing both management and regulatory\nchallenges that must start to be considered and addressed both by regulators,\ncentral banks and security exchanges. In this paper we focus purely on the\nOperational Risk perspective of banks operating in an environment where such\nelectronic Virtual currencies are available. Some aspects of this discussion\nare directly relevant now, whilst others can be understood as discussions to\nraise awareness of issues in Operational Risk that will arise as Virtual\ncurrency start to interact more widely in the real economy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2014 14:22:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Chapelle", "Ariane", ""], ["Panayi", "Efstathios", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.1620", "submitter": "Yevgeniy Kovchegov", "authors": "Yevgeniy Kovchegov, Nese Yildiz", "title": "Orthogonal Polynomials for Seminonparametric Instrumental Variables\n  Model", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST q-fin.EC stat.AP stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop an approach that resolves a {\\it polynomial basis problem} for a\nclass of models with discrete endogenous covariate, and for a class of\neconometric models considered in the work of Newey and Powell (2003), where the\nendogenous covariate is continuous.

Now, assume that the\nconditional distributions of $X$ given $Z$ satisfy the conditions sufficient\nfor solving the identification problem as in Newey and Powell (2003) or as in\nProposition 1.1 of the current paper.

The recent discovery of the powerful class of zero-determinant\nstrategies in the iterated prisoner's dilemma dramatically expands our\nunderstanding of the classic game by uncovering strategies that provide a\nunilateral advantage to sentient players pitted against unwitting opponents.\nHowever, strategies in the prisoner's dilemma game are only two strategies.

Although its\nevolving structure and determinants have been widely analyzed in the\nliterature, much less has been done to understand its interplay with other\ncomplex phenomena. The aim of this work is, precisely in this direction, to\nstudy the relations of IT with International Migration (IM) and Foreign Direct\nInvestments (FDI). In both cases the procedure used is to first approach the\nproblem in a multiple-networks perspective and than deepen the analysis by\nusing ad hoc econometrics techniques. With respect to IM, a general positive\ncorrelation with IT is highlighted and product categories for which this effect\nis stronger are identified and cross-checked with previous classifications.\nNext, employing spatial econometric techniques and proposing a new way to\ndefine country neighbors based on the most intense IM flows, direct/indirect\nnetwork effects are studied and a stronger competitive effect of third country\nmigrants is identified for a specific product class. In the case of FDI, first\ncorrelations between the two networks are identified, highlighting how they can\nbe mostly explained by countries economic/demographic size and geographical\ndistance. Then, using the Heckman selection model with a gravity equation,\n(non-linear) components arising from distance, position in the Global Supply\nChain and presence of Regional Trade Agreements are studied. Finally, it is\nshown how IT and FDI correlation changes with sectors: they are complements in\nmanufacturing, but substitutes in services.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Sep 2014 17:23:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sgrignoli", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.4387", "submitter": "Valery Tabakov", "authors": "Valery Tabakov", "title": "Indicators of availability of non-market relations in the sphere of\n  labor market in Ukraine", "comments": "16 pages in Ukrainian", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are identified indicators of availability a non-market relations in the\nsphere of labor market in Ukraine.
