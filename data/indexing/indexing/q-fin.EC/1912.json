Agents may\nmanipulate the vote to achieve a better outcome by voting in a way that does\nnot reflect their true preferences. In real world voting scenarios, people\noften do not have complete information about other voter preferences and it can\nbe computationally complex to identify a strategy that will maximize their\nexpected utility. In such situations, it is often assumed that voters will vote\ntruthfully rather than expending the effort to strategize. However, being\ntruthful is just one possible heuristic that may be used. In this paper, we\nexamine the effectiveness of heuristics in single winner and multi-winner\napproval voting scenarios with missing votes. In particular, we look at\nheuristics where a voter ignores information about other voting profiles and\nmakes their decisions based solely on how much they like each candidate. In a\nbehavioral experiment, we show that people vote truthfully in some situations\nand prioritize high utility candidates in others. We examine when these\nbehaviors maximize expected utility and show how the structure of the voting\nenvironment affects both how well each heuristic performs and how humans employ\nthese heuristics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 13:38:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Scheuerman", "Jaelle", ""], ["Harman", "Jason L.", ""], ["Mattei", "Nicholas", ""], ["Venable", "K.

As such,\nincreasing forest carbon stocks by lengthening rotations is an economically\nattractive method for climate change mitigation, despite the forest damage\nrisk. Carbon pricing also increases land expectation value and reduces the\neconomic risks of the landowner. The production possibility frontier under\noptimal rotation suggests that significantly larger forests carbon stocks are\nachievable, but imply lower harvests.
