If the medical scientific\npublication system has promptly reacted to this new situation, other domains,\nparticularly in new technologies, struggle to map what is happening in their\ncontexts. The pandemic has created the need for a rapid detection of\ntechnological convergence phenomena, but at the same time it has made clear\nthat this task is impossible on the basis of traditional patent and publication\nindicators. This paper presents a novel methodology to perform a rapid\ndetection of the fast technological convergence phenomenon that is occurring\nunder the pressure of the Covid-19 pandemic. The fast detection has been\nperformed thanks to the use of a novel source: the online blogging platform\nMedium. We demonstrate that the hybrid structure of this social journalism\nplatform allows a rapid detection of innovation phenomena, unlike other\ntraditional sources. The technological convergence phenomenon has been modelled\nthrough a network-based approach, analysing the differences of networks\ncomputed during two time periods (pre and post COVID-19). The results led us to\ndiscuss the repurposing of technologies regarding \"Remote Control\", \"Remote\nWorking\", \"Health\" and \"Remote Learning\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2021 09:37:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Melluso", "Nicola", ""], ["Bonaccorsi", "Andrea", ""], ["Chiarello", "Filippo", ""], ["Fantoni", "Gualtiero", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.00233", "submitter": "Matheus E.

Becker's theory rationalizes the well-known\nphenomenon of homogamy among different-sex couples: individuals mate with their\nlikes because many characteristics, such as education, consumption behaviour,\ndesire to nurture children, religion, etc., exhibit strong complementarities in\nthe household production function. However, because of asymmetries in the\ndistributions of male and female characteristics, men and women may need to\nmarry \"up\" or \"down\" according to the relative shortage of their\ncharacteristics among the populations of men and women. Yet, among same-sex\ncouples, this limitation does not exist as partners are drawn from the same\npopulation, and thus the theory of assortative mating would boldly predict that\nindividuals will choose a partner with nearly identical characteristics.\nEmpirical evidence suggests a very different picture: a robust stylized fact is\nthat the correlation of the characteristics is in fact weaker among same-sex\ncouples. In this paper, we build an equilibrium model of same-sex marriage\nmarket which allows for straightforward identification of the gains to\nmarriage. We estimate the model with 2008-2012 ACS data on California and show\nthat positive assortative mating is weaker for homosexuals than for\nheterosexuals with respect to age and race. Our results suggest that positive\nassortative mating with respect to education is stronger among lesbians, and\nnot significantly different when comparing gay men and married different-sex\ncouples.

In this regard, the focus in academia is\nincreasingly shifting from traditional technologies to electricity consuming\nalternatives. Calculating and comparing their performance with respect to\ntraditional technologies requires conversion factors (CFs) like a primary\nenergy factor and a CO2eq intensity. These reflect the PE and CE associated\nwith each unit of electricity consumed. Previous work has shown that the\ncalculation and use of CFs is a contentious and multifaceted issue. However,\nthis has mostly remained a theoretical discussion. A stock-taking of how CFs\nare actually calculated and used in academic literature has so far been\nmissing, impeding insight into what the contemporary trends and challenges are.\nTherefore, we structurally review 65 publications across six methodological\naspects. We find that 72% of the publications consider only a single country,\n86% apply a purely retrospective perspective, 54% apply a yearly temporal\nresolution, 65% apply a purely operational (instead of a life-cycle)\nperspective, 91% make use of average (rather than marginal) CFs, and 75% ignore\nelectricity imports from surrounding countries. We conclude that there is a\nstrong need in the literature for a publicly available, transparently\ncalculated dataset of CFs, which avoids the shortcomings found in the\nliterature. This would enable more accurate and transparent PE and CE\ncalculations, and support the development of new building energy performance\nassessment methods and smart grid algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:21:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hamels", "Sam", ""], ["Himpe", "Eline", ""], ["Laverge", "Jelle", ""], ["Delghust", "Marc", ""], ["Brande", "Kjartan Van den", ""], ["Janssens", "Arnold", ""], ["Albrecht", "Johan", ""]]}]
