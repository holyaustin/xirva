We obtain an explicit\ncharacterization of the optimal wage along with the optimal action provided by\nthe agent. The optimal contract is linear by offering both a fixed share of the\noutput which is similar to the standard shutdown-free Holmstr{\\\"o}m-Milgrom\nmodel and a linear prevention mechanism that is proportional to the random\nlifetime of the contract. We then tweak the model to add a possibility for risk\nmitigation through investment and study its optimality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:36:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Jessica", "", "INSA Toulouse"], ["Villeneuve", "St\u00e9phane", "", "TSE"]]}, {"id": "2102.01800", "submitter": "Ariah Klages-Mundt", "authors": "Ariah Klages-Mundt, Andreea Minca", "title": "Optimal Intervention in Economic Networks using Influence Maximization\n  Methods", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider optimal intervention in the Elliott-Golub-Jackson network model\nand show that it can be transformed into an influence maximization problem,\ninterpreted as the reverse of a default cascade.

In fact, as the majority of the RCAs known\nnowadays are induced by RMs, the popularity of the two are apparently very much\ncorrelated.
