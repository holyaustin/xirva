We start with reduced form models incorporating liquidity as an\nadditional discount rate. We review Chen, Fabozzi and Sverdlove (2008) and\nBuhler and Trapp (2006, 2008), adopting different assumptions on how liquidity\nrates enter the CDS premium rate formula, about the dynamics of liquidity rate\nprocesses and about the credit-liquidity correlation. Buhler and Trapp (2008)\nprovides the most general and realistic framework, incorporating correlation\nbetween liquidity and credit, liquidity spillover effects between bonds and CDS\ncontracts and asymmetric liquidity effects on the Bid and Ask CDS premium\nrates. We then discuss the Bongaerts, De Jong and Driessen (2009) study which\nderives an equilibrium asset pricing model incorporating liquidity effects.\nFindings include that both expected illiquidity and liquidity risk have a\nstatistically significant impact on expected CDS returns. We finalize our\nreview with a discussion of Predescu et al (2009), which analyzes also data\nin-crisis. This is a statistical model that associates an ordinal liquidity\nscore with each CDS reference entity and allows one to compare liquidity of\nover 2400 reference entities. This study points out that credit and illiquidity\nare correlated, with a smile pattern. All these studies highlight that CDS\npremium rates are not pure measures of credit risk. Further research is needed\nto measure liquidity premium at CDS contract level and to disentangle liquidity\nfrom credit effectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2010 20:33:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Mar 2010 00:16:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Predescu", "Mirela", ""], ["Capponi", "Agostino", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2688", "submitter": "Mark Mueller", "authors": "Andrew W.
