Our target is to maximise the expected exponential utility\nof discounted dividend payments, given that the dividend rates are bounded by\nsome constant. The utility function destroys the linearity and the time\nhomogeneity of the considered problem. The value function depends not only on\nthe surplus, but also on time. Numerical considerations suggest that the\noptimal strategy, if it exists, is of a barrier type with a non-linear barrier.\nIn the related article by granditz et al., it has been observed that standard\nnumerical methods break down in certain parameter cases and no close form\nsolution has been found.\n  For these reasons, we offer a new method allowing to estimate the distance of\nan arbitrary smooth enough function to the value function. Applying this\nmethod, we investigate the goodness of the most obvious suboptimal strategies -\npayout on the maximal rate, and constant barrier strategies - by measuring the\ndistance of its performance function to the value function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 13:36:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2019 21:58:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Eisenberg", "Julia", ""], ["Kr\u00fchner", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.01987", "submitter": "Brian Hanley", "authors": "Brian P.
