We first show that if $\\tau$ is an\narbitrary random (default) time such that its Az\\'ema's supermartingale\n$Z_t^\\tau=\\P(\\tau>t|\\F_t)$ is continuous, then $\\tau$ avoids stopping times. We\nthen disprove a conjecture about the equality between the hazard process and\nthe martingale hazard process, which first appeared in \\cite{jenbrutk1}, and we\nshow how it should be modified to become a theorem. The pseudo-stopping times,\nintroduced in \\cite{AshkanYor}, appear as the most general class of random\ntimes for which these two processes are equal. We also show that these two\nprocesses always differ when $\\tau$ is an honest time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2008 22:46:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Coculescu", "Delia", ""], ["Nikeghbali", "Ashkan", ""]]}]
