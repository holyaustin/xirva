This result provides a formal explanation for earlier\nempirical results which showed that Katz-type centrality measures are closely\nrelated to contagiousness. It also allows assessing the assumptions that one is\nmaking when using such centrality measures as systemic risk indicators. I\nconclude that these assumptions should be considered too strong and that, from\na theoretical perspective, clearing models should be given preference over\ncentrality measures in systemic risk analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 13:03:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Siebenbrunner", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.05812", "submitter": "Thomas Forss Mr.", "authors": "Thomas Forss and Peter Sarlin", "title": "News-sentiment networks as a risk indicator", "comments": "28 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 4 pages appendix", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  To understand the relationship between news sentiment and company stock price\nmovements, and to better understand connectivity among companies, we define an\nalgorithm for measuring sentiment-based network risk.

We extract\nrelative sentiment for companies to get a measure of individual company risk,\nand input it into our risk model together with co-occurrences of companies\nextracted from news on a quarterly basis. We can show that the highest\nquarterly risk value outputted by our risk model, is correlated to a higher\nchance of stock price decline, up to 70 days after a risk measurement. Our\nresults show that the highest difference in the probability of stock price\ndecline, compared to the benchmark containing all risk values for the same\nperiod, is during the interval from 21 to 30 days after a quarterly\nmeasurement. The highest average probability of company stock price decline, is\nfound at a delay of 28 days, after a company has reached its maximum risk\nvalue.

Furthermore we include subordination levels, which were established in\ncollateralized debt obligations to protect the more senior tranches from high\nlosses.
