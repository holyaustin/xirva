The\nimpact of parameter imperfections on the quality of expected loss (EL) in the\nsense of a fair, unbiased estimate of risk expenses however is barely covered.\nSo far there are no established backtesting procedures for EL, quantifying its\nimpact with regards to pricing or risk adjusted profitability measures. In this\npaper, a practically oriented, top-down approach to assess the quality of EL by\nbacktesting with a properly defined risk measure is introduced. In a first\nstep, the concept of risk expenses (Cost of Risk) has to be extended beyond the\nclassical provisioning view, towards a more adequate capital consumption\napproach (Impact of Risk, IoR). On this basis, the difference between\nparameter-based EL and actually reported Impact of Risk is decomposed into its\nkey components. The proposed method will deepen the understanding of practical\nproperties of EL, reconciles the EL with a clearly defined and observable risk\nmeasure and provides a link between upcoming IFRS 9 accounting standards for\nloan loss provisioning with IRBA regulatory capital requirements. The method is\nrobust irrespective whether parameters are simple, expert based values or\nhighly predictive and perfectly calibrated IRBA compliant methods, as long as\nparameters and default identification procedures are stable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 06:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 12:39:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 13:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Reitgruber", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.5235", "submitter": "Yoshiharu Maeno", "authors": "Yoshiharu Maeno, Kenji Nishiguchi, Satoshi Morinaga, Hirokazu\n  Matsushima", "title": "Optimal portfolio for a robust financial system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "presented at the IEEE Workshop on Computational Intelligence for\n  Financial Engineering and Economics, Singapore, April 2013", "doi": "10.1109/CIFEr.2013.6611695", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study presents an ANWSER model (asset network systemic risk model) to\nquantify the risk of financial contagion which manifests itself in a financial\ncrisis.
