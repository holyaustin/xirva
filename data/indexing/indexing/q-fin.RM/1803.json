We\nstart from the Merton model which default events and losses are derived from\nthe asset values at maturity. To estimate the time development of the asset\nvalues, the stock prices are used whose correlations have a strong impact on\nthe loss distribution, particularly on its tails. These correlations are\nnon-stationary which also influences the tails. We account for the asset\nfluctuations by averaging over an ensemble of random matrices that models the\ntruly existing set of measured correlation matrices. As a most welcome side\neffect, this approach drastically reduces the parameter dependence of the loss\ndistribution, allowing us to obtain very explicit results which show\nquantitatively that the heavy tails prevail over diversification benefits even\nfor small correlations. We calibrate our random matrix model with market data\nand show how it is capable of grasping different market situations.\nFurthermore, we present numerical simulations for concurrent portfolio risks,\ni.e., for the joint probability densities of losses for two portfolios.

In\nparticular, we are concerned with abnormal cohort effects such as those for\ngenerations 1919 and 1920, for which the period tables provided by the Human\nMortality Database show particularly low and high mortality rates respectively.\nTo provide corrected tables for the three countries of interest here (France,\nItaly and West Germany), we use the approach developed by Boumezoued (2016) for\ncountries for which the method applies (France and Italy), and provide an\nextension of the method for West Germany as monthly fertility histories are not\nsufficient to cover the generations of interest. These mortality tables are\ncrucial inputs to stochastic mortality models forecasting future scenarios,\nfrom which the extreme 0,5% longevity improvement can be extracted, allowing\nfor the calculation of the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR). More precisely,\nto assess the impact of such anomalies in the Solvency II framework, we use a\nsimplified internal model based on three usual stochastic models to project\nmortality rates in the future combined with a closure table methodology for\nolder ages. Correcting this bias obviously improves the data quality of the\nmortality inputs, which is of paramount importance today, and slightly\ndecreases the capital requirement. Overall, the longevity risk assessment\nremains stable, as well as the selection of the stochastic mortality model. As\na collateral gain of this data quality improvement, the more regular estimated\nparameters allow for new insights and a refined assessment regarding longevity\nrisk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 15:46:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Balland", "Fabrice", ""], ["Boumezoued", "Alexandre", ""], ["Devineau", "Laurent", ""], ["Habart", "Marine", ""], ["Popa", "Tom", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00957", "submitter": "Dietmar Pfeifer Prof. Dr.", "authors": "Dietmar Pfeifer, Andreas M\\\"andle, Olena Ragulina and C\\^ome Girschig", "title": "New copulas based on general partitions-of-unity (part III) - the\n  continuous case (extended version)", "comments": "23 pages, 47 figures,5 tables, 9 references", "journal-ref": "Dependence Modeling (2019), 181 - 201", "doi": "10.1515/demo-2019-0009", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we discuss a natural extension of infinite discrete\npartition-of-unity copulas which were recently introduced in the literature to\ncontinuous partition of copulas with possible applications in risk management\nand other fields.

Koch (2017) introduced a notion of\nspatial risk measure and a corresponding set of axioms which are well suited to\nanalyze the risk due to events having a spatial extent, precisely such as\nenvironmental phenomena. The axiom of asymptotic spatial homogeneity is of\nparticular interest since it allows one to quantify the rate of spatial\ndiversification when the region under consideration becomes large. In this\npaper, we first investigate the general concepts of spatial risk measures and\ncorresponding axioms further and thoroughly explain the usefulness of this\ntheory for both actuarial science and practice. Second, in the case of a\ngeneral cost field, we give sufficient conditions such that spatial risk\nmeasures associated with expectation, variance, Value-at-Risk as well as\nexpected shortfall and induced by this cost field satisfy the axioms of\nasymptotic spatial homogeneity of order $0$, $-2$, $-1$ and $-1$, respectively.\nLast but not least, in the case where the cost field is a function of a\nmax-stable random field, we provide conditions on both the function and the\nmax-stable field ensuring the latter properties. Max-stable random fields are\nrelevant when assessing the risk of extreme events since they appear as a\nnatural extension of multivariate extreme-value theory to the level of random\nfields. Overall, this paper improves our understanding of spatial risk measures\nas well as of their properties with respect to the space variable and\ngeneralizes many results obtained in Koch (2017).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2018 17:11:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2018 09:20:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2018 17:10:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 22 Dec 2018 08:24:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 25 Apr 2019 13:19:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 13:09:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Koch", "Erwan", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.07590", "submitter": "Alexander McNeil", "authors": "Janine Balter and Alexander J.

From the perspective of systemic\nrisk it is important to understand the influence of this network structure on\ndefault contagion. Using sparse random graphs to model the financial network,\nasymptotic methods turned out powerful to analytically describe the contagion\nprocess and to make statements about resilience. So far, however, they have\nbeen limited to so-called {\\em rank one} models in which informally the only\nnetwork parameter is the degree sequence (see (Amini et. al. 2016) and\n(Detering et. al. 2019) for example) and the contagion process can be described\nby a one dimensional fix-point equation. These networks fail to account for a\npronounced block structure such as core/periphery or a network composed of\ndifferent connected blocks for different countries. We present a much more\ngeneral model here, where we distinguish vertices (institutions) of different\ntypes and let edge probabilities and exposures depend on the types of both, the\nreceiving and the sending vertex plus additional parameters. Our main result\nallows to compute explicitly the systemic damage caused by some initial local\nshock event, and we derive a complete characterisation of resilient\nrespectively non-resilient financial systems. This is the first instance that\ndefault contagion is rigorously studied in a model outside the class of rank\none models and several technical challenges arise. Moreover, in contrast to\nprevious work, in which networks could be classified as resilient or non\nresilient, independent of the distribution of the shock, information about the\nshock becomes important in our model and a more refined resilience condition\narises.
