The assumptions that the\nchosen put option finishes in-the-money and the constraint of hedging budget is\nbinding are relaxed in this paper. A hypothesis test is proposed to determine\nwhether the failure rate of hedging strategy is greater than the predetermined\nlevel of risk. The performances of the proposed method and the method with\nthose two assumptions are compared through simulations. The results of\nsimulated investigations indicate that the proposed method is much more prudent\nthan the method with those two assumptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2011 08:56:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Guanghui", ""], ["Xu", "Jing", ""], ["Xing", "Wenting", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0220", "submitter": "Peng Liu", "authors": "Tim Leung and Peng Liu", "title": "Risk Premia and Optimal Liquidation of Credit Derivatives", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance 2012", "doi": "10.1142/S0219024912500598", "report-no": "volume 15 issue 8 dec 2012", "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies the optimal timing to liquidate credit derivatives in a\ngeneral intensity-based credit risk model under stochastic interest rate.

This leads to a natural question of whether the\nregulatory authorities could have predicted and perhaps mitigated the current\neconomic crisis by effective computations of some stability measure of the\nbanking networks.
