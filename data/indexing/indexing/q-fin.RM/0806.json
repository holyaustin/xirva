We\ndescribe an intensity based model where the homogeneity assumption is broken by\nintroducing a random environment that makes it possible to take into account\nthe idiosyncratic characteristics of the firms. We shall see that our model\ngoes behind the identification of groups of firms that can be considered\nbasically exchangeable. Despite this heterogeneity assumption our model has the\nadvantage of being totally tractable. The aim is to quantify the losses that a\nbank may suffer in a large credit portfolio. Relying on a large deviation\nprinciple on the trajectory space of the process, we state a suitable law of\nlarge number and a central limit theorem useful to study large portfolio\nlosses.
