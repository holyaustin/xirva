We assume that the process of the firm value is\nonly observable once in a while but is strongly correlated with the stock price\nwhich is observable and tradable. This hybrid type structure make the\ntransparency \"observable\". The implication of the present study is that the\ndepth of the shock to the market caused by the precise accounting information\ndoes reflect the degree of transparency. Furthermore, it can be quantized\nresorting to the calibration method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2008 08:03:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 04:39:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Akahori", "Jir\u00f4", ""], ["Kanishi", "Yuuki", ""], ["Morimura", "Yuichi", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3209", "submitter": "Hirbod Assa", "authors": "Hirbod Assa", "title": "Convex Risk Measures: Lebesgue Property on one Period and Multi Period\n  Risk Measures and Application in Capital Allocation Problem", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we study the Lebesgue property for convex risk measures on the\nspace of bounded c\\`adl\\`ag random processes ($\\mathcal{R}^\\infty$).

We introduce\nand study the Lebesgue property for convex risk measures in the multi period\nframework. We give presentation of all convex risk measures with Lebesgue\nproperty on bounded c\\`adl\\`ag processes. To do that we need to have a complete\ndescription of compact sets of $\\mathcal{A}^1$. The main mathematical\ncontribution of this paper is the characterization of the compact sets of\n$\\mathcal{A}^p$ (including $\\mathcal{A}^1$).
