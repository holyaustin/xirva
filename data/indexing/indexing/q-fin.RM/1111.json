We define rigorously this\nprocedure and then study extensively the Gaussian Tree of quite arbitrary size\nand shape, where individual risks are normal, and where the Gaussian copula is\nused. We derive exact analytical results for the diversification benefit of the\nGaussian tree as a function of its shape and of the dependency parameters.\n  Such a \"toy-model\" of an aggregation tree enables one to understand the basic\nphenomena's at play while aggregating risks in this way. In particular, it is\nshown that, for a fixed number of individual risks, \"thin\" trees diversify\nbetter than \"fat\" trees. Related to this, it is shown that hierarchical trees\nhave the natural tendency to lower the overall dependency with respect to the\ndependency parameter chosen at each step of the aggregation. We also show that\nthese results hold in more general cases outside the gaussian world, and apply\nnotably to more realistic portfolios (LogNormal trees). We believe that any\ninsurer or reinsurer using such a tool should be aware of these systematic\neffects, and that this awareness should strongly call for designing trees that\nadequately fit the business.\n  We finally address the issue of specifying the full joint distribution\nbetween the risks. We show that the hierarchical mechanism does not require nor\nspecify the joint distribution, but that the latter can be determined exactly\n(in the Gaussian case) by adding conditional independence hypotheses between\nthe risks and their sums.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2011 12:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2011 08:51:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bruneton", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1331", "submitter": "Damiano  Brigo", "authors": "Damiano Brigo", "title": "Counterparty Risk FAQ: Credit VaR, PFE, CVA, DVA, Closeout, Netting,\n  Collateral, Re-hypothecation, WWR, Basel, Funding, CCDS and Margin Lending", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a dialogue on Counterparty Credit Risk touching on Credit Value at\nRisk (Credit VaR), Potential Future Exposure (PFE), Expected Exposure (EE),\nExpected Positive Exposure (EPE), Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA), Debit\nValuation Adjustment (DVA), DVA Hedging, Closeout conventions, Netting clauses,\nCollateral modeling, Gap Risk, Re-hypothecation, Wrong Way Risk, Basel III,\ninclusion of Funding costs, First to Default risk, Contingent Credit Default\nSwaps (CCDS) and CVA restructuring possibilities through margin lending.
