Multilayer networks,\nin their multiplex form, have been introduced within the last three years to\nanalysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have\nmodelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial\ninstitutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a\nnon-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising\nthe same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No\nmechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically\nevaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive\ncontagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an\ninterconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial\ninstitutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity\nwithin different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial\nmarket. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and\nresilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion\nmechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost\nstabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their\ninterconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion\nprogressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly\naffect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural\nresilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each\ninstitution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate\nthe new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority of the Bank of England. The capabilities of multichannel\nstabilisation are confirmed empirically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 16:44:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 15:56:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 22:34:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 03:19:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 09:10:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Serguieva", "Antoaneta", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.07218", "submitter": "Joanna D\\k{e}bicka", "authors": "Joanna D\\k{e}bicka, Beata Zmy\\'slona", "title": "Premium valuation for a multiple state model containing manifold\n  premium-paid states", "comments": "16 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1602.08696", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this contribution is to derive a general matrix formula for the\nnet period premium paid in more than one state.
