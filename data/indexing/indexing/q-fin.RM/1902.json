Two main aspects are\nconsidered: how the financial risk is distributed among the European countries\nand how large is the value of the total risk. The first aspect is evaluated by\nmeans of the expected value of a dynamic entropy measure. The second one is\nsolved by computing the evolution of the total credit spread over time.\nMoreover, the covariance between countries' total spread allows understand any\ncontagions in EU. The methodology is applied to real data of 24 countries for\nthe three major agencies: Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch. Obtained\nresults suggest that both the financial risk inequality and the value of the\ntotal risk increase over time at a different rate depending on the rating\nagency and that the dependence structure is characterized by a strong\ncorrelation between most of European countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Feb 2019 11:00:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["D'Amico", "Guglielmo", ""], ["Petroni", "Filippo", ""], ["Regnault", "Philippe", ""], ["Scocchera", "Stefania", ""], ["Storchi", "Loriano", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00706", "submitter": "Asaf Cohen", "authors": "Asaf Cohen and Virginia R.

Specifically, we prove a comparison lemma for the corresponding\nintegro-differential equation and use this comparison lemma to prove that the\nprobability of ruin for the scaled CL process converges to the probability of\nruin for the limiting diffusion process. Moreover, we show that the rate of\nconvergence for the ruin probability is of order $\\mO\\big(n^{-1/2}\\big)$, and\nwe show that the convergence is {\\it uniform} with respect to the surplus. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first rate of convergence achieved for\nthese ruin probabilities, and we show that it is the tightest one in the\ngeneral case.

Range Value at Risk (RVaR) is a\nnatural interpolation between these two prominent risk measures, which\nconstitutes a tradeoff between the sensitivity of the latter and the robustness\nof the former, turning it into a practically relevant risk measure on its own.\nAs such, there is a need to statistically validate RVaR forecasts and to\ncompare and rank the performance of different RVaR models, tasks subsumed under\nthe term 'backtesting' in finance. The predictive performance is best evaluated\nand compared in terms of strictly consistent loss or scoring functions. That\nis, functions which are minimised in expectation by the correct RVaR forecast.\nMuch like ES, it has been shown recently that RVaR does not admit strictly\nconsistent scoring functions, i.e., it is not elicitable. Mitigating this\nnegative result, this paper shows that a triplet of RVaR with two VaR\ncomponents at different levels is elicitable. We characterise the class of\nstrictly consistent scoring functions for this triplet. Additional properties\nof these scoring functions are examined, including the diagnostic tool of\nMurphy diagrams.
