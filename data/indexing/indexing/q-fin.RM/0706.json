If two firms are\ncompetitions (copartners), the default intensity of one firm will decrease\n(increase) abruptly when the other firm defaults. As time goes on, the impact\nwill decrease gradually until extinct. In this model, the joint distribution\nand marginal distributions of default times are derived by employing the change\nof measure, so can we value the fair swap premium of a CDS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jun 2007 13:44:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Yunfen", "", "1 and 2"], ["Hu", "Xinhua", ""], ["Ye", "Zhongxing", ""]]}]
