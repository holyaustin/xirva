In this respect, a better choice of the\ncopulas could be obtained through the information about the (non)symmetry of\nthe data. Exchangeability as a probability concept (first next to independence)\nhas been studied since 1930's, copulas have been studied since 1950's, and even\nthe most important class of copulas from the point of view of applications,\ni.e. the ones arising from shock models s.a. Marshall's copulas, have been\nstudied since 1960's. However, the point of non-exchangeability of copulas was\nbrought up only in 2006 and has been intensively studied ever since. One of the\nmain contributions of this paper is the maximal asymmetry function for a family\nof copulas. We compute this function for the major families of shock-based\ncopulas, i.e. Marshall, maxmin and reflected maxmin (RMM for short) copulas and\nalso for some other important families. We compute the sharp bound of asymmetry\nmeasure $\\mu_\\infty$, the most important of the asymmetry measures, for the\nfamily of Marshall copulas and the family of maxmin copulas, which both equal\nto $\\frac{4}{27}\\ (\\approx 0.148)$. One should compare this bound to the one\nfor the class of PQD copulas to which they belong, which is $3-2\\sqrt{2}\\\n\\approx 0.172)$, and to the general bound for all copulas that is $\\frac13$.\nFurthermore, we give the sharp bound of the same asymmetry measure for RMM\ncopulas which is $3-2\\sqrt{2}$, compared to the same bound for NQD copulas,\nwhere they belong, which is $\\sqrt{5}-2\\ (\\approx 0.236)$. One of our main\nresults is also the statistical interpretation of shocks in a given model at\nwhich the maximal asymmetry measure bound is attained. These interpretations\nfor the three families studied are illustrated by examples that should be\nhelpful to practitioners when choosing the model for their data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2018 09:18:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 12:19:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2019 13:22:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 13:03:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bukov\u0161ek", "Damjana Kokol", ""], ["Ko\u0161ir", "Toma\u017e", ""], ["Moj\u0161kerc", "Bla\u017e", ""], ["Omladi\u010d", "Matja\u017e", ""]]}]
