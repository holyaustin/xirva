As\nthis risk measure has to be estimated from historical data, it is important to\nbe able to verify and compare competing estimation procedures. In statistical\ndecision theory, risk measures for which such verification and comparison is\npossible, are called elicitable. It is known that quantile based risk measures\nsuch as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper we show that law-invariant\nspectral risk measures such as expected shortfall are not elicitable unless\nthey reduce to minus the expected value. Hence, it is unclear how to perform\nforecast verification or comparison. However, the class of elicitable\nlaw-invariant coherent risk measures does not reduce to minus the expected\nvalue.

In this regard, we provide a\nsummary of the role of capital adequacy in the new accord, highlighting along\nthe way the significant loss events that have been attributed to the\nOperational Risk class that was introduced in the Basel II and III accords.\nThen we provide a semi-tutorial discussion on the modelling aspects of capital\nestimation under a Loss Distributional Approach (LDA). Our emphasis is to focus\non the important loss processes with regard to those that contribute most to\ncapital, the so called high consequence, low frequency loss processes. This\nleads us to provide a tutorial overview of heavy tailed loss process modelling\nin OpRisk under Basel III, with discussion on the implications of such tail\nassumptions for the severity model in an LDA structure. This provides\npractitioners with a clear understanding of the features that they may wish to\nconsider when developing OpRisk severity models in practice. From this\ndiscussion on heavy tailed severity models, we then develop an understanding of\nthe impact such models have on the right tail asymptotics of the compound loss\nprocess and we provide detailed presentation of what are known as first and\nsecond order tail approximations for the resulting heavy tailed loss process.\nFrom this we develop a tutorial on three key families of risk measures and\ntheir equivalent second order asymptotic approximations: Value-at-Risk (Basel\nIII industry standard); Expected Shortfall (ES) and the Spectral Risk Measure.\nThese then form the capital approximations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 15:17:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Targino", "Rodrigo S.", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.5552", "submitter": "Pavlin Mavrodiev", "authors": "Paolo Tasca and Pavlin Mavrodiev and Frank Schweitzer", "title": "Quantifying the Impact of Leveraging and Diversification on Systemic\n  Risk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Excessive leverage, i.e. the abuse of debt financing, is considered one of\nthe primary factors in the default of financial institutions. Systemic risk\nresults from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot\nbe considered independent.

Portfolio diversification is used as a strategy to mitigate losses\nfrom investments in risky projects. We calculate an optimal level of\ndiversification that has to be reached for a given level of excessive leverage\nto still mitigate an increase in systemic risk. In our model, this optimal\ndiversification further depends on the market size and the market conditions\n(e.g. volatility). It allows to distinguish between a safe regime, in which\nexcessive leverage does not result in an increase of systemic risk, and a risky\nregime, in which excessive leverage cannot be mitigated leading to an increased\nsystemic risk.
