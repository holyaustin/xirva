Additionally, the\ndefault dependence of borrowers with assets and debt in different currencies\nshould be stronger than in the one-currency case. By combining well-known\nmodels by Merton (1974), Garman and Kohlhagen (1983), and Vasicek (2002) we\ndevelop simple representations of PDs and asset correlations that take into\naccount exchange rate risk. From these results, consistency conditions can be\nderived that link the changes in PD and asset correlation and do not require\nknowledge of hard-to-estimate parameters like asset value volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2007 10:39:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Tasche", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3537", "submitter": "Emmanuel Gobet", "authors": "Gr\\'egory Benmenzer (LJK), Emmanuel Gobet (LJK), C\\'eline J\\'erusalem\n  (LJK)", "title": "Arbitrage free cointegrated models in gas and oil future markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this article we present a continuous time model for natural gas and crude\noil future prices. Its main feature is the possibility to link both energies in\nthe long term and in the short term. For each energy, the future returns are\nrepresented as the sum of volatility functions driven by motions. Under the\nrisk neutral probability, the motions of both energies are correlated Brownian\nmotions while under the historical probability, they are cointegrated by a\nVectorial Error Correction Model. Our approach is equivalent to defining the\nmarket price of risk. This model is free of arbitrage: thus, it can be used for\nrisk management as well for option pricing issues. Calibration on European\nmarket data and numerical simulations illustrate well its behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2007 19:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Benmenzer", "Gr\u00e9gory", "", "LJK"], ["Gobet", "Emmanuel", "", "LJK"], ["J\u00e9rusalem", "C\u00e9line", "", "LJK"]]}]
