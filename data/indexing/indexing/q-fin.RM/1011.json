Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain\ndevelopment of future mortality intensities, or {\\it hazard rates}. In this\npaper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a\nmortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure\nendowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are\ncorrelated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment\nby assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality\nforward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality\nrisk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major\nresult of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial\ndifferential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can\nrepresent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward\nmay raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price\nwithout hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. [2009]. The market price of\nthe reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios\njointly determine the cost of hedging. We demonstrate our results using\nnumerical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 04:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Ting", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.1329", "submitter": "Serguei Pergamenchtchikov", "authors": "Serguei Pergamenchtchikov (LMRS), Zeitouny Omar (LMRS)", "title": "Ruin probability in the presence of risky investments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an insurance company in the case when the premium rate is a\nbounded non-negative random function $c_\\zs{t}$ and the capital of the\ninsurance company is invested in a risky asset whose price follows a geometric\nBrownian motion with mean return $a$ and volatility $\\sigma>0$.

We focus on a single\nrisk factor-the debt-to-asset ratio R-in order to study the stability of the\nZipf distribution of R over time. We find that the Zipf exponent increases\nduring market crashes, implying that firms go bankrupt with larger values of R.\nBased on the Zipf analysis, we employ Bayes's theorem and relate the\nconditional probability that a bankrupt firm has a ratio R with the conditional\nprobability of bankruptcy for a firm with a given R value. For 2,737 bankrupt\nfirms, we demonstrate size dependence in assets change during the bankruptcy\nproceedings. Prepetition firm assets and petition firm assets follow Zipf\ndistributions but with different exponents, meaning that firms with smaller\nassets adjust their assets more than firms with larger assets during the\nbankruptcy process. We compare bankrupt firms with nonbankrupt firms by\nanalyzing the assets and liabilities of two large subsets of the US economy:\n2,545 Nasdaq members and 1,680 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) members. We find\nthat both assets and liabilities follow a Pareto distribution. The finding is\nnot a trivial consequence of the Zipf scaling relationship of firm size\nquantified by employees-although the market capitalization of Nasdaq stocks\nfollows a Pareto distribution, the same distribution does not describe NYSE\nstocks. We propose a coupled Simon model that simultaneously evolves both\nassets and debt with the possibility of bankruptcy, and we also consider the\npossibility of firm mergers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 14:37:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Podobnik", "Boris", ""], ["Horvatic", "Davor", ""], ["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Uro\u0161evi\u0107", "Branko", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

Or do they in fact make things worse? Just like medicine regulatory\nmeasures in financial markets aim at improving an already complex system.

In\nthis paper an agent based stock market model is built that tries to find\nanswers to the questions above. In a stepwise procedure regulatory measures are\nintroduced and their implications on market liquidity and stability examined.\nParticularly, the effects of (i) a ban of short selling (ii) a mandatory risk\nlimit, i.e. a Value-at-Risk limit, (iii) an introduction of a Tobin Tax, i.e.\ntransaction tax on trading, and (iv) any arbitrary combination of the measures\nare observed and discussed. The model is set up to incorporate non-linear\nfeedback effects of leverage and liquidity constraints leading to fire sales\nand escape dynamics. In its unregulated version the model outcome is capable of\nreproducing stylised facts of asset returns like fat tails and clustered\nvolatility. Introducing regulatory measures shows that only a mandatory risk\nlimit is beneficial from every perspective, while a short selling ban - though\nreducing volatility - increases tail risk. The contrary holds true for a Tobin\nTax: it reduces the occurrence of crashes but increases volatility.\nFurthermore, the interplay of measures is not negligible: measures block each\nother and a well chosen combination can mitigate unforeseen side effects.\nConcerning the Tobin Tax the findings indicate that an overdose can do severe\nharm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 16:34:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 07:23:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kerbl", "Stefan", ""]]}]
