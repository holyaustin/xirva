The conditional expected returns exhibit\nfaster-than-exponential acceleration decorated by accelerating oscillations,\ncalled \"log-periodic power law.\" Tests on residuals show a remarkable low rate\n(0.2%) of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the\nS&P500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly\nidentifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, in Aug. 1998 and the\nITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests\nconfirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides\na diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before Oct.\n1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4 years\nearlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined\nLPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the\nlast two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical\npreference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction\nwith Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2009 17:48:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "L.", ""], ["E", "Ren R.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.0220", "submitter": "Didier Sornette", "authors": "Didier Sornette and Ryan Woodard", "title": "Financial Bubbles, Real Estate bubbles, Derivative Bubbles, and the\n  Financial and Economic Crisis", "comments": "51 pages, 25 figures, to appear in the Proceedings of APFA7\n  (Applications of Physics in Financial Analysis), Conference series entitled\n  Applications of Physics in Financial Analysis focuses on the analysis of\n  large-scale Economic data, organized by Misako Takayasu and Tsutomu Watanabe\n  http://www.thic-apfa7.com/en/htm/index.html", "journal-ref": "in Proceedings of APFA7 (Applications of Physics in Financial\n  Analysis), \"New Approaches to the Analysis of Large-Scale Business and\n  Economic Data,'' Misako Takayasu, Tsutomu Watanabe and Hideki Takayasu, eds.,\n  Springer (2010)", "doi": "10.1007/978-4-431-53853-0_6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The financial crisis of 2008, which started with an initially well-defined\nepicenter focused on mortgage backed securities (MBS), has been cascading into\na global economic recession, whose increasing severity and uncertain duration\nhas led and is continuing to lead to massive losses and damage for billions of\npeople. Heavy central bank interventions and government spending programs have\nbeen launched worldwide and especially in the USA and Europe, with the hope to\nunfreeze credit and boltster consumption. Here, we present evidence and\narticulate a general framework that allows one to diagnose the fundamental\ncause of the unfolding financial and economic crisis: the accumulation of\nseveral bubbles and their interplay and mutual reinforcement has led to an\nillusion of a \"perpetual money machine\" allowing financial institutions to\nextract wealth from an unsustainable artificial process. Taking stock of this\ndiagnostic, we conclude that many of the interventions to address the so-called\nliquidity crisis and to encourage more consumption are ill-advised and even\ndangerous, given that precautionary reserves were not accumulated in the \"good\ntimes\" but that huge liabilities were. The most \"interesting\" present times\nconstitute unique opportunities but also great challenges, for which we offer a\nfew recommendations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 May 2009 17:34:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sornette", "Didier", ""], ["Woodard", "Ryan", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.0781", "submitter": "Mikhail Voropaev", "authors": "Mikhail Voropaev", "title": "Variance-covariance based risk allocation in credit portfolios:\n  analytical approximation", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  High precision analytical approximation is proposed for variance-covariance\nbased risk allocation in a portfolio of risky assets.
