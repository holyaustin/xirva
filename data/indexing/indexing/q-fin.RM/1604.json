Repo pricing is characterized with its puzzling dual pricing\nmeasures: repo haircut and repo spread. This article develops a repo haircut\nmodel by designing haircuts to achieve high credit criteria, and identifies\neconomic capital for repo's default risk as the main driver of repo pricing. A\nsimple repo spread formula is obtained that relates spread to haircuts negative\nlinearly. An investor wishing to minimize all-in funding cost can settle at an\noptimal combination of haircut and repo rate. The model empirically reproduces\nrepo haircut hikes concerning asset backed securities during the financial\ncrisis.

On one hand, banks face potential losses whenever\ntheir counterparties are under distress and thus unable to fulfill their\nobligations. On the other hand, solvency constraints may force banks to recover\nlost fundings by selling their illiquid assets, resulting in effective losses\nin the presence of fire sales - that is, when funding shortcomings are\nwidespread over the market. Because of the complex structure of the network of\ninterbank exposures, these losses reverberate among banks and eventually get\namplified, with potentially catastrophic consequences for the whole financial\nsystem. Building on Debt Rank [Battiston et al., 2012], in this work we define\na systemic risk metric that estimates the potential amplification of losses in\ninterbank markets accounting for both credit and liquidity contagion channels:\nthe Debt-Solvency Rank. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183\nEuropean banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013, showing indeed\nthat liquidity spillovers substantially increase systemic risk, and thus cannot\nbe neglected in stress-test scenarios. We also provide additional evidence that\nthe interbank market was extremely fragile up to the 2008 financial crisis,\nbecoming slightly more robust only afterwards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 12:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Cimini", "Giulio", ""], ["Serri", "Matteo", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07042", "submitter": "Sylvia Gottschalk", "authors": "Sylvia Gottschalk", "title": "Entropy and credit risk in highly correlated markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2017.02.083", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We compare two models of corporate default by calculating the\nJeffreys-Kullback-Leibler divergence between their predicted default\nprobabilities when asset correlations are either high or low.
