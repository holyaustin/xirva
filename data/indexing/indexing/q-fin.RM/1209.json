If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to\nfail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighoring agents. Several\ncritical constellations determine whether this cascade remains finite or\nreaches the size of the system, i.e. leads to systemic risk. We investigate the\ncritical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are\ncharacterized by an individual threshold \\theta_i determining their capacity to\nhandle a load \\alpha\\theta_i with 1-\\alpha being their safety margin. If agents\nfail, they redistribute their load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular\nnetwork. For three different threshold distributions P(\\theta), we derive\nanalytical results for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a\nmeasure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops. We focus on two different\nregimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of\nthe order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal\nevent where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent.\nWe find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the\nnetwork finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold\ndistribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may\nlead to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we\ndemonstrate that the size of the \"big\" shock is not the problem, as the\nsystemic risk only varies slightly for changes of 10 to 50 percent of the\nexternal shock. Systemic risk depends much more on ingredients such as the\nnetwork topology, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which gives\nhints on how to reduce systemic risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2012 13:06:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2012 07:25:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 14:31:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Tessone", "Claudio J.", ""], ["Garas", "Antonios", ""], ["Guerra", "Beniamino", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.2298", "submitter": "Nassim N.

In response to the crisis, drastic actions have been\ntaken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because\ninterest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates\nimply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates\nalso increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If\nthere is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute\nto---rather than be caused by---default risk. Here we build a quantitative\nequilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able\nto determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show\nthat over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates\nof Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The\nrelationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the\nGreek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude\nnon-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find\nevidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According\nto the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March\n2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of\ndefault by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and\ninternational interventions.
