We\nobtain exact analytical expressions for the survival and hitting probabilities\nto a given level of return. We study several asymptotic behaviors and obtain\napproximate forms of these probabilities which prove, among other interesting\nproperties, the non-existence of a mean first-passage time. One significant\nresult is the evidence of extreme deviations --which implies a high risk of\ndefault-- when certain dimensionless parameter, related to the strength of the\nvolatility fluctuations, increases. We believe that this may provide an\neffective tool for risk control which can be readily applicable to real\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2009 16:43:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Masoliver", "Jaume", ""], ["Perello", "Josep", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2756", "submitter": "Erick Trevino Aguilar", "authors": "Erick Trevino Aguilar", "title": "Monitoring dates of maximal risk", "comments": "Working Paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Monitoring means to observe a system for any changes which may occur over\ntime, using a monitor or measuring device of some sort. In this paper we\nformulate a problem of monitoring dates of maximal risk of a financial\nposition. Thus, the systems we are going to observe arise from situations in\nfinance. The measuring device we are going to use is a time-consistent measure\nof risk.\n  In the first part of the paper we discuss the numerical representation of\nconditional convex risk measures which are defined in a space Lp(F,R) and take\nvalues in L1(G,R). This will allow us to consider time-consistent convex risk\nmeasures in L1(R).\n  In the second part of the paper we use a time-consistent convex risk measure\nin order to define an abstract problem of monitoring stopping times of maximal\nrisk. The penalty function involved in the robust representation changes\nqualitatively the time when maximal risk is for the first time identified.

The Kelly criterion offers another approach, rooted in information\ntheory, that always implies logarithmic utility. The two approaches seem\nincompatible, too loosely or too tightly constraining investors' risk\npreferences, from their respective perspectives. The conflict can be understood\non the basis that the multiplicative models used in both approaches are\nnon-ergodic which leads to ensemble-average returns differing from time-average\nreturns in single realizations. The classic treatments, from the very beginning\nof probability theory, use ensemble-averages, whereas the Kelly-result is\nobtained by considering time-averages. Maximizing the time-average growth rates\nfor an investment defines an optimal leverage, whereas growth rates derived\nfrom ensemble-average returns depend linearly on leverage. The latter measure\ncan thus incentivize investors to maximize leverage, which is detrimental to\ntime-average growth and overall market stability. The Sharpe ratio is\ninsensitive to leverage. Its relation to optimal leverage is discussed. A\nbetter understanding of the significance of time-irreversibility and\nnon-ergodicity and the resulting bounds on leverage may help policy makers in\nreshaping financial risk controls.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 18:23:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Aug 2010 16:27:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Ole", ""]]}]
