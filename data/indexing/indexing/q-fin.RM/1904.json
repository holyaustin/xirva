Measured by the expected loss under the worst-case scenario,\nfinancial risk caused by model uncertainty is regarded as a result of the\ninteraction between financial market and external information sources. This\nforms a thermodynamic picture in which a closed system interacts with an\nexternal reservoir, reaching its equilibrium at the worst-case scenario. The\nseverity of the worst-case scenario depends on the rate of heat dissipation,\ncaused by information sources reducing the entropy of the system. This\nthermodynamic picture leads to simple and natural derivation of the\ncharacterization rules of the worst-case risk, and gives its Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian forms. With its help financial practitioners may evaluate risks\nutilizing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Mar 2019 05:26:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.05422", "submitter": "Matteo Brachetta", "authors": "Matteo Brachetta and Claudia Ceci", "title": "Optimal excess-of-loss reinsurance for stochastic factor risk models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.OC q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the optimal excess-of-loss reinsurance problem when both the\nintensity of the claims arrival process and the claim size distribution are\ninfluenced by an exogenous stochastic factor.
