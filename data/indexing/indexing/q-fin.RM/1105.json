A weak formulation, using test functions\nand a probabilistic relaxation of the constraint, avoids restrictions related\nto a measurable selection but still implies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequation in the viscosity sense. We treat open state constraints as a special\ncase of expectation constraints and prove a comparison theorem to obtain the\nequation for closed state constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2011 07:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 21:05:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchard", "Bruno", ""], ["Nutz", "Marcel", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2968", "submitter": "Karol Przanowski", "authors": "Karol Przanowski", "title": "Banking retail consumer finance data generator - credit scoring data\n  repository", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents two cases of random banking data generators based on\nmigration matrices and scoring rules. The banking data generator is a new hope\nin researches of finding the proving method of comparisons of various credit\nscoring techniques.

Data are very useful for various analyses to understand in the\nbetter way the complexity of the banking processes and also for students and\ntheir researches. There are presented very interesting conclusions for crisis\nbehavior, namely that if a crisis is impacted by many factors, both customer\ncharacteristics: application and behavioral; then there is very difficult to\nindicate these factors in the typical scoring analysis and the crisis is\neverywhere, in every kind of risk reports.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 May 2011 20:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Przanowski", "Karol", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5717", "submitter": "Younes Kchia", "authors": "Robert Jarrow, Younes Kchia and Philip Protter", "title": "Is there a bubble in LinkedIn's stock price?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent academic work has developed a method to determine, in real time, if a\ngiven stock is exhibiting a price bubble.
