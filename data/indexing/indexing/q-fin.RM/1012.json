The 99.9% quantile can be considered a tail event. As\nsupported by the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan Theorem, tail events exceeding some\nhigh threshold are usually modeled by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).\nEstimation of GPD tail quantiles is not a trivial task, in particular if one\ntakes into account the heavy tails of this distribution, the possibility of\nsingular outliers, and, moreover, the fact that data is usually pooled among\nseveral sources. Moreover, if, as is frequently the case, operational losses\nare pooled anonymously, relevance of the fitting data for the respective bank\nis not self-evident. In such situations, robust methods may provide stable\nestimates when classical methods already fail. In this paper, optimally-robust\nprocedures MBRE, OMSE, RMXE are introduced to the application domain of\noperational risk. We apply these procedures to parameter estimation of a GPD at\ndata from Algorithmics Inc. To better understand these results, we provide\nsupportive diagnostic plots adjusted for this context: influence plots,\noutlyingness plots, and QQ plots with robust confidence bands.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 17:07:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Feb 2011 16:23:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2011 15:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Horbenko", "Nataliya", ""], ["Ruckdeschel", "Peter", ""], ["Bae", "Taehan", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0843", "submitter": "Adrien de Larrard", "authors": "Xin Guo, Robert A Jarrow, Adrien de Larrard", "title": "The economic default time and the Arcsine law", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops a structural credit risk model to characterize the\ndifference between the economic and recorded default times for a firm. Recorded\ndefault occurs when default is recorded in the legal system. The economic\ndefault time is the last time when the firm is able to pay off its debt prior\nto the legal default time. It has been empirically documented that these two\ntimes are distinct (see Guo, Jarrow, and Lin (2008)). In our model, the\nprobability distribution for the time span between economic and recorded\ndefaults follows a mixture of Arcsine Laws, which is consistent with the\nresults contained in Guo, Jarrow, and Lin. In addition, we show that the\nclassical structural model is a limiting case of our model as the time period\nbetween debt repayment dates goes to zero. As a corollary, we show how the firm\nvalue process's parameters can be estimated using the tail index and\ncorrelation structure of the firm's return.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Dec 2010 20:53:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Jan 2011 21:38:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Xin", ""], ["Jarrow", "Robert A", ""], ["de Larrard", "Adrien", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.4674", "submitter": "Alex Langnau", "authors": "Alex Langnau, Daniel Cangemi", "title": "Marking Systemic Portfolio Risk with Application to the Correlation Skew\n  of Equity Baskets", "comments": "Correlation skew, Systemic Risk, Merton jump model, equity basket", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The downside risk of a portfolio of (equity)assets is generally substantially\nhigher than the downside risk of its components.
