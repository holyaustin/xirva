This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of\nfinancial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both\nexogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are\namplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At the end of the\ndynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each clearing member, which\nrepresents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the\nFixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy\nwhose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two\ndifferent scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock\ncorresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default\nof the two most exposed clearing members). Although the two situations lead to\nsimilar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the\ndistress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number\nof additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results\nthus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2\nbasis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very\nconservative default funds, such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to\nthe shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a\nrefined tool for calibrating default fund amounts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 17:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Poce", "Giulia", ""], ["Cimini", "Giulio", ""], ["Gabrielli", "Andrea", ""], ["Zaccaria", "Andrea", ""], ["Baldacci", "Giuditta", ""], ["Polito", "Marco", ""], ["Rizzo", "Mariangela", ""], ["Sabatini", "Silvia", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04311", "submitter": "Giulio Cimini", "authors": "Matteo Serri, Guido Caldarelli, Giulio Cimini", "title": "How the interbank market becomes systemically dangerous: an agent-based\n  network model of financial distress propagation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Network Theory in Finance 3(1), 1-18 (2017)", "doi": "10.21314/JNTF.2017.025", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Assessing the stability of economic systems is a fundamental research focus\nin economics, that has become increasingly interdisciplinary in the currently\ntroubled economic situation. In particular, much attention has been devoted to\nthe interbank lending market as an important diffusion channel for financial\ndistress during the recent crisis. In this work we study the stability of the\ninterbank market to exogenous shocks using an agent-based network framework.\nOur model encompasses several ingredients that have been recognized in the\nliterature as pro-cyclical triggers of financial distress in the banking\nsystem: credit and liquidity shocks through bilateral exposures, liquidity\nhoarding due to counterparty creditworthiness deterioration, target leveraging\npolicies and fire-sales spillovers. But we exclude the possibility of central\nauthorities intervention. We implement this framework on a dataset of 183\nEuropean banks that were publicly traded between 2004 and 2013. We document the\nextreme fragility of the interbank lending market up to 2008, when a systemic\ncrisis leads to total depletion of market equity with an increasing speed of\nmarket collapse. After the crisis instead the system is more resilient to\nsystemic events in terms of residual market equity. However, the speed at which\nthe crisis breaks out reaches a new maximum in 2011, and never goes back to\nvalues observed before 2007. Our analysis points to the key role of the crisis\noutbreak speed, which sets the maximum delay for central authorities\nintervention to be effective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 10:01:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Serri", "Matteo", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""], ["Cimini", "Giulio", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04494", "submitter": "Bahman Angoshtari", "authors": "Bahman Angoshtari, Thaleia Zariphopoulou, Xun Yu Zhou", "title": "Predictable Forward Performance Processes: The Binomial Case", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a new class of forward performance processes that are endogenous\nand predictable with regards to an underlying market information set and,\nfurthermore, are updated at discrete times.

By comparing Pearson, Nass and likelihood-ratio tests\n(LRTs) for different numbers of VaR levels $N$ it is shown in a series of\nsimulation experiments that multinomial tests with $N\\geq 4$ are much more\npowerful at detecting misspecifications of trading book loss models than\nstandard binomial exception tests corresponding to the case $N=1$. Each test\nhas its merits: Pearson offers simplicity; Nass is robust in its size\nproperties to the choice of $N$; the LRT is very powerful though slightly\nover-sized in small samples and more computationally burdensome. A\ntraffic-light system for trading book models based on the multinomial test is\nproposed and the recommended procedure is applied to a real-data example\nspanning the 2008 financial crisis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 14:23:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kratz", "Marie", ""], ["Lok", "Yen H.", ""], ["McNeil", "Alexander J", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.06010", "submitter": "Leopoldo Catania", "authors": "David Ardia, Kris Boudt and Leopoldo Catania", "title": "Value-at-Risk Prediction in R with the GAS Package", "comments": "10 pages 1 fig 2 tab", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  GAS models have been recently proposed in time-series econometrics as\nvaluable tools for signal extraction and prediction.
