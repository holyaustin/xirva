We aim at finding marginal distributions of, and dependence between,\nlosses on the five largest lines of business (LoBs) in order to create models\nfor Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation. We try to use data in an\noptimal way by sensibly defining an accounting year loss in terms of actuarial\nliability predictions, and by pooling observations from several companies when\npossible to decrease the uncertainty about the underlying distributions and\ntheir parameters. We find that dependence between LoBs is weaker in our data\nthan what is assumed in the Solvency II standard formula. We also find\ndependence between companies that may affect financial stability, and must be\ntaken into account when estimating loss distribution parameters. Moreover, we\ndiscuss under what circumstances an insurer is better (or worse) off using an\ninternal model for SCR calculation instead of the standard formula.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2015 12:16:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Alm", "Jonas", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01126", "submitter": "Zizhuo Wang", "authors": "Pengyu Qian, Zizhuo Wang, Zaiwen Wen", "title": "A Composite Risk Measure Framework for Decision Making under Uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a unified framework for decision making under\nuncertainty. Our framework is based on the composite of two risk measures,\nwhere the inner risk measure accounts for the risk of decision given the exact\ndistribution of uncertain model parameters, and the outer risk measure\nquantifies the risk that occurs when estimating the parameters of distribution.\nWe show that the model is tractable under mild conditions. The framework is a\ngeneralization of several existing models, including stochastic programming,\nrobust optimization, distributionally robust optimization, etc. Using this\nframework, we study a few new models which imply probabilistic guarantees for\nsolutions and yield less conservative results comparing to traditional models.\nNumerical experiments are performed on portfolio selection problems to\ndemonstrate the strength of our models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 10:05:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Pengyu", ""], ["Wang", "Zizhuo", ""], ["Wen", "Zaiwen", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01573", "submitter": "Ola Mahmoud", "authors": "Ola Mahmoud", "title": "The Temporal Dimension of Risk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multi-period measures of risk account for the path that the value of an\ninvestment portfolio takes. In the context of probabilistic risk measures, the\nfocus has traditionally been on the magnitude of investment loss and not on the\ndimension associated with the passage of time. In this paper, the concept of\ntemporal path-dependent risk measure is mathematically formalized to capture\nthe risk associated with the temporal dimension of a stochastic process. We\ndiscuss the properties of temporal measures of risk and show that they can\nnever be coherent. We then study the temporal dimension of investment drawdown,\nits duration, which measures the length of excursions below a running maximum.\nIts properties in the context of risk measures are analyzed both theoretically\nand empirically. In particular, we show that duration captures serial\ncorrelation in the returns of two major asset classes. We conclude by\ndiscussing the challenges of path-dependent temporal risk estimation in\npractice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 17:47:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2015 10:38:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 14:40:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 08:54:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mahmoud", "Ola", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02007", "submitter": "Marcelo Righi", "authors": "Marcelo Brutti Righi, Paulo Sergio Ceretta", "title": "Shortfall Deviation Risk: An alternative to risk measurement", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Risk 19, 81-116, 2016", "doi": "10.21314/JOR.2016.349", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present the Shortfall Deviation Risk (SDR), a risk measure that represents\nthe expected loss that occurs with certain probability penalized by the\ndispersion of results that are worse than such an expectation.
