We investigate the\nphenomenon of a credit crisis and quantify the losses that a bank may suffer in\na large credit portfolio. Applying a large deviation principle we compute the\nlimiting distributions of the system and determine the time evolution of the\ncredit quality indicators of the firms, deriving moreover the dynamics of a\nglobal financial health indicator. We finally describe a suitable version of\nthe \"Central Limit Theorem\" useful to study large portfolio losses.

Our primary goal\nis to show that the minimal probability of ruin, whose stochastic\nrepresentation does not have a classical form as does the utility maximization\nproblem (i.e., the objective's dependence on the initial values of the state\nvariables is implicit), is the unique classical solution of its\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a non-linear boundary-value\nproblem. We establish our goal by exploiting the convex duality relationship\nbetween (a) and (b).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 21:51:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2009 20:47:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sun, 4 Apr 2010 03:53:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Sun, 22 Aug 2010 19:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Fri, 27 Aug 2010 14:43:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Jan 2008 18:11:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 19:54:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2008 04:17:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2008 13:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2009 20:45:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 16:20:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2009 16:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sat, 7 Nov 2009 12:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}]
