We characterize the existence\nand uniqueness of a valuation that maximises individual and total equity values\nfor all banks. We apply our model to the assessment of systemic risk, and in\nparticular for the case of stress-testing.

Our study suggests that, under the JLS model, equity\nand currency markets do not expect crashes or sharp rises following the\nreferendum results. Instead, rates and credit markets consider the referendum a\nrisky event, expecting either a Bremain scenario or a Brexit scenario\nedulcorated by central banks intervention.

A\nparamount example is provided by financial networks. In fact, the spreading and\namplification of financial distress in capital markets is strongly affected by\nthe interconnections among financial institutions. Yet, while the aggregate\nbalance sheets of institutions are publicly disclosed, information on single\npositions is mostly confidential and, as such, unavailable. Standard approaches\nto reconstruct the network of financial interconnection produce unrealistically\ndense topologies, leading to a biased estimation of systemic risk. Moreover,\nreconstruction techniques are generally designed for monopartite networks of\nbilateral exposures between financial institutions, thus failing in reproducing\nbipartite networks of security holdings (\\eg, investment portfolios). Here we\npropose a reconstruction method based on constrained entropy maximization,\ntailored for bipartite financial networks. Such a procedure enhances the\ntraditional {\\em capital-asset pricing model} (CAPM) and allows to reproduce\nthe correct topology of the network. We test this ECAPM method on a dataset,\ncollected by the European Central Bank, of detailed security holdings of\nEuropean institutional sectors over a period of six years (2009-2015). Our\napproach outperforms the traditional CAPM and the recently proposed MECAPM both\nin reproducing the network topology and in estimating systemic risk due to\nfire-sales spillovers. In general, ECAPM can be applied to the whole class of\nweighted bipartite networks described by the fitness model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 13:54:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:27:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:57:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Squartini", "Tiziano", ""], ["Almog", "Assaf", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""], ["van Lelyveld", "Iman", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""], ["Cimini", "Giulio", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.08984", "submitter": "Johan Andreasson", "authors": "Johan G.

We account for mortality risk and\nrisky investment assets, and introduce a health proxy to capture the decreasing\nlevel of consumption for older retirees. Then we find optimal housing at\nretirement, and optimal consumption and optimal risky asset allocation\ndepending on age and wealth. The model is solved numerically as a stochastic\ncontrol problem, and is calibrated using the maximum likelihood method on\nempirical data of consumption and housing from the Australian Bureau of\nStatistics 2009-2010 Survey. The model fits the characteristics of the data\nwell to explain the behavior of Australian retirees. The key findings are the\nfollowing: First, the optimal policy is highly sensitive to means-tested Age\nPension early in retirement but this sensitivity fades with age. Secondly, the\nallocation to risky assets shows a complex relationship with the means-tested\nAge Pension that disappears once minimum withdrawal rules are enforced. As a\ngeneral rule, when wealth decreases the proportion allocated to risky assets\nincreases, due to the Age Pension working as a buffer against investment\nlosses. Finally, couples can be more aggressive with risky allocations due to\ntheir longer life expectancy compared with singles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 07:32:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Andreasson", "Johan G.", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""], ["Novikov", "Alex", ""]]}]
