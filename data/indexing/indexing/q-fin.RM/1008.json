Random contractions appear naturally in\ninsurance and finance. Our principal contribution is the derivation of the tail\nasymptotics of $X$ assuming that $F$ is in the max-domain of attraction of an\nextreme value distribution and the distribution function of $S$ satisfies a\nregular variation property. We apply our result to derive the asymptotics of\nthe probability of ruin for a particular discrete-time risk model. Further we\nquantify in our asymptotic setting the effect of the random scaling on the\nConditional Tail Expectations, risk aggregation, and derive the joint\nasymptotic distribution of linear combinations of random contractions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jul 2010 21:50:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Hashorva", "Enkelejd", ""], ["Pakes", "Anthony G.", ""], ["Tang", "Qihe", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1032", "submitter": "Abhimanyu Mitra", "authors": "Abhimanyu Mitra and Sidney I.

This property, usually called\nloading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature.\nThe increased interest in constructing new insurance premiums has raised a\nquestion as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums.\nIn this paper we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity in\nanswering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the\nloading monotonicity of a number of well-known insurance premiums and offer a\nhost of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus\nillustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing\nloading-monotonic insurance premiums.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Aug 2010 02:25:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sendov", "Hristo S.", ""], ["Wang", "Ying", ""], ["Zitikis", "Ricardas", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.3718", "submitter": "William Shaw", "authors": "William T.

In this first paper we explore the need\nfor more general optimization tools, and consider the means by which\nconstrained random portfolios may be generated. A practical scheme for the\nlong-only fully-invested problem is developed and tested for the classic QP\napplication. The advantage of Monte Carlo methods is that they may be extended\nto risk functions that are more complicated functions of the return\ndistribution, and that the underlying return distribution may be computed\nwithout the classical Gaussian limitations. The optimization of quadratic\nrisk-return functions, VaR, CVaR, may be handled in a similar manner to\nvariability ratios such as Sortino and Omega, or mathematical constructions\nsuch as expected utility and its behavioural finance extensions.\nRobustification is also possible. Grid computing technology is an excellent\nplatform for the development of such computations due to the intrinsically\nparallel nature of the computation, coupled to the requirement to transmit only\nsmall packets of data over the grid. We give some examples deploying\nGridMathematica, in which various investor risk preferences are optimized with\ndiffering multivariate distributions. Good comparisons with established results\nin Mean-Variance and CVaR optimization are obtained when ``edge-vertex-biased''\nsampling methods are employed to create random portfolios. We also give an\napplication to Omega optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Aug 2010 19:35:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.3746", "submitter": "Takashi Shinzato", "authors": "Takashi Shinzato and Muneki Yasuda", "title": "Belief Propagation Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization Problems", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures, to submit to EPL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0134968", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG math.OC q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The typical behavior of optimal solutions to portfolio optimization problems\nwith absolute deviation and expected shortfall models using replica analysis\nwas pioneeringly estimated by S.
