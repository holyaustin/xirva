We demonstrate that\nthe comonotonic setting provides a lower bound and Jensen's inequality provides\nan upper bound to the price of debt under Eisenberg-Noe financial networks with\nbankruptcy costs. Such financial networks encode the interconnection of firms\nthrough debt claims. The proposed pricing formulas consider the realized,\nendogenous, recovery rate on debt claims. Special consideration is given to the\nCAPM setting in which firms invest in correlated portfolios so as to provide\nanalytical stress testing formulas.

The existing scoring\napproaches focus on only either probability of default (PD) prediction, known\nas credit scoring, or profitability prediction, known as profit scoring, to\nidentify the best loans for investment. Credit scoring fails to deliver the\nmain need of lenders on how much profit they may obtain through their\ninvestment. On the other hand, profit scoring can satisfy that need by\npredicting the investment profitability. However, profit scoring completely\nignores the class imbalance problem where most of the past loans are\nnon-default. Consequently, ignorance of the class imbalance problem\nsignificantly affects the accuracy of profitability prediction. Our proposed\ntwo-stage scoring approach is an integration of credit scoring and profit\nscoring to address the above challenges. More specifically, stage 1 is designed\nas credit scoring to identify non-default loans while the imbalanced nature of\nloan status is considered in PD prediction. The loans identified as non-default\nare then moved to stage 2 for prediction of profitability, measured by internal\nrate of return. Wide and deep learning is used to build the predictive models\nin both stages to achieve both memorization and generalization. Extensive\nnumerical studies are conducted based on real-world data to verify the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach. The numerical studies indicate our\ntwo-stage scoring approach outperforms the existing credit scoring and profit\nscoring approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Oct 2018 00:54:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 02:03:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bastani", "Kaveh", ""], ["Asgari", "Elham", ""], ["Namavari", "Hamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.04978", "submitter": "Zachary Feinstein", "authors": "Zachary Feinstein and Birgit Rudloff", "title": "Time consistency for scalar multivariate risk measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present results on dynamic multivariate scalar risk\nmeasures, which arise in markets with transaction costs and systemic risk. Dual\nrepresentations of such risk measures are presented. These are then used to\nobtain the main results of this paper on time consistency; namely, an\nequivalent recursive formulation of multivariate scalar risk measures to\nmultiportfolio time consistency. We are motivated to study time consistency of\nmultivariate scalar risk measures as the superhedging risk measure in markets\nwith transaction costs (with a single eligible asset) (Jouini and Kallal\n(1995), Roux and Zastawniak (2016), Loehne and Rudloff (2014)) does not satisfy\nthe usual scalar concept of time consistency. In fact, as demonstrated in\n(Feinstein and Rudloff (2020)), scalar risk measures with the same\nscalarization weight at all times would not be time consistent in general. The\ndeduced recursive relation for the scalarizations of multiportfolio time\nconsistent set-valued risk measures provided in this paper requires\nconsideration of the entire family of scalarizations. In this way we develop a\ndirect notion of a \"moving scalarization\" for scalar time consistency that\ncorroborates recent research on scalarizations of dynamic multi-objective\nproblems (Karnam, Ma, and Zhang (2017), Kovacova and Rudloff (2020)).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2018 12:26:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 21:09:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2019 17:08:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 11:48:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Feinstein", "Zachary", ""], ["Rudloff", "Birgit", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.07457", "submitter": "Volodymyr Perederiy", "authors": "Volodymyr Perederiy", "title": "Vanna-Volga Method for Normal Volatilities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vanna-Volga is a popular method for the interpolation/extrapolation of\nvolatility smiles. The technique is widely used in the FX markets context, due\nto its ability to consistently construct the entire Lognormal smile using only\nthree Lognormal market quotes. However, the derivation of the Vanna-Volga\nmethod itself is free of distributional assumptions. With this is mind, it is\nsurprising there have been no attempts to apply the method to Normal\nvolatilities (the current standard for interest rate markets). We show how the\nmethod can be modified to build Normal volatility smiles. As it turns out, only\nminor modifications are required compared to the Lognormal case. Moreover, as\nthe inversion of Normal volatilities from option prices is easier in the Normal\ncase, the smile construction can occur at a machine-precision level using\nanalytical formulae, making the approximations via Taylor-series unnecessary.\nApart from being based on practical and intuitive hedging arguments, the\nVanna-Volga has further important advantages. In comparison to the Normal SABR\nmodel, the Vanna-Volga can easily fit both classical convex and atypical\nconcave smiles (frowns). Concave smile patterns are sometimes observed around\nATM strikes in the interest rate markets, particularly in the situations of\nanticipated jumps (with an unclear outcome) in interest rates. Besides,\nconcavity is often observed towards the lower/left end of the Normal volatility\nsmiles of interest rates. At least in these situations, the Vanna-Volga can be\nexpected to interpolate/extrapolate better than SABR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Oct 2018 10:17:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2020 03:26:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Perederiy", "Volodymyr", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.09112", "submitter": "Erik Schlogl", "authors": "Yu Feng, Ralph Rudd, Christopher Baker, Qaphela Mashalaba, Melusi\n  Mavuso, Erik Schl\\\"ogl", "title": "Quantifying the Model Risk Inherent in the Calibration and Recalibration\n  of Option Pricing Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We focus on two particular aspects of model risk: the inability of a chosen\nmodel to fit observed market prices at a given point in time (calibration\nerror) and the model risk due to recalibration of model parameters (in\ncontradiction to the model assumptions).
