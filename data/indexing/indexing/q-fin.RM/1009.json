However, there are two\nsignificant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same\nsource, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first\nomission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An\nexample is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically\nwritten down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The\nsecond omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are\nout of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require\nfunding that cannot be secured using the position itself. These contingent\nfuture funding positions are usually not booked in any position-keeping system.\nWe show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to\ncomplete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.\n  For a particular large complex financial institution that profited $2.5B from\nspread widening we show that including Goodwill would have resulted in a $4B\nloss under conservative assumptions.

We propose a three\ndimensional (3D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently\nthe reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts\nof it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods\nfor the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an\npractitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical actuarial reserve models are two\ndimensional (2D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2D\nmatrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or\nthe Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and\ngive rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some\nof them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no\ninformation about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most\nimportant for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial\nstability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the\nclaim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted\nand dependent on the kind of projection.
