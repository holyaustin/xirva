We obtain\ntwo such theorems by considering a financial market both with and without a\nriskless asset for random consumption. The striking result is that we obtain\ntwo-fund theorems despite the additional source of randomness from consumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 01:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2007 04:22:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2008 21:14:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3760", "submitter": "Alexandre Popier", "authors": "Stefan Ankirchner, Peter Imkeller, Alexandre Popier", "title": "Optimal cross hedging for insurance derivatives", "comments": "27 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.OC math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": null, "abstract": "  We consider insurance derivatives depending on an external physical risk\nprocess, for example a temperature in a low dimensional climate model. We\nassume that this process is correlated with a tradable financial asset. We\nderive optimal strategies for exponential utility from terminal wealth,\ndetermine the indifference prices of the derivatives, and interpret them in\nterms of diversification pressure. Moreover we check the optimal investment\nstrategies for standard admissibility criteria. Finally we compare the static\nrisk connected with an insurance derivative to the reduced risk due to a\ndynamic investment into the correlated asset. We show that dynamic hedging\nreduces the risk aversion in terms of entropic risk measures by a factor\nrelated to the correlation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2007 13:01:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ankirchner", "Stefan", ""], ["Imkeller", "Peter", ""], ["Popier", "Alexandre", ""]]}]
