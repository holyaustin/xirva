Due to unexpected and abrupt decline of asset values, a bank must\nclosely monitor its net worth as well as market conditions, and one of its\nimportant concerns is when to raise more capital so as not to violate capital\nadequacy requirements. In this paper, we model the tradeoff between avoiding\ncosts of delay and premature capital raising, and solve the corresponding\noptimal stopping problem. In order to model defaults in a bank's loan/credit\nbusiness portfolios, we represent its net worth by Levy processes, and solve\nexplicitly for the double exponential jump diffusion process and for a general\nspectrally negative Levy process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2010 08:53:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 01:07:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2011 11:21:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Egami", "Masahiko", ""], ["Yamazaki", "Kazutoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.0685", "submitter": "Sergey Ivliev", "authors": "Sergey Ivliev", "title": "Simple Fuzzy Score for Russian Public Companies Risk of Default", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The model is aimed to discriminate the 'good' and the 'bad' companies in\nRussian corporate sector based on their financial statements data based on\nRussian Accounting Standards.

In this context, a novel numerical procedure utilising Markov chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC), ABC and a Bayesian bootstrap procedure was developed in a\ntruly distribution-free setting. The ABC methodology arises because we work in\na distribution-free setting in which we make no parametric assumptions, meaning\nwe can not evaluate the likelihood point-wise or in this case simulate directly\nfrom the likelihood model. The use of a bootstrap procedure allows us to\ngenerate samples from the intractable likelihood without the requirement of\ndistributional assumptions, this is crucial to the ABC framework. The developed\nmethodology is used to obtain the empirical distribution of the DFCL model\nparameters and the predictive distribution of the outstanding loss liabilities\nconditional on the observed claims. We then estimate predictive Bayesian\ncapital estimates, the Value at Risk (VaR) and the mean square error of\nprediction (MSEP).
