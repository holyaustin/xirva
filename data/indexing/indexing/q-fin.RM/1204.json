Under leverage the problem is particularly dramatic: due to\nthe concave form of market impact, selling always initially causes the expected\nleverage to increase. There is a critical leverage above which it is impossible\nto exit a portfolio without leverage going to infinity and bankruptcy becoming\nlikely. Standard risk-management methods give no warning of this problem, which\neasily occurs for aggressively leveraged positions in illiquid markets. We\npropose an alternative accounting procedure based on the estimated market\nimpact of liquidation that removes the illusion of profit. This should curb the\nleverage cycle and contribute to an enhanced stability of financial markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 11:13:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2012 08:03:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
