For what we call the infimum of expectations class of\nrisk measures, we show that if the decision maker (DM) maximizes the\nexpectation of a random return under constraint that the risk measure is\nbounded above, he then behaves as a ``generalized expected utility maximizer''\nin the following sense. The DM exhibits ambiguity with respect to a family of\nutility functions defined on a larger set of decisions than the original one;\nhe adopts pessimism and performs first a minimization of expected utility over\nthis family, then performs a maximization over a new decisions set. This\neconomic behaviour is called ``Maxmin under risk'' and studied by Maccheroni\n(2002). This economic interpretation allows us to exhibit a loss aversion\nfactor when the risk measure is the Conditional Value-at-Risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2009 12:22:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Andrieu", "Laetitia", "", "EDF R&D"], ["De Lara", "Michel", "", "CERMICS"], ["Seck", "Babacar", "", "CERMICS"]]}, {"id": "0906.3841", "submitter": "Austin Gerig", "authors": "Austin Gerig, Javier Vicente, Miguel A.

Here, we present a model\nthat explains the shape and scaling of the distribution of intraday stock price\nfluctuations (called intraday returns) and verify the model using a large\ndatabase for several stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange. We provide\nevidence that the return distribution for these stocks is non-Gaussian and\nsimilar in shape, and that the distribution appears stable over intraday time\nscales. We explain these results by assuming the volatility of returns is\nconstant intraday, but varies over longer periods such that its inverse square\nfollows a gamma distribution. This produces returns that are Student\ndistributed for intraday time scales. The predicted results show excellent\nagreement with the data for all stocks in our study and over all regions of the\nreturn distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Jun 2009 06:36:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 11:04:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gerig", "Austin", ""], ["Vicente", "Javier", ""], ["Fuentes", "Miguel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3968", "submitter": "Marco Bardoscia", "authors": "V.

The algorithm allows the construction of a\nBayesian Network targeted for each bank using only internal loss data, and\ntakes into account in a simple and realistic way the correlations among\ndifferent processes of the bank. The internal losses are averaged over a\nvariable time horizon, so that the correlations at different times are removed,\nwhile the correlations at the same time are kept: the averaged losses are thus\nsuitable to perform the learning of the network topology and parameters. The\nalgorithm has been validated on synthetic time series.
