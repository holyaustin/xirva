We find that the existence of the optimum is a\nprobabilistic issue, depending on the particular random sample, in all three\ncases. At a critical combination of the parameters of these problems we find an\nalgorithmic phase transition, separating the phase where the optimization is\nfeasible from the one where it is not. This transition is similar to the one\ndiscovered earlier for Expected Shortfall based on historical time series. We\nemploy the replica method to compute the phase diagram, as well as to obtain\nthe critical exponent of the estimation error that diverges at the critical\npoint. The analytical results are corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2008 19:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 16 Nov 2008 15:40:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Varga-Haszonits", "Istvan", ""], ["Kondor", "Imre", ""]]}]
