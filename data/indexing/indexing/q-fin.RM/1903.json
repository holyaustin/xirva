We prove that it is\nstrongly consistent and asymptotically normal. We compare the finite sample\nperformance of our proposed kernel estimator with that of several existing\nestimators for different SRMs using Monte Carlo simulation. We observe that our\nproposed kernel estimator outperforms all the estimators.

The instantaneous and continuous matching of power supply with demand\nis a key factor explaining its volatility. During periods of high demand,\ncostlier generation capabilities are utilised since electricity cannot be\nstored and this has the impact of driving prices up very quickly. Furthermore,\nthe non-storability also complicates physical hedging. Owing to these, the\nproblem of joint price-quantity risk in electricity markets is a commonly\nstudied theme.\n  We propose using Gaussian Processes (GPs) to tackle this problem since GPs\nprovide a versatile and elegant non-parametric approach for regression and\ntime-series modelling. However, GPs scale poorly with the amount of training\ndata due to a cubic complexity. These considerations suggest that knowledge\ntransfer between price and load is vital for effective hedging, and that a\ncomputationally efficient method is required. To this end, we use the\ncoregionalized (or multi-task) sparse GPs which addresses the aforementioned\nissues.\n  To gauge the performance of our model, we use an average-load strategy as\ncomparator. The latter is a robust approach commonly used by industry. If the\nspot and load are uncorrelated and Gaussian, then hedging with the expected\nload will result in the minimum variance position.\n  Our main contributions are twofold.
