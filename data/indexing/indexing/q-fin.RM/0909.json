The distributions of recurrence intervals for positive\nand negative thresholds are symmetric, and display power-law tails tested by\nthree goodness-of-fit measures including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic,\nthe weighted KS statistic and the Cram\\'er-von Mises criterion. Both long-term\nand shot-term memory effects are observed in the recurrence intervals for\npositive and negative thresholds $q$. We further apply the recurrence interval\nanalysis to the risk estimation for the Chinese stock markets based on the\nprobability $W_q(\\Delta{t},t)$, Value-at-Risk (VaR) analysis and VaR analysis\nconditioned on preceding recurrence intervals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 08:32:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "Fei", ""], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1383", "submitter": "Dan Shiber", "authors": "Ivailo I.

The only ingredient required by our approach is the\nknowledge of the characteristic function describing the financial data in use.\nThis allows to extend risk analysis to those non-Gaussian models defined in the\nFourier space, such as Levy noise driven processes and stochastic volatility\nmodels. We test our analytical results on data sets coming from various\nfinancial indexes, finding that our predictions outperform those provided by\nthe standard Log-Normal dynamics and are in remarkable agreement with those of\nthe benchmark historical approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 12:33:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2012 17:36:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "G.", ""], ["Cazzola", "V.", ""], ["Livan", "G.", ""], ["Montagna", "G.", ""], ["Nicrosini", "O.", ""]]}]
