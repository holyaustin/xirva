All this changes when the funds are\nallowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than\ntheir wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives\ninvestors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As\nleverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered\nvolatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations\nof fat tails and clustered volatility depended on \"irrational behavior\", such\nas trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits\ncause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally\nsafer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage\nlimit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately\nthis sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is\nalready falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward\nprice movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at\nevery time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard\n(supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks\nbase leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of\nlow volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making\nthese extreme fluctuations even worse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2009 18:31:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jan 2010 14:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Thurner", "Stefan", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

We introduce the \"quasi-unbiased estimators\", that can address any\ntype of desirable constraints. The main tool of our theory is the parsimonious\nencoding of all the information contained in the OHLC prices for a given time\ninterval in the form of the joint distributions of the high-minus-open,\nlow-minus-open and close-minus-open values, whose analytical expression is\nderived exactly for Wiener processes with drift.
