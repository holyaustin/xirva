We propose an\nefficient message-passing algorithm to explore the space of possible network\nstructures, and show that a correct estimation of the network degree of\nconnectedness leads to more reliable estimations for systemic risk. Such\nalgorithm is also able to produce maximally fragile structures, providing a\npractical upper bound for the risk of contagion when the actual network\nstructure is unknown. We test our algorithm on ensembles of synthetic data\nencoding some features of real financial networks (sparsity and heterogeneity),\nfinding that more accurate estimations of risk can be achieved. Finally we find\nthat this algorithm can be used to control the amount of information regulators\nneed to require from banks in order to sufficiently constrain the\nreconstruction of financial networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Sep 2011 14:00:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 17:52:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mastromatteo", "Iacopo", ""], ["Zarinelli", "Elia", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""]]}]
