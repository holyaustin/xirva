Based on the criterion of\nminimizing the variance of Monte Carlo estimator within a parametric family, we\npropose a general account for finding the optimal tilting measure. To this end,\nwhen the moment generating function of the underlying distribution exists, we\nobtain a simple and explicit expression of the optimal alternative\ndistribution. The proposed algorithm is quite general to cover many interesting\nexamples, such as normal distribution, noncentral $\\chi^2$ distribution, and\ncompound Poisson processes. To illustrate the broad applicability of our\nmethod, we study value-at-risk (VaR) computation in financial risk management\nand bootstrap confidence regions in statistical inferences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Feb 2013 05:03:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Fuh", "Cheng-Der", ""], ["Teng", "Huei-Wen", ""], ["Wang", "Ren-Her", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.2063", "submitter": "Tiziano Squartini", "authors": "Tiziano Squartini, Iman van Lelyveld, Diego Garlaschelli", "title": "Early-warning signals of topological collapse in interbank networks", "comments": "28 pages, 23 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Sci.

However, the interplay between financial distress and\ntopological changes is still poorly understood. Here we analyze the quarterly\ninterbank exposures among Dutch banks over the period 1998-2008, ending with\nthe crisis. After controlling for the link density, many topological properties\ndisplay an abrupt change in 2008, providing a clear - but unpredictable -\nsignature of the crisis. By contrast, if the heterogeneity of banks'\nconnectivity is controlled for, the same properties show a gradual transition\nto the crisis, starting in 2005 and preceded by an even earlier period during\nwhich anomalous debt loops could have led to the underestimation of\ncounter-party risk. These early-warning signals are undetectable if the network\nis reconstructed from partial bank-specific data, as routinely done. We discuss\nimportant implications for bank regulatory policies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 15:17:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 10:10:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2013 20:26:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:51:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Squartini", "Tiziano", ""], ["van Lelyveld", "Iman", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.3654", "submitter": "Hyong-Chol O", "authors": "Hyong-Chol O, Jong-Jun Jo and Chol-Ho Kim", "title": "Pricing Corporate Defaultable Bond using Declared Firm Value", "comments": "12 pages, version 5 is written in tex and accepted in\n  EJMAA(Electronic Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications)", "journal-ref": "Electronic Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications,\n  Vol.2(1),Jan 2014,1-11", "doi": null, "report-no": "KISU-MATH-2011-E-R-001", "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the pricing problem for corporate defaultable bond from the\nviewpoint of the investors outside the firm that could not exactly know about\nthe information of the firm.
