In this paper we\nconsider systemic risk due to fire sales spillover and portfolio rebalancing by\nusing the risk metrics defined by Greenwood et al. (2015). By using the Maximum\nEntropy principle we propose a method to assess aggregated and single bank's\nsystemicness and vulnerability and to statistically test for a change in these\nvariables when only the information on the size of each bank and the\ncapitalization of the investment assets are available. We prove the\neffectiveness of our method on 2001-2013 quarterly data of US banks for which\nportfolio composition is available.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 09:05:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 21:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Di Gangi", "Domenico", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Pirino", "Davide", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09133", "submitter": "Ying Jiao", "authors": "Nicole El Karoui (LPMA), Monique Jeanblanc (LaMME), Ying Jiao (SAF)", "title": "Dynamics of multivariate default system in random environment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a multivariate default system where random environmental\ninformation is available.
