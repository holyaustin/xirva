This means that when there are few\nmembers in the scheme, there is an increased risk of the liability value\ndeviating significantly from the expected liability value, as compared to a\nlarge scheme.\n  We quantify this risk through examining the coefficient of variation of a\nscheme's liability value relative to its expected value. We examine how the\ncoefficient of variation varies with the number of members and find that, even\nwith a few hundred members in the scheme, idiosyncratic mortality risk may\nstill be significant. Using a stochastic mortality model reduces the\nidiosyncratic mortality risk but at the cost of increasing the overall\nmortality risk in the scheme.\n  Next we quantify the amount of the mortality risk concentrated in the\nexecutive section of the scheme, where the executives receive a benefit that is\nhigher than the non-executive benefit. We use the Euler capital allocation\nprinciple to allocate the total standard deviation of the liability value\nbetween the executive and non-executive sections. We find that the proportion\nof the standard deviation allocated to the executive section is higher than is\nsuggested by an allocation based on the members' benefit amounts. While the\nresults are sensitive to the choice of mortality model, they do suggest that\nthe mortality risk of the scheme should be monitored and managed within the\nsections of a scheme, and not only on a scheme-wide basis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 13:44:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 10:55:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 07:26:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2011 09:18:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Donnelly", "Catherine", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.2164", "submitter": "Mikhail Voropaev", "authors": "Mikhail Voropaev", "title": "KISS approach to credit portfolio modeling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple, yet reasonably accurate, analytical technique is proposed for\nmulti-factor structural credit portfolio models.
