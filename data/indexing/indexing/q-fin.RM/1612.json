An\norder parameter is introduced to quantify the level of synchronization which is\nshown a function of percentage of agents in reactive state. Further,\nsynchronization is shown to be driven by the most active agents with the\nhighest volatility. A tipping point is identified when crowd becomes\nself-amplifying and unstable. By applying this model, financial bubbles, market\nmomentum and volatility patterns are simulated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Dec 2016 15:59:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Xia", "Jake J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.02444", "submitter": "Kazutoshi Yamazaki", "authors": "Jos\\'e-Luis P\\'erez and Kazutoshi Yamazaki", "title": "Hybrid continuous and periodic barrier strategies in the dual model:\n  optimality and fluctuation identities", "comments": "33 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Avanzi et al.
