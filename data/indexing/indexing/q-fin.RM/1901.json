The models are a white noise process with conditionally\nlog-Laplace stochastic volatility. In contrast to other, similar stochastic\nvolatility formalisms, this process has analytic expressions for its\nconditional probabilistic structure that enable straightforward estimation of\ndynamically changing extreme event probabilities. The process and volatility\nare conditionally Pareto-tailed, with tail exponent given by the reciprocal of\nthe log-volatility's mean absolute innovation. This formalism can accommodate a\nwide variety of nonlinear dependence, as well as conditional power law-tail\nbehavior ranging from weakly non-Gaussian to Cauchy-like tails. We provide a\ncomputationally straightforward estimation procedure that uses an asymptotic\napproximation of the process' dynamic large deviation probabilities. We\ndemonstrate the estimator's utility with a simulation study. We then show the\nmethod's predictive capabilities on a simulated nonlinear time series where the\nvolatility is driven by the chaotic Lorenz system. Lastly we provide an\nempirical application, which shows that this simple modeling method can be\neffectively used for dynamic and predictive tail inference in financial time\nseries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jan 2019 17:43:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 18:23:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2019 18:17:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2019 17:20:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 16:46:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Chavez", "Gordon V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.04689", "submitter": "Yiying Zhang", "authors": "Jan Dhaene, Roger J.
