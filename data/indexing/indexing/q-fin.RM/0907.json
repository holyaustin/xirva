In\nparticular, models of social and financial cascades, as well as the fiber\nbundle model, the voter model, and models of epidemic spreading are recovered\nas special cases. To unify their description, we define the net fragility of a\nnode, which is the difference between its fragility and the threshold that\ndetermines its failure. Nodes fail if their net fragility grows above zero and\ntheir failure increases the fragility of neighbouring nodes, thus possibly\ntriggering a cascade. In this framework, we identify three classes depending on\nthe way the fragility of a node is increased by the failure of a neighbour. At\nthe microscopic level, we illustrate with specific examples how the failure\nspreading pattern varies with the node triggering the cascade, depending on its\nposition in the network and its degree. At the macroscopic level, systemic risk\nis measured as the final fraction of failed nodes, $X^\\ast$, and for each of\nthe three classes we derive a recursive equation to compute its value. The\nphase diagram of $X^\\ast$ as a function of the initial conditions, thus allows\nfor a prediction of the systemic risk as well as a comparison of the three\ndifferent model classes. We could identify which model class lead to a\nfirst-order phase transition in systemic risk, i.e. situations where small\nchanges in the initial conditions may lead to a global failure. Eventually, we\ngeneralize our framework to encompass stochastic contagion models. This\nindicates the potential for further generalizations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2009 15:45:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2010 16:46:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Lorenz", "Jan", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5363", "submitter": "Jean-Pierre Marco", "authors": "Jean-Pierre Marco", "title": "Dynamical complexity and symplectic integrability", "comments": "58 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS math.SG q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce two numerical conjugacy invariants for dynamical systems -- the\ncomplexity and weak complexity indices -- which are well-suited for the study\nof \"completely integrable\" Hamiltonian systems.
