This question from credit risk\nencompasses basic mathematical problems concerning the existence of an\nintensity process and filtration expansions, as well as some conceptual issues\nfor credit risk. By revisiting and extending the famous Jeulin--Yor [Lecture\nNotes in Math. 649 (1978) 78--97] result regarding compensators under a general\nfiltration expansion framework, a novel computation methodology for the\nintensity process of a stopping time is proposed.
