In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable.
