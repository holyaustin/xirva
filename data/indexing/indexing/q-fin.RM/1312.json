This unifies some recent\nliterature in this area. Through stochastic time change we establish a link\nbetween the stochastic area and the stopping time of another associated\ntime-homogeneous diffusion. Then we characterize the Laplace transform of the\nstochastic area in terms of the eigenfunctions of the associated diffusion. We\nalso explicitly obtain the integer moments of the stochastic area in terms of\nscale and speed densities of the associated diffusion. Specifically we study in\ndetail three stopping times: the first passage time to a constant level, the\nfirst drawdown time and the Azema-Yor stopping time. We also study the total\noccupation area of the diffusion below a constant level. We show applications\nof the results to a new structural model of default (Yildirim 2006), the Omega\nrisk model of bankruptcy in risk analysis (Gerber, Shiu and Yang 2012), and a\ndiffusion risk model with surplus-dependent tax (Albrecher and Hipp 2007, Li,\nTang and Zhou 2013).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Dec 2013 23:03:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cui", "Zhenyu", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0424", "submitter": "Rodrigo S.

At the same time, however, it has\nbeen criticised for issues relating to backtesting. In particular, ES has been\nfound not to be elicitable which means that backtesting for ES is less\nstraightforward than, e.g., backtesting for VaR. Expectiles have been suggested\nas potentially better alternatives to both ES and VaR. In this paper, we\nrevisit commonly accepted desirable properties of risk measures like coherence,\ncomonotonic additivity, robustness and elicitability. We check VaR, ES and\nExpectiles with regard to whether or not they enjoy these properties, with\nparticular emphasis on Expectiles. We also consider their impact on capital\nallocation, an important issue in risk management. We find that, despite the\ncaveats that apply to the estimation and backtesting of ES, it can be\nconsidered a good risk measure. As a consequence, there is no sufficient\nevidence to justify an all-inclusive replacement of ES by Expectiles in\napplications. For backtesting ES, we propose an empirical approach that\nconsists in replacing ES by a set of four quantiles, which should allow to make\nuse of backtesting methods for VaR.\n  Keywords: Backtesting; capital allocation; coherence; diversification;\nelicitability; expected shortfall; expectile; forecasts; probability integral\ntransform (PIT); risk measure; risk management; robustness; value-at-risk\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 18:54:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Dec 2013 10:26:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 19:39:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2015 19:36:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Emmer", "Susanne", ""], ["Kratz", "Marie", ""], ["Tasche", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.5073", "submitter": "Anne Balter", "authors": "Anne Balter, Antoon Pelsser, Peter Schotman", "title": "Extrapolating the term structure of interest rates with parameter\n  uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pricing extremely long-dated liabilities market consistently deals with the\ndecline in liquidity of financial instruments on long maturities.
