The main result of the paper consists in providing, in the\ncash-subadditive case, a sufficient condition for strong time-consistency (or\nrecursivity) in terms of a generalized cocycle condition. On one hand, our\nresult can be seen as an extension to cash-subadditive convex dynamic risk\nmeasures of Theorem 2.5 in Bion-Nadal \\cite{bion-nadal-FS}; on the other hand,\nit is weaker since strong time-consistency is not fully characterized. Finally,\nwe exploit the relation between different notions of time-consistency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 13:58:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mastrogiacomo", "Elisa", ""], ["Gianin", "Emanuela Rosazza", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.04460", "submitter": "Marco Bardoscia", "authors": "Marco Bardoscia, Fabio Caccioli, Juan Ignacio Perotti, Gianna Vivaldo,\n  Guido Caldarelli", "title": "Distress propagation in complex networks: the case of non-linear\n  DebtRank", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 11(10): e0163825 (2016)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0163825", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a dynamical model of distress propagation on complex networks,\nwhich we apply to the study of financial contagion in networks of banks\nconnected to each other by direct exposures. The model that we consider is an\nextension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The\nmechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss,\ndistress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The\noriginal DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected\nbanks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of\nnon-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a\ndata-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system\ndepends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios.\nWe find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where\nsmall shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and\nthat the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 18:52:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 16:37:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Perotti", "Juan Ignacio", ""], ["Vivaldo", "Gianna", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.04741", "submitter": "Damiano  Brigo", "authors": "Damiano Brigo, Camilla Pisani, Francesco Rapisarda", "title": "The Multivariate Mixture Dynamics Model: Shifted dynamics and\n  correlation skew", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Multi Variate Mixture Dynamics model is a tractable, dynamical,\narbitrage-free multivariate model characterized by transparency on the\ndependence structure, since closed form formulae for terminal correlations,\naverage correlations and copula function are available. It also allows for\ncomplete decorrelation between assets and instantaneous variances. Each single\nasset is modelled according to a lognormal mixture dynamics model, and this\nunivariate version is widely used in the industry due to its flexibility and\naccuracy. The same property holds for the multivariate process of all assets,\nwhose density is a mixture of multivariate basic densities. This allows for\nconsistency of single asset and index/portfolio smile. In this paper, we\ngeneralize the MVMD model by introducing shifted dynamics and we propose a\ndefinition of implied correlation under this model. We investigate whether the\nmodel is able to consistently reproduce the implied volatility of FX cross\nrates once the single components are calibrated to univariate shifted lognormal\nmixture dynamics models. We consider in particular the case of the Chinese\nrenminbi FX rate, showing that the shifted MVMD model correctly recovers the\nCNY/EUR smile given the EUR/USD smile and the USD/CNY smile, thus highlighting\nthat the model can also work as an arbitrage free volatility smile\nextrapolation tool for cross currencies that may not be liquid or fully\nobservable. We compare the performance of the shifted MVMD model in terms of\nimplied correlation with those of the shifted Simply Correlated Mixture\nDynamics model where the dynamics of the single assets are connected naively by\nintroducing correlation among their Brownian motions. Finally, we introduce a\nmodel with uncertain volatilities and correlation.

We provide three methods for computing the\nbank price of risk from readily available business unit data, i.e. business\nunit budgets (rate of return) and limits (e.g. exposure percentiles).

The proposed new measure of\ninsolvency risk is constructed by disentangling assets, debt and equity at the\nmicro-prudential firm level. This new risk index is the Firm Insolvency Risk\nIndex (FIRI) which is symmetrical, proportional and scale invariant. We\ndemonstrate that the balance sheet can be shown to evolve with a fractal\npattern. As such we construct a fractal index that can measure the risk of\nassets. This index can differentiate between the similarity and dissimilarity\nin asset risk, and it will also possess the properties of being self-similar\nand invariant to firm characteristics that make up its asset composition hence\ninvariant to all types of risk derived from assets. Self-similarity and scale\ninvariance across the cross section allows direct comparison of degrees of risk\nin assets. This is by comparing the risk dissimilarity of assets. Being\nnaturally bounded to its highest upper bound, (0,2], the fractal index is able\nto serve like a risk thermometer. We assign geometric probabilities of\ninsolvency P (equity is equal or less than 0 conditional on debt being greater\nthan 0).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 13:11:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Azhar", "A.
