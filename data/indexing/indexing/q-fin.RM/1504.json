Here we formulate a\ndynamical \"microscopic\" theory of instability for financial networks by\niterating balance sheet identities of individual banks and by assuming a simple\nrule for the transfer of shocks from borrowers to lenders. By doing so, we\ngeneralise the DebtRank formulation, both providing an interpretation of the\neffective dynamics in terms of basic accounting principles and preventing the\nunderestimation of losses on certain network topologies. Depending on the\nstructure of the interbank leverage matrix the dynamics is either stable, in\nwhich case the asymptotic state can be computed analytically, or unstable,\nmeaning that at least one bank will default. We apply this framework to a\ndataset of the top listed European banks in the period 2008 - 2013. We find\nthat network effects can generate an amplification of exogenous shocks of a\nfactor ranging between three (in normal periods) and six (during the crisis)\nwhen we stress the system with a 0.5% shock on external (i.e. non-interbank)\nassets for all banks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 07:57:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 14:41:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.02896", "submitter": "Marco Bianchetti", "authors": "Marco Bianchetti, Sergei Kucherenko, Stefano Scoleri", "title": "Pricing and Risk Management with High-Dimensional Quasi Monte Carlo and\n  Global Sensitivity Analysis", "comments": "43 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We review and apply Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Global Sensitivity Analysis\n(GSA) techniques to pricing and risk management (greeks) of representative\nfinancial instruments of increasing complexity.

We develop a\nnew class of flexible Copula models where the evolution of the dependence\nparameters follow a Markov-Switching Generalised Autoregressive Score (SGASC)\ndynamics. Maximum Likelihood estimation is consistently performed using the\nInference Functions for Margins (IFM) approach and a version of the\nExpectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm specifically tailored to this class of\nmodels. The SGASC models are then used to estimate the Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (CoVaR), which is defined as the VaR of a given asset conditional\non another asset (or portfolio) being in financial distress, and the\nConditional Expected Shortfall (CoES). Our empirical investigation shows that\nthe proposed SGASC models are able to explain and predict the systemic risk\ncontribution of several European countries. Moreover, we also find that the\nSGASC models outperform competitors using several CoVaR backtesting procedures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 21:43:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 17:50:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 16:34:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bernardi", "Mauro", ""], ["Catania", "Leopoldo", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.04774", "submitter": "Jianing Zhang", "authors": "Claudia Kl\\\"uppelberg, Jianing Zhang", "title": "Time-consistency of risk measures with GARCH volatilities and their\n  estimation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study time-consistent risk measures for returns that are\ngiven by a GARCH(1,1) model.

Specifically, using the\nelements of network theory, we constructed an agent-based model that obeys the\nstylised rules of microfinance industry. We found that in a deteriorating\neconomic environment confounded with adverse selection, a form of latent moral\nhazard may cause a regime shift from a high to a low loan repayment\nprobability. An after-the-fact recovery, when possible, required the economic\nenvironment to improve beyond that which led to the shift in the first place.\nThese findings suggest a small set of measurable quantities for mapping\nmicrofinance credit risk and, consequently, for balancing the requirements to\nreasonably price loans and to operate on a fully self-financed basis. We\nillustrate how the proposed mapping works using a 10-year monthly data set from\none of the best-known microfinance representatives, Grameen Bank in Bangladesh.\nFinally, we discuss an entirely new perspective for managing microfinance\ncredit risk based on enticing spontaneous cooperation by building social\ncapital.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2015 11:26:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-21", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Joung-Hun", ""], ["Jusup", "Marko", ""], ["Podobnik", "Boris", ""], ["Iwasa", "Yoh", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.06094", "submitter": "Miryana Grigorova", "authors": "Miryana Grigorova, Peter Imkeller, Elias Offen, Youssef Ouknine,\n  Marie-Claire Quenez (LPMA)", "title": "Reflected BSDEs when the obstacle is not right-continuous and optimal\n  stopping", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "The Annals of Applied Probability : an official journal of the\n  institute of mathematical statistics, The Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics, 2017", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the first part of the paper, we study reflected backward stochastic\ndifferential equations (RBSDEs) with lower obstacle which is assumed to be\nright upper-semicontinuous but not necessarily right-continuous.
