The objective is to\nmaximize the expected discounted dividend payout up to the time of ruin. We\nprovide a comparative study in this general framework of both restricted and\nunrestricted payment schemes, which were only previously treated separately in\ncertain special cases of risk models in the literature. In the case of\nrestricted payment scheme, the value function is shown to be a classical\nsolution of the corresponding HJB equation, which in turn leads to an optimal\nrestricted payment policy known as the threshold strategy. In the case of\nunrestricted payment scheme, by solving the associated integro-differential\nquasi-variational inequality, we obtain the value function as well as an\noptimal unrestricted dividend payment scheme known as the barrier strategy.\nWhen claim sizes are exponentially distributed, we provide easily verifiable\nconditions under which the threshold and barrier strategies are optimal\nrestricted and unrestricted dividend payment policies, respectively. The main\nresults are illustrated with several examples, including a new example\nconcerning regressive growth rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 18:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 15:22:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Runhuan", ""], ["Volkmer", "Hans", ""], ["Zhang", "Shuaiqi", ""], ["Zhu", "Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2791", "submitter": "Brahimi Brahim", "authors": "Brahim Brahimi, Djamel Meraghni, and Abdelhakim Necir", "title": "Distortion risk measures for sums of dependent losses", "comments": "Accepted 25 October 2010, Journal Afrika Statistika Vol. 5, N9, 2010,\n  page 260--267", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME math.ST q-fin.RM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss two distinct approaches, for distorting risk measures of sums of\ndependent random variables, which preserve the property of coherence.

We summarize the relative strengths of the two methods, characterize\nseveral necessary and sufficient conditions under which one of the measurements\nalways dominates the other, and introduce a metric to quantify how close the\ntwo risk measures are.\n  Using this notion, we address the question of how tightly a given coherent\nmeasure can be approximated by lower or upper-bounding compositional measures.\nWe exhibit an interesting asymmetry between the two cases: the tightest\npossible upper-bound can be exactly characterized, and corresponds to a popular\nconstruction in the literature, while the tightest-possible lower bound is not\nreadily available. We show that testing domination and computing the\napproximation factors is generally NP-hard, even when the risk measures in\nquestion are comonotonic and law-invariant.
