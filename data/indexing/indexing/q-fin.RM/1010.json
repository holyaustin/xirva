The numeraire portfolio is the\nunique strictly positive wealth process that, when used as a benchmark to\ndenominate all other wealth, makes all wealth processes local martingales. It\nis assumed that the numeraire portfolio exists and that its wealth increases to\ninfinity as time goes to infinity. Under this setting, an initial enlargement\nof the filtration is performed, by including the overall minimum of the\nnumeraire portfolio. It is established that all nonnegative wealth processes,\nwhen stopped at the time of the overall minimum of the numeraire portfolio,\nbecome local martingales in the enlarged filtration. This implies that\nrisk-averse insider traders would refrain from investing in the risky assets\nbefore that time. A partial converse to the previous result is also established\nin the case of complete markets, showing that the time of the overall minimum\nof the numeraire portfolio is in a certain sense unique in rendering\nundesirable the act of undertaking risky positions before it. The\naforementioned results shed light to the importance of the numeraire portfolio\nas an indicator of overall market performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Oct 2010 19:48:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Dec 2010 01:01:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kardaras", "Constantinos", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.2981", "submitter": "Andrzej Jarosz", "authors": "Andrzej Jarosz", "title": "Hermitian and non-Hermitian covariance estimators for multivariate\n  Gaussian and non-Gaussian assets from random matrix theory", "comments": "56 pages, 86 figures, 348 equations, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cond-mat.stat-mech q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The random matrix theory method of planar Gaussian diagrammatic expansion is\napplied to find the mean spectral density of the Hermitian equal-time and\nnon-Hermitian time-lagged cross-covariance estimators, firstly in the form of\nmaster equations for the most general multivariate Gaussian system, secondly\nfor seven particular toy models of the true covariance function.

This paper studies the behaviour of\ndifferent insurance policies in the context of capital reduction for a range of\npossible extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period,\nmultiple risk settings. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modelling of\nthe annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for\nthe annual losses, with heavy tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable\nseverities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date\nand it is believed, insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk\nmitigation and capital reduction in future. The first question of interest is\nwhen would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase\ninsurance for heavy tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy\nscenarios? The second question then pertains to Solvency II and addresses what\nthe insurers capital would be for such operational risk scenarios under\ndifferent policy offerings. In addition we consider the insurers perspective\nwith respect to fair premium as a percentage above the expected annual claim\nfor each insurance policy. The intention being to address questions related to\nVaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums\nin OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide\nclosed form solutions for the distribution of loss process and claims process\nin an LDA structure as well as closed form analytic solutions for the Expected\nShortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II. We also provide closed\nform analytic solutions for the annual loss distribution of multiple risks\nincluding insurance mitigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Oct 2010 09:42:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Nov 2010 00:19:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Byrnes", "Aaron D.", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.5171", "submitter": "Georg Mainik", "authors": "Georg Mainik and Ludger R\\\"uschendorf", "title": "Ordering of multivariate probability distributions with respect to\n  extreme portfolio losses", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new notion of stochastic ordering is introduced to compare multivariate\nstochastic risk models with respect to extreme portfolio losses.
