For an investor with constant absolute risk\naversion, we compute indifference prices for defaultable bonds, as well as a\nprice for dynamic protection against default. For the latter problem, our work\ncomplements Sircar & Zariphopoulou (2007), where it is implicitly assumed the\ninvestor is protected against default. We consider a factor model where the\nasset's instantaneous return, variance, correlation and default intensity are\ndriven by a time-homogenous diffusion X taking values in an arbitrary region E.\nWe identify the certainty equivalent with a semi-linear degenerate elliptic\npartial differential equation with quadratic growth in both function and\ngradient. Under a minimal integrability assumption on the market price of risk,\nwe show the certainty equivalent is a classical solution. In particular, our\nresults cover when X is a one-dimensional affine diffusion and when returns,\nvariances and default intensities are also affine. Numerical examples highlight\nthe relationship between the factor process and both the indifference price and\ndefault insurance. Lastly, we show the insurance protection price is not the\ndefault intensity under the dual optimal measure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:23:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ishikawa", "Tetsuya", ""], ["Robertson", "Scott", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.00918", "submitter": "Marcin Pitera", "authors": "Piotr Jaworski and Marcin Pitera", "title": "A note on conditional covariance matrices for elliptical distributions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.ST q-fin.RM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short note we provide an analytical formula for the conditional\ncovariance matrices of the elliptically distributed random vectors, when the\nconditioning is based on the values of any linear combination of the marginal\nrandom variables.
