The dual story provides an intuitive\ninterpretation, and full characterization, of dual counterparts of such\nconcepts as prudence and temperance. The direction of preference between these\nnested classes of lottery pairs is equivalent to signing the successive\nderivatives of the probability weighting function within Yaari's (1987) dual\ntheory. We explore implications of our results for optimal portfolio choice and\nshow that the sign of the third derivative of the probability weighting\nfunction may be naturally linked to a self-protection problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Dec 2017 13:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Eeckhoudt", "Louis R.", ""], ["Laeven", "Roger J.

However, many of these households have mobile phones, which\ngenerate rich data about behavior. This article shows that behavioral\nsignatures in mobile phone data predict default, using call records matched to\nrepayment outcomes for credit extended by a South American telecom. On a sample\nof individuals with (thin) financial histories, our method actually outperforms\nmodels using credit bureau information, both within time and when tested on a\ndifferent time period. But our method also attains similar performance on those\nwithout financial histories, who cannot be scored using traditional methods.\nIndividuals in the highest quintile of risk by our measure are 2.8 times more\nlikely to default than those in the lowest quintile. The method forms the basis\nfor new forms of credit that reach the unbanked.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Dec 2017 05:28:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Feb 2018 01:42:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Dec 2019 17:13:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bj\u00f6rkegren", "Daniel", ""], ["Grissen", "Darrell", ""]]}]
