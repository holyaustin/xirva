We show\nthat, by properly shifting financial exposures from one institution to another,\na CDS market can be designed to rewire the network of interbank exposures in a\nway that makes it more resilient to insolvency cascades. A regulator can use\ninformation about the topology of the interbank network to devise a systemic\ninsurance surcharge that is added to the CDS spread. CDS contracts are thus\neffectively penalized according to how much they contribute to increasing\nsystemic risk. CDS contracts that decrease systemic risk remain untaxed. We\nsimulate this regulated CDS market using an agent-based model (CRISIS\nmacro-financial model) and we demonstrate that it leads to an interbank system\nthat is more resilient to insolvency cascades.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Jan 2016 20:53:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Oct 2017 13:44:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Leduc", "Matt V.", ""], ["Poledna", "Sebastian", ""], ["Thurner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.03015", "submitter": "Thilo Albrecht Schmitt", "authors": "Thilo A.

Hence it is of utmost\nimportance to choose a distribution for these asset values which is in\naccordance with empirical data. At the same time, it is desirable to still\npreserve some analytical tractability. We achieve both goals by putting forward\nan ensemble approach for the asset correlations. Consistently with the data, we\nview them as fluctuating quantities, for which we may choose the average\ncorrelation as homogeneous. Thereby we can reduce the number of parameters to\ntwo, the average correlation between assets and the strength of the\nfluctuations around this average value. Yet, the resulting asset value\ndistribution describes the empirical data well. This allows us to derive the\ndistribution of credit portfolio losses. With Monte-Carlo simulations for the\nValue at Risk and Expected Tail Loss we validate the assumptions of our\napproach and demonstrate the necessity of taking fluctuating correlations into\naccount.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:01:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitt", "Thilo A.", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.03171", "submitter": "Yumiharu Nakano", "authors": "Yumiharu Nakano", "title": "On a law of large numbers for insurance risks", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This note presents a kind of the strong law of large numbers for an insurance\nrisk caused by a single catastrophic event rather than by an accumulation of\nindependent and identically distributed risks.

RiskRank is a general-purpose aggregation\noperator that concurrently accounts for risk levels for individual entities and\ntheir interconnectedness. The measure relies on the decomposition of systemic\nrisk into sub-components that are in turn assessed using a set of risk measures\nand their relationships. For this purpose, motivated by the development of the\nChoquet integral, we employ the RiskRank function to aggregate risk measures,\nallowing for the integration of the interrelation of different factors in the\naggregation process. The use of RiskRank is illustrated through a real-world\ncase in a European setting, in which we show that it performs well in\nout-of-sample analysis.
