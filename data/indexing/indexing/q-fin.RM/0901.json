Such functions allow the direct recycling of Monte\nCarlo samples from one distribution into samples from another. The method may\nbe developed analytically for certain special cases, and illuminate the idea\nthat it is a more precise form of the traditional Cornish-Fisher expansion. In\nthis manner the model risk of distributional risk may be assessed free of the\nMonte Carlo noise associated with resampling. Examples are given of equations\nfor converting normal samples to Student t, and converting exponential to\nhyperbolic, variance gamma and normal. In the case of the normal distribution,\nthe change of variables employed allows the sampling to take place to good\naccuracy based on a single rational approximation over a very wide range of the\nsample space. The avoidance of any branching statement is of use in optimal GPU\ncomputations as it avoids the effect of {\\it warp divergence}, and we give\nexamples of branch-free normal quantiles that offer performance improvements in\na GPU environment, while retaining the best precision characteristics of\nwell-known methods. We also offer models based on a low-probability of warp\ndivergence. Comparisons of new and old forms are made on the Nvidia Quadro\n4000, GTX 285 and 480, and Tesla C2050 GPUs. We argue that in single-precision\nmode, the change-of-variables approach offers performance competitive with the\nfastest existing scheme while substantially improving precision, and that in\ndouble-precision mode, this approach offers the most GPU-optimal Gaussian\nquantile yet, and without compromise on precision for Monte Carlo applications,\nworking twice as fast as the CUDA 4 library function with increased precision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2009 12:14:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2009 17:51:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2009 10:37:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 26 Aug 2010 14:20:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 19:16:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""], ["Luu", "Thomas", ""], ["Brickman", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1099", "submitter": "Damiano  Brigo", "authors": "Damiano Brigo, Kyriakos Chourdakis, Imane Bakkar", "title": "Counterparty risk valuation for Energy-Commodities swaps: Impact of\n  volatilities and correlation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is commonly accepted that Commodities futures and forward prices, in\nprinciple, agree under some simplifying assumptions. One of the most relevant\nassumptions is the absence of counterparty risk. Indeed, due to margining,\nfutures have practically no counterparty risk. Forwards, instead, may bear the\nfull risk of default for the counterparty when traded with brokers or outside\nclearing houses, or when embedded in other contracts such as swaps. In this\npaper we focus on energy commodities and on Oil in particular. We use a hybrid\ncommodities-credit model to asses impact of counterparty risk in pricing\nformulas, both in the gross effect of default probabilities and on the subtler\neffects of credit spread volatility, commodities volatility and\ncredit-commodities correlation. We illustrate our general approach with a case\nstudy based on an oil swap, showing that an accurate valuation of counterparty\nrisk depends on volatilities and correlation and cannot be accounted for\nprecisely through a pre-defined multiplier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2009 17:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Chourdakis", "Kyriakos", ""], ["Bakkar", "Imane", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.3318", "submitter": "Gordan Zitkovic", "authors": "Michail Anthropelos, Gordan Zitkovic", "title": "Partial Equilibria with Convex Capital Requirements: Existence,\n  Uniqueness and Stability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an incomplete semimartingale model of a financial market, we consider\nseveral risk-averse financial agents who negotiate the price of a bundle of\ncontingent claims.
