This paper attempts to reconcile some apparently\ndifferent views emerged after the 2008 crisis regarding the nature and the\nrelevance of contagion in financial networks. We develop a common framework\nencompassing several network contagion models and show that, regardless of the\nshock distribution and the network topology, precise ordering relationships on\nthe level of aggregate systemic losses hold among models. We argue that the\nextent of contagion crucially depends on the amount of information that each\nmodel assumes to be available to market players. Under no uncertainty about the\nnetwork structure and values of external assets, the well-known Eisenberg and\nNoe (2001) model applies, which delivers the lowest level of contagion. This is\ndue to a property of loss conservation: aggregate losses after contagion are\nequal to the losses incurred by those institutions initially hit by a shock.\nThis property implies that many contagion analyses rule out by construction any\nloss amplification, treating de facto an interconnected system as a single\naggregate entity, where losses are simply mutualised. Under higher levels of\nuncertainty, as captured for instance by the DebtRank model, losses become\nnon-conservative and get compounded through the network. This has important\npolicy implications: by reducing the levels of uncertainty in times of distress\n(e.g. by obtaining specific data on the network) policymakers would be able to\nmove towards more conservative scenarios. Empirically, we compare the magnitude\nof contagion across models on a sample of the largest European banks during the\nyears 2006-2016. In particular, we analyse contagion effects as a function of\nthe size of the shock and the type of external assets shocked.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 16:42:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Visentin", "Gabriele", ""], ["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["D'Errico", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08283", "submitter": "Leonardo Massai", "authors": "Giuseppe Carlo Calafiore, Leonardo Massai", "title": "Risk measures and Margining control", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This document constitutes the final report of the contractual activity\nbetween Directa SIM and Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico\ndi Torino, on the research topic titled \"quantificazione del rischio di un\nportafoglio di strumenti finanziari per trading online su device fissi e\nmobili.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 23:23:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Calafiore", "Giuseppe Carlo", ""], ["Massai", "Leonardo", ""]]}]
