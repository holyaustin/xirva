Systemic risk can\npropagate through different mechanisms and channels of contagion. One important\nform of financial contagion arises from indirect interconnections between\nfinancial institutions mediated by financial markets. This indirect\ninterconnection occurs when financial institutions invest in common assets and\nis referred to as overlapping portfolios. In this work we quantify systemic\nrisk from indirect interconnections between financial institutions. Having\ncomplete information of security holdings of major Mexican financial\nintermediaries and the ability to uniquely identify securities in their\nportfolios, allows us to represent the Mexican financial system as a bipartite\nnetwork of securities and financial institutions. This makes it possible to\nquantify systemic risk arising from overlapping portfolios. We show that\nfocusing only on direct exposures underestimates total systemic risk levels by\nup to 50%. By representing the financial system as a multi-layer network of\ndirect exposures (default contagion) and indirect exposures (overlapping\nportfolios) we estimate the mutual influence of different channels of\ncontagion. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven\nquantification of systemic risk on national scales that includes overlapping\nportfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 15:56:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Poledna", "Sebastian", ""], ["Mart\u00ednez-Jaramillo", "Seraf\u00edn", ""], ["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Thurner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.02127", "submitter": "Paolo Barucca", "authors": "Duc Thi Luu, Mauro Napoletano, Paolo Barucca and Stefano Battiston", "title": "Collateral Unchained: Rehypothecation networks, concentration and\n  systemic effects", "comments": "39 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study how network structure affects the dynamics of collateral in presence\nof rehypothecation.
