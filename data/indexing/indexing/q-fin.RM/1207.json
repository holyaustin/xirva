It compares two alternative notions of\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These\nnotions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y\ngiven a stress event for a random variable X, but they use different types of\nstress events. We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in\nterms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their\nperformance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that\nconditioning on X>=VaR_\\alpha(X) gives a much better response to dependence\nbetween X and Y than conditioning on X=VaR_\\alpha(X). We prove general results\nthat relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on\nX>=VaR_\\alpha(X) to well established results on concordance ordering of\nmultivariate distributions or their copulas. These results also apply to some\nother systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and\nthe Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR\nbased on the stress event X=VaR_\\alpha(X) is not dependence consistent. In\nparticular, if (X,Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based on X=VaR_\\alpha(X)\nis not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues\narise in the bivariate t model and in the model with t margins and a Gumbel\ncopula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X>=VaR_\\alpha(X) is an increasing\nfunction of the dependence parameter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Jul 2012 22:01:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2012 13:18:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 13:33:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Mainik", "Georg", ""], ["Schaanning", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.4309", "submitter": "Stephan Nicklas", "authors": "Oliver Grothe and Stephan Nicklas", "title": "Vine Constructions of Levy Copulas", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Levy copulas are the most general concept to capture jump dependence in\nmultivariate Levy processes.

A challenge faced by both,\ndistributional and Levy copulas, is to find flexible but still applicable\nmodels for higher dimensions. To overcome this problem, the concept of pair\ncopula constructions has been successfully applied to distributional copulas.\nIn this paper, we develop the pair construction for Levy copulas (PLCC).\nSimilar to pair constructions of distributional copulas, the pair construction\nof a d-dimensional Levy copula consists of d(d-1)/2 bivariate dependence\nfunctions. We show that only d-1 of these bivariate functions are Levy copulas,\nwhereas the remaining functions are distributional copulas. Since there are no\nrestrictions concerning the choice of the copulas, the proposed pair\nconstruction adds the desired flexibility to Levy copula models.
