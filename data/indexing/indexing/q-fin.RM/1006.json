This\npaper includes eight sections. Section 1 is a longer introduction, which gives\na brief introduction to random metric theory, risk measures and conditional\nrisk measures. Section 2 gives the central framework in random metric theory,\ntopological structures, important examples, the notions of a random conjugate\nspace and the Hahn-Banach theorems for random linear functionals. Section 3\ngives several important representation theorems for random conjugate spaces.\nSection 4 gives characterizations for a complete random normed module to be\nrandom reflexive. Section 5 gives hyperplane separation theorems currently\navailable in random locally convex modules. Section 6 gives the theory of\nrandom duality with respect to the locally $L^{0}-$convex topology and in\nparticular a characterization for a locally $L^{0}-$convex module to be\n$L^{0}-$pre$-$barreled. Section 7 gives some basic results on $L^{0}-$convex\nanalysis together with some applications to conditional risk measures. Finally,\nSection 8 is devoted to extensions of conditional convex risk measures, which\nshows that every representable $L^{\\infty}-$type of conditional convex risk\nmeasure and every continuous $L^{p}-$type of convex conditional risk measure\n($1\\leq p<+\\infty$) can be extended to an $L^{\\infty}_{\\cal F}({\\cal E})-$type\nof $\\sigma_{\\epsilon,\\lambda}(L^{\\infty}_{\\cal F}({\\cal E}), L^{1}_{\\cal\nF}({\\cal E}))-$lower semicontinuous conditional convex risk measure and an\n$L^{p}_{\\cal F}({\\cal E})-$type of ${\\cal T}_{\\epsilon,\\lambda}-$continuous\nconditional convex risk measure ($1\\leq p<+\\infty$), respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2010 17:03:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Fri, 26 Nov 2010 08:25:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Mon, 21 Feb 2011 15:28:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Sun, 27 Feb 2011 16:01:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 07:30:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v14", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2011 14:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v15", "created": "Mon, 14 Mar 2011 07:48:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v16", "created": "Wed, 16 Mar 2011 08:12:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v17", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2011 09:00:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Jun 2010 08:35:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 09:01:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 12 Jun 2010 06:03:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 08:03:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 07:16:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 09:21:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 16 Nov 2010 08:41:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 11:00:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Tiexin", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0863", "submitter": "Jani Sainio", "authors": "Luis H.

The main purpose of this work is to design an effective\nalarm system, i.e. to define alarm times and to recommend augmentation of\ncapital of suitable magnitude at those points to prevent or reduce the chance\nof ruin. To draw a fair measure of effectiveness of alarm system, comparison is\ndrawn between an alarm system, with capital being added at the sound of every\nalarm, and the corresponding system without any alarm, but an equivalently\nhigher initial capital. Analytical results are obtained in general setup and\nthis is backed up by simulated performances with various types of loss severity\ndistributions. This provides a strategy for suitably spreading out the capital\nand yet addressing survivability concerns at satisfactory level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 21:24:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Shubhabrata", ""], ["Kratz", "Marie", ""]]}]
