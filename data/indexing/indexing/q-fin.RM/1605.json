When returns fall, volatility increases. We examine the\nrole of the leverage effect with regards to generating density forecasts of\nequity returns using well-known observation and parameter-driven volatility\nmodels. These models differ in their assumptions regarding: The parametric\nspecification, the evolution of the conditional volatility process and how the\nleverage effect is accounted for. The ability of a model to generate accurate\ndensity forecasts when the leverage effect is incorporated or not as well as a\ncomparison between different model-types is carried out using a large number of\nfinancial time-series. We find that, models with the leverage effect generally\ngenerate more accurate density forecasts compared to their no-leverage\ncounterparts. Moreover, we also find that our choice with regards to how to\nmodel the leverage effect and the conditional log-volatility process is\nimportant in generating accurate density forecasts\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 May 2016 10:16:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 18:52:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Catania", "Leopoldo", ""], ["Nonejad", "Nima", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.04940", "submitter": "Khizar Qureshi", "authors": "Khizar Qureshi", "title": "Value-at-Risk: The Effect of Autoregression in a Quantile Process", "comments": "Columbia Economics Review, November 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Value-at-Risk (VaR) is an institutional measure of risk favored by financial\nregulators.

However, it is worth investigating the\neffects of refinancing after taking the underlying costs into consideration.\nHere we develop a synthetic mortgage calculator that sufficiently accounts for\nsuch costs and the implications on new monthly payments. To confirm the\naccuracy of the calculator, we simulate the effects of refinancing over 15 and\n30 year periods. We then model the effects of refinancing as risk to the issuer\nof the mortgage, as there is negative duration associated with shifts in the\ninterest rate. Furthermore, we investigate the effects on the swap market as\nwell as the treasury bond market.

This constraint is\nimposed at any deterministic time t and is typically weaker than the classical\npointwise one associated to reflected BSDEs. Focusing on solutions (Y, Z, K)\nwith deterministic K, we obtain the well-posedness of such equation, in the\npresence of a natural Skorokhod type condition. Such condition indeed ensures\nthe minimality of the enhanced solution, under an additional structural\ncondition on the driver.
