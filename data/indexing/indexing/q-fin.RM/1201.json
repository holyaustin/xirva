The objective is to proceed from a\nmodel of the loss distribution, given through probabilities, correlations and\nthe like, to an analytical approximation of the distribution.

These show, informally,\nwhere the risk is coming from, and also indicate how to go about optimising the\nportfolio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 11:10:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Richard J", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0967", "submitter": "Marco  Vega", "authors": "Daniel Kapp and Marco Vega", "title": "Real Output Costs of Financial Crises: A Loss Distribution Approach", "comments": "31 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study cross-country GDP losses due to financial crises in terms of\nfrequency (number of loss events per period) and severity (loss per\noccurrence).

The regime of large deviations is separated\nfrom the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the\nsymmetry between the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For\nstochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic noise, this implies that\nwhile typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with\ncontinuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For\neigenvalues of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large\ndeviation where the trace of the matrix is anomalously large concentrates on\njust a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed world the large deviation\naffects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application to\nfinance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat\ntailed increments, large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be\nrealized by discrete jumps. Interestingly, we find that large excursions of\nprices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than by\ndiscontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of\nlarge deviations. Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously\nlarge eigenvalue, the market mode, as compared to the prediction of random\nmatrix theory. We show that this is explained by a large deviation with excess\ncovariance rather than by one with excess volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 12:19:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Apr 2014 09:39:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 17:40:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Filiasi", "Mario", ""], ["Livan", "Giacomo", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Peressi", "Maria", ""], ["Vesselli", "Erik", ""], ["Zarinelli", "Elia", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5132", "submitter": "Michael Schmutz", "authors": "Thorsten Rheinl\\\"ander and Michael Schmutz", "title": "Quasi self-dual exponential L\\'evy processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The important application of semi-static hedging in financial markets\nnaturally leads to the notion of quasi self-dual processes.
