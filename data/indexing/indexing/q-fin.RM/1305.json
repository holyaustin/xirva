In our credit risk\nmodel, the risk free short rate is a constant and the default event occurs in\nan expected manner when the firm value reaches a given default barrier at\npredetermined discrete announcing dates or in an unexpected manner at the first\njump time of a Poisson process with given default intensity given by a step\nfunction of time variable, respectively.

In order to deal with the difference of coefficients in\nsubintervals we use a relation between prices of higher order binaries with\ndifferent coefficients. In our model, due to the inhomogenous term related to\nendogenous recovery, our pricing formulae are represented by not only the\nprices of higher binary options but also the integrals of them.
