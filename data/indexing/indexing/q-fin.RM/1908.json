First, it keeps track of both\nmarket and book values to apply the regulatory profit sharing rule. Second, it\nintroduces a determination of the crediting rate to policyholders that is close\nto the practice and is a trade-off between the regulatory rate, a competitor\nrate and the available profits. Third, it considers an investment in bonds that\nenables to match a part of the cash outflow due to surrenders, while avoiding\nto store the trading history. We use this model to evaluate the Solvency\nCapital Requirement (SCR) with the standard formula, and show that the choice\nof the interest rate model is important to get a meaningful model after the\nregulatory shocks on the interest rate. We discuss the different values of the\nSCR modules first in a framework with moderate interest rates using the shocks\nof the present legislation, and then we consider a low interest framework with\nthe latest recommandation of the EIOPA on the shocks. In both cases, we\nillustrate the importance of matching cash-flows and its impact on the SCR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Aug 2019 11:38:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Alfonsi", "Aur\u00e9lien", ""], ["Cherchali", "Adel", ""], ["Acevedo", "Jose Arturo Infante", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.00982", "submitter": "Wentao Hu", "authors": "Wentao Hu", "title": "calculation worst-case Value-at-Risk prediction using empirical data\n  under model uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantification of risk positions under model uncertainty is of crucial\nimportance from both viewpoints of external regulation and internal management.\nThe concept of model uncertainty, sometimes also referred to as model\nambiguity.

Consequently, cryptocurrencies\nare more appropriately described as crypto assets. A common investment\nattribute shared by the more than 2,500 crypto assets is that they are highly\nvolatile. An investor interested in reducing price volatility of a portfolio of\ncrypto assets can do so by constructing an optimal portfolio through standard\noptimization techniques that minimize tail risk. Because crypto assets are not\nbacked by any real assets, forming a hedge to reduce the risk contribution of a\nsingle crypto asset can only be done with another set of similar assets (i.e.,\na set of other crypto assets). A major finding of this paper is that crypto\nportfolios constructed via optimizations that minimize variance and Conditional\nValue at Risk outperform a major stock market index (the S$\\&$P 500). As of\nthis writing, options in which the underlying is a crypto asset index are not\ntraded, one of the reasons being that the academic literature has not\nformulated an acceptable fair pricing model. We offer a fair valuation model\nfor crypto asset options based on a dynamic pricing model for the underlying\ncrypto assets. The model was carefully backtested and therefore offers a\nreliable model for the underlying crypto assets in the natural world.
