It is a combination of the utility\nindifference pricing and optimal intertemporal risk allocation. We give a\ncharacterization of the optimal intertemporal risk allocation by a first order\ncondition. Applying this result to the exponential utility function, we obtain\nan essentially new type of premium calculation method for a popular type of\nmulti-period insurance contract. This method is simple and can be easily\nimplemented numerically. We see that the results of numerical calculations are\nwell coincident with the risk loading level determined by traditional\npractices. The results also suggest a possible implied utility approach to\ninsurance pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2007 19:31:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Nov 2007 11:46:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2007 12:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Fukuda", "Kei", ""], ["Inoue", "Akihiko", ""], ["Nakano", "Yumiharu", ""]]}]
