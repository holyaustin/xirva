When present values of\nbuilding instruments are expressed as linear combinations of some primary\nquantities such as zero-coupon bonds, discount factor, or survival probabilit-\nies, arbitrage-free bounds can be derived for those quantities at the most\nliquid maturities. As a matter of example, we present an iterative procedure\nthat allows to compute model-free bounds for OIS-implied discount rates and\nCDS-implied default probabilities. We then show how mean-reverting term\nstructure models can be used as generators of admissible curves. This framework\nis based on a particular specification of the mean-reverting level which al-\nlows to perfectly reproduce market quotes of standard vanilla interest-rate and\ndefault-risky securities while preserving a certain degree of smoothness. The\nnumerical results suggest that, for both OIS discounting curves and CDS credit\ncurves, the operational task of term- structure construction may be associated\nwith a significant degree of uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 18:47:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cousin", "Areski", "", "SAF"], ["Niang", "Ibrahima", "", "SAF"]]}, {"id": "1404.0879", "submitter": "Philip Ngare Ph.D", "authors": "Gunther Leobacher and Philip Ngare", "title": "Utility indifference pricing of derivatives written on industrial loss\n  indexes", "comments": "(Re-)Insurance, catastrophe derivatives, jump process, random\n  thinning, utility indifference price", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of pricing derivatives written on some industrial\nloss index via utility indifference pricing.

More technically, during a bubble phase,\nthe price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often\naccompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a\nchange of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they\nleave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is,\nbefore they burst. In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind\nfinancial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power\nlaw emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are,\nas a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific\ntrading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major\ncorrection, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards\nmaturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles\nand to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. The tools\nthat are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose. They are at the\ncore of the Financial Crisis Observatory at the ETH Zurich, where tens of\nthousands of assets are monitored on a daily basis.
