The model is based on a jump--diffusion\nprocess for the risk factors, i.e. for the company assets. We also include\ncorrelations between the companies. We discuss that models of this type have\nmuch in common with other problems in statistical physics and in the theory of\ncomplex systems. We study a simplified version of our model analytically.\nFurthermore, we perform extensive numerical simulations for the full model. The\nobservables are the loss distribution of the credit portfolio, its moments and\nother quantities derived thereof. We compile detailed information about the\nparameter dependence of these observables. In the course of setting up and\nanalyzing our model, we also give a review of credit risk modeling for a\nphysics audience.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2007 14:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2007 13:30:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["Sj\u00f6lin", "Markus", ""], ["Sundin", "Andreas", ""], ["Wolanski", "Michal", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}]
