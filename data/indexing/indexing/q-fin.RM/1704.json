The proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio\nvalue bounded within a targeted range, composed of a conservative lower target\nrepresenting a need for capital protection and a desired upper target\nrepresenting an investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire\nprobability distribution of returns, as it simultaneously seeks a desired\nexpected return, cuts off downside risk and implicitly caps volatility and\nhigher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of this investment strategy, we\nstudy a multiperiod portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs and\ndevelop a two-stage regression approach that improves the classical least\nsquares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm when dealing with difficult payoffs, such\nas highly concave, abruptly changing or discontinuous functions. Our numerical\nresults show substantial improvements over the classical LSMC algorithm for\nboth the constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility approach and the\nproposed skewed target range strategy (STRS). Our numerical results illustrate\nthe ability of the STRS to contain the portfolio value within the targeted\nrange. When compared with the CRRA utility approach, the STRS achieves a\nsimilar mean-variance efficient frontier while delivering a better downside\nrisk-return trade-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 03:50:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 06:21:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 02:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rongju", ""], ["Langren\u00e9", "Nicolas", ""], ["Tian", "Yu", ""], ["Zhu", "Zili", ""], ["Klebaner", "Fima", ""], ["Hamza", "Kais", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01174", "submitter": "Nonthachote Chatsanga", "authors": "Nonthachote Chatsanga and Andrew J.

Our optimisation model allows a\n\"currency overlay\", or a deviation of currency exposure from asset exposure, to\nprovide flexibility in hedging against, or in speculation using, currency\nexposure. The transaction costs associated with both trading and hedging are\nalso included.\n  To model the realistic dependence structure of the multivariate return\ndistributions, a new scenario generation method, employing a regular-vine\ncopula is developed. The use of vine copulas allows a better representation of\nthe characteristics of returns, specifically, their non-normality and\nasymmetric dependencies. It hence improves the representation of the\nuncertainty underlying decisions needed for international portfolio\noptimisation problems. Efficient portfolios optimised with scenarios generated\nfrom the new vine-copula method are compared with the portfolios from a\nstandard scenario generation method. Experimental results show that the\nproposed method, using realistic non-normal uncertainty, produces portfolios\nthat give better risk-return reward than those from a standard scenario\ngeneration approach, using normal distributions. The difference in risk-return\ncompensation is largest when the portfolios are constrained to require higher\nreturns. The paper shows that it can be important to model the non-normality in\nuncertainty, and not just assume normal distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 20:28:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Chatsanga", "Nonthachote", ""], ["Parkes", "Andrew J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01503", "submitter": "Marius Hofert", "authors": "Klaus Herrmann, Marius Hofert, Melina Mailhot", "title": "Multivariate Geometric Expectiles", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A generalization of expectiles for d-dimensional multivariate distribution\nfunctions is introduced.
