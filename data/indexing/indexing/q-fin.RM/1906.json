It is based on a novel concept called portfolio dimensionality\nthat connects diversification to the non-Gaussianity of portfolio returns and\ncan typically be defined in terms of the ratio of risk measures which are\nhomogenous functions of equal degree. The latter arises naturally due to our\nrequirement that diversification measures should be leverage invariant. We\nintroduce this new framework and argue the benefits relative to existing\nmeasures of diversification in the literature, before addressing the question\nof optimizing diversification or, equivalently, dimensionality. Maximising\nportfolio dimensionality leads to highly non-trivial optimization problems with\nobjective functions which are typically non-convex and potentially have\nmultiple local optima. Two complementary global optimization algorithms are\nthus presented. For problems of moderate size and more akin to asset allocation\nproblems, a deterministic Branch and Bound algorithm is developed, whereas for\nproblems of larger size a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on\nGradient Langevin Dynamics is given. We demonstrate analytically and through\nnumerical experiments that the framework reflects the desired properties often\ndiscussed in the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 16:43:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2019 13:43:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2019 14:49:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Barkhagen", "Mathias", ""], ["Fleming", "Brian", ""], ["Quiles", "Sergio Garcia", ""], ["Gondzio", "Jacek", ""], ["Kalcsics", "Joerg", ""], ["Kroeske", "Jens", ""], ["Sabanis", "Sotirios", ""], ["Staal", "Arne", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.00946", "submitter": "Alex Garivaltis", "authors": "Alex Garivaltis", "title": "The Laws of Motion of the Broker Call Rate in the United States", "comments": "40 pages, 15 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Financial Studies, 7(4), 56 (2019)", "doi": "10.3390/ijfs7040056", "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.EM econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.GN q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, which is the third installment of the author's trilogy on\nmargin loan pricing, we analyze $1,367$ monthly observations of the U.S. broker\ncall money rate, which is the interest rate at which stock brokers can borrow\nto fund their margin loans to retail clients.

If we live in the Black-Scholes world, the brokers\nare presumably making arbitrage profits by shorting dynamically precise amounts\nof their clients' portfolios. First, we extend Fortune's (2000) application of\nMerton's (1974) no-arbitrage approach to allow for brokers that can only revise\ntheir hedges finitely many times during the term of the loan. We show that\nextremely small differences in the revision frequency can easily explain the\nobserved variation in margin loan pricing. In fact, four additional revisions\nper three-day period serve to explain all of the currently observed\nheterogeneity.

The broker\nsolves a general stochastic control problem that yields simple and pleasant\nformulas for the optimal interest rate and the net interest margin.

The\nfirst model considered is the so-called minimal market model, where pricing is\nachieved using the benchmark approach. The benchmark approach was introduced by\nPlaten in 2001 and has received wide acceptance in the finance community. Under\nthis approach, valuing an asset involves determining the minimum-valued\nreplicating portfolio, with reference to the growth optimal portfolio under the\nreal-world probability measure, and it both subsumes classical risk-neutral\npricing as a particular case and extends it to situations where risk-neutral\npricing is impossible.
