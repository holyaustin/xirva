The modular structure of the framework allows to accommodate\nfor a variety of shock scenarios, methods to estimate interbank exposures and\nmechanisms of distress propagation. The main features are as follows. First,\nthe framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects\n(i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced\nin the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible\nfire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks\non individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their\nvulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it\nincludes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with\nfamiliar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform\nrobustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a\nmodule for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are\ncoherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration,\nwe carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over\nthe years 2008-2013. We find that second-round and third-round effects dominate\nfirst-round effects, therefore suggesting that most current stress-test\nframeworks might lead to a severe underestimation of systemic risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 17:08:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 19:01:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Battiston", "Stefano", ""], ["D'Errico", "Marco", ""], ["Gurciullo", "Stefano", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.02034", "submitter": "Alexander Sokol", "authors": "Alexander Sokol", "title": "A generic model for spouse's pensions with a view towards the\n  calculation of liabilities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Insurance: Mathematics and Economics, Vol. 65, pp. 198--207, 2015", "doi": "10.1016/j.insmatheco.2015.09.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a generic model for spouse's pensions.

In the American\nEconomic Review, Elliott, Golub and Jackson proposed a simple model for\ncapturing the dynamics of complex financial networks. In Elliott, Golub and\nJackson's model, each institution in the network can buy underlying assets or\npercentage shares in other institutions (cross-holdings) and if any\ninstitution's value drops below a critical threshold value, its value suffers\nan additional failure cost.\n  This work shows that even in simple model put forward by Elliott, Golub and\nJackson there are fundamental barriers to understanding the risks that are\ninherent in a network. First, if institutions are not required to maintain a\nminimum amount of self-holdings, an $\\epsilon$ change in investments by a\nsingle institution can have an arbitrarily magnified influence on the net worth\nof the institutions in the system. This sensitivity result shows that if\ninstitutions have small self-holdings, then estimating the market value of an\ninstitution requires almost perfect information about every cross-holding in\nthe system. Second, we show that even if a regulator has complete information\nabout all cross-holdings in the system, it may be computationally intractable\nto even estimate the number of failures that could be caused by an arbitrarily\nsmall shock to the system. Together, these results show that any uncertainty in\nthe cross-holdings or values of the underlying assets can be amplified by the\nnetwork to arbitrarily large uncertainty in the valuations of institutions in\nthe network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 10:24:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:54:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hemenway", "Brett", ""], ["Khanna", "Sanjeev", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.08123", "submitter": "Tobias Fissler", "authors": "Tobias Fissler, Johanna F.
