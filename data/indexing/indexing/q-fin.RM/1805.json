The list is almost\nendless: from XVAs to FRTB, stress testing programs, etc. These computations\nrequire from several hundred up to a few million revaluations. The cost of\nimplementing these calculations via a \"brute-force\" full revaluation is\nenormous. There is now a strong demand in the industry for algorithmic\nsolutions to the challenge. In this paper we show a solution based on Chebyshev\ninterpolation techniques. It is based on the demonstrated fact that those\ninterpolants show exponential convergence for the vast majority of pricing\nfunctions that an institution has. In this paper we elaborate on the theory\nbehind it and extend those techniques to any dimensionality. We then approach\nthe problem from a practical standpoint, illustrating how it can be applied to\nmany of the challenges the industry is currently facing. We show that the\ncomputational effort of many current risk calculations can be decreased orders\nof magnitude with the proposed techniques, without compromising accuracy.\nIllustrative examples include XVAs and IMM on exotics, XVA sensitivities,\nInitial Margin Simulations, IMA-FRTB and AAD.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2018 16:25:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Laris", "Mariano Zeron Medina", ""], ["Ruiz", "Ignacio", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.03890", "submitter": "Jianfeng Yao", "authors": "Shige Peng, Shuzhen Yang and Jianfeng Yao", "title": "Improving Value-at-Risk prediction under model uncertainty", "comments": "42 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Several well-established benchmark predictors exist for Value-at-Risk (VaR),\na major instrument for financial risk management.
