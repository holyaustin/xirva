One\nimportant line of research is concerned with mechanisms of clearing, that is,\nthe mechanism by which mutual debts are repaid, in the regular regime, or in a\ndefault regime. One of the first models of a clearing mechanism was proposed by\nEisenberg and Noe and is based on the three rules: limited liability, the\npriority of debt claims over the shareholders' interests, and the equal\npriority of debts (pro-rata rule).

In\nthis paper, we propose a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness\nof clearing vector applicable to an arbitrary topology of the financial\nnetwork.

The dependence structure is defined\nby a mixed Bernstein copula which represents a generalization of the well-known\nArchimedean copulas. Using this new copula, the probability density function\nand the cumulative distribution function of the aggregate risk are obtained.\nThen, closed-form expressions for basic risk measures, such as tail\nvalue-at-risk(TVaR) and TVaR-based allocations, are derived.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2021 19:06:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Marri", "Fouad", ""], ["Moutanabbir", "Khouzeima", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.15790", "submitter": "Fabio Angelo Maccheroni", "authors": "Erio Castagnoli, Giacomo Cattelan, Fabio Maccheroni, Claudio Tebaldi,\n  Ruodu Wang", "title": "Star-shaped Risk Measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.TH math.FA q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper monetary risk measures that are positively superhomogeneous,\ncalled star-shaped risk measures, are characterized and their properties\nstudied. The measures in this class, which arise when the controversial\nsubadditivity property of coherent risk measures is dispensed with and positive\nhomogeneity is weakened, include all practically used risk measures, in\nparticular, both convex risk measures and Value-at-Risk.\n  From a financial viewpoint, our relaxation of convexity is necessary to\nquantify the capital requirements for risk exposure in the presence of\ncompetitive delegation or robust aggregation mechanisms.\n  From a decision theoretical perspective, star-shaped risk measures emerge\nfrom variational preferences when risk mitigation strategies can be adopted by\na rational decision maker.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 17:33:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Castagnoli", "Erio", ""], ["Cattelan", "Giacomo", ""], ["Maccheroni", "Fabio", ""], ["Tebaldi", "Claudio", ""], ["Wang", "Ruodu", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16918", "submitter": "Olivier Feron", "authors": "Thomas Deschatre and Olivier F\\'eron and Pierre Gruet", "title": "A survey of electricity spot and futures price models for risk\n  management applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This review presents the set of electricity price models proposed in the\nliterature since the opening of power markets.

Using risk theory techniques, we determine the probability of a\nhousehold falling under the poverty line. Microinsurance is then introduced to\nanalyse its impact as an insurance solution for the lower income class. Our\nresults validate those previously obtained with this type of model, showing\nthat microinsurance alone is not sufficient to reduce the probability of\nfalling into the area of poverty for specific groups of people, since premium\npayments constrain households' capital growth. This indicates the need for\nadditional aid particularly from the government.
