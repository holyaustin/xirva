Economic agents\nare attracted to each other to exchange `economic energy', forming a network of\ntrades. When the capital level of one economic agent drops below a minimum, the\neconomic agent becomes insolvent. The insolvency of one single economic agent\naffects the economic energy of all its neighbours which thus become susceptible\nto insolvency, being able to trigger a chain of insolvencies (avalanche). We\nshow that the distribution of avalanche sizes follows a power-law whose\nexponent depends on the minimum capital level. Furthermore, we present evidence\nthat under an increase in the minimum capital level, large crashes will be\navoided only if one assumes that agents will accept a drop in business levels,\nwhile keeping their trading attitudes and policies unchanged. The alternative\nassumption, that agents will try to restore their business levels, may lead to\nthe unexpected consequence that large crises occur with higher probability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 15:32:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 18:48:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["da Cruz", "Jo\u00e3o P.", ""], ["Lind", "Pedro G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1460", "submitter": "Aleksandar Mijatovic", "authors": "Aleksandar Mijatovic and Martijn R.

However in\npractice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential\nshortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically\nincomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we\ninvestigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is\nwell-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the\nrisk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)\ndelta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which\nnevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims.

This\npaper examines three tail quantile-based risk measures applied to the\nestimation of extreme agricultural financial risk for corn and soybean\nproduction in the US: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES) and Spectral\nRisk Measures (SRMs). We use Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model the tail\nreturns and present results for these three different risk measures using\nagricultural futures market data. We compare the estimated risk measures in\nterms of their size and precision, and find that they are all considerably\nhigher than normal estimates; they are also quite uncertain, and become more\nuncertain as the risks involved become more extreme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:45:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cotter", "John", ""], ["Dowd", "Kevin", ""], ["Morgan", "Wyn", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5965", "submitter": "John Cotter", "authors": "John Cotter", "title": "Scaling conditional tail probability and quantile estimators", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel procedure for scaling relatively high frequency tail\nprobability and quantile estimates for the conditional distribution of returns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:48:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cotter", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5966", "submitter": "John Cotter", "authors": "John Cotter and Jim Hanly", "title": "Hedging: Scaling and the Investor Horizon", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper examines the volatility and covariance dynamics of cash and\nfutures contracts that underlie the Optimal Hedge Ratio (OHR) across different\nhedging time horizons. We examine whether hedge ratios calculated over a short\nterm hedging horizon can be scaled and successfully applied to longer term\nhorizons. We also test the equivalence of scaled hedge ratios with those\ncalculated directly from lower frequency data and compare them in terms of\nhedging effectiveness. Our findings show that the volatility and covariance\ndynamics may differ considerably depending on the hedging horizon and this\ngives rise to significant differences between short term and longer term\nhedges. Despite this, scaling provides good hedging outcomes in terms of risk\nreduction which are comparable to those based on direct estimation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 15:50:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cotter", "John", ""], ["Hanly", "Jim", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.5968", "submitter": "John Cotter", "authors": "John Cotter and Jim Hanly", "title": "Time Varying Risk Aversion: An Application to Energy Hedging", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Risk aversion is a key element of utility maximizing hedge strategies;\nhowever, it has typically been assigned an arbitrary value in the literature.\nThis paper instead applies a GARCH-in-Mean (GARCH-M) model to estimate a\ntime-varying measure of risk aversion that is based on the observed risk\npreferences of energy hedging market participants.
