We find that its probability\ndistribution seems to be stable over different time scales, a stylized fact\nobserved in many different financial time series. However, an in-depth analysis\nof the data using maximum likelihood estimation and different goodness-of-fit\ntests rejects the L\\'evy-stable law as a plausible underlying probabilistic\nmodel. The analysis shows that the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution\nprovides an overall fit for the data better than any of the other subclasses of\nthe family of the Generalized Hyperbolic distributions and certainly much\nbetter than the L\\'evy-stable laws. Furthermore, the right (resp. left) tail of\nthe distribution seems to follow a power-law with exponent \\alpha=4.60 (resp.\n\\alpha =4.28). Finally, we present evidence that the observed stability is due\nto temporal correlations or non-stationarities of the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 18:51:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Su\u00e1rez-Garc\u00eda", "Pablo", ""], ["G\u00f3mez-Ullate", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0763", "submitter": "Dylan Possama\\\"i", "authors": "M.
