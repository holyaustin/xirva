In our\nstylized description, all properties of a given firm are captured by its\neffective credit rating, which follows a simple dynamics of co-evolution with\nthe credit ratings of the other firms in our economic network. The dynamics\nresembles the evolution of Potts spin-glass with external global field\ncorresponding to a panic effect in the economy. The existence of a global phase\ntransition, between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, explains the large\nsusceptibility of the system to negative shocks. We show that bailing out the\nfirst few defaulting firms does not solve the problem, but does have the effect\nof alleviating considerably the global shock, as measured by the fraction of\nfirms that are not defaulting as a consequence. This beneficial effect is the\ncounterpart of the large vulnerability of the system of coupled firms, which\nare both the direct consequences of the collective self-organized endogenous\nbehaviors of the credit ratings of the firms in our economic network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 20:34:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:11:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sieczka", "Pawe\u0142", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""], ["Ho\u0142yst", "Janusz A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2282", "submitter": "Philip Maymin", "authors": "Philip Maymin", "title": "The Hazards of Propping Up: Bubbles and Chaos", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Business and Finance Research 2009, vol.\n  3, no. 2, 83-93", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the current environment of financial distress, many governments are likely\nto soon become major holders of financial assets, but the policy debate focuses\nonly on the likelihood and extent of short-term market stabilization.

While it is conceptually easy to estimate loss\ndistributions conditional on default events by means of Monte Carlo simulation,\nit becomes impractical for two or more simultaneous defaults as then the\nconditioning event is extremely rare. We provide an analytical approach to the\ncalculation of the conditional loss distribution for the CreditRisk+ portfolio\nmodel with independent random loss given default distributions. The analytical\nsolution for this case can be used to check the accuracy of an approximation to\nthe conditional loss distribution whereby the unconditional model is run with\nstressed input probabilities of default (PDs). It turns out that this\napproximation is unbiased.
