The proposed\napproach extends the usual market-risk measure, ie, Value-at-Risk (VaR) at a\nshort-term horizon and 99% confidence level, by properly applying a scaling on\nthe short-term Profit-and-Loss (P&L) distribution. Besides the standard\nsquare-root-of-time scaling, based on normality assumptions, we consider two\nleptokurtic probability density function classes for fitting empirical P&L\ndatasets and derive accurately their scaling behaviour in light of the Central\nLimit Theorem, interpreting time scaling as a convolution problem. Our analyses\nresult in a range of possible VaR-scaling approaches depending on the\ndistribution providing the best fit to empirical data, the desired percentile\nlevel and the time horizon of the Economic Capital calculation. After assessing\nthe different approaches on a test equity trading portfolio, it emerges that\nthe choice of the VaR-scaling approach can affect substantially the Economic\nCapital calculation. In particular, the use of a convolution-based approach\ncould lead to significantly larger risk measures (by up to a factor of four)\nthan those calculated using Normal assumptions on the P&L distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2014 16:35:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Spadafora", "Luca", ""], ["Dubrovich", "Marco", ""], ["Terraneo", "Marcello", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.3086", "submitter": "Mauro  Ribeiro de Oliveira JR", "authors": "Mauro R.
