We provide here a comprehensive mathematical formulation\nof the model and show using martingale arguments in the spirit of Sannikov [18]\nhow the maximization problem with implicit constraints faced by investors can\nbe reduced to a classical stochastic control problem. The approach has the\nadvantage of avoiding the more general techniques based on forward-backward\nstochastic differential equations described in [6] and leads to a simple\nrecursive system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We provide a solution to\nour problem by a verification argument and give an explicit description of both\nthe value function and the optimal contract. Finally, we study the limit case\nwhere the bank is no longer impatient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 18:39:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 17:06:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Pag\u00e8s", "Henri", ""], ["Possama\u00ef", "Dylan", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2532", "submitter": "Marco Bardoscia", "authors": "Marco Bardoscia, Roberto Bellotti", "title": "A Dynamical Approach to Operational Risk Measurement", "comments": "19 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Operational Risk 6-1 (2011), pp. 3-19", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a dynamical model for the estimation of Operational Risk in\nbanking institutions. Operational Risk is the risk that a financial loss occurs\nas the result of failed processes. Examples of operational losses are the ones\ngenerated by internal frauds, human errors or failed transactions. In order to\nencompass the most heterogeneous set of processes, in our approach the losses\nof each process are generated by the interplay among random noise, interactions\nwith other processes and the efforts the bank makes to avoid losses. We show\nhow some relevant parameters of the model can be estimated from a database of\nhistorical operational losses, validate the estimation procedure and test the\nforecasting power of the model. Some advantages of our approach over the\ntraditional statistical techniques are that it allows to follow the whole time\nevolution of the losses and to take into account different-time correlations\namong the processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Feb 2012 14:40:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Bellotti", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.3025", "submitter": "Reimer Kuehn", "authors": "Sebastian Heise and Reimer Kuehn", "title": "Derivatives and Credit Contagion in Interconnected Networks", "comments": "26 pages, 7 multi-part figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1140/epjb/e2012-20740-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The importance of adequately modeling credit risk has once again been\nhighlighted in the recent financial crisis. Defaults tend to cluster around\ntimes of economic stress due to poor macro-economic conditions, {\\em but also}\nby directly triggering each other through contagion. Although credit default\nswaps have radically altered the dynamics of contagion for more than a decade,\nmodels quantifying their impact on systemic risk are still missing. Here, we\nexamine contagion through credit default swaps in a stylized economic network\nof corporates and financial institutions. We analyse such a system using a\nstochastic setting, which allows us to exploit limit theorems to exactly solve\nthe contagion dynamics for the entire system. Our analysis shows that, by\ncreating additional contagion channels, CDS can actually lead to greater\ninstability of the entire network in times of economic stress. This is\nparticularly pronounced when CDS are used by banks to expand their loan books\n(arguing that CDS would offload the additional risks from their balance\nsheets). Thus, even with complete hedging through CDS, a significant loan book\nexpansion can lead to considerably enhanced probabilities for the occurrence of\nvery large losses and very high default rates in the system. Our approach adds\na new dimension to research on credit contagion, and could feed into a rational\nunderpinning of an improved regulatory framework for credit derivatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 12:55:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Heise", "Sebastian", ""], ["Kuehn", "Reimer", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.3755", "submitter": "Takayuki Osogami", "authors": "Takayuki Osogami", "title": "Iterated risk measures for risk-sensitive Markov decision processes with\n  discounted cost", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "UAI-P-2011-PG-573-580", "categories": "cs.GT cs.AI q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate a limitation of discounted expected utility, a standard\napproach for representing the preference to risk when future cost is\ndiscounted.
