Suppose\n(X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A\nrelevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of\ninfluence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways.\nIn this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of\nrisk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance,\ninsurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under\nthe assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and\nasymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful\nmodel classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive\nthe asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to\ninfinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in\nthe models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this\nreflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains\nsignificant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce\nan extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and\nMES for high thresholds t where little data are available.
