The\nequation of motion takes into account the interactions among different bank's\nprocesses, the spontaneous generation of losses via a noise term and the\nefforts made by the bank to avoid their occurrence. Since the model is very\ngeneral, it can be tailored on the internal organizational structure of a\nspecific bank by estimating some of its parameters from historical operational\nlosses. The model is exactly solved in the case in which there are no causal\nloops in the matrix of couplings and it is shown how the solution can be\nexploited to estimate also the parameters of the noise. The forecasting power\nof the model is investigated by using a fraction $f$ of simulated data to\nestimate the parameters, showing that for $f = 0.75$ the VaR can be forecast\nwith an error $\\simeq 10^{-3}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 21:12:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 08:09:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 09:59:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 15:22:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2011 09:00:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 12 Feb 2012 14:13:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bardoscia", "Marco", ""], ["Bellotti", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.0610", "submitter": "Samuel Cohen", "authors": "Samuel N.

The company, which faces\nconstant liability payments and has choices to choose various\nproduction/business policies from an available set of control policies with\ndifferent expected profits and risks, controls the business policy and dividend\npayout process to maximize the expected present value of the dividends until\nthe time of bankruptcy. However, if the dividend payout barrier is too low to\nbe acceptable, it may result in the company's bankruptcy soon. In order to\nprotect the shareholders' profits, the managements of the company impose a\nreasonable and normal constraint on their dividend strategy, that is, the\nbankrupt probability associated with the optimal dividend payout barrier should\nbe smaller than a given risk level within a fixed time horizon. This paper aims\nat working out the optimal control policy as well as optimal return function\nfor the company under bankrupt probability constraint by stochastic analysis,\nPDE methods and variational inequality approach.
