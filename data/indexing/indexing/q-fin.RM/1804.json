Crucially, a Markov property is introduced to capture time\ndependencies and to make our measures comparable across time. We apply the\nmodel on an original dataset of Austrian interbank exposures. The temporal span\nencompasses the onset and development of the financial crisis in 2008 as well\nas the beginnings of European sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Our analysis\nhighlights an overall increasing trend for network homogeneity, whereby core\nbanks have a tendency to distribute their market exposures more equally across\ntheir partners.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 12:33:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Aug 2018 09:05:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Hledik", "Juraj", ""], ["Rastelli", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02289", "submitter": "David Lee", "authors": "David Lee", "title": "Pricing Financial Derivatives Subject to Counterparty Risk and Credit\n  Value Adjustment", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.07843 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.GN q-fin.RM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article presents a generic model for pricing financial derivatives\nsubject to counterparty credit risk.
