Value-at-Risk is a\nstandard tool to measure and control the market risk of an asset or a\nportfolio, and it is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is\npartly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use\nof Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in\npresence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for\nValue-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a\nproduct partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition\nstructure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian\nstock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that\nProduct Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify\nmarket risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full\nagreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides\nricher information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence\nof outlying points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 13:45:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 13:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["De Giuli", "Maria Elena", ""], ["Delpini", "Danilo", ""], ["Tarantola", "Claudia", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.1393", "submitter": "Jason Morton", "authors": "I.
