We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture\nthe dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under\ndifferent gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty\nlevels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic\nfactor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six\ndifferent indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary\npolicy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of\nuncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe\nhaven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be\nsensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and\nto whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a\npositive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty\ncomposite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under\nnormal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio\ncomposed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2018 09:18:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bouoiyour", "Jamal", "", "CATT"], ["Selmi", "Refk", "", "CATT"], ["Wohar", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.08701", "submitter": "Fei Sun", "authors": "Fei Sun, Yijun Hu", "title": "Quasiconvex risk measures with markets volatility", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1806.01166", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Since the quasiconvex risk measures is a bigger class than the well known\nconvex risk measures, the study of quasiconvex risk measures makes sense\nespecially in the financial markets with volatility.

In particular, a key component of the\napproach - prescription of cost components to a risk-free money account,\ngenerates derivative prices that are not cleared by the markets that trade the\nderivative and its underlying securities. It also introduces several risk-free\npositions (accounts) that accrue at persistently non-zero spreads with respect\nto each other and the risk free rate. In the case of derivatives with\ncounterparty default risk [Burgard and Kjaer 2013] introduces an approach\nreferred to as semi-replication, which through the choice of cost components in\nthe money account results in derivative prices that carry arbitrage\nopportunities in the form of holding portfolio of counterparty's bonds versus a\nderivative position with it.\n  This paper derives no-arbitrage expressions for default-risky derivative\ncontracts with and without collateral, avoiding these inconsistencies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2018 19:48:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 16:01:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2018 00:48:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 24 Dec 2018 17:07:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Tumasyan", "Hovik", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.11290", "submitter": "Lioudmila Vostrikova", "authors": "Lioudmila Vostrikova (LAREMA), J\\'er\\^ome Spielmann (LAREMA)", "title": "On The Ruin Problem With Investment When The Risky Asset Is A\n  Semimartingale", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the ruin problem with investment in a general\nframework where the business part X is a L{\\'e}vy process and the return on\ninvestment R is a semimartingale.
