This instability was first\ndiscovered on the special example of Expected Shortfall which is used here both\nas an illustration and as a prompt for generalization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Mar 2008 10:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2008 19:30:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 17:13:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kondor", "Imre", ""], ["Varga-Haszonits", "Istvan", ""]]}]
