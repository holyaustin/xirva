The\ndistinctive feature of such processes is that the long-term aggregate return\ndistributions can substantially deviate from the asymptotic Gaussian limit for\nvery long horizons. We introduce the notion of correlation surface as a\nconvenient tool for comparing portfolio credit loss generating models and\npricing synthetic CDO tranches. Analyzing alternative specifications of the\nunderlying dynamics, we conclude that the asymmetric models with TARCH\nvolatility specification are the preferred choice for generating significant\nand persistent credit correlation skews. The characteristic dependence of the\ncorrelation skew on term to maturity and portfolio hazard rate in these models\nhas a significant impact on both relative value analysis and risk management of\nCDO tranches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2010 22:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Berd", "Arthur M.", ""], ["Engle", "Robert F.", ""], ["Voronov", "Artem", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.1867", "submitter": "Frederic Planchet", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Planchet (SAF), Pierre-Emanuel Th\\'erond (SAF)", "title": "Allocation d'actifs selon le crit\\`ere de maximisation des fonds propres\n  \\'economiques en assurance non-vie", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Bulletin Fran\\c{c}ais d'Actuariat 7, 13 (2007) 10...38", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The economic equities maximization criterion (MFPE) leads to the choice of\nfinancial portfolio, which maximizes the ratio of the expected value of the\ninsurance company on the capital. This criterion is presented in the framework\nof a non-life insurance company and is applied within the framework of the\nFrench legislation and in a lawful context inspired of the works in progress\nabout the European project Solvency 2. In the French regulation case, the\nrequired solvency margin does not depend of the asset allocation. It is quite\ndifferent in the Solvency 2 framework because the target capital has to control\nthe global risk of the company. And the financial risk takes part of this\nglobal risk. Thus the economic equities maximization criterion leads to search\na couple asset allocation / equities which solves a stochastic program. A\nnumerical illustration makes it possible to analyze the consequences of the\nintroduction of a Solvency 2 framework on the technical reserves and the\nequities of a non-life insurance company and on the optimal allocation due to\nthe economic equities maximization criterion. Finally, the impact of a\nmisspecification of the risky asset model on the optimal allocation is\nillustrated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2010 20:00:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Planchet", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "SAF"], ["Th\u00e9rond", "Pierre-Emanuel", "", "SAF"]]}, {"id": "1001.1908", "submitter": "Frederic Planchet", "authors": "Jean-Paul F\\'elix (SAF), Fr\\'ed\\'eric Planchet (SAF)", "title": "Mesure des risques de march\\'e et de souscription vie en situation\n  d'information incompl\\`ete pour un portefeuille de pr\\'evoyance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Bulletin Fran\\c{c}ais d'Actuariat 9, 18 (2009) 79...105", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the framework of Embedded Value new standards, namely the MCEV norms, the\nlatest principles published in June 2008 address the issue of market and\nunderwriting risks measurement by using stochastic models of projection and\nvalorization.

The surrender charge of a life annuity is a proportion\nof its value. Ruin occurs when the total of the value of the risky and riskless\nassets and the surrender value of the life annuity reaches zero. We find the\noptimal investment strategy and optimal annuity purchase and surrender\nstrategies in two situations: (i) the value of the risky and riskless assets is\nallowed to be negative, with the imputed surrender value of the life annuity\nkeeping the total positive; or (ii) the value of the risky and riskless assets\nis required to be non-negative. In the first case, although the individual has\nthe flexiblity to buy or sell at any time, we find that the individual will not\nbuy a life annuity unless she can cover all her consumption via the annuity and\nshe will never sell her annuity. In the second case, the individual surrenders\njust enough annuity income to keep her total assets positive. However, in this\nsecond case, the individual's annuity purchasing strategy depends on the size\nof the proportional surrender charge. When the charge is large enough, the\nindividual will not buy a life annuity unless she can cover all her\nconsumption, the so-called safe level. When the charge is small enough, the\nindividual will buy a life annuity at a wealth lower than this safe level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jan 2010 19:49:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Ting", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.5058", "submitter": "Abhimanyu Mitra", "authors": "Abhimanyu Mitra, Sidney I.
