Further, we consider the problem with special ambiguity sets. In\nparticular we are able to derive some cases where the robust optimization\nproblem coincides with the minimization of a coherent risk measure. In the\nfinal section we discuss two applications: A robust LQ problem and a robust\nproblem for managing regenerative energy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2020 11:45:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e4uerle", "Nicole", ""], ["Glauner", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15128", "submitter": "Alexandre Carbonneau", "authors": "Alexandre Carbonneau", "title": "Deep Hedging of Long-Term Financial Derivatives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for global hedging\nof long-term financial derivatives. A similar setup as in Coleman et al. (2007)\nis considered with the risk management of lookback options embedded in\nguarantees of variable annuities with ratchet features. The deep hedging\nalgorithm of Buehler et al. (2019a) is applied to optimize neural networks\nrepresenting global hedging policies with both quadratic and non-quadratic\npenalties. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first paper that\npresents an extensive benchmarking of global policies for long-term contingent\nclaims with the use of various hedging instruments (e.g. underlying and\nstandard options) and with the presence of jump risk for equity. Monte Carlo\nexperiments demonstrate the vast superiority of non-quadratic global hedging as\nit results simultaneously in downside risk metrics two to three times smaller\nthan best benchmarks and in significant hedging gains. Analyses show that the\nneural networks are able to effectively adapt their hedging decisions to\ndifferent penalties and stylized facts of risky asset dynamics only by\nexperiencing simulations of the financial market exhibiting these features.\nNumerical results also indicate that non-quadratic global policies are\nsignificantly more geared towards being long equity risk which entails earning\nthe equity risk premium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2020 21:57:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Carbonneau", "Alexandre", ""]]}]
