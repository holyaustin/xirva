Although\nmany academics, practitioners and policy makers have studied questions related\nto collapsing asset price bubbles, there is little consensus yet about their\ncauses and effects. This review and essay evaluates some of the hypotheses\noffered to explain the market crashes that often follow asset price bubbles.\nStarting from historical accounts and syntheses of past bubbles and crashes, we\nput the problem in perspective with respect to the development of the efficient\nmarket hypothesis. We then present the models based on heterogeneous agents and\nthe limits to arbitrage that prevent rational agents from bursting bubbles\nbefore they inflate. Then, we explore another set of explanations of why\nrational traders would be led to actually profit from and surf on bubbles, by\nanticipating the behavior of noise traders or by realizing the difficulties in\nsynchronizing their actions. We then end by discussing a complex system\napproach of social imitation leading to collective market regimes like herding\nand the phenomenon of bifurcation (or phase transition) that rationalize what\ncrash can occur in unstable market regimes. The key insight is that diagnosing\nbubbles may be feasible when taking into account the positive feedback\nmechanisms that give rise to transient \"super-exponential\" price growth, the\nbubbles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 18:25:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kaizoji", "T.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3381", "submitter": "Noufel Frikha", "authors": "Olivier Aj Bardou (PMA, GDF-RDD), Noufel Frikha (PMA, GDF-RDD), G.\n  Pag\\`es (PMA)", "title": "Computation of VaR and CVaR using stochastic approximations and\n  unconstrained importance sampling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) are two risk\nmeasures which are widely used in the practice of risk management.

The convergence\nrate of this algorithm to its target satisfies a Gaussian Central Limit\nTheorem. As a second step, in order to speed up the initial procedure, we\npropose a recursive importance sampling (I.S.) procedure which induces a\nsignificant variance reduction of both VaR and CVaR procedures. This idea,\nwhich goes back to the seminal paper of B. Arouna, follows a new approach\nintroduced by V. Lemaire and G. Pag\\`es. Finally, we consider a deterministic\nmoving risk level to speed up the initialization phase of the algorithm. We\nprove that the convergence rate of the resulting procedure is ruled by a\nCentral Limit Theorem with minimal variance and its efficiency is illustrated\nby considering several typical energy portfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2008 20:02:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Jan 2009 16:22:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2009 15:14:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 7 Nov 2009 05:54:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 3 Dec 2010 11:26:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bardou", "Olivier Aj", "", "PMA, GDF-RDD"], ["Frikha", "Noufel", "", "PMA, GDF-RDD"], ["Pag\u00e8s", "G.", "", "PMA"]]}, {"id": "0812.3705", "submitter": "Agostino Capponi", "authors": "Damiano Brigo and Agostino Capponi", "title": "Bilateral counterparty risk valuation with stochastic dynamical models\n  and application to Credit Default Swaps", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the general arbitrage-free valuation framework for counterparty\nrisk adjustments in presence of bilateral default risk, including default of\nthe investor. We illustrate the symmetry in the valuation and show that the\nadjustment involves a long position in a put option plus a short position in a\ncall option, both with zero strike and written on the residual net value of the\ncontract at the relevant default times. We allow for correlation between the\ndefault times of the investor, counterparty and underlying portfolio risk\nfactors. We use arbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models. We then specialize\nour analysis to Credit Default Swaps (CDS) as underlying portfolio,\ngeneralizing the work of Brigo and Chourdakis (2008) [5] who deal with\nunilateral and asymmetric counterparty risk. We introduce stochastic intensity\nmodels and a trivariate copula function on the default times exponential\nvariables to model default dependence. Similarly to [5], we find that both\ndefault correlation and credit spread volatilities have a relevant and\nstructured impact on the adjustment. Differently from [5], the two parties will\nnow agree on the credit valuation adjustment. We study a case involving British\nAirways, Lehman Brothers and Royal Dutch Shell, illustrating the bilateral\nadjustments in concrete crisis situations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Dec 2008 05:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2009 16:33:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 02:21:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 18 Nov 2009 23:28:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Capponi", "Agostino", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4210", "submitter": "Damiano  Brigo", "authors": "Damiano Brigo, Antonio Dalessandro, Matthias Neugebauer, Fares Triki", "title": "A Stochastic Processes Toolkit for Risk Management", "comments": "Updated version accepted for publication in the Journal of Risk\n  Management for Financial Institutions", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In risk management it is desirable to grasp the essential statistical\nfeatures of a time series representing a risk factor.

The reader may also use these models as building blocks to build\nmore complex models, although for a number of risk management applications the\nmodels developed here suffice for the first step in the quantitative analysis.\nThe broad qualitative features addressed here are {fat tails} and {mean\nreversion}. We give some orientation on the initial choice of a suitable\nstochastic process and then explain how the process parameters can be estimated\nbased on historical data. Once the process has been calibrated, typically\nthrough maximum likelihood estimation, one may simulate the risk factor and\nbuild future scenarios for the risky portfolio. On the terminal simulated\ndistribution of the portfolio one may then single out several risk measures,\nalthough here we focus on the stochastic processes estimation preceding the\nsimulation of the risk factors Finally, this first survey report focuses on\nsingle time series. Correlation or more generally dependence across risk\nfactors, leading to multivariate processes modeling, will be addressed in\nfuture work.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2008 15:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Dalessandro", "Antonio", ""], ["Neugebauer", "Matthias", ""], ["Triki", "Fares", ""]]}]
