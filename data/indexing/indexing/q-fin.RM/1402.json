By utilizing the entire\nrange of conditional quantile functions, especially higher quantile levels, we\ndetail how quantile regression is capable of providing an accurate estimation\nof risk margin and an overview of implied capital based on the historical\nvolatility of a general insurers loss portfolio. Two modelling frameworks are\nconsidered based around parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models\nwhich we develop specifically in this insurance setting.\n  In the parametric quantile regression framework, several models including the\nflexible generalized beta distribution family, asymmetric Laplace (AL)\ndistribution and power Pareto distribution are considered under a Bayesian\nregression framework. The Bayesian posterior quantile regression models in each\ncase are studied via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling strategies.\n  In the nonparametric quantile regression framework, that we contrast to the\nparametric Bayesian models, we adopted an AL distribution as a proxy and\ntogether with the parametric AL model, we expressed the solution as a scale\nmixture of uniform distributions to facilitate implementation. The models are\nextended to adopt dynamic mean, variance and skewness and applied to analyze\ntwo real loss reserve data sets to perform inference and discuss interesting\nfeatures of quantile regression for risk margin calculations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 14:13:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dong", "Alice X.

In his model, each bank has only two\ncounter-party neighbors, a bank fails due to the counter-party risk only if at\nleast one of its two neighbors default, and such a counter-party risk is a low\nprobability event. Informally, the author shows that the banks will hedge their\nasset risks by appropriate OTC contracts, and, though it may be socially\noptimal to insure against counter-party risk, in equilibrium banks will {\\em\nnot} choose to insure this low probability event.\n  In this paper, we consider the above model for more general network\ntopologies, namely when each node has exactly 2r counter-party neighbors for\nsome integer r>0. We extend the analysis of [1] to show that as the number of\ncounter-party neighbors increase the probability of counter-party risk also\nincreases, and in particular the socially optimal solution becomes privately\nsustainable when each bank hedges its risk to at least n/2 banks, where n is\nthe number of banks in the network, i.e., when 2r is at least n/2, banks not\nonly hedge their asset risk but also hedge its counter-party risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 05:54:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["DasGupta", "Bhaskar", ""], ["Kaligounder", "Lakshmi", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.5352", "submitter": "Konstantinos Spiliopoulos", "authors": "Konstantinos Spiliopoulos", "title": "Systemic Risk and Default Clustering for Large Financial Systems", "comments": "in Large Deviations and Asymptotic Methods in Finance, (Editors: P.\n  Friz, J.
