Assumptions we impose on\nloss functions and contingent claims are very mild. We prove that the upper and\nlower bounds of good deal pricing bounds are expressed by convex risk measures\non Orlicz hearts. In addition, we obtain its representation with the minimal\npenalty function. Moreover, we give a representation, for two simple cases, of\ngood deal bounds and calculate the optimal strategies when a claim is traded at\nthe upper or lower bounds of its good deal pricing bound.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2008 08:27:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 07:16:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Arai", "Takuji", ""]]}]
