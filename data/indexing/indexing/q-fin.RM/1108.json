We call\nsuch a convex risk measure a good deal valuation and give a set of equivalent\nconditions for its existence in terms of market. A good deal valuation is\ncharacterized by several equivalent properties and in particular, we see that a\nconvex risk measure is a good deal valuation only if it is given as a risk\nindifference price. An application to shortfall risk measure is given. In\naddition, we show that the no-free-lunch (NFL) condition is equivalent to the\nexistence of a relevant convex risk measure which is a good deal valuation. The\nrelevance turns out to be a condition for a good deal valuation to be\nreasonable. Further we investigate conditions under which any good deal\nvaluation is relevant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Aug 2011 08:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Arai", "Takuji", ""], ["Fukasawa", "Masaaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5098", "submitter": "Yuri A.
