Recently, Beale et\nal. (\"Individual versus systemic risk and the regulator's dilemma\", Proc Natl\nAcad Sci USA 108: 12647-12652, 2011) demonstrated that higher portfolio\ndiversity among banks would reduce systemic risk by decreasing the risk of\nsimultaneous defaults at the expense of a higher likelihood of individual\ndefaults. In practice, however, a bank default has an externality in that it\nundermines other banks' balance sheets. This paper explores how each of these\ndifferent sources of risk, simultaneity risk and externality, contributes to\nsystemic risk. The results show that the allocation of external assets that\nminimizes systemic risk varies with the topology of the financial network as\nlong as asset returns have negative correlations. In the model, a well-known\ncentrality measure, PageRank, reflects an appropriately defined \"infectiveness\"\nof a bank. An important result is that the most infective bank need not always\nbe the safest bank. Under certain circumstances, the most infective node should\nact as a firewall to prevent large-scale collective defaults.
