Out of it\ndifferent questions arise, relevant for applications and theory: What are the\nfactors which affect the degree of procyclicality? More specifically, how does\nthe choice of risk measure affect this? How does this behaviour vary with the\nchoice of realized volatility estimator? How do different underlying model\nassumptions influence the pro-cyclical effect? In this paper we consider three\ndifferent well-known risk measures (Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall,\nExpectile), the r-th absolute centred sample moment, for any integer $r>0$, as\nrealized volatility estimator (this includes the sample variance and the sample\nmean absolute deviation around the sample mean) and two models (either an iid\nmodel or an augmented GARCH($p$,$q$) model). We show that the strength of\nprocyclicality depends on these three factors, the choice of risk measure, the\nrealized volatility estimator and the model considered. But, no matter the\nchoices, the procyclicality will always be present.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 17:28:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e4utigam", "Marcel", ""], ["Kratz", "Marie", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.08374", "submitter": "Zhengkun Li", "authors": "Zhengkun Li, Minh-Ngoc Tran, Chao Wang, Richard Gerlach and Junbin Gao", "title": "A Bayesian Long Short-Term Memory Model for Value at Risk and Expected\n  Shortfall Joint Forecasting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.LG q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) are widely used in the\nfinancial sector to measure the market risk and manage the extreme market\nmovement.

A major difficulty arises\nsince OCEs are often time inconsistent. Nevertheless, via an enlargement of\nstate space we achieve a substitute of sorts for time consistency in fair\ngenerality. This allows us to derive a dynamic programming principle and thus\nrecover central results of (risk-neutral) stochastic control theory.
