Most of the literature has\nfocused on cash-additive risk measures, for which the eligible asset is a\nrisk-free bond, on the grounds that the general case can be reduced to the\ncash-additive case by a change of numeraire. However, discounting does not work\nin all financially relevant situations, typically when the eligible asset is a\ndefaultable bond. In this paper we fill this gap allowing for general eligible\nassets. We provide a variety of finiteness and continuity results for the\ncorresponding risk measures and apply them to risk measures based on\nValue-at-Risk and Tail Value-at-Risk on $L^p$ spaces, as well as to shortfall\nrisk measures on Orlicz spaces. We pay special attention to the property of\ncash subadditivity, which has been recently proposed as an alternative to cash\nadditivity to deal with defaultable bonds. For important examples, we provide\ncharacterizations of cash subadditivity and show that, when the eligible asset\nis a defaultable bond, cash subadditivity is the exception rather than the\nrule. Finally, we consider the situation where the eligible asset is not\nliquidly traded and the pricing rule is no longer linear. We establish when the\nresulting risk measures are quasiconvex and show that cash subadditivity is\nonly compatible with continuous pricing rules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 19:09:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Jun 2012 16:59:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 23 Sep 2012 19:00:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 11:24:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 16:23:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 06:25:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2013 15:00:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 10:44:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Farkas", "Walter", ""], ["Koch-Medina", "Pablo", ""], ["Munari", "Cosimo", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0715", "submitter": "Leonel P\\'erez-Hern\\'andez", "authors": "Daniel Hern\\'andez-Hern\\'andez and Leonel P\\'erez-Hern\\'andez", "title": "Robust utility maximization for L\\'evy processes: Penalization and\n  solvability", "comments": "24 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1205.3827", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the robust utility maximization problem for a market model\nbased on L\\'evy processes is analyzed.

Specifically, we show that the critical\nassumption used in Jarrow (2010, pg. 20), to derive the illusionary alpha\nresult, is based on a zero set for CAPM with Lebesgue measure zero. So\nconclusions based on that assumption may well have probability measure zero of\noccurrence as well. Technically, the existence of [Tanaka] local time on a zero\nset for CAPM implies existence of positive alphas. In fact, we show that\npositive alpha exists under the same scenarios of \"perpetual event swap\" and\n\"market systemic event\" Jarrow (2010) used to formulate the illusionary\npositive alpha result. First, we prove that as long as asset price volatility\nis greater than zero, systemic events like market crash will occur in finite\ntime almost surely. Thus creating an opportunity to hedge against that event.\nSecond, we find that Jarrow's \"false positive alpha\" variable constitutes\nportfolio manager reward for trading strategy. For instance, we show that\npositive alpha exists if portfolio managers develop hedging strategies based on\neither (1) an exotic [barrier] option on the underlying asset - with barrier\nhitting time motivated by the \"market systemic\" event, or (2) a swaption\nstrategy for the implied interest rate risk inherent in Jarrow's triumvirate of\nriskless rate of return, factor sensitivity exposure, and constant risk premium\nfor a perpetual event swap.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 17:42:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Charles-Cadogan", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.5393", "submitter": "Carmine De Franco", "authors": "Carmine De Franco, Peter Tankov and Xavier Warin", "title": "Numerical methods for the quadratic hedging problem in Markov models\n  with jumps", "comments": "37 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop algorithms for the numerical computation of the quadratic hedging\nstrategy in incomplete markets modeled by pure jump Markov process.
