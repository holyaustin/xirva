Our empirically driven credit model consists of interacting\ndefault intensities which ramp up and then decay after the occurrence of credit\nevents. Using the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe decomposition of the counterparty\nrisk price payment stream, we recover a closed-form representation for the risk\nminimizing strategy in terms of classical solutions to nonlinear recursive\nsystems of Cauchy problems. We discuss applications of our framework to the\nmost prominent class of credit derivatives, including credit swap and risky\nbond portfolios, as well as first-to-default claims.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 18:53:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bo", "Lijun", ""], ["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Ceci", "Claudia", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.01337", "submitter": "Marcin Pitera", "authors": "Felix Moldenhauer and Marcin Pitera", "title": "Backtesting Expected Shortfall: a simple recipe?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new backtesting framework for Expected Shortfall that could be\nused by the regulator.

Using this simple concept\ncombined with monotonicity of Expected Shortfall with respect to its target\nconfidence level we introduce a natural and efficient backtesting framework.\nOur test statistics is given by the biggest number of worst realisations for\nthe secured position that add up to a negative total. Surprisingly, this simple\nquantity could be used to construct an efficient backtesting framework for\nunconditional coverage of Expected Shortfall in a natural extension of the\nregulatory traffic-light approach for Value-at-Risk.
