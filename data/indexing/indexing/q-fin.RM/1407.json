Our aim here is to examine some of the popular \"average\" assumptions in\na more realistic setting of a stochastic model. Thus, we examine the contention\nthat investment in the stock market is similar to gambling in a casino, while\npurchasing companies, after due diligence, is safer under the premise that\nacting as a holding company that wholly owns other companies avoids some of the\nstock market risks. We show that the stock market index faithfully reflects its\ncompanies' profits at the time of their publication. We compare the shifted\nhistorical dynamics of the S\\&P500's aggregated financial earnings to its\nvalue, and find a high degree of correlation. We conclude that there is no\nbenefit to a pension fund in wholly owning a super trust. We verify, by\nexamining historical data, that stock earnings follow an exponential\n(geometric) Brownian motion and estimate its parameters. The robustness of this\nmodel is examined by an estimate of a pensioner's accumulated assets over a\nsaving period. We also estimate the survival probability and mean survival time\nof the accumulated individual fund with pension consumption over the residual\nlife of the pensioner.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 10:57:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Grimberg", "Paz", ""], ["Schuss", "Zeev", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1072", "submitter": "Alessandro Ramponi", "authors": "Alessandro Ramponi", "title": "On a Transform Method for the Efficient Computation of Conditional VaR\n  (and VaR) with Application to Loss Models with Jumps and Stochastic\n  Volatility", "comments": "23 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11009-015-9446-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we consider Fourier transform techniques to efficiently compute\nthe Value-at-Risk and the Conditional Value-at-Risk of an arbitrary loss random\nvariable, characterized by having a computable generalized characteristic\nfunction.

The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,\nleverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical\nleverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in\nwhich gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic\nmarket collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using\nsimplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the\nnature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.\nWe introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to\ncontinuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the\npolicy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the\nendogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there\nis always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,\ncountercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the\nimpact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness\nvia the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator\nrelaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and\ntightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the\namplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nchoice of parameters. Finally, we investigate fixed limits on leverage and show\nhow they can control the leverage cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 16:28:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Aug 2014 15:27:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Aymanns", "Christoph", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
