We argue that risk\nmeasures such as value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) are\nineffective in constraining such players. We show that, in many standard market\nmodels, product design aimed at utility maximization is not constrained at all\nby VaR or ES bounds: the maximized utility corresponding to the optimal payoff\nis the same with or without ES constraints. By contrast we show that, in\nreasonable markets, risk management constraints based on a second more\nconventional concave utility function can reduce the maximum S-shaped utility\nthat can be achieved by the investor, even if the constraining utility function\nis only rather modestly concave. It follows that product designs leading to\nunbounded S-shaped utilities will lead to unbounded negative expected\nconstraining utilities when measured with such conventional utility functions.\nTo prove these latter results we solve a general problem of optimizing an\ninvestor expected utility under risk management constraints where both investor\nand risk manager have conventional concave utility functions, but the investor\nhas limited liability. We illustrate our results throughout with the example of\nthe Black--Scholes option market. These results are particularly important\ngiven the historical role of VaR and that ES was endorsed by the Basel\ncommittee in 2012--2013.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Nov 2017 17:07:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jan 2018 12:45:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 15:28:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Armstrong", "John", ""], ["Brigo", "Damiano", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.02600", "submitter": "Brian Hanley", "authors": "Brian P.

This problem first surfaced with CDS contracts,\nwhich are part of a class of loan insurance I term a default insurance note.\n  Without an address to this problem, within the average range of returns for a\nlarge venture capital portfolio, a venture-bank makes less money the better\ntheir investments do, in a continuous function. The highest rate of return is a\ntotal loss, 64% more than a top portfolio.\n  Here, a strategy for removing this perverse incentive is defined, consisting\nof a clawback lien that returns part of the payment value as a lien on the firm\nthat is the beneficiary of the insurance. This is presented as the final major\ncomponent for implementing a default insurance note system so that\nventure-banking can operate to maximum benefit.
