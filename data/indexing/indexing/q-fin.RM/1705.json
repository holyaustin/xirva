Worldwide regulation oblige financial institutions to\nmanage and address model risk with the same severity as any other type of risk,\nwhich besides defines model risk as the potential for adverse consequences from\ndecisions based on incorrect and misused model outputs and reports. Model risk\nquantification is essential not only in meeting these requirements but for\ninstitution's basic internal operative.

In this article, we tackle this problem by\nassessing the risk of the portfolio through the \"amount of randomness\" conveyed\nby its returns. We achieve this by using an objective function that relies on\nthe exponential of R\\'enyi entropy, an information-theoretic criterion that\nprecisely quantifies the uncertainty embedded in a distribution, accounting for\nhigher-order moments. Compared to Shannon entropy, R\\'enyi entropy features a\nparameter that can be tuned to play around the notion of uncertainty. A\nGram-Charlier expansion shows that it controls the relative contributions of\nthe central (variance) and tail (kurtosis) parts of the distribution in the\nmeasure. We further rely on a non-parametric estimator of the exponential\nR\\'enyi entropy that extends a robust sample-spacings estimator initially\ndesigned for Shannon entropy. A portfolio selection application illustrates\nthat minimizing R\\'enyi entropy yields portfolios that outperform\nstate-of-the-art minimum variance portfolios in terms of risk-return-turnover\ntrade-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 May 2017 12:10:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 May 2017 11:14:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 13:59:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2018 14:47:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lassance", "Nathan", ""], ["Vrins", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.06899", "submitter": "Zhongmin Luo", "authors": "Raymond Brummelhuis and Zhongmin Luo", "title": "CDS Rate Construction Methods by Machine Learning Techniques", "comments": "51 pages; 21 Figures; 15 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.RM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Regulators require financial institutions to estimate counterparty default\nrisks from liquid CDS quotes for the valuation and risk management of OTC\nderivatives.
