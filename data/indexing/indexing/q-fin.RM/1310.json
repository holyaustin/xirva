The corresponding correlation matrix is constructed. It is\nfound that the distribution of a significant number of eigenvalues of the\nvolatility correlation matrix matches with the analytical result from the RMT.\nFurthermore, the empirical estimates of short and long-range correlations among\neigenvalues, which are within the RMT bounds, match with the analytical results\nfor Gaussian Orthogonal ensemble (GOE) of the RMT. To understand the\ninformation content of the largest eigenvectors, we estimate the contribution\nof GICS industry groups in each eigenvector. In comparison with eigenvectors of\ncorrelation matrix for price fluctuations, only few of the largest eigenvectors\nof volatility correlation matrix are dominated by a single industry group. We\nalso study correlations among `volatility return' and get similar results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Oct 2013 16:53:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Ajay", ""], ["Xu", "Dinghai", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6025", "submitter": "Iosif Pinelis", "authors": "Iosif Pinelis", "title": "An optimal three-way stable and monotonic spectrum of bounds on\n  quantiles: a spectrum of coherent measures of financial risk and economic\n  inequality", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Risks, 2(3):349--392 (September 2014)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.OC math.ST q-fin.RM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A certain spectrum, indexed by a\\in[0,\\infty], of upper bounds P_a(X;x) on\nthe tail probability P(X\\geq x), with P_0(X;x)=P(X\\geq x) and P_\\infty(X;x)\nbeing the best possible exponential upper bound on P(X\\geq x), is shown to be\nstable and monotonic in a, x, and X, where x is a real number and X is a random\nvariable. The bounds P_a(X;x) are optimal values in certain minimization\nproblems. The corresponding spectrum, also indexed by a\\in[0,\\infty], of upper\nbounds Q_a(X;p) on the (1-p)-quantile of X is stable and monotonic in a, p, and\nX, with Q_0(X;p) equal the largest (1-p)-quantile of X. In certain sense, the\nquantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are usually close enough to the true quantiles\nQ_0(X;p). Moreover, Q_a(X;p) is subadditive in X if a\\geq 1, as well as\npositive-homogeneous and translation-invariant, and thus is a so-called\ncoherent measure of risk. A number of other useful properties of the bounds\nP_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are established. In particular, quite similarly to the\nbounds P_a(X;x) on the tail probabilities, the quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) are the\noptimal values in certain minimization problems. This allows for a\ncomparatively easy incorporation of the bounds P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) into more\nspecialized optimization problems. It is shown that the minimization problems\nfor which P_a(X;x) and Q_a(X;p) are the optimal values are in a certain sense\ndual to each other; in the case a=\\infty this corresponds to the bilinear\nLegendre--Fenchel duality. In finance, the (1-p)-quantile Q_0(X;p) is known as\nthe value-at-risk (VaR), whereas the value of Q_1(X;p) is known as the\nconditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and also as the expected shortfall (ES),\naverage value-at-risk (AVaR), and expected tail loss (ETL). It is shown that\nthe quantile bounds Q_a(X;p) can be used as measures of economic inequality.\nThe spectrum parameter, a, may be considered an index of sensitivity to\nrisk/inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 19:58:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pinelis", "Iosif", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7128", "submitter": "Claudio Nordio", "authors": "Lorenzo Giada and Claudio Nordio", "title": "Restructuring the \"one-way CSA\" counterparty risk in a CDO", "comments": "8 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how to restructure the counterparty risk faced by the originator of a\nsecuritization or covered bond arising from an interest rate hedging swap\nassisted by a \"one-way\" collateral agreement.
