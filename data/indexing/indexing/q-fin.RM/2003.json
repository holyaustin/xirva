Furthermore, in a\nsecond phase the risk factors are regressed against the cashflow-paths to\nobtain approximations of pathwise option values. The regression step is carried\nout by ordinary least squares as well as neural networks, and it is shown that\nthe latter produces more accurate approximations.\n  The expected exposure is formulated, both in terms of the cashflow-paths and\nin terms of the pathwise option values and it is shown that a simple\nMonte-Carlo average yields accurate approximations in both cases. The potential\nfuture exposure is estimated by the empirical $\\alpha$-percentile.\n  Finally, it is shown that the expected exposures, as well as the potential\nfuture exposures can be computed under either, the risk neutral measure, or the\nreal world measure, without having to re-train the neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2020 10:08:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2020 16:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2020 13:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Andersson", "Kristoffer", ""], ["Oosterlee", "Cornelis", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.02173", "submitter": "Christian Furrer", "authors": "Marcus C.
