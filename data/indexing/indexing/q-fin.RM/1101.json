We analyze how the payout of claims is modified when\ncollateral margining is included in agreement with current ISDA documentation.\nWe then specialize our analysis to interest-rate swaps as underlying portfolio,\nand allow for mutual dependences between the default times of the investor and\nthe counterparty and the underlying portfolio risk factors. We use\narbitrage-free stochastic dynamical models, including also the effect of\ninterest rate and credit spread volatilities. The impact of re-hypotecation, of\ncollateral margining frequency and of dependencies on the bilateral\ncounterparty risk adjustment is illustrated with a numerical example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 15:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Pallavicini", "Andrea", ""], ["Papatheodorou", "Vasileios", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.3974", "submitter": "Guanghui Huang", "authors": "Guanghui Huang, Jianping Wan, Cheng Chen", "title": "An Active Margin System and its Application in Chinese Margin Lending\n  Market", "comments": "27 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In order to protect brokers from customer defaults in a volatile market, an\nactive margin system is proposed for the transactions of margin lending in\nChina. The probability of negative return under the condition that collaterals\nare liquidated in a falling market is used to measure the risk associated with\nmargin loans, and a recursive algorithm is proposed to calculate this\nprobability under a Markov chain model. The optimal maintenance margin ratio\ncan be given under the constraint of the proposed risk measurement for a\nspecified amount of initial margin. An example of such a margin system is\nconstructed and applied to $26,800$ margin loans of 134 stocks traded on the\nShanghai Stock Exchange. The empirical results indicate that the proposed\nmethod is an operational method for brokers to set margin system with a clearly\nspecified target of risk control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jan 2011 17:26:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Guanghui", ""], ["Wan", "Jianping", ""], ["Chen", "Cheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.4437", "submitter": "Philippe Barbe", "authors": "Ph.

In this article, we have extended the\nprevious studies of collateralized derivative pricing to more generic\nsituation, that is asymmetric and imperfect collateralization with the\nassociated counter party credit risk. By introducing the collateral coverage\nratio, our framework can handle these issues in an unified manner. Although the\nresultant pricing formula becomes non-linear FBSDE and cannot be solve exactly,\nthe fist order approximation is provided using Gateaux derivative. We have\nshown that it allows us to decompose the price of generic contract into three\nparts: market benchmark, bilateral credit value adjustment (CVA), and the\ncollateral cost adjustment (CCA) independent from the credit risk. We have\nstudied each term closely, and demonstrated the significant impact of\nasymmetric collateralization through CCA using the numerical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jan 2011 05:14:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 05:55:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 08:31:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 02:16:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Fujii", "Masaaki", ""], ["Takahashi", "Akihiko", ""]]}]
