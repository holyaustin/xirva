Financial institutions and banking\nregulators agree on this because on the one hand errors with ratings of\ncorporates or banks can have fatal consequences for the lending institutions\nand on the other hand errors by statistical methods can be minimised but not\ncompletely avoided. Nonetheless, rating overrides can be misused in order to\nconceal the real riskiness of borrowers or even entire portfolios. That is why\nrating overrides usually are strictly governed and carefully recorded. It is\nnot clear, however, which frequency of overrides is appropriate for a given\nrating model within a predefined time period. This paper argues that there is a\nnatural error rate associated with a statistical rating model that may be used\nto inform assessment of whether or not an observed override rate is adequate.\nThe natural error rate is closely related to the rating model's discriminatory\npower and can readily be calculated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Mar 2012 21:50:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Apr 2012 09:58:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 19:01:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 08:32:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Tasche", "Dirk", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.2564", "submitter": "Lorenzo Hern\\'andez", "authors": "Lorenzo Hern\\'andez, Jorge Tejero, Alberto Su\\'arez and Santiago\n  Carrillo-Men\\'endez", "title": "Percentiles of sums of heavy-tailed random variables: Beyond the\n  single-loss approximation", "comments": "18 pages, 20 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A perturbative approach is used to derive approximations of arbitrary order\nto estimate high percentiles of sums of positive independent random variables\nthat exhibit heavy tails.
