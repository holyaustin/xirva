The banks and investors share a\ncommon belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have\ndifferent objective functions; changes to this common belief result in\nportfolio adjustments and trade. Positive belief shocks induce banks to buy\nrisky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing\nnew short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets\nin order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and\nthey supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple\nmarket-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of\nequilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe),\ncausing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent.\nSuccessive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel;\nrather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their\ninitial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the\nexpansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can\nalso force larger price declines. Emergency asset price supports can be\nunderstood as attempts by a central bank to coordinate expectations on an\nequilibrium with solvency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Mar 2014 02:39:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Brummitt", "Charles D.", ""], ["Sethi", "Rajiv", ""], ["Watts", "Duncan J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.2060", "submitter": "Michael B.
