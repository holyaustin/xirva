We propose\ncapital equivalents to the Newton's laws of motion and on this basis we\ndetermine the most secure form of credit repayment with regard to maximisation\nof profit. Then we extend the Newton's laws to models in linear spaces of\narbitrary dimension with the help of matrix rates of return. The matrix rates\ndescribe the evolution of multidimensional capital and they are sensitive to\nboth quantitative changes of individual elements and flows between them. This\nallows us for simultaneous analysis of evolution of complex capital in both\ncontinuous and discrete time models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2008 17:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Szczypinska", "Anna", ""], ["Piotrowski", "Edward W.", ""]]}]
