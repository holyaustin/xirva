The covariance is\ndefined as a simple cross product of the returns, with weights that decay\nlogarithmically slowly. The key general properties of the covariance matrices\nare the following. The spectrum of the covariance is very static, except for\nthe top three to ten eigenvalues, and decay exponentially fast toward zero. The\nmean spectrum and spectral density show no particular feature that would\nseparate \"meaningful\" from \"noisy\" eigenvalues. The spectrum of the correlation\nis more static, with three to five eigenvalues that have distinct dynamics. The\nmean projector of rank k on the leading subspace shows instead that most of the\ndynamics occur in the eigenvectors, including deep in the spectrum. Together,\nthis implies that the reduction of the covariance to a few leading eigenmodes\nmisses most of the dynamics, and that a covariance estimator correctly\nevaluates both volatilities and correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 11:00:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zumbach", "Gilles", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1531", "submitter": "Gilles Zumbach", "authors": "Gilles Zumbach", "title": "Inference on multivariate ARCH processes with large sizes", "comments": "22 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The covariance matrix is formulated in the framework of a linear multivariate\nARCH process with long memory, where the natural cross product structure of the\ncovariance is generalized by adding two linear terms with their respective\nparameter. The residuals of the linear ARCH process are computed using\nhistorical data and the (inverse square root of the) covariance matrix. Simple\nmeasure of qualities assessing the independence and unit magnitude of the\nresidual distributions are proposed. The salient properties of the computed\nresiduals are studied for three data sets of size 54, 55 and 330. Both new\nterms introduced in the covariance help in producing uncorrelated residuals,\nbut the residual magnitudes are very different from unity. The large sizes of\nthe inferred residuals are due to the limited information that can be extracted\nfrom the empirical data when the number of time series is large, and denotes a\nfundamental limitation to the inference that can be achieved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 11:14:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zumbach", "Gilles", ""]]}]
