The models can be calibrated exactly to credit spreads using\nefficient closed-form formulas for default probabilities. Default events are\ncaused by the value of the firm assets hitting a safety threshold, which\ndepends on the financial situation of the company and on market conditions. In\nAT1P this default barrier is deterministic. Instead SBTV assumes two possible\nscenarios for the initial level of the default barrier, for taking into account\nuncertainty on balance sheet information. While in [19] and [15] the models are\nanalyzed across Parmalat's history, here we apply the models to exact\ncalibration of Lehman Credit Default Swap (CDS) data during the months\npreceding default, as the crisis unfolds. The results we obtain with AT1P and\nSBTV have reasonable economic interpretation, and are particularly realistic\nwhen SBTV is considered. The pricing of counterparty risk in an Equity Return\nSwap is a convenient application we consider, also to illustrate the\ninteraction of our credit models with equity models in hybrid products context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2009 15:28:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Morini", "Massimo", ""], ["Tarenghi", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4614", "submitter": "Arthur M.
