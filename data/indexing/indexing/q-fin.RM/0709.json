Exploring these in the simplest\ncontext of a finite time set and finite sample space, we find natural\nrisk-transfer and time-consistency properties for a firm seeking to spread its\nrisk across a group of subsidiaries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 13:51:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jobert", "A.", ""], ["Rogers", "L.
