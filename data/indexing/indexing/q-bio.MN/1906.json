In biological organisms, genetic activity is often highly nonlinear,\nmaking it difficult to design libraries of promoters to act as reporters of the\ncell state. We make use of the Koopman observability gramian to develop an\nalgorithm for optimal sensor (or reporter) placement for discrete time\nnonlinear dynamical systems to ease the difficulty of design of the promoter\nlibrary. This ease is enabled due to the fact that the Koopman operator\nrepresents the evolution of a nonlinear system linearly by lifting the states\nto an infinite-dimensional space of observables. The Koopman framework ideally\ndemands high temporal resolution, but data in biology are often sampled\nsparsely in time. Therefore we compute what we call the temporally fine-grained\nKoopman operator from the temporally coarse-grained Koopman operator, the\nlatter of which is identified from the sparse data. The optimal placement of\nsensors then corresponds to maximizing the observability of the fine-grained\nsystem.

We illustrate these\nidentifiability conditions with a simulated synthetic gene circuit model, the\nrepressilator. We illustrate how rank degeneracy in datasets results in\noverfitted nonlinear models of the repressilator, resulting in poor predictive\naccuracy. Our findings provide novel experimental design criteria for discovery\nof globally predictive nonlinear models of biological phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Jun 2019 00:33:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Sep 2019 20:54:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Boddupalli", "Nibodh", ""], ["Hasnain", "Aqib", ""], ["Nandanoori", "Sai Pushpak", ""], ["Yeung", "Enoch", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.12216", "submitter": "Mirko Pasquini", "authors": "Mirko Pasquini, David Angeli", "title": "On the robust existence of piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions for\n  hybrid models of gene regulatory networks", "comments": "Submitted to the 58th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control - Nice,\n  France", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SY cs.SY q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we addressed the problem of stability analysis for an uncertain\npiecewise affine model of a genetic regulatory network.

However, the\napplicability and accuracy presumptions of such algorithms remain unclear due\nto experimental heterogeneity. This paper assesses the performance of recent\nand successful network inference strategies under a novel, multifactorial\nevaluation framework in order to highlight pragmatic tradeoffs in experimental\ndesign. The effects of data quantity and systems perturbations are addressed,\nthereby formulating guidelines for efficient resource management.\n  Realistic data were generated from six widely used benchmark models of\nrhythmic and non-rhythmic gene regulatory systems with random perturbations\nmimicking the effect of gene knock-out or chemical treatments. Then,\ntime-series data of increasing lengths were provided to five state-of-the-art\nnetwork inference algorithms representing distinctive mathematical paradigms.\nThe performances of such network reconstruction methodologies are uncovered\nunder various experimental conditions. We report that the algorithms do not\nbenefit equally from data increments. Furthermore, for rhythmic systems, it is\nmore profitable for network inference strategies to be run on long time-series\nrather than short time-series with multiple perturbations. By contrast, for the\nnon-rhythmic systems, increasing the number of perturbation experiments yielded\nbetter results than increasing the sampling frequency. We expect that future\nbenchmark and algorithm design would integrate such multifactorial\nconsiderations to promote their widespread and conscientious usage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mombaerts", "Laurent", ""], ["Aalto", "Atte", ""], ["Markdahl", "Johan", ""], ["Goncalves", "Jorge", ""]]}]
