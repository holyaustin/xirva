Block diagram representations of the\ndynamics implied by these bond graphs are used to reveal implicit feedback\nstructures and are linearised to allow the application of control-theoretical\nmethods.\n  Two concepts of modularity are examined: computational modularity where\nphysical correctness is retained and behavioural modularity where module\nbehaviour (such as ultrasensitivity) is retained. As well as providing\ncomputational modularity, bond graphs provide a natural formulation of\nbehavioural modularity and reveal the sources of retroactivity. A bond graph\napproach to reducing retroactivity, and thus inter-module interaction, is shown\nto require a power supply such as that provided by the ATP = ADP + Pi reaction.\n  The MAPK cascade (Raf-MEK-ERK pathway) is used as an illustrative example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 03:19:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 05:48:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gawthrop", "Peter", ""], ["Crampin", "Edmund", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07768", "submitter": "Yang-Yu Liu", "authors": "Arunachalam Vinayagam, Travis E.

With suitable inputs, PPI networks\ndrive the cells to diverse functional outcomes such as cell proliferation or\ncell death. Here we characterize the structural controllability of a large\ndirected human PPI network comprised of 6,339 proteins and 34,813 interactions.\nThis allows us to classify proteins as \"indispensable\", \"neutral\" or\n\"dispensable\", which correlates to increasing, no effect, or decreasing the\nnumber of driver nodes in the network upon removal of that protein. We find\nthat 21% of the proteins in the PPI network are indispensable. Interestingly,\nthese indispensable proteins are the primary targets of disease-causing\nmutations, human viruses, and drugs, suggesting that altering a network's\ncontrol property is critical for the transition between healthy and disease\nstates. Furthermore, analyzing copy number alterations data from 1,547 cancer\npatients reveals that 56 genes that are frequently amplified or deleted in nine\ndifferent cancers are indispensable. Among the 56 genes, 46 of them have not\nbeen previously associated with cancer. This suggests that controllability\nanalysis is very useful in identifying novel disease genes and potential drug\ntargets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 15:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Vinayagam", "Arunachalam", ""], ["Gibson", "Travis E.", ""], ["Lee", "Ho-Joon", ""], ["Yilmazel", "Bahar", ""], ["Roesel", "Charles", ""], ["Hu", "Yanhui", ""], ["Kwon", "Young", ""], ["Sharma", "Amitabh", ""], ["Liu", "Yang-Yu", ""], ["Perrimon", "Norbert", ""], ["Barab\u00e1si", "Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08230", "submitter": "Thierry Emonet", "authors": "Nicholas W Frankel, William Pontius, Yann S Dufour, Junjiajia Long,\n  Luis Hernandez- Nunez, Thierry Emonet", "title": "Adaptability of non-genetic diversity in bacterial chemotaxis", "comments": "Journal link: http://elifesciences.org/content/3/e03526", "journal-ref": "eLife 3, e03526 (2014)", "doi": "10.7554/eLife.03526.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.CB q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Bacterial chemotaxis systems are as diverse as the environments that bacteria\ninhabit, but how much environmental variation can cells tolerate with a single\nsystem?

By simulating foraging and\ncolonization of E. coli using a single-cell chemotaxis model, we found that\ndifferent environments selected for different behaviors.

Arguably, one of the most important of\nsuch coordinated responses is the one of amplification cascades, in which\nactivation of a few key-responsive transcription factors (termed master\nregulators, MRs) lead to a large series of transcriptional activation events.\nThis is so since master regulators are transcription factors controlling the\nexpression of other transcription factor molecules and so on. MRs hold a\ncentral position related to transcriptional dynamics and control of gene\nregulatory networks and are often involved in complex feedback and feedforward\nloops inducing non-trivial dynamics. Recent studies have pointed out to the\nmyocyte enhancing factor 2C (MEF2C, also known as MADS box transcription\nenhancer factor 2, polypeptide C) as being one of such master regulators\ninvolved in the pathogenesis of primary breast cancer. In this work, we perform\nan integrative genomic analysis of the transcriptional regulation activity of\nMEF2C and its target genes to evaluate to what extent are these molecules\ninducing collective responses leading to gene expression deregulation and\ncarcinogenesis. We also analyzed a number of induced dynamic responses, in\nparticular those associated with transcriptional bursts, and nonlinear\ncascading to evaluate the influence they may have in malignant phenotypes and\ncancer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 17 Oct 2015 22:32:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hern\u00e1ndez-Lemus", "E.", ""], ["Baca-L\u00f3pez", "K.", ""], ["Lemus", "R.", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Herrera", "R.", ""]]}]
