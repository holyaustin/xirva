Due to evolutionary pressures, the number of allowable reactions\nwithin these systems are highly constrained and thus the resulting metabolic\nnetworks display considerable asymmetry. In this paper, we explore possible\nevolutionary factors pertaining to the reduced symmetry observed in these\nnetworks, and demonstrate the important role environmental variability plays in\nshaping their structural organization. Interpreting the returnability index as\nan equilibrium constant for a reaction network in equilibrium with a\nhypothetical reference system, enables us to quantify the extent to which a\nmetabolic network is in disequilibrium. Further, by introducing a new directed\ncentrality measure via an extension of the subgraph centrality metric to\ndirected networks, we are able to characterise individual metabolites by their\nparticipation within metabolic pathways. To demonstrate these ideas, we study\n116 metabolic networks of bacteria. In particular, we find that the equilibrium\nconstant for the metabolic networks decreases significantly in-line with\nvariability in bacterial habitats, supporting the view that environmental\nvariability promotes disequilibrium within these biochemical reaction systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 07:18:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Crofts", "Jonathan J", ""], ["Estrada", "Ernesto", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.0183", "submitter": "Jacobo Aguirre", "authors": "Jacobo Aguirre, David Papo and Javier M.

However, we rarely know how robust our conclusions are\nwith respect to the choice and uncertainties of the model. Using algebraic\ntechniques we study systematically the effects of intermediate, or transient,\nspecies in biochemical systems and provide a simple, yet rigorous mathematical\nclassification of all models obtained from a core model by including\nintermediates. Main examples include enzymatic and post-translational\nmodification systems, where intermediates often are considered insignificant\nand neglected in a model, or they are not included because we are unaware of\ntheir existence. All possible models obtained from the core model are\nclassified into a finite number of classes. Each class is defined by a\nmathematically simple canonical model that characterizes crucial dynamical\nproperties, such as mono- and multistationarity and stability of steady states,\nof all models in the class. We show that if the core model does not have\nconservation laws, then the introduction of intermediates does not change the\nsteady-state concentrations of the species in the core model, after suitable\nmatching of parameters. Importantly, our results provide guidelines to the\nmodeler in choosing between models and in distinguishing their properties.\nFurther, our work provides a formal way of comparing models that share a common\nskeleton.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 04:07:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 14:35:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 21:49:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Feliu", "Elisenda", ""], ["Wiuf", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6793", "submitter": "Nicolae Radu Zabet", "authors": "Nicolae Radu Zabet and Boris Adryan", "title": "The effects of transcription factor competition on gene regulation", "comments": "This is an updated version of the manuscript taking into account\n  comments from reviewers", "journal-ref": "Frontiers in Genetics 4:197 (2013)", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2013.00197", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transcription factor (TF) molecules translocate by facilitated diffusion (a\ncombination of 3D diffusion around and 1D random walk on the DNA). Despite the\nattention this mechanism received in the last 40 years, only a few studies\ninvestigated the influence of the cellular environment on the facilitated\ndiffusion mechanism and, in particular, the influence of `other' DNA binding\nproteins competing with the TF molecules for DNA space. Molecular crowding on\nthe DNA is likely to influence the association rate of TFs to their target site\nand the steady state occupancy of those sites, but it is still not clear how it\ninfluences the search in a genome-wide context, when the model includes\nbiologically relevant parameters (such as: TF abundance, TF affinity for DNA\nand TF dynamics on the DNA). We performed stochastic simulations of TFs\nperforming the facilitated diffusion mechanism, and considered various\nabundances of cognate and non-cognate TFs. We show that, for both obstacles\nthat move on the DNA and obstacles that are fixed on the DNA, changes in search\ntime are not statistically significant in case of biologically relevant\ncrowding levels on the DNA. In the case of non-cognate proteins that slide on\nthe DNA, molecular crowding on the DNA always leads to statistically\nsignificant lower levels of occupancy, which may confer a general mechanism to\ncontrol gene activity levels globally. When the `other' molecules are immobile\non the DNA, we found a completely different behaviour, namely: the occupancy of\nthe target site is always increased by higher molecular crowding on the DNA.\nFinally, we show that crowding on the DNA may increase transcriptional noise\nthrough increased variability of the occupancy time of the target sites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 11:25:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 12:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zabet", "Nicolae Radu", ""], ["Adryan", "Boris", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6869", "submitter": "Nicolae Radu Zabet", "authors": "Nicolae Radu Zabet, Robert Foy and Boris Adryan", "title": "The influence of transcription factor competition on the relationship\n  between occupancy and affinity", "comments": "28 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 8:9 (2013) e73714", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0073714", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transcription factors (TFs) are proteins that bind to specific sites on the\nDNA and regulate gene activity. Identifying where TF molecules bind and how\nmuch time they spend on their target sites is key for understanding\ntranscriptional regulation. It is usually assumed that the free energy of\nbinding of a TF to the DNA (the affinity of the site) is highly correlated to\nthe amount of time the TF remains bound (the occupancy of the site). However,\nknowing the binding energy is not sufficient to infer actual binding site\noccupancy. This mismatch between the occupancy predicted by the affinity and\nthe observed occupancy may be caused by various factors, such as TF abundance,\ncompetition between TFs or the arrangement of the sites on the DNA. We\ninvestigated the relationship between the affinity of a TF for a set of binding\nsites and their occupancy. In particular, we considered the case of lac\nrepressor (lacI) in E.coli and performed stochastic simulations of the TF\ndynamics on the DNA for various combinations of lacI abundance in competition\nwith TFs that contribute to macromolecular crowding. Our results showed that\nfor medium and high affinity sites, TF competition does not play a significant\nrole in genomic occupancy, except in cases when the abundance of lacI is\nsignificantly increased or when a low-information content PWM was used.\nNevertheless, for medium and low affinity sites, an increase in TF abundance\n(for both lacI or other molecules) leads to an increase in occupancy at several\nsites.
