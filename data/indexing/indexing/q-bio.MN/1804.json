Here we study a mathematical model of these spatio-temporal\nprocesses in the presence of stochasticity, defining and applying measures that\nquantify order within the resulting spatial patterns. We observe a universal\nsigmoidal response to increasing transcriptional noise. Ordered patterns\npersist up to a threshold noise level in the model parameters. As the noise is\nfurther increased past a threshold point of no return, these ordered patterns\nrapidly become disordered.

By\nusing simplets, we define a sensitive measure of similarity between simplicial\ncomplex network representations that allows for clustering them according to\ntheir data types better than clustering them by using other state-of-the-art\nmeasures, e.g., spectral distance, or facet distribution distance.

In\naddition, we guarantee the performance of MPGM under certain classes of network\nmodels. We introduce a sampling-based stochastic model for generating k\ncorrelated networks. We prove that for this model, if a sufficient number of\nseed tuples are available, the MULTIPLEPERCOLATION algorithm correctly aligns\nalmost all the nodes. Our theoretical results are supported by experimental\nevaluations over synthetic networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 12:55:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 May 2019 23:57:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kazemi", "Ehsan", ""], ["Grossglauser", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10775", "submitter": "Khalid Raza", "authors": "Khalid Raza", "title": "Fuzzy logic based approaches for gene regulatory network inference", "comments": "29 pages, 12 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": "Artificial Intelligence in Medicine, (2020) Elsevier, 97: 189-203", "doi": "10.1016/j.artmed.2018.12.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rapid advancement in high-throughput techniques has fueled the generation\nof large volume of biological data rapidly with low cost. Some of these\ntechniques are microarray and next generation sequencing which provides genome\nlevel insight of living cells. As a result, the size of most of the biological\ndatabases, such as NCBI-GEO, NCBI-SRA, is exponentially growing. These\nbiological data are analyzed using computational techniques for knowledge\ndiscovery - which is one of the objectives of bioinformatics research. Gene\nregulatory network (GRN) is a gene-gene interaction network which plays pivotal\nrole in understanding gene regulation process and disease studies. From the\nlast couple of decades, the researchers are interested in developing\ncomputational algorithms for GRN inference (GRNI) using high-throughput\nexperimental data. Several computational approaches have been applied for\ninferring GRN from gene expression data including statistical techniques\n(correlation coefficient), information theory (mutual information), regression\nbased approaches, probabilistic approaches (Bayesian networks, naive byes),\nartificial neural networks, and fuzzy logic. The fuzzy logic, along with its\nhybridization with other intelligent approach, is well studied in GRNI due to\nits several advantages. In this paper, we present a consolidated review on\nfuzzy logic and its hybrid approaches for GRNI developed during last two\ndecades.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2018 09:49:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Raza", "Khalid", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.11005", "submitter": "Sahil Garg", "authors": "Emilia M.

It is often solved with model\nconstruction in a controllable computational environment. In spite of that, the\nthroughput of in-silico simulation-based observations become similarly\nintractable for thorough analysis. This is especially the case in molecular\nbiology, which served as a subject for this study. In this project, we aimed to\ntest some approaches developed to deal with the curse of dimensionality. Among\nthese we found dimension reduction techniques especially appealing. They can be\nused to identify irrelevant variability and help to understand critical\nprocesses underlying high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we subjected our\ndata sets to nonlinear time series analysis, as those are well established\nmethods for results comparison. To investigate the usefulness of dimension\nreduction methods, we decided to base our study on a concrete sample set. The\nexample was taken from the domain of systems biology concerning dynamic\nevolution of sub-cellular signaling. Particularly, the dataset relates to the\nyeast pheromone pathway and is studied in-silico with a stochastic model. The\nmodel reconstructs signal propagation stimulated by a mating pheromone. In the\npaper, we elaborate on the reason of multidimensional analysis problem in the\ncontext of molecular signaling, and next, we introduce the model of choice,\nsimulation details and obtained time series dynamics.
