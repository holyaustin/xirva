Efforts to understand cell fate control have focused on simple gene\nregulatory circuits that predict the presence of multiple stable states,\nbifurcations and switch-like transitions. However, existing gene network models\ndo not explain more complex properties of cell fate dynamics such as the\nhierarchical branching of developmental paths. Here, we construct a generic\nminimal model of the genetic regulatory network controlling cell fate\ndetermination, which exhibits five elementary characteristics of cell\ndifferentiation: stability, directionality, branching, exclusivity, and\npromiscuous expression. We argue that a modular architecture comprising\nrepeated network elements reproduces these features of differentiation by\nsequentially repressing selected modules and hence restricting the dynamics to\nlower dimensional subspaces of the high-dimensional state space. We implement\nour model both with ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to explore the role\nof bifurcations in producing the one-way character of differentiation, and with\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs), to demonstrate the effect of noise on\nthe system. We further argue that binary cell fate decisions are prevalent in\ncell differentiation due to general features of the underlying dynamical\nsystem. This minimal model makes testable predictions about the structural\nbasis for directional, discrete and diversifying cell phenotype development and\nthus can guide the evaluation of real gene regulatory networks that govern\ndifferentiation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 00:03:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 12 Apr 2009 01:54:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2009 21:42:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Foster", "David V.", ""], ["Foster", "Jacob G.", ""], ["Huang", "Sui", ""], ["Kauffman", "Stuart A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4219", "submitter": "Ali Navid", "authors": "Ali Navid, Eivind Almaas", "title": "Genome-scale reconstruction of the metabolic network in Yersinia pestis,\n  strain 91001", "comments": "27 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Molecular Biosystems 5 (2009) 368-375", "doi": "10.1039/b818710j", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.CB q-bio.GN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The gram-negative bacterium Yersinia pestis, the aetiological agent of\nbubonic plague, is one the deadliest pathogens known to man.
