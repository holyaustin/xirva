They are known to\nplay an important role in several biological processes and, together with\ntranscription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory\nnetwork. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a\nfew overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary\nregulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the\nmicroRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor\nregulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this\npaper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version\nof this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an\nefficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall\ngene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream\nregulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is\nthat the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression\nof the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected\nfine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the\nactual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their\ntargets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the\ncross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the\nmicroRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a\nlarger network of regulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2010 13:48:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Sep 2011 14:09:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Osella", "Matteo", ""], ["Bosia", "Carla", ""], ["Cora'", "Davide", ""], ["Caselle", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1028", "submitter": "Albert Erives", "authors": "Albert Erives and Justin Crocker", "title": "Dynamic evolution of precise regulatory encodings creates the clustered\n  signature of developmental enhancers", "comments": "33 pages, 16 figures, 3 Tables.

Each such enhancer activates a neighboring gene at a unique threshold\nconcentration of Dorsal. The presence of Dorsal binding site clusters in these\nenhancers and of similar clusters in other enhancers has motivated models of\nthreshold-encoding in site density. However, we found that the precise length\nof a spacer separating a pair of specialized Dorsal and Twist binding sites\ndetermines the threshold-response. Despite this result, the functional range\ndetermined by this spacer element as well as the role and origin of its\nsurrounding Dorsal site cluster remained completely unknown. Here, we\nexperiment with enhancers from diverse Drosophila genomes, including the large\nuncompacted genomes from ananassae and willistoni, and report three major\ninterdependent results. First, we map the functional range of the\nthreshold-encoding spacer variable. Second, we show that the majority of sites\nat the cluster are non-functional divergent elements that have been separated\nbeyond the encoding's functional range. Third, we verify an evolutionary model\ninvolving the frequent replacement of a threshold encoding, whose precision is\neasily outdated by shifting accuracy. The process by which encodings are\nreplaced by newer ones is facilitated by the palindromic nature of the Dorsal\nand Twist binding motifs and by intrinsic repeat-instability in the specialized\nTwist binding site, which critically impacts the length of the spacer linking\nit to Dorsal. Over time, the dynamic process of selective deprecation and\nreplacement of encodings adds to a growing cluster of deadened elements, or\nnecro-elements, and strongly biases local sequence composition. ...

A genotype is viable in a given\nenvironment if it is capable of producing all biomass components the organism\nneeds to survive and reproduce. Previous work has focused on the properties of\nindividual genotypes while little is known about how genome-scale metabolic\nnetworks with a given function can vary in their reaction content. Results: We\nhere characterize spaces of such genotypes. Specifically, we study metabolic\ngenotypes whose phenotype is viability in minimal chemical environments that\ndiffer in their sole carbon sources. We show that regardless of the number of\nreactions in a metabolic genotype, the genotypes of a given phenotype typically\nform vast, connected, and unstructured sets -- genotype networks -- that nearly\nspan the whole of genotype space. The robustness of metabolic phenotypes to\nrandom reaction removal in such spaces has a narrow distribution with a high\nmean. Different carbon sources differ in the number of metabolic genotypes in\ntheir genotype network; this number decreases as a genotype is required to be\nviable on increasing numbers of carbon sources, but much less than if metabolic\nreactions were used independently across different chemical environments.\nConclusions: Our work shows that phenotype-preserving genotype networks have\ngeneric organizational properties and that these properties are insensitive to\nthe number of reactions in metabolic genotypes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Apr 2010 16:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Samal", "Areejit", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Joao F.

We use\nstochastic simulations to analyze how these cycles interact to generate stable\nrhythms in growing, dividing cells. We find that a protein phosphorylation\ncycle by itself is robust when protein turnover is low. For high decay or\ndilution rates (and co mpensating synthesis rate), however, the\nphosphorylation-based oscillator loses its integrity. Circadian rhythms thus\ncannot be generated with a phosphorylation cycle alone when the growth rate,\nand consequently the rate of protein dilution, is high enough; in practice, a\npurely post-translational clock ceases to function well when the cell doubling\ntime drops below the 24 hour clock period. At higher growth rates, a\ntranscription-translation cycle becomes essential for generating robust\ncircadian rhythms. Interestingly, while a transcription-translation cycle is\nnecessary to sustain a phosphorylation cycle at high growth rates, a\nphosphorylation cycle can dramatically enhance the robustness of a\ntranscription-translation cycle at lower protein decay or dilution rates. Our\nanalysis thus predicts that both cycles are required to generate robust\ncircadian rhythms over the full range of growth conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2010 11:39:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Zwicker", "David", ""], ["Lubensky", "David K.", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.3138", "submitter": "Adri\\'an L\\'opez Garc\\'ia de Lomana", "authors": "Adri\\'an L\\'opez Garc\\'ia de Lomana, Qasim K.
