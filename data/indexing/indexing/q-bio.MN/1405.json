The central idea is to\ncreate a complex classifier from a population of weak or simple classifiers.

The randomized\nsensitivities are achieved by constructing a library of synthetic gene circuits\nwith randomized control sequences (e.g. ribosome-binding sites) in the front\nelement. The training procedure consists in re-shaping of the master population\nin such a way that it collectively responds to the \"positive\" patterns of input\nsignals by producing above-threshold output (e.g. fluorescent signal), and\nbelow-threshold output in case of the \"negative\" patterns. The population\nre-shaping is achieved by presenting sequential examples and pruning the\npopulation using either graded selection/counterselection or by\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).

The first mathematical\ncriterion to identify global TFs, the $\\kappa$-value, was reassessed on B.\nsubtilis and confirmed its high predictive power by identifying all the\npreviously reported, plus three potential, master regulators and eight sigma\nfactors. The functional conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a\nset of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified\nvia both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions.

Here, we unravel the TRN of Escherichia coli by\nseparating it into its key elements, thus revealing its natural organization.\nWe also present a mathematical criterion, based on the topological features of\nthe TRN, to classify the network elements into one of two possible classes:\nhierarchical or modular genes.\n  Results: We found that modular genes are clustered into physiologically\ncorrelated groups validated by a statistical analysis of the enrichment of the\nfunctional classes. Hierarchical genes encode transcription factors responsible\nfor coordinating module responses based on general interest signals.\nHierarchical elements correlate highly with the previously studied global\nregulators, suggesting that this could be the first mathematical method to\nidentify global regulators. We identified a new element in TRNs never described\nbefore: intermodular genes. These are structural genes that integrate, at the\npromoter level, signals coming from different modules, and therefore from\ndifferent physiological responses. Using the concept of pleiotropy, we have\nreconstructed the hierarchy of the network and discuss the role of feedforward\nmotifs in shaping the hierarchical backbone of the TRN.\n  Conclusions: This study sheds new light on the design principles underpinning\nthe organization of TRNs, showing a novel nonpyramidal architecture composed of\nindependent modules globally governed by hierarchical transcription factors,\nwhose responses are integrated by intermodular genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2014 01:20:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Freyre-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Julio A.", ""], ["Alonso-Pav\u00f3n", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""], ["Trevi\u00f1o-Quintanilla", "Luis G.", ""], ["Collado-Vides", "Julio", ""]]}]
