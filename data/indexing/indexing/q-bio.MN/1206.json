Here, we describe first the protein structure\nnetworks of molecular chaperones, then characterize chaperone containing\nsub-networks of interactomes called as chaperone-networks or chaperomes. We\nreview the role of molecular chaperones in short-term adaptation of cellular\nnetworks in response to stress, and in long-term adaptation discussing their\nputative functions in the regulation of evolvability. We provide a general\noverview of possible network mechanisms of adaptation, learning and memory\nformation. We propose that changes of network rigidity play a key role in\nlearning and memory formation processes. Flexible network topology provides\n\"learning competent\" state. Here, networks may have much less modular\nboundaries than locally rigid, highly modular networks, where the learnt\ninformation has already been consolidated in a memory formation process. Since\nmodular boundaries are efficient filters of information, in the \"learning\ncompetent\" state information filtering may be much smaller, than after memory\nformation. This mechanism restricts high information transfer to the \"learning\ncompetent\" state. After memory formation, modular boundary-induced segregation\nand information filtering protect the stored information. The flexible networks\nof young organisms are generally in a \"learning competent\" state. On the\ncontrary, locally rigid networks of old organisms have lost their \"learning\ncompetent\" state, but store and protect their learnt information efficiently.\nWe anticipate that the above mechanism may operate at the level of both\nprotein-protein interaction and neuronal networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2012 06:34:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 9 Jun 2013 15:16:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2014 10:32:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gyurko", "David M.", ""], ["Soti", "Csaba", ""], ["Stetak", "Attila", ""], ["Csermely", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0123", "submitter": "Peter Csermely", "authors": "Tamas Hegedus, Gergely Gyimesi, Merse E.

This paper focus on a minimal microRNA-mediated regulatory\ncircuit, in which a protein-coding gene (host gene) is targeted by a microRNA\nlocated inside one of its introns. Results: Autoregulation via intronic\nmicroRNAs is widespread in the human regulatory network, as confirmed by our\nbioinformatic analysis, and can perform several regulatory tasks despite its\nsimple topology. Our analysis, based on analytical calculations and\nsimulations, indicates that this circuitry alters the dynamics of the host gene\nexpression, can induce complex responses implementing adaptation and Weber's\nlaw, and efficiently filters fluctuations propagating from the upstream network\nto the host gene. A fine-tuning of the circuit parameters can optimize each of\nthese functions.

Persistent increased activity of the enzyme\nprotein kinase M (PKM) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional\nspatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in\nthe synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only\nsynapses that have been \"tagged\" by an stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning\ncan \"capture\" PKM. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key\nmolecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents\nrelationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model\nsuccessfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKM, STC, LTD, and\ncross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKM.\nThe maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term\nmemory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKM\nenhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback\nunderlies bistability in the activity of PKM. Second, cross capture requires\nthe induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKM synthesis, although this may\nrequire tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the\neffects of PKM inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of\nCaM kinases.

Using phase reduction and Floquet multipliers, we\nnumerically analyzed their entrainability under different coupling strengths\nand period ratios. We found that a period mismatch induces better entrainment\nin both types of oscillator; the enhancement occurs in the vicinity of the\nbifurcation on their limit cycles. In the smooth oscillator, the optimal period\nratio for the enhancement coincides with the experimentally observed ratio,\nwhich suggests biological exploitation of the period mismatch.

The APC is a protein in\nthe mitochondrial carrier super family that localizes to the inner\nmitochondrial membrane (IMM). It is known to modulate a number of processes\nthat depend on mitochondrial AdN content, such as gluconeogenesis, protein\nsynthesis, and citrulline synthesis. Despite this critical role, a kinetic\nmodel of the underlying mechanism has not been developed and validated. Here, a\nbiophysical model of the APC is developed that is thermodynamically balanced\nand accurately reproduces a number of reported data sets from isolated rat\nliver and rat kidney mitochondria. The model is based on an ordered bi-bi\nmechanism for hetero-exchange of ATP and Pi and also includes homo-exchanges of\nATP and Pi to explain both the initial rate and time course data on ATP and Pi\ntransport via the APC. The model invokes seven kinetic parameters regarding the\nAPC mechanism and three parameters related to matrix pH regulation by external\nPi. These parameters are estimated based on nineteen independent data curves;\nthe estimated parameters are validated using six additional data curves. The\nmodel takes into account the effects of pH, Mg2+ and Ca2+ on ATP and Pi\ntransport via the APC and supports the conclusion that the pH gradient across\nthe IMM serves as the primary driving force for AdN uptake or efflux. Moreover,\ncomputer simulations demonstrate that extra-matrix Ca2+ modulates the turnover\nrate of the APC and not the binding affinity of ATP, as previously suggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 15:25:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 14:21:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 02:27:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tewari", "Shivendra G.", ""], ["Dash", "Ranjan K.", ""], ["Beard", "Daniel A.", ""], ["Bazil", "Jason N.", ""]]}]
