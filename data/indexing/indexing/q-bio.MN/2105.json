In the presence of\nparameters we must go further and derive necessary and sufficient conditions in\nthe parameters for toricity or shifted toricity to hold. Technically, we use\nreal quantifier elimination methods. Our computations on biological networks\nhere once more confirm shifted toricity as a relevant concept, while toricity\nholds only for degenerate parameter choices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 May 2021 04:09:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2021 06:42:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Rahkooy", "Hamid", ""], ["Sturm", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.12226", "submitter": "Shawn Gu", "authors": "Shawn Gu, Meng Jiang, Pietro Hiram Guzzi, and Tijana Milenkovic", "title": "Modeling multi-scale data via a network of networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Prediction of node and graph labels are prominent network science tasks. Data\nanalyzed in these tasks are sometimes related: entities represented by nodes in\na higher-level (higher-scale) network can themselves be modeled as networks at\na lower level. We argue that systems involving such entities should be\nintegrated with a \"network of networks\" (NoN) representation. Then, we ask\nwhether entity label prediction using multi-level NoN data via our proposed\napproaches is more accurate than using each of single-level node and graph data\nalone, i.e., than traditional node label prediction on the higher-level network\nand graph label prediction on the lower-level networks. To obtain data, we\ndevelop the first synthetic NoN generator and construct a real biological NoN.\nWe evaluate accuracy of considered approaches when predicting artificial labels\nfrom the synthetic NoNs and proteins' functions from the biological NoN. For\nthe synthetic NoNs, our NoN approaches outperform or are as good as node- and\nnetwork-level ones depending on the NoN properties. For the biological NoN, our\nNoN approaches outperform the single-level approaches for just under half of\nthe protein functions, and for 30% of the functions, only our NoN approaches\nmake meaningful predictions, while node- and network-level ones achieve random\naccuracy. So, NoN-based data integration is important.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2021 21:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Shawn", ""], ["Jiang", "Meng", ""], ["Guzzi", "Pietro Hiram", ""], ["Milenkovic", "Tijana", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.12727", "submitter": "J.

Darwinian evolution has organized each\nprotein family in different ways, but dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is\nboth simple and effective in providing readily transferable dynamical insights\nfor many proteins represented in the uncounted amino acid sequences, as well as\nthe 90 thousand static structures contained in the online Protein Data Base.\nCritical point theory is general, and recently it has proved to be the most\neffective way of describing protein networks that have evolved towards nearly\nperfect functionality in given environments, self-organized criticality.\nDarwinian evolutionary patterns are governed by common dynamical hydropathic\nscaling principles, which can be quantified using scales that have been\ndeveloped bioinformatically by studying thousands of static PDB structures. The\nmost effective dynamical scales involve hydropathic globular sculpting\ninteractions averaged over length scales centered on domain dimensions. A\ncentral feature of dynamical hydropathic scaling theory is the characteristic\ndomain length associated with a given protein functionality. Evolution has\nfunctioned in such a way that the minimal critical length scale established so\nfar is about nine amino acids, but in some cases it is much larger. Some\ningenuity is needed to find this primary length scale, as shown by the examples\ndiscussed here. Often a survey of the Darwinian evolution of a protein sequence\nsuggests a means of determining the critical length scale. The evolution of\nCoronavirus is an interesting application; it identifies critical mutations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2021 16:07:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Phillips", "J.
