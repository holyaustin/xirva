However, recent measurement has\ndemonstrated that phenotypic changes resulting from adaptation and evolution in\nresponse to environmental changes are effectively restricted to a\nlow-dimensional subspace. Thus, uncovering the origin and nature of such a\ndrastic dimension reduction is crucial to understanding the general\ncharacteristics of biological adaptation and evolution. Herein, we first\nformulated the dimension reduction in terms of dynamical systems theory:\nconsidering the steady growth state of cells, the reduction is represented by\nthe separation of a few large singular values of the inverse Jacobian matrix\naround a fixed point. We then examined this dimension reduction by numerical\nevolution of cells consisting of thousands of chemicals whose concentrations\ndetermine phenotype. As a result of the evolution, phenotypic changes due to\nmutations and external perturbations were found to be mainly restricted to a\none-dimensional subspace. One singular value of the inverse Jacobian matrix at\na fixed point of concentrations was significantly larger than the others. The\nmajor phenotypic changes due to mutations and external perturbations occur\nalong the corresponding left-singular vector, which leads to phenotypic\nconstraint, and fitness dominantly changes in the same direction. Once such\nphenotypic constraint is acquired, phenotypic evolution to a novel environment\ntakes advantage of this restricted phenotypic direction. This results in the\nconvergence of phenotypic pathways across genetically different strains, as is\nexperimentally observed, while accelerating further evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2019 04:20:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2019 08:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sato", "Takuya U.", ""], ["Kaneko", "Kunihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.01801", "submitter": "Pramod Shinde", "authors": "Pramod Shinde, Loic Marrec, Aparna Rai, Alok Yadav, Rajesh Kumar,\n  Mikhail Ivanchenko, Alexey Zaikin, Sarika Jalan", "title": "Symmetry in cancer networks identified: Proposal for multi-cancer\n  biomarkers", "comments": "20 Pages, 5 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the most challenging problems in biomedicine and genomics is the\nidentification of disease biomarkers.

Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small\nmotifs both at steady state and \\red{away from stationarity}. Experimental\nevidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)\ncrosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the\nintegration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale\neffects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to\nwhich crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its\nemergent systemic features in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network\nreconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level\ncrosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii)\ncan achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are\nrobust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly\nnon-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters.\nFurthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is\nstrongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's\ntopology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection.
