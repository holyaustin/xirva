Multi-lineage differentiation has been\nreported for various progenitor cells, and it has been explained through the\nbifurcation of a metastable state.

Enzyme copy-number changes\naffect the processing rate of the substrate molecules; high enzyme numbers\nincrease the processing probability, low enzyme numbers decrease it. We study\ndifferent RNA processing cascades where enzyme copy-numbers are either fixed or\nfluctuate. We find that for fixed enzyme-copy numbers the substrates at\nsteady-state are Poisson-distributed, and the whole RNA cascade dynamics can be\nunderstood as a single birth-death process of the mature RNA product. In this\ncase, solely fluctuations in the timing of RNA processing lead to variation in\nthe number of RNA molecules. However, we show analytically and numerically that\nwhen enzyme copy-numbers fluctuate, the strength of RNA fluctuations increases\nlinearly with the RNA transcription rate. This linear effect becomes stronger\nas the speed of enzyme dynamics decreases relative to the speed of RNA\ndynamics. Interestingly, we find that under certain conditions, the RNA cascade\ncan reduce the strength of fluctuations in the expression level of the mature\nRNA product.
