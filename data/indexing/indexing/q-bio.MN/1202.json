First, we analyzed\nfailure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and\ncompared the results to those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To\nalert to the potential damage caused by the failure of individual reactions, we\npropose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target\nreactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous\nfailure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong non-linear amplification\neffects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the\nintersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene\nco-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied\nthe consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage\ncaused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between\ngenome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality. At the same time,\nwe found that genes controlling high-damage reactions tend to operate in\nfunctional isolation, as a metabolic protection mechanism. We conclude that the\narchitecture of M. pneumoniae, both at the level of metabolism and genome,\nseems to have evolved towards increased structural robustness, similarly to\nother more complex model bacterial organisms, despite its reduced genome size\nand its greater metabolic network linearity. Our approach, although motivated\nbiochemically, is generic enough to be of potential use toward analyzing and\npredicting spreading of structural stress in any bipartite complex network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 13:37:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00fcell", "Oriol", ""], ["Sagu\u00e9s", "Francesc", ""], ["Serrano", "M. \u00c1ngeles", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6274", "submitter": "Haidong Feng", "authors": "Haidong Feng, Jin Wang", "title": "A new mechanism of development and differentiation through slow\n  binding/unbinding of regulatory proteins to the genes", "comments": "25 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the differentiation, a biological process from a multipotent\nstem or progenitor state to a mature cell is critically important. We develop a\ntheoretical framework to quantify the underlying potential landscape and\nbiological paths for cell development and differentiation. We propose a new\nmechanism of differentiation and development through binding/unbinding of\nregulatory proteins to the gene promoters. We found indeed the differentiated\nstates can emerge from the slow promoter binding/unbinding processes.\nFurthermore, under slow promoter binding/unbinding, we found multiple\nmeta-stable differentiated states. This can explain the origin of multiple\nstates observed in the recent experiments. In addition, the kinetic time\nquantified by mean first passage transition time for the differentiation and\nreprogramming strongly depends on the time scale of the promoter\nbinding/unbinding processes. We discovered an optimal speed for differentiation\nfor certain binding/unbinding rates of regulatory proteins to promoters. More\nexperiments in the future might be able to tell if cells differentiate at at\nthat optimal speed. In addition, we quantify kinetic pathways for the\ndifferentiation and reprogramming. We found that they are irreversible. This\ncaptures the non-equilibrium dynamics in multipotent stem or progenitor cells.\nSuch inherent time-asymmetry as a result of irreversibility of state transition\npathways as shown may provide the origin of time arrow for cell development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 16:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Haidong", ""], ["Wang", "Jin", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6433", "submitter": "Gabor Vattay", "authors": "Gabor Vattay and Stuart Kauffman, Samuli Niiranen", "title": "Quantum biology on the edge of quantum chaos", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 9(3): e89017", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0089017", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.BM q-bio.MN q-bio.PE quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a new explanation for why some biological systems can stay quantum\ncoherent for long times at room temperatures, one of the fundamental puzzles of\nquantum biology.
