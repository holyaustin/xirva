However, how the gene network\nunderlying stemness regulation reliably specifies cell fates is not well\nunderstood. To address this question, we applied a recently developed\ncomputational method, Random Circuit Perturbation (RACIPE), to a nine-component\ngene regulatory network (GRN) governing stemness, from which we identified\nfifteen robust gene states. Among them, four out of the five most probable gene\nstates exhibit gene expression patterns observed in single mouse embryonic\ncells at 32-cell and 64-cell stages. These gene states can be robustly\npredicted by the stemness GRN but not by randomized versions of the stemness\nGRN. Strikingly, we found a hierarchical structure of the GRN with the\nOct4/Cdx2 motif functioning as the first decision-making module followed by\nGata6/Nanog. We propose that stem cell populations, instead of being viewed as\nall having a specific cellular state, can be regarded as a heterogeneous\nmixture including cells in various states. Upon perturbations by external\nsignals, stem cells lose the capacity to access certain cellular states,\nthereby becoming differentiated. The findings demonstrate that the functions of\nthe stemness GRN is mainly determined by its well-evolved network topology\nrather than by detailed kinetic parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 23:11:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Bin", ""], ["Lu", "Mingyang", ""], ["Galbraith", "Madeline", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""], ["Onuchic", "Jose N.", ""], ["Jia", "Dongya", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.00995", "submitter": "Diego Oyarz\\'un", "authors": "Evangelos-Marios Nikolados, Andrea Y.
