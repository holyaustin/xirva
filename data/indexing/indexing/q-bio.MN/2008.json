Synthetic Biology exploits gene\nor/and protein regulatory networks towards the design of oscillatory networks\nfor producing useful compounds. Therefore, at different levels of application\nand for different purposes, the study of biomolecular oscillations can lead to\ndifferent clues about the mechanisms underlying living cells. It is known that\nnetwork-level interactions involve more than one type of biomolecule as well as\nbiological processes operating at multiple omic levels. Combining\nnetwork/pathway-level information with genetic information it is possible to\ndescribe well-understood or unknown bacterial mechanisms and organism-specific\ndynamics. Results: Network multi-omic integration has led to the discovery of\ninteresting oscillatory signals. Following the methodologies used in signal\nprocessing and communication engineering, a new methodology is introduced to\nidentify and quantify the extent of the multi-omic oscillations of the signal.\nNew signal metrics are designed to allow further biotechnological explanations\nand provide important clues about the oscillatory nature of the pathways and\ntheir regulatory circuits. Our algorithms designed for the analysis of\nmulti-omic signals are tested and validated on 11 different bacteria for\nthousands of multi-omic signals perturbed at the network level by different\nexperimental conditions. Information on the order of genes, codon usage, gene\nexpression, and protein molecular weight is integrated at three different\nfunctional levels. Oscillations show interesting evidence that network-level\nmulti-omic signals present a synchronized response to perturbations and\nevolutionary relations along with taxa.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Aug 2020 13:27:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bardozzo", "Francesco", ""], ["Li\u00f2", "Pietro", ""], ["Tagliaferri", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00687", "submitter": "Gennadi Glinsky", "authors": "Gennadi Glinsky", "title": "Genomics-guided drawing of malignant regulatory signatures revealed a\n  pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral sequences (SCARS) and\n  functionally-active hESC enhancers", "comments": "6 figues; 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.MN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  From patients and physicians perspectives, the clinical definition of a tumor\nmalignant phenotype could be restricted to the early diagnosis of sub-types of\nmalignancies with the increased risk of existing therapy failure and high\nlikelihood of death from cancer.

Analyses from this perspective of experimental and clinical\nobservations revealed the pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral\nsequences (SCARS) in the origin and pathophysiology of clinically-lethal\nmalignancies. SCARS represent evolutionary- and biologically-related family of\ngenomic regulatory sequences, the principal physiological function of which is\nto create and maintain the stemness phenotype during human preimplantation\nembryogenesis. SCARS expression must be silenced during cellular\ndifferentiation and SCARS activity remains silent in most\nterminally-differentiated human cells performing specialized functions in the\nhuman body.
