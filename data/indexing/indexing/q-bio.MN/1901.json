These clocks are intrinsically subject to thermal fluctuations, so\nthat the duration of a full oscillation cycle is random. Their success in\ncarrying out their biological function is thought to depend on the degree to\nwhich these fluctuations in the cycle period can be suppressed. Biochemical\noscillators also require a constant supply of free energy in order to break\ndetailed balance and maintain their cyclic dynamics. For a given free energy\nbudget, the recently discovered `thermodynamic uncertainty relation' yields the\nmagnitude of period fluctuations in the most precise conceivable free-running\nclock. In this paper, we show that computational models of real biochemical\nclocks severely underperform this optimum, with fluctuations several orders of\nmagnitude larger than the theoretical minimum. We argue that this suboptimal\nperformance is due to the small number of internal states per molecule in these\nmodels, combined with the high level of thermodynamic force required to\nmaintain the system in the oscillatory phase. We introduce a new model with a\ntunable number of internal states per molecule, and confirm that it approaches\nthe optimal precision as this number increases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2019 22:25:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 01:01:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 15:31:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Marsland", "Robert", "III"], ["Cui", "Wenping", ""], ["Horowitz", "Jordan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03659", "submitter": "Jan Bartsch", "authors": "Jan Bartsch, Alfio Borz\\`i, Christina Schenk, Dominik Schmidt, Jonas\n  M\\\"uller, Volker Schulz, Kai Velten", "title": "An extended model of wine fermentation including aromas and acids", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The art of viticulture and the quest for making wines has a long tradition\nand it just started recently that mathematicians entered this field with their\nmain contribution of modelling alcoholic fermentation.

The current approach to uncovering the shared pathways between AD and\nT2DM involves association analysis; however, such analyses lack power to\ndiscover the mechanisms of the diseases. Methods: We develop novel statistical\nmethods to shift the current paradigm of genetic analysis from association\nanalysis to deep causal inference for uncovering the shared mechanisms between\nAD and T2DM, and develop pipelines to infer multilevel omics causal networks\nwhich lead to shifting the current paradigm of genetic analysis from genetic\nanalysis alone to integrated causal genomic, epigenomic, transcriptional and\nphenotypic data analysis. To discover common causal paths from genetic variants\nto AD and T2DM, we also develop algorithms that can automatically search the\ncausal paths from genetic variants to diseases and Results: The proposed\nmethods and algorithms are applied to ROSMAP dataset with 432 individuals who\nsimultaneously had genotype, RNA-seq, DNA methylation and some phenotypes. We\nconstruct multi-omics causal networks and identify 13 shared causal genes, 16\nshared causal pathways between AD and T2DM, and 754 gene expression and 101\ngene methylation nodes that were connected to both AD and T2DM in multi-omics\ncausal networks. Conclusions: The results of application of the proposed\npipelines for identifying causal paths to real data analysis of AD and T2DM\nprovided strong evidence to support the link between AD and T2DM and unraveled\ncausal mechanism to explain this link.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jan 2019 21:40:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Zixin", ""], ["Jiao", "Rong", ""], ["Wang", "Jiucun", ""], ["Wang", "Panpan", ""], ["Zhu", "Yun", ""], ["Zhao", "Jinying", ""], ["De Jager", "Phil", ""], ["Bennett", "David A", ""], ["Jin", "Li", ""], ["Xiong", "Momiao", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06114", "submitter": "Swathi Tej", "authors": "Swathi Tej, Kumar Gaurav and Sutapa Mukherji", "title": "Small RNA driven feed-forward loop: critical role of sRNA in noise\n  filtering", "comments": "17 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": "IOP Physical Biology online 2019", "doi": "10.1088/1478-3975/ab1563", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A feed-forward loop (FFL) is a common gene-regulatory motif in which usually\nthe upstream regulator is a protein, a transcription factor, that regulates the\nexpression of the target protein in two parallel pathways. Here, we study a\ndistinct sRNA-driven FFL (sFFL) discovered recently in Salmonella enterica.\nUnlike previously studied transcriptional FFLs (tFFL) and sRNA-mediated FFLs\n(smFFL), here the upstream regulator is an sRNA that activates the target\nprotein and its transcriptional activator. Such sFFL has not been subjected to\nrigorous analysis. We, therefore, set out to understand two aspects. First is a\nquantitative comparison of the regulatory response of sFFL with tFFL and smFFL\nusing a differential equation framework. Since the process of gene expression\nis inherently stochastic, the second objective is to find how the noise affects\nthe functionality of sFFL. We find the response of sFFLto be stronger, faster,\nand more sensitive to the initial concentration of the upstream regulator than\ntFFL and smFFL. Further, a generating function based analysis and stochastic\nsimulations lead to a non-trivial prediction that an optimal noise filtration\ncan be attained depending on the synthesis rate of the sRNA and the degradation\nrate of the transcriptional activator. We conclude that in sFFL, sRNA plays a\ncritical role not only in driving a rapid and strong response, but also a\nreliable response that depends critically on its concentration. Given the\nadvantages of sFFL brought out in this work, it should not be surprising if\nfuture work reveals their employment in different biological contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2019 07:27:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2019 07:01:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tej", "Swathi", ""], ["Gaurav", "Kumar", ""], ["Mukherji", "Sutapa", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.06321", "submitter": "Jianhua Xing", "authors": "Jingyu Zhang, Hengyu Chen, Ruoyan Li, David A.
