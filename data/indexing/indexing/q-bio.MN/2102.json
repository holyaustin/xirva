Existing serial, and high-performance\ncomputing (HPC) search engines, otherwise highly successful, are known to\nexhibit poor-scalability with increasing size of theoretical search-space\nneeded for increased complexity of modern non-model, multi-species MS-based\nomics analysis. Consequently, the bottleneck for computational techniques is\nthe communication costs of moving the data between hierarchy of memory, or\nprocessing units, and not the arithmetic operations. This post-Moore change in\narchitecture, and demands of modern systems biology experiments have dampened\nthe overall effectiveness of the existing HPC workflows. We present a novel\nefficient parallel computational method, and its implementation on\nmemory-distributed architectures for peptide identification tool called HiCOPS,\nthat enables more than 100-fold improvement in speed over most existing HPC\nproteome database search tools. HiCOPS empowers the supercomputing database\nsearch concept for comprehensive identification of peptides, and all their\nmodified forms within a reasonable time-frame. We demonstrate this by searching\nGigabytes of experimental MS data against Terabytes of databases where HiCOPS\ncompletes peptide identification in few minutes using 72 parallel nodes (1728\ncores) compared to several weeks required by existing state-of-the-art tools\nusing 1 node (24 cores); 100 minutes vs 5 weeks; 500x speedup. Finally, we\nformulate a theoretical framework for our overhead-avoiding strategy, and\nreport superior performance evaluation results for key metrics including\nexecution time, CPU utilization, speedups, and I/O efficiency.

Can the infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus type\n1 induce a change in the differentiation status or process in T cells?.\nMethods. We will consider two stochastic Markov chain models, one which will\ndescribe the T-helper cell differentiation process, and another one describing\nthat process of infection of the T-helper cell by the virus; in these Markov\nchains, we will consider a set of states $\\{X_t \\}$ comprised of those proteins\ninvolved in each of the processes and their interactions (either\ndifferentiation or infection of the cell), such that we will obtain two\nstochastic transition matrices ($A,B$), one for each process; afterwards, the\ncomputation of their eigenvalues shall be performed, in which, should the\neigenvalue $\\lambda_i=1$ exist, the computation for the equilibrium\ndistribution $\\pi^n$ will be obtained for each of the matrices, which will\ninform us on the trends of interactions amongst the proteins in the long-term.\nResults. The stochastic processes considered possess an equilibrium\ndistribution, when reaching their equilibrium distribution, there exists an\nincrease in their informational entropy, and their log-rank distributions can\nbe modeled as discrete beta generalized distributions (DGBD). Discussion. The\nequilibrium distributions of both process can be regarded as states in which\nthe cell is well-differentiated, ergo there exists an induction of a novel\nHIV-dependent differentiated state in the T-cell; these processes due to their\nDGBD distribution can be considered complex processes; due to the increasing\nentropy, the equilibrium states are stable ones. Conclusion. The HIV virus can\npromote a novel differentiated state in the T-cell, which can give account for\nclinical features seen in patients; this model, notwithstanding does not give\naccount of YES/NO logical switches involved in the regulatory networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Feb 2021 18:37:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Vivanco-Lira", "Alfonso", ""], ["Nieto-Saucedo", "Jos\u00e9-Ra\u00fal", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.04628", "submitter": "Youming Li", "authors": "Youming Li and Da-Quan Jiang and Chen Jia", "title": "A novel method of computing the steady-state joint distribution for\n  first-order stochastic reaction kinetics", "comments": "33 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  While the analytical solution for the marginal distribution of a stochastic\nchemical reaction network has been extensively studied, its joint distribution,\ni.e. the solution of a high-dimensional chemical master equation, has received\nmuch less attention.

Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular,\nit was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in\nchildren protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an\ninverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try\nto reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not\nmonotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that\ndepends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with\nmost existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked\nfor ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the\nprotease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The\nnegative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not\nparadoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation\nthat predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus\npropagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to\nprotect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low\nACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the\ninflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the\nangiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation\ntriggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its\nmany post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome\nof children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower\nACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the\nalternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the\nanti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:11:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bastolla", "Ugo", ""], ["Chambers", "Patrick", ""], ["Abia", "David", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Bermejo", "Maria-Laura", ""], ["Fresno", "Manuel", ""]]}]
