Hybrid stochastic processes, in particular\npiecewise-deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), are well adapted for\ndescribing such situations. PDMPs approximate the jump Markov processes\ntraditionally used as models for stochastic chemical reaction networks.\nAlthough hybrid modelling is now well established in biology, these models\nremain computationally challenging. We propose several improved methods for\ncomputing time dependent multivariate probability distributions (MPD) of PDMP\nmodels of gene networks. In these models, the promoter dynamics is described by\na finite state, continuous time Markov process, whereas the mRNA and protein\nlevels follow ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The Monte-Carlo method\ncombines direct simulation of the PDMP with analytic solutions of the ODEs. The\npush-forward method numerically computes the probability measure advected by\nthe deterministic ODE flow, through the use of analytic expressions of the\ncorresponding semigroup. Compared to earlier versions of this method, the\nprobability of the promoter states sequence is computed beyond the naive mean\nfield theory and adapted for non-linear regulation functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 09:45:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Innocentini", "Guilherme C.

The error-correction mechanism implemented by the\nenzyme determines which of the two cases holds. For example, discrimination in\nthe forward reaction rates tends to grant smaller errors to polymers with\nfaster synthesis. The opposite occurs for discrimination in monomer rejection\nrates. Our results provide an experimentally feasible way to identify\nerror-correction mechanisms by measuring the error-speed correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2019 06:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chiuchi\u00fa", "Davide", ""], ["Tu", "Yuhai", ""], ["Pigolotti", "Simone", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.12958", "submitter": "Edmund Crampin", "authors": "Peter J.

After showing\nbi-directional translations between RPNs and BNs and analogies between results\non synchronism sensitivity, we illustrate that usual updating modes for BNs can\nmiss plausible behaviours, i.e., incorrectly conclude on the\nabsence/impossibility of reaching specific configurations.
