In recent years, SL has\nemerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy against cancer: by targeting the\nSL partners of altered genes in cancer cells, these cells can be selectively\nkilled while sparing the normal cells. Consequently, a number of studies have\nattempted prediction of SL interactions in human, a majority by extrapolating\nSL interactions inferred through large-scale screens in model organisms.\nHowever, these predicted SL interactions either do not hold in human cells or\ndo not include genes that are (frequently) altered in human cancers, and are\ntherefore not attractive in the context of cancer therapy.\n  Results: Here, we develop a computational approach to infer SL interactions\ndirectly from frequently altered genes in human cancers. It is based on the\nobservation that pairs of genes that are altered in a (significantly) mutually\nexclusive manner in cancers are likely to constitute lethal combinations. Using\ngenomic copy-number and gene-expression data from four cancers, breast,\nprostate, ovarian and uterine (total 3980 samples) from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas, we identify 718 genes that are frequently amplified or upregulated, and\nare likely to be synthetic lethal with six key DNA-damage response (DDR) genes\nin these cancers.

Notably, when minimizing the energy of the input signal, the optimal\nsignals exhibit overshooting, which is a biphasic pattern with transient and\nsteady phases; this pattern is prevalent in actual dynamical patterns. We also\nidentify conditions in which these three patterns (steep, gradual, and\novershooting) confer advantages. Our study shows that cellular signal\ntransduction is governed by the principle of minimizing free energy dissipation\nand uncertainty; these constraints serve as selective pressures when designing\ndynamical signaling patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 09:29:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 10:19:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 20 Apr 2016 06:35:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 08:21:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Hasegawa", "Yoshihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.07784", "submitter": "Hao Ge", "authors": "Yongyi Guo, Zhiyi You, Min Qian, Hao Ge", "title": "Stochastic robustness and relative stability of multiple pathways in\n  biological networks", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multiple dynamic pathways always exist in biological networks, but their\nrobustness against internal fluctuations and relative stability have not been\nwell recognized and carefully analyzed yet. Here we try to address these issues\nthrough an illustrative example, namely the Siah-1/beta-catenin/p14/19 ARF loop\nof protein p53 dynamics. Its deterministic Boolean network model predicts that\ntwo parallel pathways with comparable magnitudes of attractive basins should\nexist after the protein p53 is activated when a cell becomes harmfully\ndisturbed. Once the low but non-neglectable intrinsic fluctuations are\nincorporated into the model, we show that a phase transition phenomenon is\nemerged: in one parameter region the probability weights of the normal pathway,\nreported in experimental literature, are comparable with the other pathway\nwhich is seemingly abnormal with the unknown functions, whereas, in some other\nparameter regions, the probability weight of the abnormal pathway can even\ndominate and become globally attractive. The theory of exponentially perturbed\nMarkov chains is applied and further generalized in order to quantitatively\nexplain such a phase transition phenomenon, in which the nonequilibrium\n\"activation energy barriers\" along each transiting trajectory between the\nparallel pathways and the number of \"optimal transition paths\" play a central\npart. Our theory can also determine how the transition time and the number of\noptimal transition paths between the parallel pathways depend on each\ninteraction's strength, and help to identify those possibly more crucial\ninteractions in the biological network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 06:48:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Yongyi", ""], ["You", "Zhiyi", ""], ["Qian", "Min", ""], ["Ge", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08237", "submitter": "Salvatore Alaimo Ph.D.", "authors": "Salvatore Alaimo, Rosalba Giugno, Mario Acunzo, Dario Veneziano,\n  Alfredo Ferro, and Alfredo Pulvirenti", "title": "Post-transcriptional knowledge in pathway analysis increases the\n  accuracy of phenotypes classification", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.18632/oncotarget.9788", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.CE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: Prediction of phenotypes from high-dimensional data is a crucial\ntask in precision biology and medicine.

A number of\nmethods, including some from our own group, have explored how one goes about\ncomputing or predicting the dynamics of networks given information about\ninternal models of individual nodes and network connectivity, possibly with\nadditional information provided by statistical or descriptive metrics that\ncharacterize the network. But what can be inferred about network dynamics when\nthere is no knowledge or information about the internal model or dynamics of\nparticipating nodes? Here, we explore how connected subsets of nodes\ncompetitively interact in order to activate a common downstream node they\nconnect into. We achieve this by assuming a simple set of rules borrowed from\nneurophysiology. The model we develop reflects a local process from which\nglobal network dynamics emerges. We call this model a competitive refractory\ndynanics model. It is derived from a consideration of spatial and temporal\nsummation in biological neurons, whereby summating post synaptic potentials\n(PSPs) along the dendritic tree contribute towards the membrane potential at\nthe initial segment reaching a threshold potential. We first show how the\n'winning node' or set of 'winning' nodes that achieve activation of a\ndownstream node is computable by the model. We then derive a formal definition\nof optimized network signaling within our framework. We define a ratio between\nthe signaling latencies on the edges of the network and the internal time it\ntakes individual nodes to process incoming signals. We show that an optimal\nratio is one where the speed of information propagation between connected nodes\ndoes not exceed the internal dynamic time scale of the nodes. We then show how\nwe can use these results to arrive at a unique interpretation for the\nprevalence of the small world network topology in natural and engineered\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 06:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 18:11:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2016 23:20:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 12 May 2017 03:22:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 3 Nov 2017 03:09:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Silva", "Gabriel A.", ""]]}]
