Moreover, we derive an energy accuracy tradeoff for such general\nnon-equilibrium receptors when the estimation is performed by a simple observer\nof the duration the receptor is in signaling states. This tradeoff reveals that\nthe simple observer can only attain the performance of the ideal observer in\nthe limit of large receptor energy consumption and size. Our results generalize\nthe classic 1977 Berg-Purcell limit on cellular sensing along multiple\ndimensions, and yield a novel thermodynamic uncertainty relation for the time a\nphysical system spends in a pool of states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:04:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 19:44:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Harvey", "S.

Given the increasing amount of\nbiological data available and the recent discoveries showing that many diseases\nare related to the disruption of cellular signal transduction cascades, in\nsilico discovery of signaling pathways in cell biology has become an active\nresearch topic in past years. However, reconstruction of signaling pathways\nremains a challenge mainly because of the need for systematic approaches for\npredicting causal relationships, like edge direction and activation/inhibition\namong interacting proteins in the signal flow. We propose an approach for\npredicting signaling pathways that integrates protein interactions, gene\nexpression, phenotypes, and protein complex information. Our method first finds\ncandidate pathways using a directed-edge-based algorithm and then defines a\ngraph model to include causal activation relationships among proteins, in\ncandidate pathways using cell cycle gene expression and phenotypes to infer\nconsistent pathways in yeast. Then, we incorporate protein complex coverage\ninformation for deciding on the final predicted signaling pathways. We show\nthat our approach improves the predictive results of the state of the art using\ndifferent ranking metrics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2020 16:55:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2020 17:07:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Inostroza", "Daniel", ""], ["Hern\u00e1ndez", "Cecilia", ""], ["Seco", "Diego", ""], ["Navarro", "Gonzalo", ""], ["Olivera-Nappa", "Alvaro", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.12693", "submitter": "Hamid Rahkooy", "authors": "Hamid Rahkooy and Ovidiu Radulescu and Thomas Sturm", "title": "A Linear Algebra Approach for Detecting Binomiality of Steady State\n  Ideals of Reversible Chemical Reaction Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proc.

We take an algebraic approach considering, besides concentrations of\nspecies, also rate constants as indeterminates. This leads us to the concept of\nunconditional binomiality, meaning binomiality for all values of the rate\nconstants. This concept is different from conditional binomiality that applies\nwhen rate constant values or relations among rate constants are given. We start\nby representing the generators of a steady state ideal as sums of binomials,\nwhich yields a corresponding coefficient matrix. On these grounds we propose an\nefficient algorithm for detecting unconditional binomiality. That algorithm\nuses exclusively elementary column and row operations on the coefficient\nmatrix. We prove asymptotic worst case upper bounds on the time complexity of\nour algorithm. Furthermore, we experimentally compare its performance with\nother existing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2020 13:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:03:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Rahkooy", "Hamid", ""], ["Radulescu", "Ovidiu", ""], ["Sturm", "Thomas", ""]]}]
