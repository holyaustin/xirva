When investigating the dynamics of these models one strategy is to\nlook at the simplest possible models in order to get the most detailed\ninsights. We investigate a minimal model of the Calvin cycle introduced by Hahn\nwhile he was pursuing this strategy. In a variant of the model not including\nphotorespiration it is shown that there exists exactly one positive steady\nstate and that this steady state is unstable. For generic initial data either\nall concentrations tend to infinity at lates times or all concentrations tend\nto zero at late times. In a variant including photorespiration it is shown that\nfor suitable values of the parameters of the model there exist two positive\nsteady states, one stable and one unstable. For generic initial data either the\nsolution tends to the stable steady state at late times or all concentrations\ntend to zero at late times. Thus we obtain rigorous proofs of mathematical\nstatements which together confirm the intuitive idea proposed by Hahn that\nphotorespiration can stabilize the operation of the Calvin cycle. In the case\nthat the concentrations tend to infinity we derive formulae for the leading\norder asymptotics using the Poincar\\'e compactification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Dec 2018 09:25:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Obeid", "Hussein", ""], ["Rendall", "Alan D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.00818", "submitter": "Ronan M.T.

A key\naspect of our work is the modeling of single-cell variability by assigning a\nprobability distribution to intervals of initial concentration values and\nkinetic rate constants. We propagate this distribution through the system\ndynamics to obtain a distribution over the set of trajectories of the ODEs.\nThis in turn opens the door for performing statistical analysis of the ODE\nsystem's behavior. To illustrate this we first encode quantitative data and\nqualitative trends as bounded linear time temporal logic (BLTL) formulas. Based\non this we construct a parameter estimation method using an SMC-driven\nevaluation procedure applied to the stochastic version of the behavior of the\nODE system. We then describe how this SMC framework can be generalized to\nhybrid automata by exploiting the given distribution over the initial states\nand the--much more sophisticated--system dynamics to associate a Markov chain\nwith the hybrid automaton. We then establish a strong relationship between the\nbehaviors of the hybrid automaton and its associated Markov chain.\nConsequently, we sample trajectories from the hybrid automaton in a way that\nmimics the sampling of the trajectories of the Markov chain. This enables us to\nverify approximately that the Markov chain meets a BLTL specification with high\nprobability. We have applied these methods to ODE based models of Toll-like\nreceptor signaling and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, as well\nas to systems exhibiting hybrid dynamics including the circadian clock pathway\nand cardiac cell physiology.

The\ntime-dependent evolution of concentrations of the species is commonly described\nby a system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs). However, the\nanalysis of such high-dimensional, non-linear system of equations is often\ncomputationally expensive and even prohibitive in practice. The major challenge\ntowards reducing such models is providing the guarantees as to how the solution\nof the reduced model relates to that of the original model, while avoiding to\nsolve the original model. In this paper, we have designed and tested an\napproximation method for ODE models of biochemical reaction systems, in which\nthe guarantees are our major requirement. Borrowing from tropical analysis\ntechniques, dominance relations among terms of each species' ODE are exploited\nto simplify the original model, by neglecting the dominated terms. As the\ndominant subsystems can change during the system's dynamics, depending on which\nspecies dominate the others, several possible modes exist. Thus, simpler models\nconsisting of only the dominant subsystems can be assembled into hybrid,\npiecewise smooth models, which approximate the behavior of the initial system.\nBy combining the detection of dominated terms with symbolic bounds propagation,\nwe show how to approximate the original model by an assembly of simpler models,\nconsisting in ordinary differential equations that provide time-dependent lower\nand upper bounds for the concentrations of the initial models species. Our\nmethod provides sound interval bounds for the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies, and hence can serve to evaluate the faithfulness of\ntropicalization-based reduction heuristics for ODE models of biochemical\nreduction systems. The method is tested on several case studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2018 17:30:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2019 09:56:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Beica", "Andreea", ""], ["Feret", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["Petrov", "Tatjana", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11627", "submitter": "Griffin Chure", "authors": "Rob Phillips, Nathan M.

The ability to read and\nre-write it at will has ushered in a stunning period in the history of science.\nNonetheless, there is an Achilles heel exposed by all of the genomic data that\nhas accrued: we still don't know how to interpret it. Many genes are subject to\nsophisticated programs of transcriptional regulation, mediated by DNA sequences\nthat harbor binding sites for transcription factors which can up- or\ndown-regulate gene expression depending upon environmental conditions. This\ngives rise to an input-output function describing how the level of expression\ndepends upon the parameters of the regulated gene { for instance, on the number\nand type of binding sites in its regulatory sequence. In recent years, the\nability to make precision measurements of expression, coupled with the ability\nto make increasingly sophisticated theoretical predictions, have enabled an\nexplicit dialogue between theory and experiment that holds the promise of\ncovering this genomic Achilles heel. The goal is to reach a predictive\nunderstanding of transcriptional regulation that makes it possible to calculate\ngene expression levels from DNA regulatory sequence. This review focuses on the\ncanonical simple repression motif to ask how well the models that have been\nused to characterize it actually work. We consider a hierarchy of increasingly\nsophisticated experiments in which the minimal parameter set learned at one\nlevel is applied to make quantitative predictions at the next. We show that\nthese careful quantitative dissections provide a template for a predictive\nunderstanding of the many more complex regulatory arrangements found across all\ndomains of life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2018 23:06:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Phillips", "Rob", ""], ["Belliveau", "Nathan M.", ""], ["Chure", "Griffin", ""], ["Garcia", "Hernan G.", ""], ["Razo-Mejia", "Manuel", ""], ["Scholes", "Clarissa", ""]]}]
