We use a Boolean modeling framework and ideas from spin\nglass literature to identify functional differences between five real\nbiological networks and random networks with similar topological features. We\nshow that minimal frustration is a fundamental property that allows biological\nnetworks to robustly establish cell types and regulate cell fate choice, and\nthis property can emerge in complex networks via Darwinian evolution. The study\nalso provides clues regarding how the regulation of cell fate choice can go\nawry in a disease like cancer and lead to the emergence of aberrant cell types.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Nov 2019 21:16:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Tripathi", "Shubham", ""], ["Kessler", "David A.", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10316", "submitter": "Peiran Jiang", "authors": "Peiran Jiang, Shujun Huang, Zhenyuan Fu, Zexuan Sun, Ted M.

Given the enormous number of drug combinations, it is cost- and\ntime-consuming to screen all possible drug pairs experimentally. Currently, it\nhas not been fully explored to integrate multiple networks to predict\nsynergistic drug combinations using recently developed deep learning\ntechnologies. In this study, we proposed a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN)\nmodel to predict synergistic drug combinations in particular cancer cell lines.\nSpecifically, the GCN method used a convolutional neural network model to do\nheterogeneous graph embedding, and thus solved a link prediction task. The\ngraph in this study was a multimodal graph, which was constructed by\nintegrating the drug-drug combination, drug-protein interaction, and\nprotein-protein interaction networks. We found that the GCN model was able to\ncorrectly predict cell line-specific synergistic drug combinations from a large\nheterogonous network. The majority (30) of the 39 cell line-specific models\nshow an area under the receiver operational characteristic curve (AUC) larger\nthan 0.80, resulting in a mean AUC of 0.84. Moreover, we conducted an in-depth\nliterature survey to investigate the top predicted drug combinations in\nspecific cancer cell lines and found that many of them have been found to show\nsynergistic antitumor activity against the same or other cancers in vitro or in\nvivo. Taken together, the results indicate that our study provides a promising\nway to better predict and optimize synergistic drug pairs in silico.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Nov 2019 06:21:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Peiran", ""], ["Huang", "Shujun", ""], ["Fu", "Zhenyuan", ""], ["Sun", "Zexuan", ""], ["Lakowski", "Ted M.", ""], ["Hu", "Pingzhao", ""]]}]
