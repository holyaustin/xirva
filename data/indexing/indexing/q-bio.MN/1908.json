Its\ndistinguishing feature is the explicit assignment of catalytic function to\nchemicals that are part of the network. In this work, we show the introduction\nof subsequent and simultaneous catalytic functions gives rise to an algebraic\nstructure of a semigroup with additional compatible data of idempotent addition\nand a partial order. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that such\nsemigroup models are a natural setup to treat the emergence of autocatalytic\nbiochemical reaction networks. We establish the basic algebraic properties of\nthe algebraic models and show that it is natural to define the function of any\nsubnetwork on the whole reaction network in a mathematically correct way. This\nleads to a natural discrete dynamics on the network, which results from\niteratively considering the self-action on a subnetwork by its own function.\nFinally, we demonstrate that the identification of the maximal self-sustaining\nsubnetwork of any reaction network is very straightforward in our setup. This\nleads to an algebraic characterization of the lattice of self-sustaining\nsubsets for any CRS. Moreover, we show that algebraic models for reaction\nnetworks with a self-sustaining subnetwork cannot be nilpotent, thus\nestablishing a link to the combinatorial theory of finite semigroups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Aug 2019 13:46:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Loutchko", "", ""], ["Dimitri", "", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.04836", "submitter": "Alessandro Seganti", "authors": "Alessandro Seganti", "title": "Boolean constraint satisfaction problems for reaction networks", "comments": "Doctoral thesis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cond-mat.dis-nn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This Thesis presents research at the boundary between Statistical Physics and\nBiology.

Human aging is linked to many prevalent diseases. The aging\nprocess is highly influenced by genetic factors. Hence, it is important to\nidentify human aging-related genes.

The potential of such data integration has been\nrecognized but mostly in the context of cancer. So, we are the first to propose\na supervised learning framework for predicting aging-related genes from an\naging-specific PPI subnetwork.\n  Results. In a systematic and comprehensive evaluation, we find that in many\nof the evaluation tests: (i) using an aging-specific subnetwork indeed yields\nmore accurate aging-related gene predictions than using the entire network, and\n(ii) predictive methods from our framework that have not previously been used\nfor supervised prediction of aging-related genes outperform existing prominent\nmethods for the same purpose.\n  Conclusion.
