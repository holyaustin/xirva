Little is known\nregarding the regulatory interactions between noncoding RNA classes. Recent\nreports have suggested that lncRNAs could potentially interact with other\nnoncoding RNAs including miroRNAs (miRNAs) and modulate their regulatory role\nthrough interactions. We hypothesized that long noncoding RNAs could\nparticipate as a layer of regulatory interactions with miRNAs. The availability\nof genome-scale datasets for argonaute targets across human transcriptome has\nprompted us to reconstruct a genome-scale network of interactions between\nmiRNAs and lncRNAs.\n  We used well characterized experimental\nPhotoactivatable-Ribonucleoside-Enhanced Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation\n(PAR-CLIP) datasets and the recent genome-wide annotations for lncRNAs in\npublic domain to construct a comprehensive transcriptome-wide map of miRNA\nregulatory elements. Comparative analysis revealed many of the miRNAs could\ntarget long noncoding RNAs, apart from the coding transcripts thus\nparticipating in a novel layer of regulatory interactions between noncoding RNA\nclasses. We also find the miRNA regulatory elements have a positional\npreference, clustering towards the 3' and 5' ends of the long noncoding\ntranscripts. We also further reconstruct a genome-wide map of miRNA\ninteractions with lncRNAs as well as messenger RNAs.\n  This analysis suggests widespread regulatory interactions between noncoding\nRNAs classes and suggests a novel functional role for lncRNAs. We also present\nthe first transcriptome scale study on lncRNA-miRNA interactions and the first\nreport of a genome-scale reconstruction of a noncoding RNA regulatory\ninteractome involving lncRNAs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 09:48:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Jalali", "Saakshi", ""], ["Bhartiya", "Deeksha", ""], ["Scaria", "Vinod", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0162", "submitter": "Thomas R.

While gene expression is often\nhighly erratic, embryonic development is usually exceedingly precise. In\nparticular, gene expression boundaries are robust not only against intrinsic\nnoise from gene expression and protein diffusion, but also against\nembryo-to-embryo variations in the morphogen gradients, which provide\npositional information to the differentiating cells. How development is robust\nagainst intra- and inter-embryonic variations is not understood. A common motif\nin the gene regulation networks that control embryonic development is mutual\nrepression between pairs of genes. To assess the role of mutual repression in\nthe robust formation of gene expression patterns, we have performed large-scale\nstochastic simulations of a minimal model of two mutually repressing gap genes\nin Drosophila, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni). Our model includes not only\nmutual repression between hb and kni, but also the stochastic and cooperative\nactivation of hb by the anterior morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) and of kni by the\nposterior morphogen Caudal (Cad), as well as the diffusion of Hb and Kni. Our\nanalysis reveals that mutual repression can markedly increase the steepness and\nprecision of the gap gene expression boundaries. In contrast to spatial\naveraging and cooperative gene activation, mutual repression thus allows for\ngene-expression boundaries that are both steep and precise. Moreover, mutual\nrepression dramatically enhances their robustness against embryo-to-embryo\nvariations in the morphogen levels. Finally, our simulations reveal that gap\nprotein diffusion plays a critical role not only in reducing the width of gap\ngene expression boundaries via spatial averaging, but also in repairing\npatterning errors that could arise due to the bistability induced by mutual\nrepression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 10:15:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Aug 2012 11:08:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Sokolowski", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Erdmann", "Thorsten", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0874", "submitter": "Anne Shiu", "authors": "Manoj Gopalkrishnan, Ezra Miller, Anne Shiu", "title": "A Projection Argument for Differential Inclusions, with Applications to\n  Persistence of Mass-Action Kinetics", "comments": "v5: published version; v3 and v4: minor additional edits; v2:\n  contains more general version of main theorem on vertexical families,\n  including its accompanying corollaries -- some of them new; final section\n  contains new results relating to prior and future research on persistence of\n  mass-action systems; improved exposition throughout", "journal-ref": "SIGMA 9 (2013), 025, 25 pages", "doi": "10.3842/SIGMA.2013.025", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS cs.SY q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by questions in mass-action kinetics, we introduce the notion of\nvertexical family of differential inclusions.

The model consists of input-output transfer\nfunctions, which are derived from differential equations, using stable\nequilibria.

The delay is computed\nas the maximal reaction time until a stable equilibrium for the target species\nis reached, in the context of all other reactions in the system. The\ntransmission strength is the concentration change of the target species. The\ncomputed input-output transfer functions can be stored in a matrix, fitted with\nparameters, and recalled to build discrete dynamical models. By separating\nreaction time and concentration we can greatly simplify the model,\ncircumventing typical problems of complex dynamical systems.
