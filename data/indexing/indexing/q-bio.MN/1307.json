The spatial variation of chromatin density within\nmouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography\nreconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear\nspace into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.\nVolume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying\ndensity of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the\npotential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density\nof chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the\nvolume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of\nvolume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a\nprotein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a\nfinite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the\nmean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein\nexperiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain\nthese results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there\nis an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the\nvolume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective\npotential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:13:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 16:09:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 23:10:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Isaacson", "Samuel A.", ""], ["Larabell", "Carolyn A.", ""], ["Gros", "Mark A.
