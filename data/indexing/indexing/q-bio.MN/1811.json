Cells are, however, highly\ncrowded with macromolecules, including a variety of molecular machines such as\nenzymes. The working cycles of these machines are often coupled with their\ninternal motion (conformational changes). In the crowded environment of a cell,\nmotion interference between neighboring molecules is not negligible, and this\ninterference can affect the reaction dynamics through machine operation. To\nsimulate such a situation, we propose a reaction-diffusion model consisting of\nparticles whose shape depends on an internal state variable, for crowds of\nnano- to micro-machines. The interference between nearby particles is naturally\nintroduced through excluded volume repulsion. In the simulations, we observed\nsegregation and flow-like patterns enhanced by crowding out of relevant\nmolecules, as well as molecular synchronization waves and phase transitions.\nThe presented model is simple and extensible for diverse molecular machinery,\nand may serve as a framework to study the interplay between the mechanical\nstress/strain network and the chemical reaction network in the cell.\nApplications to more macroscopic systems, e.g., crowds of cells, are also\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2018 22:28:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Togashi", "Yuichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.02766", "submitter": "Tomislav Plesa Dr", "authors": "Tomislav Plesa", "title": "Stochastic approximations of higher-molecular by bi-molecular reactions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biochemical reactions involving three or more reactants, called\nhigher-molecular reactions, play an important role in theoretical systems and\nsynthetic biology.

In this\nwork, we propose several hardware-based simulation schemes utilizing novel\nrandom update index generation techniques for step-based and round-based\nstochastic simulations of cellular networks.

They occur in biological models because of diffusion effects or as\nsimplifying modeling elements. We propose here to consider delayed stochastic\nreaction networks. The difficulty here lies in the fact that the state-space of\na delayed reaction network is infinite-dimensional, which makes their analysis\nmore involved. We demonstrate here that a particular class of stochastic\ntime-varying delays, namely those that follow a phase-type distribution, can be\nexactly implemented in terms of a chemical reaction network. Hence, any\ndelay-free network can be augmented to incorporate those delays through the\naddition of delay-species and delay-reactions. Hence, for this class of\nstochastic delays, which can be used to approximate any delay distribution\narbitrarily accurately, the state-space remains finite-dimensional and,\ntherefore, standard tools developed for standard reaction network still apply.\nIn particular, we demonstrate that for unimolecular mass-action reaction\nnetworks that the delayed stochastic reaction network is ergodic if and only if\nthe non-delayed network is ergodic as well. Bimolecular reactions are more\ndifficult to consider but an analogous result is also obtained. These results\ntell us that delays that are phase-type distributed, regardless of their\ndistribution, are not harmful to the ergodicity property of reaction networks.\nWe also prove that the presence of those delays adds convolution terms in the\nmoment equation but does not change the value of the stationary means compared\nto the delay-free case. Finally, the control of a certain class of delayed\nstochastic reaction network using a delayed antithetic integral controller is\nconsidered. It is proven that this controller achieves its goal provided that\nthe delay-free network satisfy the conditions of ergodicity and\noutput-controllability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2018 14:23:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Sep 2019 22:33:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 06:48:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2020 17:14:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 18:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Briat", "Corentin", ""], ["Khammash", "Mustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.09512", "submitter": "Fangting Li", "authors": "Yao Zhao (1,2), Dedi Wang (1,2), Zhiwen Zhang (1,2), Ying Lu (3),\n  Xiaojing Yang (2), Qi Ouyang (1,2), Chao Tang (1,2), and Fangting Li (1,2)\n  ((1) School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing, China, (2) Center for\n  Quantitative Biology, Peking University, Beijing, China, (3) Department of\n  Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA)", "title": "Critical slowing down and attractive manifold: a mechanism for dynamic\n  robustness in yeast cell-cycle process", "comments": "27 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
