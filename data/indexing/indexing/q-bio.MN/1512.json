This essential requirement has been largely overlooked by the\nmetabolic pathway community.\n  Indeed, every flux mode can be decomposed into elementary modes without\ncancelations. The result is an immediate consequence of a theorem by\nRockafellar which states that every element of a linear subspace is a conformal\nsum (a sum without cancelations) of elementary vectors (support-minimal\nvectors).

We introduce SIREN, a\nfast and memory efficient tool with low computational complexity, that allows\nthe user to easily consider it as a complementary approach for many network\nreconstruction methods. SIREN allows biologists to use independent expression\ndata to predict interaction types for known gene regulatory networks where\nreconstruction methods do not provide any information about the nature of their\ninteraction types. The SIREN Cytoscape plugin is implemented in Java and is\nfreely available at http://baderlab.org/Software/SIRENplugin and via the\nCytoscape app manager.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 06:39:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Montojo", "Jason", ""], ["Khosravi", "Pegah", ""], ["Gazestani", "Vahid H.", ""], ["Bader", "Gary D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.05234", "submitter": "Inna Kuperstein", "authors": "Inna Kuperstein", "title": "Deciphering cell signaling rewiring in human disorders", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The knowledge of cell molecular mechanisms implicated in human diseases is\nexpanding and should be converted into guidelines for deciphering pathological\ncell signaling and suggesting appropriate treatment.

Many important interactions are conserved\nacross a large variety of species. The need to maintain interaction leads to a\nhigh degree of co-evolution between residues in the interface between partner\nproteins. The inference of protein-protein interaction networks from the\nrapidly growing sequence databases is one of the most formidable tasks in\nsystems biology today. We propose here a novel approach based on the\nDirect-Coupling Analysis of the co-evolution between inter-protein residue\npairs. We use ribosomal and trp operon proteins as test cases: For the small\nresp. large ribosomal subunit our approach predicts protein-interaction\npartners at a true-positive rate of 70% resp. 90% within the first 10\npredictions, with areas of 0.69 resp. 0.81 under the ROC curves for all\npredictions. In the trp operon, it assigns the two largest interaction scores\nto the only two interactions experimentally known. On the level of residue\ninteractions we show that for both the small and the large ribosomal subunit\nour approach predicts interacting residues in the system with a true positive\nrate of 60% and 85% in the first 20 predictions. We use artificial data to show\nthat the performance of our approach depends crucially on the size of the joint\nmultiple sequence alignments and analyze how many sequences would be necessary\nfor a perfect prediction if the sequences were sampled from the same model that\nwe use for prediction. Given the performance of our approach on the test data\nwe speculate that it can be used to detect new interactions, especially in the\nlight of the rapid growth of available sequence data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 00:22:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 10:54:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Feinauer", "Christoph", ""], ["Szurmant", "Hendrik", ""], ["Weigt", "Martin", ""], ["Pagnani", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.05574", "submitter": "Tom Michoel", "authors": "Lingfei Wang, Tom Michoel", "title": "Detection of regulator genes and eQTLs in gene networks", "comments": "minor revision with typos corrected; review article; 24 pages, 2\n  figures", "journal-ref": "Systems Biology in Animal Production and Health, Vol. 1, Chapter 1\n  (2016)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-319-43335-6_1", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Genetic differences between individuals associated to quantitative phenotypic\ntraits, including disease states, are usually found in non-coding genomic\nregions.

The precision of gradient\nsensing increases with the length of a detector (a cell or group of cells) in\nthe gradient direction, since a longer detector spans a larger range of\nconcentration values. Intuition from analyses of concentration sensing suggests\nthat precision should also increase with detector length in the direction\ntransverse to the gradient, since then spatial averaging should reduce the\nnoise. However, here we show that, unlike for concentration sensing, the\nprecision of gradient sensing decreases with transverse length for the simplest\ngradient sensing model, local excitation--global inhibition (LEGI). The reason\nis that gradient sensing ultimately relies on a subtraction of measured\nconcentration values. While spatial averaging indeed reduces the noise in these\nmeasurements, which increases precision, it also reduces the covariance between\nthe measurements, which results in the net decrease in precision. We\ndemonstrate how a recently introduced gradient sensing mechanism, regional\nexcitation--global inhibition (REGI), overcomes this effect and recovers the\nbenefit of transverse averaging. Using a REGI-based model, we compute the\noptimal two- and three-dimensional detector shapes, and argue that they are\nconsistent with the shapes of naturally occurring gradient-sensing cell\npopulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 07:01:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Smith", "Tyler", ""], ["Fancher", "Sean", ""], ["Levchenko", "Andre", ""], ["Nemenman", "Ilya", ""], ["Mugler", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08798", "submitter": "Carlo Piermarocchi", "authors": "Anthony Szedlak, Nicholas Smith, Li Liu, Giovanni Paternostro, Carlo\n  Piermarocchi", "title": "Evolutionary and topological properties of gene modules and driver\n  mutations in a leukemia gene regulatory network", "comments": "9 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005009", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The diverse, specialized genes in today's lifeforms evolved from a common\ncore of ancient, elementary genes.
