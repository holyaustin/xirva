Although the possibility to\nreproduce this emergence in laboratory has received considerable attention,\nthis is still far from being achieved. In order to unravel some key properties\nenabling the emergence of structures potentially able to sustain their own\nexistence and growth, in this work we investigate the probability to observe\nthem in ensembles of random catalytic reaction networks characterized by\ndifferent structural properties. From the point of view of network topology, an\nautocatalytic set have been defined either in term of strongly connected\ncomponents (SCCs) or as reflexively autocatalytic and food-generated sets\n(RAFs). We observe that the average level of catalysis differently affects the\nprobability to observe a SCC or a RAF, highlighting the existence of a region\nwhere the former can be observed, whereas the latter cannot. This parameter\nalso affects the composition of the RAF, which can be further characterized\ninto linear structures, autocatalysis or SCCs. Interestingly, we show that the\ndifferent network topology (uniform as opposed to power-law catalysis systems)\ndoes not have a significantly divergent impact on SCCs and RAFs appearance,\nwhereas the proportion between cleavages and condensations seems instead to\nplay a role. A major factor that limits the probability of RAF appearance and\nthat may explain some of the difficulties encountered in laboratory seems to be\nthe presence of molecules which can accumulate without being substrate or\ncatalyst of any reaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 09:51:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Filisetti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Villani", "Marco", ""], ["Damiani", "Chiara", ""], ["Graudenzi", "Alex", ""], ["Roli", "Andrea", ""], ["Hordijk", "Wim", ""], ["Serra", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.01463", "submitter": "Wolfram Liebermeister", "authors": "Wolfram Liebermeister, Timo Lubitz, and Jens Hahn", "title": "SBtab - Conventions for structured data tables in Systems Biology", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Data tables in the form of spreadsheets or delimited text files are the most\nutilised data format in Systems Biology.

This comparison demonstrates that Cu induces oxidative\nstress in E. siliculosus as illustrated by the transcriptomic overlap between\nCu and H2O2 treatments. The common response to Cu and H2O2 consisted in the\nactivation of the oxylipin and the repression of inositol signaling pathways,\ntogether with the regulation of genes coding for several\ntranscription-associated proteins. Concomitantly, Cu stress specifically\nactivated a set of genes coding for orthologs of ABC transporters, a P1B-type\nATPase, ROS detoxification systems such as a vanadium-dependent\nbromoperoxidase, and induced an increase of free fatty acid contents. Finally\nwe observed, as a common abiotic stress mechanism, the activation of autophagic\nprocesses on one hand and the repression of genes involved in nitrogen\nassimilation on the other hand.

Such models are commonly used to describe the dynamics of nonnegative\nsystems, with a wide range of application fields such as chemistry, systems\nbiology, process modeling or even transportation systems. Using a flux-based\ndescription of kinetic models, a canonical representation of the set of all\npossible feasible equilibria is developed. The characterization is made in\nterms of strictly stable compartmental matrices to define the so-called family\nof solutions. Feasibility is imposed by a set of constraints, which are linear\non a log-transformed space of complexes, and relate to the kernel of a matrix,\nthe columns of which span the stoichiometric subspace. One particularly\ninteresting representation of these constraints can be expressed in terms of a\nclass of monotonous decreasing functions. This allows connections to be\nestablished with classical results in CRNT that relate to the existence and\nuniqueness of equilibria along positive stoichiometric compatibility classes.\nIn particular, monotonicity can be employed to identify regions in the set of\npossible reaction rate coefficients leading to complex balancing, and to\nconclude uniqueness of equilibria for a class of positive deficiency networks.\nThe latter result might support constructing an alternative proof of the\nwell-known deficiency one theorem. The developed notions and results are\nillustrated through examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 10:16:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 23:30:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Alonso", "Antonio A.", ""], ["Szederkenyi", "Gabor", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07555", "submitter": "Daniel Merkle", "authors": "Jakob L.

In a recent contribution, Albert\nEschenmoser emphasised the importance of catalytic and autocatalytic cycles in\nestablishing such abiotic synthesis pathways. The accumulation of intermediate\nproducts furthermore provides additional catalysts that allow pathways to\nchange over time. We show here that generative models of chemical spaces based\non graph grammars make it possible to study such phenomena is a systematic\nmanner. In addition to repro- ducing the key steps of Eschenmoser's hypothesis\npaper, we discovered previously unexplored potentially autocatalytic pathways\nfrom HCN to glyoxylate. A cascading of autocatalytic cycles could efficiently\nre-route matter, distributed over the combinatorial complex network of HCN\nhydrolysation chemistry, towards a potential primordial metabolism. The\ngenerative approach also has it intrinsic limitations: the unsupervised\nexpansion of the chemical space remains infeasible due to the exponential\ngrowth of possible molecules and reactions between them. Here in particular the\ncombinatorial complexity of the HCN polymerisation and hydrolysation networks\nforms the computational bottleneck. As a consequence, guidance of the\ncomputational exploration by chemical experience is indispensable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:02:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Andersen", "Jakob L.", ""], ["Flamm", "Christoph", ""], ["Merkle", "Daniel", ""], ["Stadler", "Peter F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07969", "submitter": "Eli Bogart", "authors": "Eli Bogart and Christopher R.

We\ndemonstrate that incorporating these relationships as constraints on reaction\nrates and solving the resulting nonlinear optimization problem yields realistic\npredictions of the response of C4 systems to environmental and biochemical\nperturbations.
