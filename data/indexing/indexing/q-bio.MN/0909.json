Using the\nthree-component negative feedback transcription regulatory system called the\nrepressilator as a prototypical example, we quantify the degree of fluctuations\nin oscillation periods and amplitudes, as well as the noise propagation along\nthe regulatory cascade in the stable oscillation regime via dynamic Monte Carlo\nsimulations. For the single protein-species level, the fluctuation in the\noscillation amplitudes is found to be larger than that of the oscillation\nperiods, the distributions of which are reasonably described by the Weibull\ndistribution and the Gaussian tail, respectively. Correlations between\nsuccessive periods and between successive amplitudes, respectively, are\nmeasured to assess the noise propagation properties, which are found to decay\nfaster for the amplitude than for the period. The local fluctuation property is\nalso studied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2009 07:29:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2010 08:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Min", "Byungjoon", ""], ["Goh", "K. -I.", ""], ["Kim", "I. -M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1935", "submitter": "Natalja Strelkowa", "authors": "Natalja Strelkowa, Mauricio Barahona", "title": "Switchable Genetic Oscillator Operating in Quasi-Stable Mode", "comments": "24 pages, 5 main figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2009.0487", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ring topologies of repressing genes have qualitatively different long-term\ndynamics if the number of genes is odd (they oscillate) or even (they exhibit\nbistability).

We show\nhere that even repressilators possess quasi-stable, travelling-wave periodic\nsolutions that are reachable, long-lived and robust to parameter changes. These\nsolutions underlie the sustained oscillations observed in even rings in the\nstochastic regime, even if these circuits are expected to behave as switches.\nThe existence of such solutions can also be exploited for control purposes:\noperation of the system around the quasi-stable orbit allows us to turn on and\noff the oscillations reliably and on demand.

Perhaps surprisingly, it is controversial\nhow much a protein's functional importance affects its rate of evolution. In\nmost studies, functional importance has been measured on the coarse scale of\nprotein knock-outs, while evolutionary rate has been measured on the fine scale\nof amino acid substitutions. Here we introduce dynamical influence, a finer\nmeasure of protein functional importance. To measure dynamical influence, we\nfirst use detailed biochemical models of particular reaction networks to\nmeasure the influence of each reaction rate constant on network dynamics. We\nthen define the dynamical influence of a protein to be the average influence of\nthe rate constants for all reactions it is involved in.\n  Using models of a dozen biochemical systems and sequence data from\nvertebrates, we show that dynamical influence and evolutionary rate are\nnegatively correlated; proteins with greater dynamical influence evolve more\nslowly. We also show that proteins with greater dynamical influence are not\nmore likely to be essential. This suggests that there are many cellular\nreactions whose presence is essential for life, but whose quantitative rate is\nrelatively unimportant to fitness. We also provide evidence that the effect of\ndynamical influence on evolutionary rate is independent of protein expression\nlevel, expression specificity, gene compactness, and reaction degree. Dynamical\ninfluence offers a finer view of functional importance, and our results suggest\nthat focusing on essentiality may have previously led to an underestimation of\nthe role function plays in protein evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2009 22:01:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Sep 2009 01:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gutenkunst", "Ryan N.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3210", "submitter": "Jorge Vinals", "authors": "Mathieu Gaudreault, Francoise Lepine, and Jorge Vinals", "title": "Pitchfork and Hopf bifurcation thresholds in stochastic equations with\n  delayed feedback", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.80.061920", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The bifurcation diagram of a model stochastic differential equation with\ndelayed feedback is presented. We are motivated by recent research on\nstochastic effects in models of transcriptional gene regulation.

The latter is sufficient to\noriginate a Hopf bifurcation in that region of parameters in which there is a\nsufficiently strong negative feedback. We find a sharp bifurcation in parameter\nspace, and define the threshold as the point in which the stationary\ndistribution function p(x) changes from a delta function at the trivial state\nx=0 to p(x) ~ x^alpha at small x (with alpha = -1 exactly at threshold).

In this paper, we proposed a novel strategy to \"kill\" persister\ncells by triggering them to switch, in a fast and synchronized way, into\nnormally growing cells that are susceptible to antibiotics. The strategy is\nbased on resonant activation (RA), a well-studied phenomenon in physics where\nthe internal noise of a system can constructively facilitate fast and\nsynchronized barrier crossings. Through stochastic Gilliespie simulation with a\ngeneric toggle switch model, we demonstrated that RA exists in the phenotypic\nswitching of a single bacterium. Further, by coupling single cell level and\npopulation level simulations, we showed that with RA, one can greatly reduce\nthe time and total amount of antibiotics needed to sterilize a bacterial\npopulation. We suggest that resonant activation is a general phenomenon in\nphenotypic transition, and can find other applications such as cancer therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 15:47:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2010 17:02:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Yan", ""], ["Zhu", "Meng", ""], ["Xing", "Jianhua", ""]]}]
