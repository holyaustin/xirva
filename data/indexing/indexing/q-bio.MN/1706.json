To take up\nvariant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe\nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants\nof vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of\nreceptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution.\nCompetition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient\ndiversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates,\nwhereas species such as B.~thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex\nglycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide\nopportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another\nimportant process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such\nfluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information\nabout environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often\nadjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular\ncarbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake\nreceptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to\ncontrol the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring\nrelates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence.\nControl theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation\nto the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning\nstudies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory\nwiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify\nenvironmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in\ncellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect\nthose broad concepts to testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of B12,\nsiderophores and glycans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 01:48:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 14:53:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00819", "submitter": "Jayavel Arumugam", "authors": "Jayavel Arumugam", "title": "Simplified Threshold Phenomena in Hypo- and Hyper-coagulation", "comments": "4 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss two threshold phenomena in blood coagulation dynamics using a\nsimplified model.

Integration of prior network information (e.g., from pathway\ndatabases) has the potential to improve reconstructions.\n  Results: We developed a semi--supervised network reconstruction algorithm\nthat enables the synthesis of information from partially known networks with\ntime course gene expression data. We adapted PLS-VIP for time course data and\nused reference networks to simulate expression data from which null\ndistributions of VIP scores are generated and used to estimate edge\nprobabilities for input expression data. By using simulated dynamics to\ngenerate reference distributions, this approach incorporates previously known\nregulatory relationships and links the network to the dynamics to form a\nsemi-supervised approach that discovers novel and anomalous connections. We\napplied this approach to data from a sleep deprivation study with KEGG pathways\ntreated as prior networks, as well as to synthetic data from several DREAM\nchallenges, and find that it is able to recover many of the true edges and\nidentify errors in these networks, suggesting its ability to derive posterior\nnetworks that accurately reflect gene expression dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jun 2017 00:06:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 20:44:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 08:14:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Phan", ""], ["Braun", "Rosemary", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01241", "submitter": "Hector Zenil", "authors": "Yue Deng, Hector Zenil, Jesper T\\'egner, Narsis A.

These oscillators are inherently noisy due to the discrete\nnature of the reactants and the stochastic character of their interactions. To\nkeep these oscillators in sync with the daily day-night rhythm in the presence\nof noise, circadian clocks must be coupled to the dark-light cycle. In this\nmanuscript, we study the entrainment of phase oscillators as a function of the\nintrinsic noise in the system. Using stochastic simulations, we compute the\noptimal coupling strength, intrinsic frequency and shape of the phase-response\ncurve, that maximize the mutual information between the phase of the clock and\ntime. We show that the optimal coupling strength and intrinsic frequency\nincrease with the noise, but that the shape of the phase-response curve varies\nnon-monotonically with the noise: in the low-noise regime, it features a\ndeadzone that increases in width as the noise increases, while in the\nhigh-noise regime, the width decreases with the noise. These results arise from\na trade-off between maximizing stability -noise suppression - and maximizing\nlinearity of the input-output, i.e. time- phase, relation.

Most general results concerning CRNs are limited to restricted\ncases where a topological characteristic known as deficiency takes value 0 or\n1. Here we derive equations of motion for fluctuation moments at all orders for\nstochastic CRNs at general deficiency. We show, for the case of the mass-action\nrate law, that the generator of the stochastic process acts on the hierarchy of\nfactorial moments with a finite representation. Whereas simulation of\nhigh-order moments for many-particle systems is costly, this representation\nreduces solution of moment hierarchies to a complexity comparable to solving a\nheat equation. At steady states, moment hierarchies for finite CRNs interpolate\nbetween low-order and high-order scaling regimes, which may be approximated\nseparately by distributions similar to those for deficiency-0 networks, and\nconnected through matched asymptotic expansions. In CRNs with multiple stable\nor metastable steady states, boundedness of high-order moments provides the\nstarting condition for recursive solution downward to low-order moments,\nreversing the order usually used to solve moment hierarchies. A basis for a\nsubset of network flows defined by having the same mean-regressing property as\nthe flows in deficiency-0 networks gives the leading contribution to low-order\nmoments in CRNs at general deficiency, in a $1/n$-expansion in large particle\nnumbers.
