In this paper, based on\nthe information of biological pathways, we construct a network model of\nhypertension-related genes of the salt-sensitive rat to explore the\ninterrelationship between genes. Statistical and topological characteristics\nshow that the network has the small-world but not scale-free property, and\nexhibits a modular structure, revealing compact and complex connections among\nthese genes. By the threshold of integrated centrality larger than 0.71, seven\nkey hub genes are found: Jun, Rps6kb1, Cycs, Creb3l2, Cdk4, Actg1 and RT1-Da.\nThese genes should play an important role in hypertension, suggesting that the\ntreatment of hypertension should focus on the combination of drugs on multiple\ngenes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2016 04:17:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Huan", ""], ["Hu", "Jing-Bo", ""], ["Xu", "Chuan-Yun", ""], ["Zhang", "De-Hai", ""], ["Yan", "Qian", ""], ["Xu", "Ming", ""], ["Cao", "Ke-Fei", ""], ["Zhang", "Xu-Sheng", ""]]}]
