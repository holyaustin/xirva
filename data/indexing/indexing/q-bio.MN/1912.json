Recent\nprogress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved\nin epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of\nslow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between\ngene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known\nas homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that\ncombines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a\nregulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the\nfeasibility of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a\nslow positive-feedback process from expression to the threshold level is\nintroduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several fixed-point attractors with\ndistinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping the\nepigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys.

Previous\ntheoretical work has asked about the optimization of these abundances, and\nthere is some evidence that regulatory mechanisms bring cells close to this\noptimum, on average. We formulate the tradeoff between the precision of control\nand the efficiency of synthesis, asking for the maximum entropy distribution of\ntRNA abundances consistent with a desired mean rate of protein synthesis. Our\nanalysis, using data from E. coli, indicates that reasonable synthesis rates\nare consistent only with rather low entropies, so that the cell's regulatory\nmechanisms must encode a large amount of information about the \"correct\" tRNA\nabundances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2019 17:24:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rousseau", "Rebecca J.", ""], ["Bialek", "William", ""]]}]
