The intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway of\napoptosis is governed up-stream of mitochondria, by the family of Bcl-2\nproteins, and down-stream of mitochondria, by low-probability events, such as\napoptosome formation, and by feedback circuits involving caspases and inhibitor\nof apoptosis proteins (IAPs), such as XIAP. All these regulatory mechanisms\nensure that cells only commit to death once a threshold of damage has been\nreached and the anti-apoptotic reserve of the cell is overcome. As cancer cells\nare invariably exposed to strong intracellular and extracellular stress\nstimuli, they are particularly reliant on the expression of anti-apoptotic\nproteins. Hence, many cancer cells undergo apoptosis when exposed to agents\nthat inhibit anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 molecules, such as BH3 mimetics, while normal\ncells remain relatively insensitive to single agent treatments with the same\nclass of molecules. Targeting different proteins within the apoptotic network\nwith combinatorial treatment approaches often achieves even greater\nspecificity. This led us to investigate the sensitivity of leukemia and\nlymphoma cells to a pro-apoptotic action of a BH3 mimetic combined with a small\nmolecule inhibitor of XIAP. Using computational probabilistic model of\napoptotic pathway, verified by experimental results from human leukemia and\nlymphoma cell lines, we show that inhibition of XIAP has a non-linear effect on\nsensitization towards apoptosis induced by the BH3 mimetic HA14-1.

Several key\nproteins of the heat shock response became centers of heat shock-induced local\ncommunities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules\nafter heat shock.

Here, we present a formal method to assess the semantic capacity of\na chemical reaction network. The semantic capacity of a network can be measured\nby analyzing the capability of the network to implement molecular codes. We\nanalyzed models of real chemical systems (Martian atmosphere chemistry and\nvarious combustion chemistries), bio-chemical systems (gene expression, gene\ntranslation, and phosphorylation signaling cascades), as well as an artificial\nchemistry and random networks. Our study suggests that different chemical\nsystems posses different semantic capacities. Basically no semantic capacity\nwas found in the atmosphere chemistry of Mars and all studied combustion\nchemistries, as well as in highly connected random networks, i.e., with these\nchemistries molecular codes cannot be implemented. High semantic capacity was\nfound in the bio-chemical systems, as well as in random networks where the\nnumber of second order reactions is at the number of species. Hypotheses\nconcern the origin and evolution of life. We conclude that our approach can be\napplied to evaluate the information processing capabilities of a chemical\nsystem and may thus be a useful tool to understand the origin and evolution of\nmeaningful information, e.g., at the origin of life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 14:16:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["G\u00f6rlich", "Dennis", ""], ["Dittrich", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5063", "submitter": "Jose Vilar", "authors": "Jose M.

Our calibrator device possesses certain novel and useful\nfeatures like modularity (and thus the possibility of being used in many\ndifferent biological contexts), simplicity, being based on a single cell, high\nsensitivity and fast response. To uncover the critical model parameters and the\ncorresponding parameter domain at which the calibrator performance will be\noptimal, a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters was carried out over a\ngiven range of sensing protein concentrations (acting as input). Our analysis\nsuggests that the half saturation constants for repression, sensing and\ndifference in binding cooperativity (Hill coefficients) for repression are the\nkey to the performance of the proposed device. They furthermore are determinant\nfor the sensing speed of the device, showing that it is possible to produce\ndetectable differences in the repression protein concentrations and in turn in\nthe corresponding fluorescence in less than two hours. This analysis paves the\nway for the design, experimental construction and validation of a new family of\nfunctional genetic circuits for the purpose of calibrating promoters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 16:06:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gamermann", "D.", ""], ["Montagud", "A.", ""], ["Aparicio", "P.", ""], ["Navarro", "E.", ""], ["Triana", "J.", ""], ["Villatoro", "F.
