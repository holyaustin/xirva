The function consists of components of the\nspecies formation rate function and a maximal set of independent conservation\nlaws. The determinant of the function is a polynomial in the species\nconcentrations and the rate constants (linear in the latter) and its\ncoefficients are fully determined. The criterion also precludes the existence\nof degenerate steady states. Further, we relate injectivity of a chemical\nreaction network to that of the chemical reaction network obtained by adding\noutflow, or degradation, reactions for all species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 18:17:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2011 23:18:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2011 12:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Feliu", "Elisenda", ""], ["Wiuf", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5159", "submitter": "Michael Knudsen", "authors": "Michael Knudsen, Elisenda Feliu, Carsten Wiuf", "title": "Exact Analysis of Intrinsic Qualitative Features of Phosphorelays using\n  Mathematical Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Phosphorelays are a class of signaling mechanisms used by cells to respond to\nchanges in their environment. Phosphorelays (of which two-component systems\nconstitute a special case) are particularly abundant in prokaryotes and have\nbeen shown to be involved in many fundamental processes such as stress\nresponse, osmotic regulation, virulence, and chemotaxis. We develop a general\nmodel of phosphorelays extending existing models of phosphorelays and\ntwo-component systems. We analyze the model analytically under the assumption\nof mass-action kinetics and prove that a phosphorelay has a unique stable\nsteady-state. Furthermore, we derive explicit functions relating stimulus to\nthe response in any layer of a phosphorelay and show that a limited degree of\nultrasensitivity (the ability to respond to changes in stimulus in a\nswitch-like manner) in the bottom layer of a phosphorelay is an intrinsic\nfeature which does not depend on any reaction rates or substrate amounts. On\nthe other hand, we show how adjusting reaction rates and substrate amounts may\nlead to higher degrees of ultrasensitivity in intermediate layers. The explicit\nformulas also enable us to prove how the response changes with alterations in\nstimulus, kinetic parameters, and substrate amounts. Aside from providing\nbiological insight, the formulas may also be used to avoid time-consuming\nsimulations in numerical analyses and simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2011 19:08:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Knudsen", "Michael", ""], ["Feliu", "Elisenda", ""], ["Wiuf", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5163", "submitter": "Peter Csermely", "authors": "Ruth Nussinov, Chung-Jung Tsai and Peter Csermely", "title": "Allo-network drugs: harnessing allostery in cellular networks", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures, 69 references, a cover story of the 2011\n  December issue of Trends in Pharmacological Sciences", "journal-ref": "Trends in Pharmacological Sciences (2011) 32, 686-693", "doi": "10.1016/j.tips.2011.08.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Allosteric drugs are increasingly used because they produce fewer side\neffects.

The\nmathematical model is based on five basic processes: (1) The formation of\nachiral glycine clusters in solution, (2) The nucleation of oriented glycine\ncrystals at the air/water interface in the presence of hydrophobic amino acids,\n(3) A kinetic orienting effect which inhibits crystal growth, (4) The\nenantioselective occlusion of the amino acids from solution, and (5) The growth\nof oriented host glycine crystals at the interface. We translate these\nprocesses into differential rate equations. We first study the model with the\norienting process (2) without (3) and then combine both allowing us to make\ndetailed comparisons of both orienting effects which actually act in unison in\nthe experiment. Numerical results indicate that the model can yield a high\npercentage orientation of the mixed crystals at the interface and the\nconsequent resolution of the initially racemic mixture of amino acids in\nsolution. The model thus leads to separation of enantiomeric territories, the\ngeneration and amplification of optical activity by enantioselective occlusion\nof chiral additives through chiral surfaces of glycine crystals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 15:27:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Blanco", "Celia", ""], ["Hochberg", "David", ""]]}]
