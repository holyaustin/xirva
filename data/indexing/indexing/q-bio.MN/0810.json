The method is\nillustrated with a numerical example of a hypothetical network arising form a\n\"mass transfer\"-type model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 02:20:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Oct 2008 13:26:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Craciun", "Gheorghe", ""], ["Pantea", "Casian", ""], ["Rempala", "Grzegorz A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1833", "submitter": "Jose Emilio Jimenez", "authors": "Stephen A.

These fluctuations can interfere with optimal function or\ncan be exploited to generate beneficial diversity between cells; gene\nexpression noise is therefore expected to be subject to evolutionary pressure.\nShifts between modes of high and low rates of transcription initiation at a\npromoter appear to contribute to this noise both in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.\nHowever, models invoked for eukaryotic promoter noise such as stable activation\nscaffolds or persistent nucleosome alterations seem unlikely to apply to\nprokaryotic promoters. We consider the relative importance of the steps\nrequired for transcription initiation. The 3-step transcription initiation\nmodel of McClure is extended into a mathematical model that can be used to\npredict consequences of additional promoter properties. We show in principle\nthat the transcriptional bursting observed at an E. coli promoter by Golding et\nal. (2005) can be explained by stimulation of initiation by the negative\nsupercoiling behind a transcribing RNA polymerase (RNAP) or by the formation of\nmoribund or dead-end RNAP-promoter complexes. Both mechanisms are tunable by\nthe alteration of promoter kinetics and therefore allow the optimization of\npromoter mediated noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Oct 2008 02:18:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Mitarai", "Namiko", ""], ["Dodd", "Ian B.", ""], ["Crooks", "Michael T.", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.2946", "submitter": "Aleksandra Walczak", "authors": "Aleksandra M.

Comparison and alignment of\nbiological networks will likely have a similar impact. Existing network\nalignments use information external to the networks, such as sequence, because\nno good algorithm for purely topological alignment has yet been devised. In\nthis paper, we present a novel algorithm based solely on network topology, that\ncan be used to align any two networks. We apply it to biological networks to\nproduce by far the most complete topological alignments of biological networks\nto date. We demonstrate that both species phylogeny and detailed biological\nfunction of individual proteins can be extracted from our alignments.\nTopology-based alignments have the potential to provide a completely new,\nindependent source of phylogenetic information.
