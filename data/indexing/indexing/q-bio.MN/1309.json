Elasticities for\nmany reversible rate laws can be computed from the reaction Gibbs free\nenergies, which are determined by the state, and from physically unconstrained\nsaturation values. Starting from a network structure with allosteric regulation\nand consistent metabolic fluxes and concentrations, one can sample the\nelasticities, compute the control coefficients, and reconstruct a kinetic model\nwith consistent reversible rate laws. Some of the model variables are manually\nchosen, fitted to data, or optimised, while the others are computed from them.\nThe resulting model ensemble allows for probabilistic predictions, for\ninstance, about possible dynamic behaviour. By adding more data or tighter\nconstraints, the predictions can be made more precise. Model variants differing\nin network structure, flux distributions, thermodynamic forces, regulation, or\nrate laws can be realised by different model ensembles and compared by\nsignificance tests. The thermodynamic forces have specific effects on flux\ncontrol, on the synergisms between enzymes, and on the emergence and\npropagation of metabolite fluctuations. Large kinetic models could help to\nsimulate global metabolic dynamics and to predict the effects of enzyme\ninhibition, differential expression, genetic modifications, and their\ncombinations on metabolic fluxes.

The main virtues of this approach\nare the following: (i) it provides a natural way to obtain arbitrarily large\nnetworks by coupling together simple basic pieces, thus revealing the\nmodularity of regulatory networks; (ii) the assumptions about the stochastic\nprocesses used in the modeling are fairly general, in the sense that the only\nrequirement is stationarity; (iii) there is a well developed mathematical\ntheory, which is a blend of smooth dynamical systems theory, ergodic theory and\nstochastic analysis that allows one to extract relevant dynamical and\nstatistical information without solving the system; (iv) one may obtain the\nclassical rate equations form the corresponding stochastic version by averaging\nthe dynamic random variables (small noise limit). It is important to emphasize\nthat unlike the deterministic case, where coupling two equations is a trivial\nmatter, coupling two RDS is non-trivial, specially in our case, where the\ncoupling is performed between a state variable of one gene and the switching\nstochastic process of another gene and, hence, it is not a priori true that the\nresulting coupled system will satisfy the definition of a random dynamical\nsystem. We shall provide the necessary arguments that ensure that our coupling\nprescription does indeed furnish a coupled regulatory network of random\ndynamical systems.

However, the initial\nconditions for these early stages are determined by the female during\noogenesis, and it is unknown whether reproducibility is passed on to the zygote\nor whether it is reacquired by the zygote. Here we examine the earliest\nreproducible pattern in the Drosophila embryo, the Bicoid protein gradient.\nUsing a unique combination of absolute molecule counting techniques, we show\nthat it is generated from a highly controlled source of mRNA molecules that is\nreproducible from embryo to embryo to within ~8%. This occurs in a perfectly\nlinear feed-forward process: changes in the female's gene dosage lead to\nproportional changes in the mRNA and protein counts in the embryo. In this\nsetup, noise is kept low in the transition from one molecular species to\nanother, allowing the female to precisely deposit the same absolute number of\nmRNA molecules in each embryo and therefore confer reproducibility to the\nBicoid pattern. Our results indicate that the reproducibility of the\nmorphological structures that emerge in the embryo originates during oogenesis\nwhen all initial patterning signals are controlled with precision similar to\nwhat we observe for the Bicoid pattern.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2013 18:03:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Petkova", "Mariela D.", ""], ["Liu", "Feng", ""], ["Gregor", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6914", "submitter": "Marius Buliga", "authors": "Marius Buliga", "title": "Chemical concrete machine", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.FL math.LO q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The chemical concrete machine is a graph rewriting system which uses only\nlocal moves (rewrites), seen as chemical reactions involving molecules which\nare graphs made up by 4 trivalent nodes.

The main organizational unit is the nucleosome,\nwhich consists of a histone octamer with DNA wrapped around it. Histone\nproteins are implicated in the regulation of eukaryote genes and they carry\nnumerous reversible post-translational modifications that control DNA-protein\ninteractions and the recruitment of chromatin binding proteins.\nHeterochromatin, the transcriptionally inactive part of the genome, is densely\npacked and contains histone H3 that is methylated at Lys 9 (H3K9me). The\npropagation of H3K9me in nucleosomes along the DNA in chromatin is antagonizing\nby methylation of H3 Lysine 4 (H3K4me) and acetylations of several lysines,\nwhich is related to euchromatin and active genes. We show that the related\nhistone modifications form antagonized domains on a coarse scale. These histone\nmarks are assumed to be initiated within distinct nucleation sites in the DNA\nand to propagate bi-directionally. We propose a simple computer model that\nsimulates the distribution of heterochromatin in human chromosomes. The\nsimulations are in agreement with previously reported experimental observations\nfrom two different human cell lines. We reproduced different types of barriers\nbetween heterochromatin and euchromatin providing a unified model for their\nfunction. The effect of changes in the nucleation site distribution and of\npropagation rates were studied. The former occurs mainly with the aim of\n(de-)activation of single genes or gene groups and the latter has the power of\ncontrolling the transcriptional programs of entire chromosomes.
