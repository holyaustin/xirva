Previous studies reported\ntwo negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of follicle-stimulating hormone\nreceptor (FSHR), ADX68692 and ADX68693, with differential effects on\nFSHR-mediated steroidogenesis and ovulation. In this study, we attempted to\npharmacologically profile these NAMs on the closely related\nluteinizing/chorionic gonadotropin hormone receptor (LH/CGR) with regards to\nits canonical Gs/cAMP pathway as well as \\beta-arrestin recruitment in HEK293\ncells. The NAMs effects on progesterone and testosterone production were also\nassessed in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1). We found that both NAMs\nstrongly antagonized LH/CGR signaling in both HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells. ADX68693\nappeared more potent than ADX68692 to inhibit hCG-induced cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestin 2 in HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells whereas no significant difference\nin their efficacy on hCG-promoted \\beta-arrestin 2 recruitment. Interestingly,\ndifferential antagonism of the two NAMs on hCG-promoted steroidogenesis in\nmLTC-1 cells was observed with significant inhibition of testosterone but not\nprogesterone production. These observations suggest biased effects of the two\nNAMs on LH/CGR-dependent pathways controlling steroidogenesis, which appeared\nto be different to that previously shown on FSHR. This also illustrates the\ncomplexity of signaling pathways controlling FSHR- and LH/CGR-mediated\nsteroidogenesis, suggesting differential implication of cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestins. Together, our data demonstrate that ADX68692 and ADX68693 are\nNAMs at the LH/CGR in addition to FSHR.

Although recent advances\nin single-cell experimental techniques enable the direct monitoring of the\ntime-traces of the biological noise in each cell, the development of the\ntheoretical tools needed to extract the information encoded in the stochastic\ndynamics of intracellular chemical fluctuation is still in its adolescence.\nHere, we present a simple and general equation that relates the power-spectrum\nof the product number fluctuation to the product lifetime and the reaction\ndynamics of the product creation process. By analyzing the time traces of the\nprotein copy number using this theory, we can extract the power spectrum of the\nmRNA number, which cannot be directly measured by currently available\nexperimental techniques. From the power spectrum of the mRNA number, we can\nfurther extract quantitative information about the transcriptional regulation\ndynamics. Our power spectrum analysis of gene expression noise is demonstrated\nfor the gene network model of luciferase expression under the control of the\nBmal 1a promoter in mouse fibroblast cells.

L-LTP is blocked by inhibiting\neither protein synthesis or proteasome-dependent degradation prior to and\nduring a tetanic stimulus, but paradoxically, L-LTP is not blocked when\nsynthesis and degradation are inhibited simultaneously, suggesting\ncounter-acting positive and negative proteins regulate L-LTP. To investigate\nthis paradox, we modeled LTP at the Schaffer collateral synapse. Nine\ndifferential equations describe the levels of positive and negative regulator\nproteins (PP and NP) and transitions among five discrete synaptic states, a\nbasal state (BAS), three E-LTP states (EP1, EP2, ED), and a L-LTP state (LP). A\nstimulus initiates the transition from BAS to EP1 and from EP1 to EP2,\ninitiates the synthesis of PP and NP, and activates the ubiquitin-proteasome\nsystem (UPS). UPS mediates transitions of EP1 and EP2 to ED and the degradation\nof NP. The conversion of E-LTP to L-LTP is mediated by a PP-dependent\ntransition from ED to LP. NP mediates reversal of EP2 to BAS. This model\nsimulates empirical observations: 1) normal L-LTP, 2) block by either\nproteasome inhibitor or protein synthesis inhibitor alone, and 3) preservation\nof L-LTP when both inhibitors are applied together. Elements of this abstract\nmodel can be correlated with specific molecules and processes. Moreover, the\nmodel makes testable predictions, such as a unique synaptic state ED that\nprecedes the transition to L-LTP, and a time window for the action of the UPS\n(during the transitions from EP1 and EP2 to ED). Tests of these predictions\nwill provide insights into the processes of long-term synaptic plasticity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2018 17:39:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Smolen", "Paul", ""], ["Baxter", "Douglas A.", ""], ["Byrne", "John H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.07539", "submitter": "Michael Baker Ph.D.", "authors": "Yoshinao Katsu, Satomi Kohno, Kaori Oka, Xiaozhi Lin, Sumika Otake,\n  Nisha E.
