Algorithms for learning the structure and\nthe parameters of a dynamical system are distinguished based on whether time is\ndiscrete or continuous, observations are time-series or time-course, and\nwhether the system is deterministic or stochastic, however, there is no\napproach able to handle the various types of dynamical systems simultaneously.\nIn this paper, we present a unified approach to infer both the structure and\nthe parameters of nonlinear dynamical systems of any type under the restriction\nof being linear with respect to the unknown parameters. Our approach, which is\nnamed Unified Sparse Dynamics Learning (USDL), constitutes of two steps. First,\nan atemporal system of equations is derived through the application of the weak\nformulation. Then, assuming a sparse representation for the dynamical system,\nwe show that the inference problem can be expressed as a sparse signal recovery\nproblem, allowing the application of an extensive body of algorithms and\ntheoretical results. Results on simulated data demonstrate the efficacy and\nsuperiority of the USDL algorithm as a function of the experimental setup\n(sample size, number of time measurements, number of interventions, noise\nlevel). Additionally, USDL's accuracy significantly correlates with theoretical\nmetrics such as the exact recovery coefficient. On real single-cell data, the\nproposed approach is able to induce high-confidence subgraphs of the signaling\npathway.

The netgwas package deals with\nspecies with any chromosome copy number in a unified way, unlike other\nsoftware.

The fateful decision to exit or remain in the\npluripotent state is regulated by complex genetic regulatory network. Latest\nadvances in transcriptomics have made it possible to infer basic topologies of\npluripotency governing networks. The inferred network topologies, however, only\nencode boolean information while remaining silent about the roles of dynamics\nand molecular noise in gene expression. These features are widely considered\nessential for functional decision making. Herein we developed a framework for\nextending the boolean level networks into models accounting for individual\ngenetic switches and promoter architecture which allows mechanistic\ninterrogation of the roles of molecular noise, external signaling, and network\ntopology. We demonstrate the pluripotent state of the network to be a broad\nattractor which is robust to variations of gene expression. Dynamics of exiting\nthe pluripotent state, on the other hand, is significantly influenced by the\nmolecular noise originating from genetic switching events which makes cells\nmore responsive to extracellular signals. Lastly we show that steady state\nprobability landscape can be significantly remodeled by global gene switching\nrates alone which can be taken as a proxy for how global epigenetic\nmodifications exert control over stability of pluripotent states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Oct 2017 22:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yen Ting", ""], ["Hufton", "Peter G.", ""], ["Lee", "Esther J.", ""], ["Potoyan", "Davit A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.09252", "submitter": "Valeriy Grytsay Dr", "authors": "V.I.

One source of long-lived promoter states is the slow\nbinding and unbinding kinetics of transcription factors to promoters, i.e. the\nnon-adiabatic binding regime. Here, we introduce a simple analytical framework,\nknown as a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP), that accurately\ndescribes the stochastic dynamics of gene expression in the non-adiabatic\nregime. We illustrate the utility of the PDMP on a non-trivial dynamical system\nby analyzing the properties of a titration-based oscillator in the\nnon-adiabatic limit. We first show how to transform the underlying Chemical\nMaster Equation into a PDMP where the slow transitions between promoter states\nare stochastic, but whose rates depend upon the faster deterministic dynamics\nof the transcription factors regulated by these promoters. We show that the\nPDMP accurately describes the observed periods of stochastic cycles in\nactivator and repressor-based titration oscillators. We then generalize our\nPDMP analysis to more complicated versions of titration-based oscillators to\nexplain how multiple binding sites lengthen the period and improve coherence.\nLast, we show how noise-induced oscillation previously observed in a\ntitration-based oscillator arises from non-adiabatic and discrete binding\nevents at the promoter site.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Oct 2017 20:38:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yen Ting", ""], ["Buchler", "Nicolas E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.09879", "submitter": "Elias Kouskoumvekakis", "authors": "Elias S.

A number of studies in the field have\nbeen focused on finding the common properties among different kinds of networks\nsuch as heavy-tail degree distribution, small-worldness and modular structure\nand they have tried to establish a theory of structural universality in complex\nnetworks. However, there is no comprehensive study of network structure across\na diverse set of domains in order to explain the structural diversity we\nobserve in the real-world networks. In this paper, we study 986 real-world\nnetworks of diverse domains ranging from ecological food webs to online social\nnetworks along with 575 networks generated from four popular network models.\nOur study utilizes a number of machine learning techniques such as random\nforest and confusion matrix in order to show the relationships among network\ndomains in terms of network structure. Our results indicate that there are some\npartitions of network categories in which networks are hard to distinguish\nbased purely on network structure. We have found that these partitions of\nnetwork categories tend to have similar underlying functions, constraints\nand/or generative mechanisms of networks even though networks in the same\npartition have different origins, e.g., biological processes, results of\nengineering by human being, etc. This suggests that the origin of a network,\nwhether it's biological, technological or social, may not necessarily be a\ndecisive factor of the formation of similar network structure. Our findings\nshed light on the possible direction along which we could uncover the hidden\nprinciples for the structural diversity of complex networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 02:35:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ikehara", "Kansuke", ""], ["Clauset", "Aaron", ""]]}]
