These are usually depicted as a network, where nodes\nrepresent proteins and edges indicate their influence on each other. In order\nto understand diseases and therapies at the cellular level, it is crucial to\nhave an accurate understanding of the signaling pathways at work. Since\nsignaling pathways can be modified by disease, the ability to infer signaling\npathways from condition- or patient-specific data is highly valuable. A variety\nof techniques exist for inferring signaling pathways. We build on past works\nthat formulate signaling pathway inference as a Dynamic Bayesian Network\nstructure estimation problem on phosphoproteomic time course data. We take a\nBayesian approach, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate a posterior\ndistribution over possible Dynamic Bayesian Network structures. Our primary\ncontributions are (i) a novel proposal distribution that efficiently samples\nsparse graphs and (ii) the relaxation of common restrictive modeling\nassumptions. We implement our method, named Sparse Signaling Pathway Sampling,\nin Julia using the Gen probabilistic programming language. Probabilistic\nprogramming is a powerful methodology for building statistical models. The\nresulting code is modular, extensible, and legible. The Gen language, in\nparticular, allows us to customize our inference procedure for biological\ngraphs and ensure efficient sampling.
