We illustrate the novel algorithm using a simple patchy\nparticle model. After validation of the algorithm we discuss its performance.\nThe rotational BD-GFRD multiscale method will open up the possibility for large\nscale simulations of e.g. protein signalling networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 16:55:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Vijaykumar", "Adithya", ""], ["Ouldridge", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Bolhuis", "Peter G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.09849", "submitter": "Barbara Bravi", "authors": "Barbara Bravi and Peter Sollich", "title": "Statistical physics approaches to subnetwork dynamics in biochemical\n  systems", "comments": "39 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1478-3975/aa7363", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.chem-ph cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We apply a Gaussian variational approximation to model reduction in large\nbiochemical networks of unary and binary reactions. We focus on a small subset\nof variables (subnetwork) of interest, e.g. because they are accessible\nexperimentally, embedded in a larger network (bulk). The key goal is to write\ndynamical equations reduced to the subnetwork but still retaining the effects\nof the bulk. As a result, the subnetwork-reduced dynamics contains a memory\nterm and an extrinsic noise term with non-trivial temporal correlations. We\nfirst derive expressions for this memory and noise in the linearized (Gaussian)\ndynamics and then use a perturbative power expansion to obtain first order\nnonlinear corrections. For the case of vanishing intrinsic noise, our\ndescription is explicitly shown to be equivalent to projection methods up to\nquadratic terms, but it is applicable also in the presence of stochastic\nfluctuations in the original dynamics.
