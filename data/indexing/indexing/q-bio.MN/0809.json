We use a quantitative approach to\ncompare and contrast sRNAs with conventional transcription factors (TFs) to\nbetter understand the advantages of each form of regulation. In particular, we\ncalculate the steady-state behavior, noise properties, frequency-dependent gain\n(amplification), and dynamical response to large input signals of both forms of\nregulation. While the mean steady-state behavior of sRNA-regulated proteins\nexhibits a distinctive tunable threshold-linear behavior, our analysis shows\nthat transcriptional bursting leads to significantly higher intrinsic noise in\nsRNA-based regulation than in TF-based regulation in a large range of\nexpression levels and limits the ability of sRNAs to perform quantitative\nsignaling. Nonetheless, we find that sRNAs are better than TFs at filtering\nnoise in input signals. Additionally, we find that sRNAs allow cells to respond\nrapidly to large changes in input signals. These features suggest a niche for\nsRNAs in allowing cells to transition quickly yet reliably between distinct\nstates. This functional niche is consistent with the widespread appearance of\nsRNAs in stress-response and quasi-developmental networks in prokaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2008 22:14:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mehta", "Pankaj", ""], ["Goyal", "Sidhartha", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.0559", "submitter": "Yuriy Shckorbatov G", "authors": "Y.G.

Although the\nintrinsic stochasticity inherent in biochemistry is relatively well understood,\ncellular variation, or 'noise', is predominantly generated by interactions of\nthe system of interest with other stochastic systems in the cell or its\nenvironment. Such extrinsic fluctuations are nonspecific, affecting many system\ncomponents, and have a substantial lifetime, comparable to the cell cycle (they\nare 'colored'). Here, we extend the standard stochastic simulation algorithm to\ninclude extrinsic fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations affect mean\nprotein numbers and intrinsic noise, can speed up typical network response\ntimes, and can explain trends in high-throughput measurements of variation. If\nextrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they\nmay combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively\n(attenuating each other). Consequently, we predict that incoherent feedforward\nloops attenuate stochasticity, while coherent feedforwards amplify it. Our\nresults demonstrate that both the timescales of extrinsic fluctuations and\ntheir nonspecificity substantially affect the function and performance of\nbiochemical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Sep 2008 18:06:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shahrezaei", "Vahid", ""], ["Ollivier", "Julien F", ""], ["Swain", "Peter S", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.3715", "submitter": "Ibrahim Inanc", "authors": "Canan Atilgan, Ibrahim Inanc, and Ali Rana Atilgan", "title": "Residue Network Construction and Predictions of Elastic Network Models", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The past decade has witnessed the development and success of coarse-grained\nnetwork models of proteins for predicting many equilibrium properties related\nto collective modes of motion.

We present a systematical study\nof network construction strategies, and their effect on the predicted\nproperties. The analysis is based on the radial distribution function and the\nspectral dimensions of a large set of proteins as well as a newly defined\nquantity, the angular distribution function. By partitioning the interactions\ninto an essential and a residual set, we show that the robustness originates\nfrom a large number of long-distance interactions belonging to the latter.\nThese residuals have a vanishingly small effect on the force vectors on each\nresidue. The overall force balance then translates into the Hessian as small\nshifts in the slow modes of motion and an invariance of the corresponding\neigenvectors.
