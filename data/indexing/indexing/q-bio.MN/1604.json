The necessary enzyme amount\nper unit flux is a major determinant of metabolic strategies both in evolution\nand bioengineering. It depends on enzyme parameters (such as kcat and KM\nconstants), but also on metabolite concentrations. Moreover, similar amounts of\ndifferent enzymes might incur different costs for the cell, depending on\nenzyme-specific properties such as protein size and half-life. Here, we\ndeveloped enzyme cost minimization (ECM), a scalable method for computing\nenzyme amounts that support a given metabolic flux at a minimal protein cost.\nThe complex interplay of enzyme and metabolite concentrations, e.g. through\nthermodynamic driving forces and enzyme saturation, would make it hard to solve\nthis optimization problem directly. By treating enzyme cost as a function of\nmetabolite levels, we formulated ECM as a numerically tractable, convex\noptimization problem. Its tiered approach allows for building models at\ndifferent levels of detail, depending on the amount of available data.\nValidating our method with measured metabolite and protein levels in E. coli\ncentral metabolism, we found typical prediction fold errors of 3.8 and 2.7,\nrespectively, for the two kinds of data. ECM can be used to predict enzyme\nlevels and protein cost in natural and engineered pathways, establishes a\ndirect connection between protein cost and thermodynamics, and provides a\nphysically plausible and computationally tractable way to include enzyme\nkinetics into constraint-based metabolic models, where kinetics have usually\nbeen ignored or oversimplified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 08:48:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Noor", "Elad", ""], ["Flamholz", "Avi", ""], ["Bar-Even", "Arren", ""], ["Davidi", "Dan", ""], ["Milo", "Ron", ""], ["Liebermeister", "Wolfram", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00828", "submitter": "Georg Meisl", "authors": "Georg Meisl, Xiaoting Yang, Christopher M.

The CRNs using the former output convention\nhave only \"yes\" voters, with the interpretation that the CRN's output is yes if\nany voters are present and no otherwise. The CRNs using the latter output\nconvention define output by majority vote among \"yes\" and \"no\" voters.\n  Both results are proven via a generalized framework that simultaneously\ncaptures several definitions, directly inspired by a Petri net result of\nEsparza, Ganty, Leroux, and Majumder [CONCUR 2015]. These results support the\nthesis that the computational expressivity of error-free CRNs is intrinsic, not\nsensitive to arbitrary definitional choices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 08:28:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 12:11:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Brijder", "Robert", ""], ["Doty", "David", ""], ["Soloveichik", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.04643", "submitter": "Dorjsuren Battogtokh", "authors": "Dorjsuren Battogtokh and John J.

As there is no evidence for\nthis assumption of differential diffusivity, we recently proposed a new\nmechanism based on a bistable switch model of the SAM. Here we study the\nbistable-switch mechanism in detail, demonstrating that it can be understood as\nlocalized switches of WUSHEL activity in individual cells driven by a\nnon-uniform field of a peptide hormone. By comparing domain formation by Turing\nand bistable-switch mechanisms on a cell network, we show that the latter does\nnot require the assumptions needed by the former, which are not supported by\nbiological evidences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 21:09:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 03:15:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Dec 2017 19:00:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Battogtokh", "Dorjsuren", ""], ["Tyson", "John J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05378", "submitter": "Narmada Herath", "authors": "Narmada Herath and Domitilla Del Vecchio", "title": "Model order reduction for Linear Noise Approximation using time-scale\n  separation (Extended Version)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we focus on model reduction of biomolecular systems with\nmultiple time-scales, modeled using the Linear Noise Approximation.
