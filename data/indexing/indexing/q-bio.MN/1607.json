These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown\nparameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation\ntime relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed\ndata.

It hence represents a fundamental challenge for\nthe whole of systems biology.\n  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of\ncomplex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional\nglobal parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems\nbiology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an\niterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces\nwithin a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of\nuncertainty.
