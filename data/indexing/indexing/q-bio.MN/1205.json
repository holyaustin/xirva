Recently, a mathematical model has been\nproposed to describe the dynamics of post-transcriptional regulation by\nmicroRNAs. The model explains the observations made in single cell experiments\nquite well. In this paper, we introduce some additional features into the model\nand consider two specific cases. In the first case, a non-cooperative positive\nfeedback loop is included in the transcriptional regulation of the target gene\nexpression. In the second case, a stochastic version of the original model is\nconsidered in which there are random transitions between the inactive and\nactive expression states of the gene. In the first case we show that\nbistability is possible in a parameter regime, due to the presence of a\nnon-linear protein decay term in the gene expression dynamics. In the second\ncase, we derive the conditions for obtaining stochastic binary gene expression.\nWe find that this type of gene expression is more favourable in the case of\nregulation by microRNAs as compared to the case of unregulated gene expression.\nThe theoretical predictions relating to binary gene expression are\nexperimentally testable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2012 11:08:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2012 09:32:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2012 10:09:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bose", "Indrani", ""], ["Ghosh", "Sayantari", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0382", "submitter": "Tatsuaki Tsuruyama", "authors": "Tatsuaki Tsuruyama", "title": "The channel capacity and information density of biochemical signaling\n  cascades", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Living cell signaling systems include multistep biochemical signaling\nreaction cascades (BSCs) comprising modifications of molecular signaling\nproteins.
