This research seeks to fill this gap by\nexploring local search on a network representation of proteins and to probe the\nsource of navigability in proteins. Previously, we confirmed that proteins are\nnavigable small-world networks and observed that local search paths exhibit\ndifferent characteristics from global search paths. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the biological relevance of the differences in path characteristics\non a type III receptor tyrosine kinase (KIT). A chief difference that works in\nfavour of local search paths as intra-protein communication pathways is their\nweaker proclivity, compared to global search paths, for traversing long-range\nedges. Long-range edges tend to be less stable and their inclusion tends to\ndecrease the communication propensity of a path. The source of protein\nnavigability is traced to clustering provided by short-range edges. The\nmajority of a protein's short-range edges reside within structures deemed\nimportant for long-range energy transport and modulation of allosteric\ncommunication in proteins. Therefore, the disruption of intra-protein\ncommunication as a result of the destruction of these structures via random\nrewiring is expected. A local search perspective leads us to this expected\nconclusion while a global search perspective does not.

Results: This paper\npresents a method for the identification of potential intervention targets in\nBoolean molecular network models using algebraic techniques. The approach\nexploits an algebraic representation of Boolean networks to encode the control\ncandidates in the network wiring diagram as the solutions of a system of\npolynomials equations, and then uses computational algebra techniques to find\nsuch controllers. The control methods in this paper are validated through the\nidentification of combinatorial interventions in the signaling pathways of\npreviously reported control targets in two well studied systems, a p53-mdm2\nnetwork and a blood T cell lymphocyte granular leukemia survival signaling\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 15:46:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 21:38:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 17:49:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 17:54:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Murrugarra", "David", ""], ["Veliz-Cuba", "Alan", ""], ["Aguilar", "Boris", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05717", "submitter": "Ovidiu Radulescu", "authors": "Satya Swarup Samal, Dima Grigoriev, Holger Fr\\\"ohlich and Ovidiu\n  Radulescu", "title": "Analysis of Reaction Network Systems Using Tropical Geometry", "comments": "Proceedings Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing CASC 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss a novel analysis method for reaction network systems with\npolynomial or rational rate functions. This method is based on computing\ntropical equilibrations defined by the equality of at least two dominant\nmonomials of opposite signs in the differential equations of each dynamic\nvariable. In algebraic geometry, the tropical equilibration problem is\ntantamount to finding tropical prevarieties, that are finite intersections of\ntropical hypersurfaces. Tropical equilibrations with the same set of dominant\nmonomials define a branch or equivalence class. Minimal branches are\nparticularly interesting as they describe the simplest states of the reaction\nnetwork. We provide a method to compute the number of minimal branches and to\nfind representative tropical equilibrations for each branch.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 08:24:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Samal", "Satya Swarup", ""], ["Grigoriev", "Dima", ""], ["Fr\u00f6hlich", "Holger", ""], ["Radulescu", "Ovidiu", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06966", "submitter": "Andrew Mugler", "authors": "Garrett D Potter, Tommy A Byrd, Andrew Mugler, Bo Sun", "title": "Communication shapes sensory response in multicellular networks", "comments": "23 pages, 18 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1605559113", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.CB q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collective sensing by interacting cells is observed in a variety of\nbiological systems, and yet a quantitative understanding of how sensory\ninformation is collectively encoded is lacking. Here we investigate the\nATP-induced calcium dynamics of monolayers of fibroblast cells that communicate\nvia gap junctions. Combining experiments and stochastic modeling, we find that\nincreasing the ATP stimulus increases the propensity for calcium oscillations\ndespite large cell-to-cell variability. The model further predicts that the\noscillation propensity increases not only with the stimulus, but also with the\ncell density due to increased communication. Experiments confirm this\nprediction, showing that cell density modulates the collective sensory\nresponse. We further implicate cell-cell communication by coculturing the\nfibroblasts with cancer cells, which we show act as \"defects\" in the\ncommunication network, thereby reducing the oscillation propensity. These\nresults suggest that multicellular networks sit at a point in parameter space\nwhere cell-cell communication has a significant effect on the sensory response,\nallowing cells to simultaneously respond to a sensory input and to the presence\nof neighbors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 18:47:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 18:23:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Potter", "Garrett D", ""], ["Byrd", "Tommy A", ""], ["Mugler", "Andrew", ""], ["Sun", "Bo", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07571", "submitter": "Andrew Mugler", "authors": "Andrew Mugler, Mark Kittisopikul, Luke Hayden, Jintao Liu, Chris H.\n  Wiggins, Gurol M.
