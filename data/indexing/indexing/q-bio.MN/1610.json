Using state-of-the-art\nmethodologies, we prove that power-law behaviors truly govern the connectivity\nand clustering coefficient distributions. We found a non-previously reported\ncircuit motif that we named complex feed-forward motif. We highlighted the\nimportance of feedback loops for the functional architecture, beyond whether\nthey are statistically over-represented or not in the network. We show that the\npreviously reported top-down approach is inadequate to infer the hierarchy\ngoverning a regulatory network because feedback bridges different hierarchical\nlayers, and the top-down approach disregards the presence of intermodular genes\nshaping the integration layer. Our findings all together further support a\ndiamond-shaped, three-layered hierarchy exhibiting some feedback between\nprocessing and coordination layers, which is shaped by four classes of\nsystems-level elements: global regulators, locally autonomous modules, basal\nmachinery and intermodular genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 21:19:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Freyre-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Julio A.", ""], ["Tauch", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.08631", "submitter": "Ayumi Kikkawa Dr.", "authors": "Ayumi Kikkawa", "title": "Random matrix analysis for gene interaction networks in cancer cells", "comments": "22 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "SCIENTIFIC REPORTS (2018) 8:10607", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-018-28954-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Investigations of topological uniqueness of gene interaction networks in\ncancer cells are essential for understanding this disease.

Despite calls to use\ninnovative approaches to address common diseases, an increasing majority of\nresearch funding goes toward \"safe\" incremental research. Counteracting this\ntrend by nurturing novel and potentially transformative scientific research is\nchallenging, it must be supported in competition with established research\nprograms. Therefore, we propose a tool that helps to resolve the tension\nbetween safe but fundable research vs. high-risk but potentially\ntransformational research. It does this by identifying hidden overlapping\ninterest around novel molecular research topics. Specifically, it identifies\npaths of molecular interactions that connect research topics and hypotheses\nthat would not typically be associated, as the basis for scientific\ncollaboration. Because these collaborations are related to the scientists'\npresent trajectory, they are low risk and can be initiated rapidly. Unlike most\nincremental steps, these collaborations have the potential for leaps in\nunderstanding, as they reposition research for novel disease applications. We\ndemonstrate the use of this tool to identify scientists who could contribute to\nunderstanding the cellular role of genes with novel associations with\nAlzheimer's disease, which have not been thoroughly characterized, in part due\nto the funding emphasis on established research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 15:03:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kuzmin", "Konstantin", ""], ["Lu", "Xiaoyan", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Partha Sarathi", ""], ["Zhuang", "Juntao", ""], ["Gaiteri", "Chris", ""], ["Szymanski", "Boleslaw K", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.09637", "submitter": "Fangting Li", "authors": "Teng Wang (1), Jian Zhao (2), Qi Ouyang (1) Hong Qian (3), Yu V.

In the fission yeast\ncell cycle, the transition from G2 phase to M phase is triggered by the\nactivation of Cdc13/Cdc2 and Cdc25, and the deactivation of Wee1. Each of these\nthree events involves a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (PdP) cycle, and\ntogether they form a regulatory circuit with feedback loops. Almost all\nquantitative models for cellular networks in the past have invalid\nthermodynamics due to the assumption of irreversible enzyme kinetics. We\nconstructed a thermodynamically realistic kinetic model of the G2/M circuit,\nand show that the phosphorylation energy ($\\Delta G$), which is determined by\nthe cellular ATP/ADP ratio, critically controls the dynamics and the bistable\nnature of Cdc2 activation. Using fission yeast nucleoplasmic extract (YNPE), we\nare able to experimentally verify our model prediction that increased , being\nsynergistic to the accumulation of Cdc13, drives the activation of Cdc2.\nFurthermore, Cdc2 activation exhibits bistability and hysteresis in response to\nchanges in phosphorylation energy. These findings suggest that adequate\nmaintenance of phosphorylation energy ensures the bistability and robustness of\nthe activation of Cdc2 in the G2/M transition. Free energy might play a\nwidespread role in biological decision-making processes, connecting\nthermodynamics with information processing in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 11:39:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Teng", ""], ["Zhao", "Jian", ""], ["Ouyang", "Qi", ""], ["Qian", "Hong", ""], ["Fu", "Yu V.", ""], ["Li", "Fangting", ""]]}]
