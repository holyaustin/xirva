To get insights into these matters, we analyzed chemical\nreaction networks with different topologies and degrees of complexity,\ninteracting or not with the environment. We showed that the global level of\nfluctuations at the steady state, as measured by the sum of the Fano factors of\nthe number of molecules of all species, is directly related to the topology of\nthe network. For systems with zero deficiency, this sum is constant and equal\nto the rank of the network. For higher deficiencies, we observed an increase or\ndecrease of the fluctuation levels according to the values of the reaction\nfluxes that link internal species, multiplied by the associated stoichiometry.\nWe showed that the noise is reduced when the fluxes all flow towards the\nspecies of higher complexity, whereas it is amplified when the fluxes are\ndirected towards lower complexity species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 09:57:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Pucci", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Rooman", "Marianne", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.01464", "submitter": "Wayne Hayes", "authors": "Dillon P.

PNA produces aligned node pairs between two networks.\nMNA produces aligned node clusters between more than two networks. Recently,\nthe focus has shifted from PNA to MNA, because MNA captures conserved regions\nbetween more networks than PNA (and MNA is thus considered to be more\ninsightful), though at higher computational complexity. The issue is that, due\nto the different outputs of PNA and MNA, a PNA method is only compared to other\nPNA methods, and an MNA method is only compared to other MNA methods.\nComparison of PNA against MNA must be done to evaluate whether MNA's higher\ncomplexity is justified by its higher accuracy. We introduce a framework that\nallows for this. We evaluate eight prominent PNA and MNA methods, on synthetic\nand real-world biological networks, using topological and functional alignment\nquality measures. We compare PNA against MNA in both a pairwise (native to PNA)\nand multiple (native to MNA) manner. PNA is expected to perform better under\nthe pairwise evaluation framework.
