Here, we applied Network Environ Analysis to 50\nempirically-based trophic ecosystem models to test the hypothesis that indirect\nflows dominate direct flows in ecosystem networks. Further, we used Monte Carlo\nbased perturbations to investigate the robustness of these results to potential\nerror in the underlying data. To explain our findings, we further investigated\nthe importance of the microbial food web in recycling energy-matter using\ncomponents of the Finn Cycling Index and analysis of Environ Centrality. We\nfound that indirect flows dominate direct flows in 37/50 (74.0%) models. This\nincreases to 31/35 (88.5%) models when we consider only models that have\ncycling structure and a representation of the microbial food web. The\nuncertainty analysis reveals that there is less error in the I/D values than\nthe $\\pm$ 5% error introduced into the models, suggesting the results are\nrobust to uncertainty. Our results show that the microbial food web mediates a\nsubstantial percentage of cycling in some systems (median = 30.2%), but its\nrole is highly variable in these models, in agreement with the literature. Our\nresults, combined with previous work, strongly suggest that indirect effects\nare dominant components of activity in ecosystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 18:14:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Salas", "Andria K.", ""], ["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2287", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "Vladimir Privman, Jan Halamek, Mary A.
