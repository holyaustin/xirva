Numerous\ntechniques have been developed to estimate parameters like rate constants,\ninitial conditions or steady state concentrations from time-resolved data. In\ncontrast to this countable set of parameters, the estimation of entire courses\nof network components corresponds to an innumerable set of parameters. The\napproach presented in this work is able to deal with course estimation for\nextrinsic system inputs or intrinsic reactants, both not being constrained by\nthe reaction network itself. Our method is based on variational calculus which\nis carried out analytically to derive an augmented system of differential\nequations including the unconstrained components as ordinary state variables.\nFinally, conventional parameter estimation is applied to the augmented system\nresulting in a combined estimation of courses and parameters. The combined\nestimation approach takes the uncertainty in input courses correctly into\naccount. This leads to precise parameter estimates and correct confidence\nintervals. In particular this implies that small motifs of large reaction\nnetworks can be analysed independently of the rest.

The production of large\nmolecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good\ncatalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules.\nThus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry.\nHere we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a\npossible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing\nthe population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible\nchemistry.

ACSs can produce a bistability in the\npopulation dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules\ndominate the population.

It is frequently assumed that the\npredictions of the reduced master equations obtained using the stochastic\nquasi-steady-state approach are in very good agreement with the predictions of\nthe full master equations, provided the conditions for the validity of the\ndeterministic quasi-steady-state approximation are fulfilled. We here use the\nlinear-noise approximation to show that this assumption is not generally\njustified for the Michaelis-Menten reaction with substrate input, the simplest\nexample of an open embedded enzyme reaction. The reduced master equation\napproach is found to considerably overestimate the size of intrinsic noise at\nlow copy numbers of molecules. A simple formula is obtained for the relative\nerror between the predictions of the reduced and full master equations for the\nvariance of the substrate concentration fluctuations. The maximum error is\nreached when modeling moderately or highly efficient enzymes, in which case the\nerror is approximately 30%. The theoretical predictions are validated by\nstochastic simulations using experimental parameter values for enzymes involved\nin proteolysis, gluconeogenesis and fermentation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2011 15:40:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Thomas", "Philipp", ""], ["Straube", "Arthur V.", ""], ["Grima", "Ramon", ""]]}]
