Clustering\nof genes with similar expression profiles allows for a course-grained view of\nthe GRN and a probabilistic determination of the connectivity among the\nclusters. We present a model for the temporal evolution of a gene cluster\nnetwork which takes into account interactions of gene products with genes and,\nthrough a non-constant degradation rate, with other gene products. The number\nof model parameters is reduced by using polynomial functions to interpolate\ntemporal data points. In this manner, the task of parameter estimation is\nreduced to a system of linear algebraic equations, thus making the computation\ntime shorter by orders of magnitude. To eliminate irrelevant networks, we test\neach GRN for stability with respect to parameter variations, and impose\nrestrictions on its behavior near the steady state.

A single gene with negative transcriptional\nfeedback needs a time delay and sufficiently strong nonlinearity in the\ntransmission of the feedback signal in order to produce biochemical rhythms. A\nsingle gene with only positive transcriptional feedback does not produce\noscillations. Here, we demonstrate that this single-gene network in conjunction\nwith a simple negative interaction can also easily produce rhythms. We examine\na model comprised of two well-differentiated parts. The first is a positive\nfeedback created by a protein that binds to the promoter of its own gene and\nactivates the transcription. The second is a negative interaction in which a\nrepressor molecule prevents this protein from binding to its promoter. A\nstochastic study shows that the system is robust to noise. A deterministic\nstudy identifies that the dynamics of the oscillator are mainly driven by two\ntypes of biomolecules: the protein, and the complex formed by the repressor and\nthis protein. The main conclusion of this paper is that a simple and usual\nnegative interaction, such as degradation, sequestration or inhibition, acting\non the positive transcriptional feedback of a single gene is a sufficient\ncondition to produce reliable oscillations. One gene is enough and the positive\ntranscriptional feedback signal does not need to activate a second repressor\ngene. This means that at the genetic level an explicit negative feedback loop\nis not necessary. The model needs neither cooperative binding reactions nor the\nformation of protein multimers. Therefore, our findings could help to clarify\nthe design principles of cellular clocks and constitute a new efficient tool\nfor engineering synthetic genetic oscillators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Jun 2011 14:10:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2011 18:48:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Nov 2011 19:49:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 15:51:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mir\u00f3-Bueno", "Jes\u00fas M.", ""], ["Rodr\u00edguez-Pat\u00f3n", "Alfonso", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2562", "submitter": "Johannes K\\\"oster", "authors": "Johannes K\\\"oster, Eli Zamir, Sven Rahmann", "title": "Protein Hypernetworks: a Logic Framework for Interaction Dependencies\n  and Perturbation Effects in Protein Networks", "comments": "Preprint, submitted to Bioinformatics; 7 pages, 5 figures, 4 pages\n  supplement For further information, see\n  http://www.rahmannlab.de/research/hypernetworks", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: Protein interactions are fundamental building blocks of\nbiochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions.

Due to the inherent stochasticity\nof biochemical processes and the small number of molecules involved, the\nstochastic approach should be more correct in describing the real system: we\nstudy the agreement between the two approaches by exploring the system\nparameter space.
