The effects of white noise on the regime shift in bistable systems\nhave been well characterized, however little is known about such effects of\ncolored noise (noise with non-zero correlation time). Here, we show that noise\ncorrelation time, by considering a genetic circuit of autoactivation, can have\nsignificant effect on the regime shift in gene expression. We demonstrate this\ntheoretically, using stochastic potential, stationary probability density\nfunction and first-passage time based on the Fokker-Planck description, where\nthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used to model colored noise. We find that\nincrease in noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime\nshift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable\nregime, while increase in noise correlation time in basal rate retain the\nbimodal distribution. We then show how cross-correlated colored noises in basal\nand degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein\nconcentration state, but reduce the bistable regime. In addition, we show that\nearly warning indicators can also be used to predict shifts between distinct\nphenotypic states in gene expression. Predictions that a cell is about to shift\nto a harmful phenotype could improve early therapeutic intervention in complex\nhuman diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Dec 2016 11:42:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 17:12:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Yogita", ""], ["Dutta", "Partha Sharathi", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.01233", "submitter": "Fangting Li", "authors": "Teng Wang (1,3), Chenzi Jin (2,3), Fangting Li (2,3) ((1) School of\n  Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.

KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of\ntwo domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the\nCII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.\nWhile this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven\nthermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation.

We study in\nthree different models of this system how these two seemingly conflicting\ncriteria are met: the Van Zon model (Van Zon et al., PNAS, 2007), the Rust\nmodel (Phong et al., PNAS, 2013), and our new model (Paijmans et al.,\narXiv:1612.02715). We find that the new model exhibits the best trade-off\nbetween input compensation and entrainability: on the footing of equal\nphase-response curves, it exhibits the strongest input compensation. Performing\nstochastic simulations at the level of individual hexamers allows us to\nidentify a new mechanism, which is employed by the new model to achieve input\ncompensation: At lower ATP fraction, the individual hexamers make a shorter\ncycle in the phosphorylation state space, which compensates for the slower pace\nat which they traverse the cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Dec 2016 23:20:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 10:38:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Lubensky", "David K", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08763", "submitter": "Alicia Dickenstein", "authors": "Mercedes P\\'erez Mill\\'an, Alicia Dickenstein", "title": "The structure of MESSI biological systems", "comments": "Several small improvements", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN math.AG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a general framework for biological systems, called MESSI\nsystems, that describe Modifications of type Enzyme-Substrate or Swap with\nIntermediates, and we prove general results based on the network structure.\nMany post-translational modification networks are MESSI systems. For example:\nthe motifs in [Feliu and Wiuf (2012a)], sequential distributive and processive\nmultisite phosphorylation networks, most of the examples in [Angeli et al.\n(2007)], phosphorylation cascades, two component systems as in [Kothamachu et\nal. (2015)], the bacterial EnvZ/OmpR network in [Shinar and Feinberg (2010)],\nand all linear networks. We show that, under mass-action kinetics, MESSI\nsystems are conservative. We simplify the study of steady states of these\nsystems by explicit elimination of intermediate complexes and we give\nconditions to ensure an explicit rational parametrization of the variety of\nsteady states (inspired by [Feliu and Wiuf (2013a, 2013b), Thomson and\nGunawardena (2009)]). We define an important subclass of MESSI systems with\ntoric steady states [P\\'erez Mill\\'an et al. (2012)] and we give for MESSI\nsystems with toric steady states an easy algorithm to determine the capacity\nfor multistationarity. In this case, the algorithm provides rate constants for\nwhich multistationarity takes place, based on the theory of oriented matroids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Dec 2016 22:09:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 20:33:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2018 22:44:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mill\u00e1n", "Mercedes P\u00e9rez", ""], ["Dickenstein", "Alicia", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.08952", "submitter": "Gang Yang", "authors": "Gang Yang, Colin Campbell and R\\'eka Albert", "title": "Compensatory interactions to stabilize multiple steady states or\n  mitigate the effects of multiple deregulations in biological networks", "comments": "16 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Network-based dynamic models such as\nBoolean models have been employed to model a variety of biological systems\nincluding those corresponding to disease. Previous work designed compensatory\ninteractions to stabilize an attractor of a Boolean network after single node\ndamage. We generalize this method to a multinode damage scenario and to the\nsimultaneous stabilization of multiple steady state attractors. We classify the\nemergent situations, with a special focus on combinatorial effects, and\ncharacterize each class through simulation. We explore how the structural and\nfunctional properties of the network affect its resilience and its possible\nrepair scenarios. We demonstrate the method's applicability to two\nintracellular network models relevant to cancer.
