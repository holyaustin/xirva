Although scaffolds are widely believed\nto have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms\nthat underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal\ncharacteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of\nscaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing\nkinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate\nthat a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is\nto control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time.\nScaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases\nto become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at\nboth early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal\nsignal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which\nkinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism\nthat describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a\nscaffold mediated protein kinase cascade. Our results illustrate another\ncomplexity in the broad array of control properties that emerge from the\nphysical effects of spatially localizing components of kinase cascades on\nscaffold proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jul 2008 01:58:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Oct 2008 03:06:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Locasale", "Jason W.", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Arup K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3287", "submitter": "Johannes Wollbold", "authors": "Johannes Wollbold, Reinhard Guthke, Bernhard Ganter", "title": "Constructing a Knowledge Base for Gene Regulatory Dynamics by Formal\n  Concept Analysis Methods", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure, LaTeX style llncsdoc.sty", "journal-ref": "K.

We first analyse the promoter activity under strong\nrepression by a slow binding repressor, in which case transcriptions occur in a\nburst, followed by a long quiescent period while a repressor binds to the\noperator; the number of transcriptions, the bursting and the quiescent times\nare estimated by reaction rates. We then examine interference effect from an\nopposing promoter, using the correlation function of transcription initiations\nfor a single promoter. The interference is shown to de-repress the promoter\nbecause RNAP's from the opposing promoter most likely encounter the repressor\nand remove it in case of strong repression. This de-repression mechanism should\nbe especially prominent for the promoters that facilitate fast formation of\nopen complex with the repressor whose binding rate is slower than about 1/sec.\nFinally, we discuss possibility of this mechanism for high activity of promoter\nPR in the hyp-mutant of lambda phage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2008 10:55:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2008 02:29:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 10 Aug 2008 12:05:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Nakanishi", "Hiizu", ""], ["Mitarai", "Namiko", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}]
