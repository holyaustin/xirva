A\nreceptor is either active or inactive and can stochastically switch between the\ntwo states. Enzyme CheR methylates inactive receptors while CheB demethylates\nactive ones and the probability for it to be active depends on its level of\nmethylation and ligandation. A simple version of the model with two methylation\nsites per receptor (M=2) shows zero-order ultrasensitivity (ZOU) akin to the\nclassical 2-state model of covalent modification studied by Goldbeter and\nKoshland (GK). For extremely small and large ligand concentrations, the system\nreduces to two 2-state GK modules. A quantitative measure of the spontaneous\nfluctuations in activity (variance) estimated mathematically under linear noise\napproximation (LNA) is found to peak near the ZOU transition. The variance is a\nweak, non-monotonic and decreasing functions of ligand and receptor\nconcentrations. Gillespie simulations for M=2 show excellent agreement with\nanalytical results obtained under LNA. Numerical results for M=2, 3 and 4 show\nZOU in mean activity; the variance is found to be smaller for larger M. The\nmagnitude of receptor noise deduced from available experimental data is\nconsistent with our predictions. A simple analysis of the downstream signaling\npathway shows that this noise is large enough to have a beneficial effect on\nthe motility of the organism. The response of mean receptor activity to small\ntime-dependent changes in the external ligand concentration, computed within\nlinear response theory, is found to have a bilobe form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:50:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Ushasi", ""], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", ""]]}]
