The algorithm is conceptually related to the\ncommonly used idea of accelerating a stochastic simulation by considering a\nsub-volume $\\lambda \\Omega$ ($0<\\lambda<1$) within a system of interest, which\nreduces the number of reaction events per unit time occurring in a simulation\nby a factor $1/\\lambda$ at the cost of greater error in unbiased estimates of\nfirst moments and biased overestimates of second moments.

These\nhydrolase enzymes operate as biochemical switches by toggling between an active\nguanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and an inactive guanosine diphosphate\n(GDP)-bound state. We compare two network motifs, a single-species switch and\nan interlinked cascade that consists of two species coupled through positive\nand negative feedback loops. We find that interlinked cascades are closer to\nthe ideal all-or-none switch and are more robust against fluctuating signals.\nWhile the single-species switch can only achieve bistability, interlinked\ncascades can be converted into oscillators by tuning the cofactor\nconcentrations, which catalyse the activity of the cascade. These regimes can\nonly be achieved with sufficient chemical driving provided by GTP hydrolysis.\nIn this study, we present a thermodynamically consistent model that can achieve\nbistability and oscillations with the same feedback motif.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 18:15:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2019 13:11:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ehrmann", "Andreas", ""], ["Nguyen", "Basile", ""], ["Seifert", "Udo", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.12199", "submitter": "Petr Sulc", "authors": "Fan Hong, Petr \\v{S}ulc", "title": "Strand displacement: a fundamental mechanism in RNA biology?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  DNA and RNA are generally regarded as central molecules in molecular biology.\nRecent advancements in the field of DNA/RNA nanotechnology successfully used\nDNA/RNA as programmable molecules to construct molecular machines and\nnanostructures with predefined shapes and functions.
