There is an\nurgent need to identify medications that would treat and prevent novel diseases\nlike the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Drug repurposing is a promising\nstrategy to discover new medical indications of the existing approved drugs due\nto several advantages in terms of the costs, safety factors, and quick results\ncompared to new drug design and discovery. In this work, we explore\ncomputational data-driven methods for drug repurposing and propose a dedicated\ngraph neural network (GNN) based drug repurposing model, called Dr-COVID.\nAlthough we analyze the predicted drugs in detail for COVID-19, the model is\ngeneric and can be used for any novel diseases. We construct a four-layered\nheterogeneous graph to model the complex interactions between drugs, diseases,\ngenes, and anatomies. We pose drug repurposing as a link prediction problem.\nSpecifically, we design an encoder based on the scalable inceptive graph neural\nnetwork (SIGN) to generate embeddings for all the nodes in the four-layered\ngraph and propose a quadratic norm scorer as a decoder to predict treatment for\na disease. We provide a detailed analysis of the 150 potential drugs (such as\nDexamethasone, Ivermectin) predicted by Dr-COVID for COVID-19 from different\npharmacological classes (e.g., corticosteroids, antivirals, antiparasitic). Out\nof these 150 drugs, 46 drugs are currently in clinical trials. Dr-COVID is\nevaluated in terms of its prediction performance and its ability to rank the\nknown treatment drugs for diseases as high as possible. For a majority of the\ndiseases, Dr-COVID ranks the actual treatment drug in the top 15.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2020 18:34:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Doshi", "Siddhant", ""], ["Chepuri", "Sundeep Prabhakar", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02513", "submitter": "Adrien Richard", "authors": "Florian Bridoux, Am\\'elia Durbec, K\\'evin Perrot, Adrien Richard", "title": "Complexity of fixed point counting problems in Boolean Networks", "comments": "43 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.CC cs.DM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  A Boolean network (BN) with $n$ components is a discrete dynamical system\ndescribed by the successive iterations of a function $f:\\{0,1\\}^n \\to\n\\{0,1\\}^n$.

For exploring the particularity of\nevolution, we need a reference system. Such a reference system that we consider\nappropriate is a set of randomly sampled GRNs. Recently, Nagata and Kikuchi\n(PLoS Comput Biol 16 (2020) e1007969) proposed an efficient procedure for\nrandomly sampling GRNs in a wide range of fitness based on the multicanonical\nMonte Carlo method. We employ that method to construct the reference set and\ncompare it with the lineages obtained by evolutionary simulations. We consider\na neural-network-like model of GRN, which has one input gene and one output\ngene. The fitness is defined so that it is large when the difference in the\nexpressions of the output gene between two input values (\"on\" and \"off\")\nbecomes large. By comparing the evolution of fitness and the fitness\ndistribution of the reference set, we find that evolution slows down\nsignificantly near the value of fitness that the number of GRNs becomes\nextremely rare. It implies that the evolutionary speed is determined mainly by\nthe number of available GRNs, or in other words, \"entropy\". Random sampling\nreveals that the highly-fit GRNs in this model inevitably exhibit bistability.\nAccordingly, the evolutionary simulations produce bistable GRNs as fitness\nbecomes high. But the increase in the fraction of bistable GRNs occurs at\nhigher fitness than the reference set. Thus, the emergence of a new phenotype,\nbistability, is delayed in evolution. We also study an indicator of mutational\nrobustness. While in the early stage of evolution, it coincides with that of\nthe reference set, in the late stage, it becomes significantly higher than that\nof the reference set. In short, evolution enhances mutational robustness.

Accumulating data suggest that this\npoorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon\nMetabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA)\nis intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises\na catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to\nproduce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.\nInterestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is\nhomologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a\nconserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and\ncatalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in\nreplication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown\nin a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.\nMeasurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork\nspeed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit\nreplication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein\nrather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and\nPEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively\nand negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a\nprocess depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions.

Basal expression is\ncorrelated to the degree of chromatin loosening measured by DNA accessibility,\nand systematically leads to cellular dedifferentiation as assessed by\ntranscriptomic signatures, irrespective of the molecular and cellular tools\nused. Modeling gene network motifs formally involved in developmental\nbifurcations, reveals that the epigenetic landscapes of Waddington are\nrestructured by the level of non specific expression, such that the attractors\nof progenitor and differentiated cells can be mutually exclusive. This\nmechanism is universal and holds beyond the particular nature of the genes\ninvolved, provided the multistable circuits are correctly described with\nautonomous basal expression. These results explain the relationships long\nestablished between gene expression noise, chromatin decondensation and\ncellular dedifferentiation, and highlight how heterochromatin maintenance is\nessential for preventing pathological cellular reprogramming, age-related\ndiseases and cancer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Dec 2020 08:29:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Flouriot", "Gilles", ""], ["Jehanno", "Charly", ""], ["Page", "Yann Le", ""], ["Goff", "Pascale Le", ""], ["Boutin", "Benjamin", ""], ["Michel", "Denis", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.13780", "submitter": "Daniel Gamermann Dr.", "authors": "Daniel Gamermann, Jos\\'e Ant\\^onio Pellizaro", "title": "An algorithm for network community structure determination by surprise", "comments": "29 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Graphs representing real world systems may be studied from their underlying\ncommunity structure.
