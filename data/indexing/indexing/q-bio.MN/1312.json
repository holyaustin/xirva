Data obtained from experiments that perturb genes by\nknockouts or RNA interference contain useful information for addressing this\nreconstruction problem. However, such data can be limited in size and/or are\nexpensive to acquire. On the other hand, observational data of the organism in\nsteady state (e.g. wild-type) are more readily available, but their\ninformational content is inadequate for the task at hand. We develop a\ncomputational approach to appropriately utilize both data sources for\nestimating a regulatory network. The proposed approach is based on a three-step\nalgorithm to estimate the underlying directed but cyclic network, that uses as\ninput both perturbation screens and steady state gene expression data. In the\nfirst step, the algorithm determines causal orderings of the genes that are\nconsistent with the perturbation data, by combining an exhaustive search method\nwith a fast heuristic that in turn couples a Monte Carlo technique with a fast\nsearch algorithm. In the second step, for each obtained causal ordering, a\nregulatory network is estimated using a penalized likelihood based method,\nwhile in the third step a consensus network is constructed from the highest\nscored ones. Extensive computational experiments show that the algorithm\nperforms well in reconstructing the underlying network and clearly outperforms\ncompeting approaches that rely only on a single data source. Further, it is\nestablished that the algorithm produces a consistent estimate of the regulatory\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 06:00:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Shojaie", "Ali", ""], ["Jauhiainen", "Alexandra", ""], ["Kallitsis", "Michael", ""], ["Michailidis", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0711", "submitter": "Camellia Sarkar", "authors": "Ankit Agrawal, Camellia Sarkar, Sanjiv K.

Understanding the decision process\nthat moves a cell from autophagy to apoptosis is important since abnormal\nregulation of autophagy occurs in many diseases, including cancer. To integrate\nexisting knowledge about this decision process into a rigorous, analytical\nframework, we built a mathematical model of cell fate decisions mediated by\nautophagy. Our dynamical model is consistent with existing quantitative\nmeasurements of autophagy and apoptosis in rat kidney proximal tubular cells\nresponding to cisplatin-induced stress.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Dec 2013 20:52:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2015 21:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Tavassoly", "I.", ""], ["Parmar", "J.", ""], ["Shajahan-Haq", "A.

The authors in that work proposed\nconstruction rules for a high-dimensional dynamical system, when given a\nlow-dimensional dynamical system and the high-dimensional network structure.\nHowever, the proof therein was restricted to the class of systems for which all\ninternal feedback loops can be broken by a loopbreaking approach yielding a\nsingle-input single-output (SISO) system. In this report, we present the\ngeneralization of the proof to systems with any number of internal feedback\nloops, which will be broken by a generalized loopbreaking approach resulting in\na multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system. This generalization of the method\nrenders the construction method applicable to a broad class of gene regulatory\nnetwork models, thus promoting the transfer of results from core motif models\nto more realistic, high-dimensional models of gene regulation. We demonstrate\nthe potential and value of our method by applying it to an example of a gene\nregulatory network in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 12:17:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 16:30:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Schittler", "Daniella", ""], ["Jouini", "Taouba", ""], ["Allg\u00f6wer", "Frank", ""], ["Waldherr", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7262", "submitter": "Nicolae Radu Zabet", "authors": "Daphne Ezer, Nicolae Radu Zabet and Boris Adryan", "title": "Physical constraints determine the logic of bacterial promoter\n  architectures", "comments": "D.E. and N.R.Z. contributed equally to this work", "journal-ref": "Nucleic Acids Res. 42:7 (2014) 4196-4207", "doi": "10.1093/nar/gku078", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Site-specific transcription factors (TFs) bind to their target sites on the\nDNA, where they regulate the rate at which genes are transcribed. Bacterial TFs\nundergo facilitated diffusion (a combination of 3D diffusion around and 1D\nrandom walk on the DNA) when searching for their target sites. Using computer\nsimulations of this search process, we show that the organisation of the\nbinding sites, in conjunction with TF copy number and binding site affinity,\nplays an important role in determining not only the steady state of promoter\noccupancy, but also the order at which TFs bind. These effects can be captured\nby facilitated diffusion-based models, but not by standard thermodynamics. We\nshow that the spacing of binding sites encodes complex logic, which can be\nderived from combinations of three basic building blocks: switches, barriers\nand clusters, whose response alone and in higher orders of organisation we\ncharacterise in detail. Effective promoter organizations are commonly found in\nthe E. coli genome and are highly conserved between strains. This will allow\nstudies of gene regulation at a previously unprecedented level of detail, where\nour framework can create testable hypothesis of promoter logic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 13:45:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ezer", "Daphne", ""], ["Zabet", "Nicolae Radu", ""], ["Adryan", "Boris", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7306", "submitter": "Bhaskar DasGupta", "authors": "Satabdi Aditya, Bhaskar DasGupta, Marek Karpinski", "title": "Algorithmic Perspectives of Network Transitive Reduction Problems and\n  their Applications to Synthesis and Analysis of Biological Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Biology, 3 (1), 1-21, 2014", "doi": "10.3390/biology3010001", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CC cs.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this survey paper, we will present a number of core algorithmic questions\nconcerning several transitive reduction problems on network that have\napplications in network synthesis and analysis involving cellular processes.\nOur starting point will be the so-called minimum equivalent digraph problem, a\nclassic computational problem in combinatorial algorithms.
