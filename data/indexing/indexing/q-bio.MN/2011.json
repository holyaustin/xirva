In this work, module detection is achieved by using Hierarchical Link\nClustering, which can recognize overlapping communities and thus have more\nbiological meaning given the overlapping regulatory domains of systems that\ngenerate co-expression. Additional steps and information are also added to the\nworkflow, where some networks in the intermediate steps are forced to be\nscale-free and LASSO regression is employed to select the most significant\nmodules of phenotypical responses to stress. Finally, the workflow is showcased\nwith a systematic study on rice (Oryza sativa), a major food source that is\nknown to be highly sensitive to salt stress: a total of 6 modules are detected\nas relevant in the response to salt stress in rice; these genes may act as\npotential targets for the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice cultivars.\nThe proposed workflow has the potential to ultimately reduce the search-space\nfor candidate genes responding to a specific treatment, which can considerably\noptimize the effort, time, and money invested by researchers in the\nexperimental validation of stress responsive genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Oct 2020 21:14:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Riccio", "Camila", ""], ["Finke", "Jorge", ""], ["Rocha", "Camilo", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.04354", "submitter": "Fedor Garbuzov", "authors": "F.

A special class of transcriptional repressors\noperate via a short-range mechanism, making local DNA regions inaccessible to\nbinding by activators and, thus, providing an indirect repressive action on the\ntarget gene. This mechanism is commonly modeled assuming that the repressors\ninteract with the DNA under thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibrium approach\nto short-range repression makes it necessary to neglect some configurations of\nthe gene regulatory region. We elaborate a more general non-equilibrium model\nof short-range repression using the graph formalism for transitions between\ngene states and apply analytical calculations to compare it with the\nequilibrium model in terms of the repression strength and expression noise. In\ncontrast to the equilibrium approach, the new model allows to separate two\nbasic mechanisms of short-range repression. The first mechanism is associated\nwith the recruiting of factors that mediate chromatin condensation, and the\nsecond one concerns the blocking of factors that mediate chromatin loosening.\nThe non-equilibrium model demonstrates better performance on previously\npublished gene expression data obtained for transcription factors controlling\nDrosophila development and, furthermore, predicts that the first repression\nmechanism is the most favorable in this system.

Adaptation of the chemotaxis sensory\npathway of the bacterium Escherichia coli is essential for detecting chemicals\nover a wide range of background concentrations, ultimately allowing cells to\nswim towards sources of attractant and away from repellents. Since bacterial\nchemotaxis is a paradigm for adaptation or homeostasis, we use it as a model\nsystem to base the development of a general theory for the analysis of\nhomeostasis in coupled dynamical systems associated with input-output networks\nwith multiple input nodes. This theory allows one to define and classify\nhomeostasis types of a given network in a model independent fashion, in the\nsense that it depends only on the network topology and not on the specific\nmodel equations. Each homeostasis type represents a possible mechanism for\ngenerating homeostasis and is associated with a suitable subnetwork motif.\nWithin this framework it is also possible to formalize a notion of generic\nproperty of a coupled dynamical system, generalizing the notion of robustness.\nFinally, we apply our theory to a specific model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis\nand show that, from our abstract point of view, adaptation or homeostasis in\nthe model is caused by a mechanism that we called input counterweight. This new\nhomeostasis mechanism is generated by a balancing between the several input\nnodes of the network and requires the existence of at least two input nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2020 21:28:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 17:06:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Madeira", "Jo\u00e3o Luiz de Oliveira", ""], ["Antoneli", "Fernando", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.06478", "submitter": "Andreas Kraemer", "authors": "Andreas Kr\\\"amer", "title": "Master regulators as order parameters of gene expression states", "comments": "11 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this paper, computation capacity of signaling\nnetworks is introduced as a fundamental limit on signaling capability and\nperformance of such networks. The computation capacity measures the maximum\nnumber of computable inputs, that is, the maximum number of input values for\nwhich the correct functional output values can be recovered from the erroneous\nnetwork outputs, when the network contains some dysfunctional molecules. This\ncontrasts with the conventional communication capacity that measures instead\nthe maximum number of input values that can be correctly distinguished based on\nthe erroneous network outputs.\n  The computation capacity is higher than the communication capacity, if the\nnetwork response function is not a one-to-one function of the input signals. By\nexplicitly incorporating the effect of signaling errors that result in the\nnetwork dysfunction, the computation capacity provides more information about\nthe network and its malfunction. Two examples of signaling networks are studied\nhere, one regulating caspase3 and another regulating NFkB, for which\ncomputation and communication capacities are analyzed. Higher computation\ncapacities are observed for both networks. One biological implication of this\nfinding is that signaling networks may have more capacity than that specified\nby the conventional communication capacity metric.
