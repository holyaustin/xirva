Specifically, stochastic fluctuations\ndrive a system to explore a range of configurations providing `raw' information\nfor a learning algorithm to construct an accurate model; yet they also blur\nenergetic differences between network states and thereby degrade information.\nThis competition leads spin networks to generically have an intrinsic optimal\ntemperature at which stochastic spin fluctuations provide maximal information\nfor discriminating among competing models, maximizing inference efficiency. We\ndemonstrate a simple active learning protocol that optimizes network\ntemperature to boost inference efficiency and dramatically increases the\nefficiency of inference on a neural circuit reconstruction task.

Complex models suffer from uncertainty and\nexperiments are needed to reduce this uncertainty. Because experiments can be\ncostly and time-consuming it is desirable to determine experiments providing\nthe most useful information. If a sequence of experiments is to be performed,\nexperimental design is needed to determine the order. A classical approach is\nto maximally reduce the overall uncertainty in the model, meaning maximal\nentropy reduction. A recently proposed method takes into account both model\nuncertainty and the translational objective, for instance, optimal structural\nintervention in gene regulatory networks, where the aim is to alter the\nregulatory logic to maximally reduce the long-run likelihood of being in a\ncancerous state. The mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) quantifies\nuncertainty based on the degree to which model uncertainty affects the\nobjective. Experimental design involves choosing the experiment that yields the\ngreatest reduction in MOCU. This paper introduces finite-horizon dynamic\nprogramming for MOCU-based sequential experimental design and compares it to\nthe greedy approach, which selects one experiment at a time without\nconsideration of the full horizon of experiments. A salient aspect of the paper\nis that it demonstrates the advantage of MOCU-based design over the widely used\nentropy-based design for both greedy and dynamic-programming strategies and\ninvestigates the effect of model conditions on the comparative performances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 22:53:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Imani", "Mahdi", ""], ["Dehghannasiri", "Roozbeh", ""], ["Braga-Neto", "Ulisses M.", ""], ["Dougherty", "Edward R.", ""]]}]
