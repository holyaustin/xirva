Advances in estimation\nalgorithms now afford analysis of much larger networks in practical time. We\nillustrate the application of ERGM to both an undirected protein-protein\ninteraction (PPI) network and directed gene regulatory networks. ERGM models\nindicate over-representation of triangles in the PPI network, and confirm\nresults from previous research as to over-representation of transitive\ntriangles (feed-forward loop) in an E. coli and a yeast regulatory network. We\nalso confirm, using ERGMs, previous research showing that under-representation\nof the cyclic triangle (feedback loop) can be explained as a consequence of\nother topological features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2020 23:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 05:27:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2021 23:36:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:11:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Stivala", "Alex", ""], ["Lomi", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11641", "submitter": "Chetan Gadgil", "authors": "Dimpal A Nyayanit and Chetan J Gadgil", "title": "Mathematical model for autoregulated miRNA biogenesis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  MicroRNAs are small non-coding nucleotide sequences that regulate target\nprotein expression at post-transcriptional levels.

Regulation of miRNA biogenesis can be\ncaused directly by the components of the biogenesis pathway or indirectly by\nother regulators. In this study, we have built a detailed mathematical model of\nmicroRNA biogenesis to investigate the regulatory role of biogenesis pathway\ncomponents. We extended a previous model to incorporate Microprocessor\nregulation of DGCR8 synthesis, exportin-mediated transport to the cytoplasm,\nand positive auto-regulation catalysed by mature miRNA translocation into the\nnucleus. Our simulation results lead to three hypotheses (i) Biogenesis is\nrobust to Dicer protein levels at higher Exportin protein levels; (ii) Higher\nmiRNA transcript formation may lead to lower RISC levels: an optimal level of\nboth precursor miRNA and Dicer is required for optimal miRNA formation at lower\nlevels of Exportin protein; and (iii) The positive auto-regulation by mature\nmiRNA translocation into the nucleus can decrease the net functional\ncytoplasmic miRNA. Wherever possible, we compare these results to experimental\nobservations not used in the model construction or calibration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 03:09:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Nyayanit", "Dimpal A", ""], ["Gadgil", "Chetan J", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11679", "submitter": "Peter Csermely", "authors": "P\\'eter Csermely, Nina Kunsic, P\\'eter Mendik, M\\'ark Kerest\\'ely,\n  Teod\\'ora Farag\\'o, D\\'aniel V.

Sequence alignment (SA)\nuncovers missing annotations by transferring functional knowledge between\nspecies' sequence-conserved regions. Because SA is imperfect, network alignment\n(NA) complements SA by transferring functional knowledge between conserved\nbiological network, rather than just sequence, regions of different species.\nExisting NA assumes that it is topological similarity (isomorphic-like\nmatching) between network regions that corresponds to the regions' functional\nrelatedness. However, we recently found that functionally unrelated proteins\nare almost as topologically similar as functionally related proteins. So, we\nredefined NA as a data-driven framework, TARA, which learns from network and\nprotein functional data what kind of topological relatedness (rather than\nsimilarity) between proteins corresponds to the proteins' functional\nrelatedness. TARA used topological information (within each network) but not\nsequence information (between proteins across networks). Yet, its alignments\nyielded higher protein functional prediction accuracy than alignments of\nexisting NA methods, even those that used both topological and sequence\ninformation. Here, we propose TARA++ that is also data-driven, like TARA and\nunlike other existing methods, but that uses across-network sequence\ninformation on top of within-network topological information, unlike TARA. To\ndeal with the within-and-across-network analysis, we adapt social network\nembedding to the problem of biological NA. TARA++ outperforms protein\nfunctional prediction accuracy of existing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 17:43:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2020 19:36:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Shawn", ""], ["Milenkovic", "Tijana", ""]]}]
