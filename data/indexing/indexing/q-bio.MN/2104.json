The classification principles underlying these ontologies are guided\nby the analysis of observable pathological similarities between disorders,\noften based on anatomical or histological principles. Although, thanks to\nrecent advances in molecular biology, disease ontologies are slowly changing to\nintegrate the etiological and genetic origins of diseases, nosology still\nreflects this \"reductionist\" perspective. Proximity relationships of disease\nmodules (hereafter DMs) in the human interactome network are now increasingly\nused in diagnostics, to identify pathobiologically similar diseases and to\nsupport drug repurposing and discovery. On the other hand, similarity relations\ninduced from structural proximity of DMs also have several limitations, such as\nincomplete knowledge of disease-gene relationships and reliability of clinical\ntrials to assess their validity. The purpose of the study described in this\npaper is to shed more light on disease similarities by analyzing the\nrelationship between categorical proximity of diseases in human-curated\nontologies and structural proximity of the related DM in the interactome.\nMethod: We propose a methodology (and related algorithms) to automatically\ninduce a hierarchical structure from proximity relations between DMs, and to\ncompare this structure with a human-curated disease taxonomy. Results: We\ndemonstrate that the proposed methodology allows to systematically analyze\ncommonalities and differences among structural and categorical similarity of\nhuman diseases, help refine and extend human disease classification systems,\nand identify promising network areas where new disease-gene interactions can be\ndiscovered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 10:42:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Grani", "Giorgio", ""], ["Madeddu", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Velardi", "Paola", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.01279", "submitter": "John Zobolas", "authors": "John Zobolas, Pedro T.

We further define the properties that outline such\nconsistency and show that several of the Boolean functions under study violate\nthem, questioning their biological plausibility and subsequent use. We also\nillustrate that regulatory functions can have major differences with regard to\ntheir asymptotic output behavior, with some of them being biased towards\nspecific Boolean outcomes when others are dependent on the ratio between\nactivating and inhibitory regulators.\n  Application results show that in a specific signaling cancer network, the\nfunction bias can be used to guide the choice of logical operators for a model\nthat matches data observations.

We have recently shown that synchronized gene\nexpression may be predicted from symmetries in the gene regulatory networks\n(GRN) and described by the concept of symmetry fibrations. We showed that\nsymmetry fibrations partition the genes into groups called fibers based on the\nsymmetries of their 'input trees', the set of paths in the network through\nwhich signals can reach a gene. In idealized dynamic gene expression models,\nall genes in a fiber are perfectly synchronized, while less idealized models -\nwith gene input functions differencing between genes - predict symmetry\nbreaking and desynchronization.\n  Results: To study the functional role of gene fibers and to test whether some\nof the fiber-induced coexpression remains in reality, we analyze gene\nfibrations for the gene regulatory networks of E. coli and B. subtilis and\nconfront them with expression data. We find approximate gene coexpression\npatterns consistent with symmetry fibrations with idealized gene expression\ndynamics. This shows that network structure alone provides useful information\nabout gene synchronization, and suggest that gene input functions within fibers\nmay be further streamlined by evolutionary pressures to realize a coexpression\nof genes.\n  Conclusions: Thus, gene fibrations provides a sound conceptual tool to\ndescribe tunable coexpression induced by network topology and shaped by\nmechanistic details of gene expression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 17:38:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Leifer", "Ian", ""], ["S\u00e1nchez-P\u00e9rez", "Mishael", ""], ["Ishida", "Cecilia", ""], ["Makse", "Hern\u00e1n A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.09206", "submitter": "Victor Popescu", "authors": "Elio Nushi, Victor-Bogdan Popescu, Jose Angel Sanchez Martin, Sergiu\n  Ivanov, Eugen Czeizler and Ion Petre", "title": "Network modeling methods for precision medicine", "comments": "55 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.SI", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss in this survey several network modeling methods and their\napplicability to precision medicine.

The resulting theoretical framework\nallows us to exploit the symmetry of multicellular bilayer structures in 2D and\n3D, thereby deriving analytical conditions that drive the dynamical system to\nform laminar patterns consistent with the formulation of cell polarity.\nCritically, the conditions are independent of the precise dynamical details,\nthus the framework allows for the utmost generality in understanding the\ninfluence of cellular geometry on patterning in lateral-inhibition systems.\nApplying the analytic conditions to mammary organoids suggests that intense\ncell signalling polarity is required for the maintenance of stratified\ncell-types within a static bilayer using a lateral-inhibition mechanism.\nFurthermore, by employing 2D and 3D cell-based models, we highlight that the\ncellular polarity conditions derived from static domains have the capacity to\ngenerate laminar patterning in dynamic environments. However, they are\ninsufficient for the maintenance of patterning when subjected to substantial\nmorphological perturbations. In agreement with the mathematical implications of\nstrict signalling polarity induced on the cells, we propose an adhesion\ndependent Notch-Delta biological process which has the potential to initiate\nbilayer stratification in a developing mammary organoid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:30:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2021 09:26:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "Joshua W.", ""], ["Dale", "Trevor C.", ""], ["Woolley", "Thomas E.", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.13146", "submitter": "Zheng Zhao", "authors": "Zheng Zhao and Philip E.

It requires designing inhibitors\nthat can bind to specific kinases when all kinase catalytic domains share a\ncommon folding scaffold that binds ATP.

This begins with deciphering the kinase-ligand\ncharacteristics, analyzing the structure-activity relationships, and\nprioritizing the desired drug molecules across the whole kinome. Currently,\nthere are more than 300 kinases with released PDB structures, which provides a\nsubstantial structural basis to gain these necessary insights.

While these models are\nconvenient for detailed simulations, their size is often an obstacle to\nderiving mechanistic insights. One way to address this issue is to perform an\nexact model reduction by finding a self-consistent lower-dimensional projection\nof the corresponding dynamical system. Recently, a new algorithm CLUE has been\ndesigned and implemented, which allows one to construct an exact linear\nreduction of the smallest possible dimension such that the fixed variables of\ninterest are preserved. It turned out that allowing arbitrary linear\ncombinations (as opposed to zero-one combinations used in the prior approaches)\nmay yield a much smaller reduction. However, there was a drawback: some of the\nnew variables did not have clear physical meaning, thus making the reduced\nmodel harder to interpret. We design and implement an algorithm that, given an\nexact linear reduction, re-parametrizes it by performing an invertible\ntransformation of the new coordinates to improve the interpretability of the\nnew variables. We apply our algorithm to three case studies and show that\n\"uninterpretable\" variables disappear entirely in all the case studies.
