Methods exist to measure the GO\nsimilarity between two proteins in isolation, but pairs of proteins in a\nnetwork alignment are not isolated: each pairing is implicitly dependent upon\nevery other pairing via the alignment itself. Current methods fail to take into\naccount the frequency of GO terms across the networks, and attempt to account\nfor common GO terms in an ad hoc fashion by imposing arbitrary rules on when to\n\"allow\" GO terms based on their location in the GO hierarchy, rather than using\nreadily available frequency information in the PPI networks themselves. Here we\ndevelop a new measure, NetGO, that naturally weighs infrequent, informative GO\nterms more heavily than frequent, less informative GO terms, without requiring\narbitrary cutoffs. In particular, NetGO down-weights the score of frequent GO\nterms according to their frequency in the networks being aligned. This is a\nglobal measure applicable only to alignments, independent of pairwise GO\nmeasures, in the same sense that the edge-based EC or S3 scores are global\nmeasures of topological similarity independent of pairwise topological\nsimilarities. We demonstrate the superiority of NetGO by creating alignments of\npredetermined quality based on homologous pairs of nodes and show that NetGO\ncorrelates with alignment quality much better than any existing GO-based\nalignment measures. We also demonstrate that NetGO provides a measure of\ntaxonomic similarity between species, consistent with existing taxonomic\nmeasures--a feature not shared with existing GO-based network alignment\nmeasures. Finally, we re-score alignments produced by almost a dozen aligners\nfrom a previous study and show that NetGO does a better job than existing\nmeasures at separating good alignments from bad ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 22:22:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hayes", "Wayne B.", ""], ["Mamano", "Nil", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01221", "submitter": "Shawn Gu", "authors": "Shawn Gu, John Johnson, Fazle E.

Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas,\nbrain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation.\nIn the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form\nmodestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the\ncell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a\ndose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium\n(Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+\nconduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and\nsarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular\nCa2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of\namylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is\nsufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+\ntransients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these\nquestions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling\nto reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and\ndecreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function\nstemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this\nmodel, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was\nsufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes.

These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced\nby deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in\npre-diabetes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Stewart", "Bradley D.", ""], ["Scott", "Caitlin E.", ""], ["McCoy", "Thomas P.", ""], ["Yin", "Guo", ""], ["Despa", "Florin", ""], ["Despa", "Sanda", ""], ["Kekenes-Huskey", "Peter M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.05343", "submitter": "Yijie Wang", "authors": "Yijie Wang, Dong-Yeon Cho, Hangnoh Lee, Justin Fear, Brian Oliver, and\n  Teresa M Przytycka", "title": "NetREX: Network Rewiring using EXpression - Towards Context Specific\n  Regulatory Networks", "comments": "RECOMB 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding gene regulation is a fundamental step towards understanding of\nhow cells function and respond to environmental cues and perturbations.

We show how to solve this problem optimally using integer linear\nprogramming and also give a fast heuristic algorithm that works well in\npractice. We perform a large-scale evaluation of our resulting method, nCOP, on\n6,038 TCGA tumor samples across 24 different cancer types. We demonstrate that\nour approach nCOP is more effective in identifying cancer genes than both\nmethods that do not utilize any network information as well as state-of-the-art\nnetwork-based methods that aggregate mutational information across individuals.\nOverall, our work demonstrates the power of combining per-individual mutational\ninformation with interaction networks in order to uncover genes functionally\nrelevant in cancers, and in particular those genes that are less frequently\nmutated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 15:47:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Hristov", "Borislav H.", ""], ["Singh", "Mona", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08586", "submitter": "Taichi Haruna", "authors": "Taichi Haruna", "title": "Evolution of Activity-Dependent Adaptive Boolean Networks towards\n  Criticality: An Analytic Approach", "comments": "17 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose new activity-dependent adaptive Boolean networks inspired by the\ncis-regulatory mechanism in gene regulatory networks.

We hypothesized that exploring the interplay between\nco-occurrence, mutual exclusivity, and functional interactions between genes\nwill further improve our understanding of the disease and help to uncover new\nrelations between cancer driving genes and pathways. To this end, we designed a\ngeneral framework, BeWith, for identifying modules with different combinations\nof mutation and interaction patterns. We focused on three different settings of\nthe BeWith schema: (i) BeME-WithFun in which the relations between modules are\nenriched with mutual exclusivity while genes within each module are\nfunctionally related; (ii) BeME-WithCo which combines mutual exclusivity\nbetween modules with co-occurrence within modules; and (iii) BeCo-WithMEFun\nwhich ensures co-occurrence between modules while the within module relations\ncombine mutual exclusivity and functional interactions. We formulated the\nBeWith framework using Integer Linear Programming (ILP), enabling us to find\noptimally scoring sets of modules. Our results demonstrate the utility of\nBeWith in providing novel information about mutational patterns, driver genes,\nand pathways. In particular, BeME-WithFun helped identify functionally coherent\nmodules that might be relevant for cancer progression. In addition to finding\npreviously well-known drivers, the identified modules pointed to the importance\nof the interaction between NCOR and NCOA3 in breast cancer. Additionally, an\napplication of the BeME-WithCo setting revealed that gene groups differ with\nrespect to their vulnerability to different mutagenic processes, and helped us\nto uncover pairs of genes with potentially synergetic effects, including a\npotential synergy between mutations in TP53 and metastasis related DCC gene.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 12:08:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Dao", "Phuong", ""], ["Kim", "Yoo-Ah", ""], ["Wojtowicz", "Damian", ""], ["Madan", "Sanna", ""], ["Sharan", "Roded", ""], ["Przytycka", "Teresa M.", ""]]}]
