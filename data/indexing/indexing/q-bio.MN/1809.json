The fact that this network yields oscillations\nwas shown recently by Suwanmajo and Krishnan. Our results, which significantly\nextend their analyses, are as follows. First, in the three-dimensional space of\ntotal amounts, the border between systems with a stable versus unstable steady\nstate is a surface defined by the vanishing of a single Hurwitz determinant.\nSecond, this surface consists generically of simple Hopf bifurcations. Next,\nsimulations suggest that when the steady state is unstable, oscillations are\nthe norm. Finally, the emergence of oscillations via a Hopf bifurcation is\nenabled by the catalytic and association constants of the distributive part of\nthe mechanism: if these rate constants satisfy two inequalities, then the\nsystem generically admits a Hopf bifurcation. Our proofs are enabled by the\nRouth-Hurwitz criterion, a Hopf-bifurcation criterion due to Yang, and a\nmonomial parametrization of steady states.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Sep 2018 22:10:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 20:44:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Conradi", "Carsten", ""], ["Mincheva", "Maya", ""], ["Shiu", "Anne", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.04613", "submitter": "Daniele Cappelletti", "authors": "David Anderson and Daniele Cappelletti", "title": "Discrepancies between extinction events and boundary equilibria in\n  reaction networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN math.DS math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reaction networks are mathematical models of interacting chemical species\nthat are primarily used in biochemistry. There are two modeling regimes that\nare typically used, one of which is deterministic and one that is stochastic.\nIn particular, the deterministic model consists of an autonomous system of\ndifferential equations, whereas the stochastic system is a continuous time\nMarkov chain. Connections between the two modeling regimes have been studied\nsince the seminal paper by Kurtz (1972), where the deterministic model is shown\nto be a limit of a properly rescaled stochastic model over compact time\nintervals. Further, more recent studies have connected the long-term behaviors\nof the two models when the reaction network satisfies certain graphical\nproperties, such as weak reversibility and a deficiency of zero.\n  These connections have led some to conjecture a link between the long-term\nbehavior of the two models exists, in some sense. In particular, one is tempted\nto believe that positive recurrence of all states for the stochastic model\nimplies the existence of positive equilibria in the deterministic setting, and\nthat boundary equilibria of the deterministic model imply the occurrence of an\nextinction event in the stochastic setting. We prove in this paper that these\nimplications do not hold in general, even if restricting the analysis to\nnetworks that are bimolecular and that conserve the total mass.
