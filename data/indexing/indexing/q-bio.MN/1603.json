Indeed, these\nsystems involve many parts and processes but are studied piecewise and their\nliteratures and data are consequently fragmented, distributed and sometimes--at\nleast apparently--inconsistent. This makes it extremely difficult to build\nsignificant explanatory models with the result that effects in these systems\nthat are brought about by many interacting factors are poorly understood.\n  The rule-based approach to modelling has shown some promise for the\nrepresentation of the highly combinatorial systems typically found in\nsignalling where many of the proteins are composed of multiple binding domains,\ncapable of simultaneous interactions, and/or peptide motifs controlled by\npost-translational modifications. However, the rule-based approach requires\nhighly detailed information about the precise conditions for each and every\ninteraction which is rarely available from any one single source. Rather, these\nconditions must be painstakingly inferred and curated, by hand, from\ninformation contained in many papers--each of which contains only part of the\nstory.\n  In this paper, we introduce a graph-based meta-model, attuned to the\nrepresentation of cellular signalling networks, which aims to ease this massive\ncognitive burden on the rule-based curation process. This meta-model is a\ngeneralization of that used by Kappa and BNGL which allows for the flexible\nrepresentation of knowledge at various levels of granularity. In particular, it\nallows us to deal with information which has either too little, or too much,\ndetail with respect to the strict rule-based meta-model. Our approach provides\na basis for the gradual aggregation of fragmented biological knowledge\nextracted from the literature into an instance of the meta-model from which we\ncan define an automated translation into executable Kappa programs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 05:34:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Basso-Blandin", "Adrien", "", "LIP, ENS Lyon"], ["Fontana", "Walter", "", "Harvard Medical\n  School"], ["Harmer", "Russ", "", "CNRS & LIP, ENS Lyon"]]}, {"id": "1603.02481", "submitter": "Jakob Lykke Andersen", "authors": "Jakob L.
