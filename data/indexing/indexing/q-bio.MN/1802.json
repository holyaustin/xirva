Recent work has found that cooperation\nbetween feedback and buffering---the use of reservoirs of molecules to maintain\nmolecular concentrations---is often critical for biochemical regulation, and\nthat buffering can act as a derivative or lead controller. However, buffering\ndiffers from derivative feedback in important ways: it is not typically limited\nby stability constraints on the parallel feedback loop, for some signals it\nacts instead as a low-pass filter, and it can change the location of\ndisturbances in the closed-loop system. Here, we propose a frequency-domain\nframework for studying the regulatory properties of buffer-feedback systems. We\ndetermine standard single-output closed-loop transfer functions and discuss\nloop-shaping properties. We also derive novel fundamental limits for\nbuffer-feedback regulation, which show that buffering and removal processes can\nreduce the fundamental limits on feedback regulation. We apply the framework to\nstudy the regulation for glycolysis (anaerobic metabolism) with creatine\nphosphate buffering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Feb 2018 01:06:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hancock", "Edward J.", ""], ["Ang", "Jordan", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.00296", "submitter": "Arampatzis Georgios", "authors": "Jana Lipkov\\'a, Georgios Arampatzis, Philippe Chatelain, Bjoern Menze,\n  Petros Koumoutsakos", "title": "$S$-Leaping: An adaptive, accelerated stochastic simulation algorithm,\n  bridging $\\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose the $S$-leaping algorithm for the acceleration of Gillespie's\nstochastic simulation algorithm that combines the advantages of the two main\naccelerated methods; the $\\tau$-leaping and $R$-leaping algorithms.

However, a major\nconsequence of polypharmacy is a much higher risk of adverse side effects for\nthe patient. Polypharmacy side effects emerge because of drug-drug\ninteractions, in which activity of one drug may change if taken with another\ndrug. The knowledge of drug interactions is limited because these complex\nrelationships are rare, and are usually not observed in relatively small\nclinical testing. Discovering polypharmacy side effects thus remains an\nimportant challenge with significant implications for patient mortality. Here,\nwe present Decagon, an approach for modeling polypharmacy side effects. The\napproach constructs a multimodal graph of protein-protein interactions,\ndrug-protein target interactions, and the polypharmacy side effects, which are\nrepresented as drug-drug interactions, where each side effect is an edge of a\ndifferent type. Decagon is developed specifically to handle such multimodal\ngraphs with a large number of edge types. Our approach develops a new graph\nconvolutional neural network for multirelational link prediction in multimodal\nnetworks. Decagon predicts the exact side effect, if any, through which a given\ndrug combination manifests clinically. Decagon accurately predicts polypharmacy\nside effects, outperforming baselines by up to 69%. We find that it\nautomatically learns representations of side effects indicative of\nco-occurrence of polypharmacy in patients. Furthermore, Decagon models\nparticularly well side effects with a strong molecular basis, while on\npredominantly non-molecular side effects, it achieves good performance because\nof effective sharing of model parameters across edge types. Decagon creates\nopportunities to use large pharmacogenomic and patient data to flag and\nprioritize side effects for follow-up analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Feb 2018 02:43:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 21:39:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Zitnik", "Marinka", ""], ["Agrawal", "Monica", ""], ["Leskovec", "Jure", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.00828", "submitter": "Deisy Morselli Gysi", "authors": "Deisy Morselli Gysi, Tiago Miranda Fragoso, Volker Buskamp, Eivind\n  Almaas and Katja Nowick", "title": "Comparing multiple networks using the Co-expression Differential Network\n  Analysis (CoDiNA)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0240523", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO q-bio.MN stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biomedical sciences are increasingly recognising the relevance of gene\nco-expression-networks for analysing complex-systems, phenotypes or diseases.\nWhen the goal is investigating complex-phenotypes under varying conditions, it\ncomes naturally to employ comparative network methods.

The solution of the detection problem is to\ncompute the log-likelihood ratio of observing a persistent signal to a\ntransient signal. We show that, if this log-likelihood ratio is positive, which\nhappens when the signal is likely to be persistent, then it can be\napproximately computed by a C1-FFL.

Although many methods\nexist, the No Free Lunch theorem for community detection implies that each\nmakes some kind of tradeoff, and no algorithm can be optimal on all inputs.\nThus, different algorithms will over or underfit on different inputs, finding\nmore, fewer, or just different communities than is optimal, and evaluation\nmethods that use a metadata partition as a ground truth will produce misleading\nconclusions about general accuracy. Here, we present a broad evaluation of over\nand underfitting in community detection, comparing the behavior of 16\nstate-of-the-art community detection algorithms on a novel and structurally\ndiverse corpus of 406 real-world networks. We find that (i) algorithms vary\nwidely both in the number of communities they find and in their corresponding\ncomposition, given the same input, (ii) algorithms can be clustered into\ndistinct high-level groups based on similarities of their outputs on real-world\nnetworks, and (iii) these differences induce wide variation in accuracy on link\nprediction and link description tasks. We introduce a new diagnostic for\nevaluating overfitting and underfitting in practice, and use it to roughly\ndivide community detection methods into general and specialized learning\nalgorithms. Across methods and inputs, Bayesian techniques based on the\nstochastic block model and a minimum description length approach to\nregularization represent the best general learning approach, but can be\noutperformed under specific circumstances.
