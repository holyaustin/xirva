We also apply a recently\ndeveloped linear response theory for the Google matrix which highlights a\npathway of proteins whose PageRank probabilities are most sensitive with\nrespect to two proteins selected for the analysis. This group of proteins is\nanalyzed by the reduced Google matrix algorithm which allows to determine the\neffective interactions between them due to direct and indirect pathways in the\nglobal network. We show that the dominating activation or inhibition function\nof each protein can be characterized by its magnetization. The results of this\nGoogle matrix analysis are presented for three examples of selected pairs of\nproteins. The developed methods work rapidly and efficiently even for networks\nwith several million of nodes and can be applied to various biological\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 14:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Frahm", "Klaus M.", ""], ["Shepelyansky", "Dima L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.11070", "submitter": "R.

A\nrecently developed method, bond-to-bond propensity analysis, has proven capable\nof predicting allosteric sites in a wide range of proteins using an\nenergy-weighted atomistic graph obtained from the protein structure and given\nknowledge only of the location of the active site. Bond-to-bond propensity\nestablishes if energy fluctuations at given bonds have significant effects on\nany other bond in the protein, by considering their propagation through the\nprotein graph. In this work, we use bond-to-bond propensity analysis to study\ndifferent aspects of ATCase activity using three different protein structures\nand sources of fluctuations. First, we predict key residues and bonds involved\nin the transition between inactive (T) and active (R) states of ATCase by\nanalysing allosteric substrate binding as a source of energy perturbations in\nthe protein graph. Our computational results also indicate that the effect of\nmultiple allosteric binding is non linear: a switching effect is observed after\na particular number and arrangement of substrates is bound suggesting a form of\nlong range communication between the distantly arranged allosteric sites.\nSecond, cooperativity is explored by considering a bisubstrate analogue as the\nsource of energy fluctuations at the active site, also leading to the\nidentification of highly significant residues to the T-R transition that\nenhance cooperativity across active sites. Finally, the inactive (T) structure\nis shown to exhibit a strong, non linear communication between the allosteric\nsites and the interface between catalytic subunits, rather than the active\nsite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2019 12:37:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hodges", "Maxwell", ""], ["Barahona", "Mauricio", ""], ["Yaliraki", "Sophia N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.12990", "submitter": "John Vastola", "authors": "John J.

Some added structure on the Koopman\noperator learning process for controlled systems is given for dynamics that are\nseparable in the state and input.
