To better understand this connection, researchers developed the\nHi-C method that is able to detect the pairwise physical contacts of all\nchromosomal loci. The Hi-C data show that chromosomes are composed of 3D\ncompartments that range over a variety of scales. However, it is challenging to\nsystematically detect these cross-scale structures. Most studies have therefore\ndesigned methods for specific scales to study foremost topologically associated\ndomains (TADs) and A/B compartments. To go beyond this limitation, we tailor a\nnetwork community detection method that finds communities in compact fractal\nglobule polymer systems. Our method allows us to continuously scan through all\nscales with a single resolution parameter. We found: (i) polymer segments\nbelonging to the same 3D community do not have to be in consecutive order along\nthe polymer chain. In other words, several TADs may belong to the same 3D\ncommunity. (ii) CTCF proteins---a loop-stabilizing protein that is ascribed a\nbig role in TAD formation---are well correlated with community borders only at\none level of organization. (iii) TADs and A/B compartments are traditionally\ntreated as two weakly related 3D structures and detected with different\nalgorithms. With our method, we detect both by simply adjusting the resolution\nparameter. We therefore argue that they represent two specific levels of a\ncontinuous spectrum 3D communities, rather than seeing them as different\nstructural entities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 14:49:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 09:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Sang Hoon", ""], ["Kim", "Yeonghoon", ""], ["Lee", "Sungmin", ""], ["Durang", "Xavier", ""], ["Stenberg", "Per", ""], ["Jeon", "Jae-Hyung", ""], ["Lizana", "Ludvig", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.01505", "submitter": "Vivian Tyng", "authors": "Vivian Tyng and Michael E.

Vector fields of\nprobability flux and velocity characterize time-varying and steady-state\nproperties of these systems, including high probability paths, barriers,\ncheckpoints among different stable regions, as well as mechanisms of dynamic\nswitching among them. However, conventional fluxes on continuous space are\nill-defined and are problematic when at boundaries of the state space or when\ncopy numbers are small. By re-defining the derivative and divergence operators\nbased on the discrete nature of reactions, we introduce new formulations of\ndiscrete fluxes. Our flux model fully accounts for the discreetness of both the\nstate space and the jump processes of reactions. The reactional discrete flux\nsatisfies the continuity equation and describes the behavior of the system\nevolving along directions of reactions. The species discrete flux directly\ndescribes the dynamic behavior in the state space of the reactants such as the\ntransfer of probability mass. With the relationship between these two fluxes\nspecified, we show how to construct time-evolving and steady-state global\nflow-maps of probability flux and velocity in the directions of every species\nat every microstate, and how they are related to the outflow and inflow of\nprobability fluxes when tracing out reaction trajectories. We also describe how\nto impose proper conditions enabling exact quantification of flux and velocity\nin the boundary regions, without the difficulty of enforcing artificial\nreflecting conditions.
