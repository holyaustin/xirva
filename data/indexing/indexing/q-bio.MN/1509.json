Rules enable a precise encoding of biochemical\ninteractions at the resolution of sites within molecules, but obtaining an\nintegrated global view from sets of rules remains challenging. Current\nautomated approaches to rule visualization fail to address the complexity of\ninteractions between rules, limiting either the types of rules that are allowed\nor the set of interactions that can be visualized simultaneously. There is a\nneed for scalable visualization approaches that present the information encoded\nin rules in an intuitive and useful manner at different levels of detail. We\nhave developed new automated approaches for visualizing both individual rules\nand complete rule-based models. We find that a more compact representation of\nan individual rule promotes promotes understanding the model assumptions\nunderlying each rule. For global visualization of rule interactions, we have\ndeveloped a method to synthesize a network of interactions between sites and\nprocesses from a rule-based model and then use a combination of user-defined\nand automated approaches to compress this network into a readable form. The\nresulting diagrams enable modelers to identify signaling motifs such as\ncascades, feedback loops, and feed-forward loops in complex models, as we\ndemonstrate using several large-scale models. These capabilities are\nimplemented within the BioNetGen framework but the approach is equally\napplicable to rule-based models specified in other formats.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 22:45:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sekar", "John A.

We develop an experimentally feasible control framework\nfor nonlinear dynamical networks that exhibit multistability (multiple\ncoexisting final states or attractors), which are representative of, e.g., gene\nregulatory networks (GRNs). The control objective is to apply parameter\nperturbation to drive the system from one attractor to another, assuming that\nthe former is undesired and the latter is desired. To make our framework\npractically useful, we consider RESTRICTED parameter perturbation by imposing\nthe following two constraints: (a) it must be experimentally realizable and (b)\nit is applied only temporarily. We introduce the concept of ATTRACTOR NETWORK,\nin which the nodes are the distinct attractors of the system, and there is a\ndirectional link from one attractor to another if the system can be driven from\nthe former to the latter using restricted control perturbation. Introduction of\nthe attractor network allows us to formulate a controllability framework for\nnonlinear dynamical networks: a network is more controllable if the underlying\nattractor network is more strongly connected, which can be quantified. We\ndemonstrate our control framework using examples from various models of\nexperimental GRNs.

One of the strongest sources of stochasticity is the binary noise\nthat arises from the binding of a regulatory protein to a promoter in the\nchromosomal DNA. In this study, we focus on two minimal oscillators based on\nactivator titration and repressor titration to understand the key parameters\nthat are important for oscillations and for overcoming binary noise. We show\nthat the rate of unbinding from the DNA, despite traditionally being considered\na fast parameter, needs to be slow to broaden the space of oscillatory\nsolutions. The addition of multiple, independent DNA binding sites further\nexpands the oscillatory parameter space for the repressor-titration oscillator\nand lengthens the period of both oscillators. This effect is a combination of\nincreased effective delay of the unbinding kinetics due to multiple binding\nsites and increased promoter ultrasensitivity that is specific for repression.\nWe then use stochastic simulation to show that multiple binding sites increase\nthe coherence of the oscillations by mitigating the binary noise. Slow values\nof DNA unbinding rate are also effective in alleviating molecular noise due to\nthe increased distance from the bifurcation point. Our work demonstrates how\nDNA binding sites and slow unbinding kinetics, which are often omitted in\nbiophysical models of gene circuits, can have a significant impact on the\ntemporal and stochastic dynamics of genetic oscillators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 16:07:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 22:27:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Karapetyan", "Sargis", ""], ["Buchler", "Nicolas E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07440", "submitter": "Denis Michel", "authors": "Denis Michel", "title": "A role for ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling in the hierarchical\n  cooperativity between noninteracting transcription factors", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures.
