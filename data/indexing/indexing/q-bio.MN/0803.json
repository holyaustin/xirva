This\nimplies that natural selection has exerted no or very little pressure on the\nnetwork degree distribution during evolution. The corresponding random network,\nhere termed the blind watchmaker network has a power-law degree distribution\nwith an exponent gamma >= 2. It is random with respect to a complete set of\nnetwork states characterized by a description of which links are attached to a\nnode as well as a time-ordering of these links. No a priory assumption of any\ngrowth mechanism or evolution process is made. It is found that the degree\ndistribution of the blind watchmaker network agrees very precisely with that of\nthe metabolic networks. This implies that the evolutionary pathway of the\ncell-metabolism, when projected onto a metabolic network representation, has\nremained statistically random with respect to a complete set of network states.\nThis suggests that even a biological system, which due to natural selection has\ndeveloped an enormous specificity like the cellular metabolism, nevertheless\ncan, at the same time, display well defined characteristics emanating from the\nubiquitous inherent random element of Darwinian evolution. The fact that also\ncompletely random networks may have scale-free node distributions gives a new\nperspective on the origin of scale-free networks in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 07:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Minnhagen", "Petter", ""], ["Bernhardsson", "Sebastian", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0635", "submitter": "Luca Sbano", "authors": "Markus Kirkilionis and Luca Sbano", "title": "An Averaging Principle for Combined Interaction Graphs.

In\nthe reverse sense attaching meaningful dynamics to given 'interaction diagrams'\nis a central bottleneck problem in many application areas, especially in cell\nbiology where various such diagrams with different conventions describing\nmolecular regulation are presently in use. In most situations these diagrams\ncan only be interpreted by the use of both discrete and continuous variables\nduring the modelling process, corresponding to both deterministic and\nstochastic hybrid dynamics. The conventions in genetics are well-known, and\ntherefore we use this field for illustration purposes. In [25] and [26] the\nauthors showed that with the help of a multi-scale analysis stochastic systems\nwith both continuous variables and finite state spaces can be approximated by\ndynamical systems whose leading order time evolution is given by a combination\nof ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and Markov chains. The leading order\nterm in these dynamical systems is called average dynamics and turns out to be\nan adequate concept to analyse a class of simplified hybrid systems. Once the\ndynamics is defifined the mutual interaction of both ODEs and Markov chains can\nbe analysed through the (reverse) introduction of the so called Interaction\nGraph, a concept originally invented for time-continuous dynamical systems, see\n[5]. Here we transfer this graph concept to the average dynamics, which itself\nis introduced as an heuristic tool to construct models of reaction or contact\nnetworks. The graphical concepts introduced form the basis for any subsequent\nstudy of the qualitative properties of hybrid models in terms of connectivity\nand (feedback) loop formation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2008 11:14:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2008 13:57:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Jul 2010 10:04:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kirkilionis", "Markus", ""], ["Sbano", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0962", "submitter": "Adilson Enio Motter", "authors": "Adilson E.

Focusing on the metabolism of single-cell organisms, we\ncomputationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme, and thus are\nunable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that\nseveral of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional\ngene deletions that restore their growth rate. In a rather counterintuitive\nfashion, this is achieved via additional damage to the metabolic network. Using\nflux balance-based approaches, we identify a number of synthetically viable\ngene pairs, in which the removal of one enzyme-encoding gene results in a\nnonviable phenotype, while the deletion of a second enzyme-encoding gene\nrescues the organism. The systematic network-based identification of\ncompensatory rescue effects may open new avenues for genetic interventions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2008 20:12:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-15", "authors_parsed": [["Motter", "Adilson E.", ""], ["Gulbahce", "Natali", ""], ["Almaas", "Eivind", ""], ["Barabasi", "Albert-Laszlo", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.1385", "submitter": "Raphael Plasson", "authors": "Rapha\\\"el Plasson (Nordita), Hugues Bersini (Iridia), Axel Brandenburg\n  (Nordita)", "title": "Decomposition of Complex Reaction Networks into Reactons", "comments": "24 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Biophysical Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "NORDITA-2008-12", "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The analysis of complex reaction networks is of great importance in several\nchemical and biochemical fields (interstellar chemistry, prebiotic chemistry,\nreaction mechanism, etc).

This analysis is made possible by the\ndecomposition of the molecules into elementary subunits, called \"reactons\" and\nthe consequent decomposition of the whole network into simple first order unary\npartial reactions related with simple transfers of reactons from one molecule\nto another.
