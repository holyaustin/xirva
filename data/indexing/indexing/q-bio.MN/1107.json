We first compare them on simulated\ndatasets and we find that PINV is less stable in terms of AUC performance when\nthe number of variables changes. The two regularized methods have comparable\nperformances but $\\ell_{2C}$ is much faster than RCM.

In contrast, rate equation\nmodels are based on the implicit assumption of infinitely large numbers of\ninteracting molecules, or equivalently, that reactions occur in infinite\nvolumes at constant macroscopic concentrations. In this article we compute the\nfinite-volume corrections (or equivalently the finite copy number corrections)\nto the solutions of the rate equations for chemical reaction networks composed\nof arbitrarily large numbers of enzyme-catalyzed reactions which are confined\ninside a small sub-cellular compartment. This is achieved by applying a\nmesoscopic version of the quasi-steady state assumption to the exact\nFokker-Planck equation associated with the Poisson Representation of the\nchemical master equation. The procedure yields impressively simple and compact\nexpressions for the finite-volume corrections. We prove that the predictions of\nthe rate equations will always underestimate the actual steady-state substrate\nconcentrations for an enzyme-reaction network confined in a small volume. In\nparticular we show that the finite-volume corrections increase with decreasing\nsub-cellular volume, decreasing Michaelis-Menten constants and increasing\nenzyme saturation. The magnitude of the corrections depends sensitively on the\ntopology of the network.

In general, the main\nlimitations faced by GRN inference methods is the small number of samples with\nhuge dimensionalities and the noisy nature of the expression measurements. In\nface of these limitations, alternatives are needed to get better accuracy on\nthe GRNs inference problem. This work addresses this problem by presenting an\nalternative feature selection method that applies prior knowledge on its search\nstrategy, called SFFS-BA. The proposed search strategy is based on the\nSequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) algorithm, with the inclusion of a\nscale-free (Barab\\'asi-Albert) topology information in order to guide the\nsearch process to improve inference. The proposed algorithm explores the\nscale-free property by pruning the search space and using a power law as a\nweight for reducing it. In this way, the search space traversed by the SFFS-BA\nmethod combines a breadth-first search when the number of combinations is small\n(<k> <= 2) with a depth-first search when the number of combinations becomes\nexplosive (<k> >= 3), being guided by the scale-free prior information.\nExperimental results show that the SFFS-BA provides a better inference\nsimilarities than SFS and SFFS, keeping the robustness of the SFS and SFFS\nmethods, thus presenting very good results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2011 17:04:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lopes", "Fabr\u00edcio Martins", ""], ["Martins-Jr", "David C.", ""], ["Barrera", "Junior", ""], ["Cesar-Jr", "Roberto M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5816", "submitter": "Christian Schneider", "authors": "Christian M.
