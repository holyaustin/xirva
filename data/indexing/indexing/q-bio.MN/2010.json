More importantly, we\nshow that a steady temperature gradient may steer an open isomerisation network\ninto a non-equilibrium steady state where furanose is boosted beyond the limits\nset by equilibrium thermodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium\nselection of furanose is maximum at optimal dissipation, as gauged by the\ntemperature gradient and energy barriers for isomerisation. The predicted\noptimum is compatible with temperature drops found in hydrothermal vents\nassociated with extremely fresh lava flows on the seafloor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2020 18:58:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 30 Jan 2021 09:50:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dass", "Avinash Vicholous", ""], ["Georgelin", "Thomas", ""], ["Westall", "Frances", ""], ["Foucher", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""], ["Rios", "Paolo De Los", ""], ["Busiello", "Daniel Maria", ""], ["Liang", "Shiling", ""], ["Piazza", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.13290", "submitter": "David Anderson", "authors": "David F.

We develop a general mathematical framework and prove that the\nordinary differential equations (ODEs) associated with certain reaction network\nimplementations of neural networks have desirable properties including (i)\nexistence of unique positive fixed points that are smooth in the parameters of\nthe model (necessary for gradient descent), and (ii) fast convergence to the\nfixed point regardless of initial condition (necessary for efficient\nimplementation). We do so by first making a connection between neural networks\nand fixed points for systems of ODEs, and then by constructing reaction\nnetworks with the correct associated set of ODEs. We demonstrate the theory by\nconstructing a reaction network that implements a neural network with a\nsmoothed ReLU activation function, though we also demonstrate how to generalize\nthe construction to allow for other activation functions (each with the\ndesirable properties listed previously). As there are multiple types of\n\"networks\" utilized in this paper, we also give a careful introduction to both\nreaction networks and neural networks, in order to disambiguate the overlapping\nvocabulary in the two settings and to clearly highlight the role of each\nnetwork's properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 02:37:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 18:05:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2021 01:17:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Anderson", "David F.", ""], ["Joshi", "Badal", ""], ["Deshpande", "Abhishek", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16020", "submitter": "Nahuel Zamponi", "authors": "Nahuel Zamponi, Emiliano Zamponi, Sergio A Cannas, Dante R Chialvo", "title": "Universal dynamics of mitochondrial networks: a finite-size scaling\n  analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A growing body of evidence suggests that the structure of mitochondrial\nnetworks is poised near criticality, an intermediate regime lying in between\norder and disorder. Such description fits well with the idea that biological\nsystems, in general, may benefit from the long-range correlations and large\nflexibility conferred by a critical regime. Despite the attractiveness of this\nproposal, a clear understanding of the possible scenarios leading these\nnetworks to criticality is still lacking. In this work, we compared the\nbehavior of mitochondrial networks emerging from a dimensionless agent-based\n(AB) model and a spatially explicit (SE) model, in which nodes are embedded on\na 2D lattice. In both scenarios, we described the position of the control\nparameter at which mitochondrial networks exhibit a dynamical phase transition\nas well as the size-dependency of several network features. Furthermore, we\nshowed that the mitochondrial networks from mouse embryonic fibroblasts\npresented similar topologies to the ones generated using the AB model, while\ntheir universal behavior is better described by a SE model. Using finite-size\nscaling analysis conducted on models and empirical data we defined the\nuniversality classes they belong and provided the theoretical boundaries for\nthe mechanisms governing mitochondrial network formation. Our findings predict\nthe full repertoire of dynamical behavior expected for real mitochondrial\nnetworks under physiological and pathological conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 02:03:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zamponi", "Nahuel", ""], ["Zamponi", "Emiliano", ""], ["Cannas", "Sergio A", ""], ["Chialvo", "Dante R", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16366", "submitter": "Amirhossein Farzam", "authors": "Marzieh Eidi, Amirhossein Farzam, Wilmer Leal, Areejit Samal, J\\\"urgen\n  Jost", "title": "Edge-based analysis of networks: Curvatures of graphs and hypergraphs", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Theory Biosci. 139, 337-348 (2020)", "doi": "10.1007/s12064-020-00328-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM math.MG q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The relations, rather than the elements, constitute the structure of\nnetworks.
