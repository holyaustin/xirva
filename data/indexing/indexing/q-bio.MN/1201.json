In this regard, contemporary genomes\ncan be used as molecular records that reveal associations of various genes\nworking in their natural lifestyles. By analyzing thousands of orthologs across\n~600 bacterial species, we constructed a map of gene-gene co-occurrence across\nmuch of the sequenced biome. If genes preferentially co-occur in the same\norganisms, they were called herein correlogs; in the opposite case, called\nanti-correlogs. To quantify correlogy and anti-correlogy, we alleviated the\ncontribution of indirect correlations between genes by adapting ideas developed\nfor reverse engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks. Resultant\ncorrelogous associations are highly enriched for physically interacting\nproteins and for co-expressed transcripts, clearly differentiating a subgroup\nof functionally-obligatory protein interactions from conditional or transient\ninteractions. Other biochemical and phylogenetic properties were also found to\nbe reflected in correlogous and anti-correlogous relationships. Additionally,\nour study elucidates the global organization of the gene association map, in\nwhich various modules of correlogous genes are strikingly interconnected by\nanti-correlogous crosstalk between the modules. We then demonstrate the\neffectiveness of such associations along different domains of life and\nenvironmental microbial communities.

In the\ntransition region we observed a mixed behavior (random-like and exponential) of\nthe degree distribution as opposed to the scale-free behavior reported for\nother biological networks. Randomness and low connectivity in the active sites\nallow for rapid changes in the connectivity distribution of the immune network\nin order to include and/or discard information and generate a dynamic memory.\nHowever it is the availability of the low concentration nodes to change rapidly\nwithout driving the system to pathological states that allow the generation of\ndynamic memory and consequently a reproduction of immune system behavior in\nmice. Although the overall behavior of degree correlation is positive, there is\nan interplay between assortative and disassortative mixing in the stable and\ntransition regions regulated by a threshold value of the node degree, which\nachieves a maximum value on the transition region and becomes totally\nassortative in the chaotic regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 16:18:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Souza-e-Silva", "Hallan", ""], ["Santos", "Rita Maria Zorzenon dos", ""]]}]
