We find that the inclusion of feedback from MN into GRN\nsignificantly affects its causal structure, in particular the number of levels\nand relative positions of nodes in the hierarchy, and the number and size of\nthe strongly connected components (SCCs).

Besides transcriptional regulation, we also take into account\nregulation of translation, enzyme activities and reactions. Our network model\nprovides novel topological characterizations of system components based on\ntheir positions in the network. We show that network characteristics suggest a\nrepresentation of the integrated system as three network domains (regulatory,\nmetabolic and interface networks) instead of two. This new three-domain\nrepresentation reveals the structural centrality of components with known high\nfunctional relevance.

Meanwhile, synthetic biologists have\ndesigned Turing systems for implementation in cell colonies, but none have yet\nled to visible patterns in the laboratory. In both cases, the relationship\nbetween underlying chemistry and emergent biology remains mysterious. To help\nresolve the mystery, this article asks the question: what kinds of biochemical\nsystems can generate Turing patterns? We find general conditions for Turing\npattern inception -- the ability to generate unstable patterns from random\nnoise -- which may lead to the ultimate formation of stable patterns, depending\non biochemical non-linearities. We find that a wide variety of systems can\ngenerate stable Turing patterns, including several which are currently unknown,\nsuch as two-species systems composed of two self-activators, and systems\ncomposed of a short-range inhibitor and a long-range activator. We furthermore\nfind that systems which are widely believed to generate stable patterns may in\nfact only generate unstable patterns, which ultimately converge to\nspatially-homogeneous concentrations.

It is designed to (i) accelerate\nthe automated exploration of such networks, and (ii) cope with model-inherent\nerrors in electronic structure calculations on elementary reaction steps. We\ndeveloped and implemented KiNetX to possess three features. First, KiNetX\nevaluates the kinetic relevance of every species in a (yet incomplete) reaction\nnetwork to confine the search for new elementary reaction steps only to those\nspecies that are considered possibly relevant. Second, KiNetX identifies and\neliminates all kinetically irrelevant species and elementary reactions to\nreduce a complex network graph to a comprehensible mechanism. Third, KiNetX\nestimates the sensitivity of species concentrations toward changes in\nindividual rate constants (derived from relative free energies), which allows\nus to systematically select the most efficient electronic structure model for\neach elementary reaction given a predefined accuracy. The novelty of KiNetX\nconsists in the rigorous propagation of correlated free-energy uncertainty\nthrough all steps of our kinetic analyis. To examine the performance of KiNetX,\nwe developed AutoNetGen. It semirandomly generates chemistry-mimicking reaction\nnetworks by encoding chemical logic into their underlying graph structure.\nAutoNetGen allows us to consider a vast number of distinct chemistry-like\nscenarios and, hence, to discuss assess the importance of rigorous uncertainty\npropagation in a statistical context.
