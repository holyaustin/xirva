In practice,\nthe common challenge is to calibrate a large number of model parameters against\nthe experimental data. A related problem is to efficiently study how the\nbehaviour of a stochastic model depends on its parameters, i.e. whether a\nchange in model parameters can lead to a significant qualitative change in\nmodel behaviour (bifurcation). In this paper, tensor-structured parametric\nanalysis (TPA) is presented. It is based on recently proposed low-parametric\ntensor-structured representations of classical matrices and vectors. This\napproach enables simultaneous computation of the model properties for all\nparameter values within a parameter space. This methodology is exemplified to\nstudy the parameter estimation, robustness, sensitivity and bifurcation\nstructure in stochastic models of biochemical networks. The TPA has been\nimplemented in Matlab and the codes are available at http://www.stobifan.org .\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 17:35:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Mar 2015 23:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Liao", "Shuohao", ""], ["Vejchodsky", "Tomas", ""], ["Erban", "Radek", ""]]}]
