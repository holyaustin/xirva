Mathematical modeling\nis used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more\nprecisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to\npredict the effect of perturbations.\n  We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The\nalgorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative\nmodeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean\nstate space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify\nthe transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that\ncan be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition\nrates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the\ntransition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set\nof ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it\ncan be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.\n  We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system\nby applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state\nspace. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution\nof probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions.\nApplications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two\nqualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model.

Second, Jerarca builds dendrograms\nbased on those distances, using well-known phylogenetic algorithms, such as\nUPGMA or Neighbor-Joining. Finally, Jerarca provides optimal partitions of the\ntrees using statistical criteria based on the distribution of intra- and\nintercluster connections.

By extending the notion of gradient flows to the network setting,\ncritical nodes of different indices are defined. This leads to a concise and\nhierarchical representation of the network. Persistent homology from\ncomputational topology is used to design efficient algorithms for performing\nsuch analysis. Applications to some examples in social and biological networks\nare demonstrated, which show that critical nodes carry important information\nabout structures and dynamics of such networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2012 07:11:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Weinan", "E.", ""], ["Lu", "Jianfeng", ""], ["Yao", "Yuan", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6389", "submitter": "Peter Csermely", "authors": "Merse E.

We start from a short description of\nstructural rigidity theory. A detailed account on the combinatorial rigidity\nanalysis of protein structures, as well as local flexibility measures of\nproteins and their applications in explaining allostery and thermostability is\ngiven. We also briefly discuss the network aspects of cytoskeletal tensegrity.\nFinally, we show the importance of the balance between functional flexibility\nand rigidity in protein-protein interaction, metabolic, gene regulatory and\nneuronal networks. Our summary raises the possibility that the concepts of\nflexibility and rigidity can be generalized to all networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2012 09:30:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Dec 2012 14:54:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gaspar", "Merse E.", ""], ["Csermely", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6538", "submitter": "Dimitris Anastassiou", "authors": "Wei-Yi Cheng and Dimitris Anastassiou", "title": "Biomolecular events in cancer revealed by attractor metagenes", "comments": "22 pages, 1 figure, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002920", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mining gene expression profiles has proven valuable for identifying\nmetagenes, defined as linear combinations of individual genes, serving as\nsurrogates of biological phenotypes. Typically, such metagenes are jointly\ngenerated as the result of an optimization process for dimensionality\nreduction. Here we present an unconstrained method for individually generating\nmetagenes that can point to the core of the underlying biological mechanisms.\nWe use an iterative process that starts from any seed gene and converges to one\nof several precise attractor metagenes representing biomolecular events, such\nas cell transdifferentiation or the presence of an amplicon. By analyzing six\nrich gene expression datasets from three different cancer types, we identified\nmany such biomolecular events, some of which are present in all tested cancer\ntypes. We focus on several such events including a stage-associated mesenchymal\ntransition and a grade-associated mitotic chromosomal instability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 02:49:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Wei-Yi", ""], ["Anastassiou", "Dimitris", ""]]}]
