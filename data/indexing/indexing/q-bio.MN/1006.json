The question of the number of\npossible oscillations and the coherent quality of these oscillations remain\nunanswered. This paper proves the upper-bounds on the number and quality of\nsuch oscillations when the system in question is homogeneously driven and has a\ndiscrete network of states. In a closed system, the maximum number of\noscillations is bounded by the number of states in the network. In open\nsystems, the size of the network bounds the quality factor of oscillation. This\nwork also explores how the quality factor of macrostate oscillations, such as\nwould be observed in chemical reactions, are bounded by the smallest equivalent\nloop of the network, not the size of the entire system. The consequences of\nthis limit are explored in the context of chemical clocks and limit cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 00:34:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2010 18:24:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 23 Feb 2011 00:08:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2011 15:52:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hodas", "Nathan O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0727", "submitter": "Giovanni Paternostro", "authors": "Jacob D.

Here, we study\nthe global and local structure of complex fitness landscapes of interacting\nloci that describe protein folds or sets of interacting genes forming pathways\nor modules. We find that in these landscapes, high peaks are more likely to be\nfound near other high peaks, corroborating Kauffman's \"Massif Central\"\nhypothesis. We study the clusters of peaks as a function of the ruggedness of\nthe landscape and find that this clustering allows peaks to form interconnected\nnetworks. These networks undergo a percolation phase transition as a function\nof minimum peak height, which indicates that evolutionary trajectories that\ntake no more than two mutations to shift from peak to peak can span the entire\ngenetic space.
