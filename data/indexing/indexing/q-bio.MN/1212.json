The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural\nselection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,\noccasionally, the gain of a novel one. Alternately, a pleiotropic gene might\npartition its functions among its duplicates, thus preserving both copies.\nDuplicate genes is not a novelty for diploid genotypes, but only for\nhaplotypes. In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions\nin diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives\nrise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a\npopulation. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory\nactivator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a\ndiploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their\ntranscriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or\nto its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are\nintroduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it\nis shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that\nemerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is\ndeleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The\ndiploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific\nexpression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network\nenables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.\nThis is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,\nwhereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single\ncells. The evolutionary model shows that these phenotypic states accessible to\na diploid, heterozygous genotype enable the spread of a duplicated haplotype.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 17:23:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dasmahapatra", "Srinandan", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.1117", "submitter": "Alexander Stewart", "authors": "Alexander J.

Theoretical work and empirical\ninvestigation in Escherichia coli have shown that negative autoregulation\nconfers both rapid response times and reduced intrinsic noise, which is\nreflected in the fact that almost half of Escherichia coli transcription\nfactors are negatively autoregulated. However, negative autoregulation is\nexceedingly rare amongst the transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nThis difference is all the more surprising because E. coli and S. cerevisiae\notherwise have remarkably similar profiles of network motifs. In this study we\nfirst show that regulatory interactions amongst the transcription factors of\nDrosophila melanogaster and humans have a similar dearth of negative\nautoregulation to that seen in S. cerevisiae. We then present a model\ndemonstrating that this fundamental difference in the noise reduction\nstrategies used amongst species can be explained by constraints on the\nevolution of negative autoregulation in diploids. We show that regulatory\ninteractions between pairs of homologous genes within the same cell can lead to\nunder-dominance - mutations which result in stronger autoregulation, and\ndecrease noise in homozygotes, paradoxically can cause increased noise in\nheterozygotes. This severely limits a diploid's ability to evolve negative\nautoregulation as a noise reduction mechanism. Our work offers a simple and\ngeneral explanation for a previously unexplained difference between the\nregulatory architectures of E. coli and yeast, Drosophila and humans.

As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been\nproposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known\nphenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and\nelegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and\ncoworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with\nother networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has\nto be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a\nspatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to\npreserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we\nnumerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded\nperturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss\ndepends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the\nkind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an\nincrease of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of\npolarization. However, if the noise is spatially homogeneous then the\npolarization is lost in the majority of cases. On the contrary, an increase of\nthe temporal autocorrelation of the noise induces an effect that depends on the\nnoise model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2012 11:57:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["de Franciscis", "Sebastiano", ""], ["d'Onofrio", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.5010", "submitter": "Tomas Tokar", "authors": "Tomas Tokar, Zdenko Turcan, Jozef Ulicny", "title": "Boolean network-based model of the Bcl-2 family mediated MOMP regulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is one of the most\nimportant points, in majority of apoptotic signaling cascades.
