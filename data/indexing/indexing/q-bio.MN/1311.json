Even though careful biochemical experimentation has revealed the\nmolecular mechanisms of transcription initiation for a number of different\npromoters in vitro, the dynamics of this process in cells is still poorly\nunderstood. One approach has been to measure the transcriptional output\n(fluorescently labeled messenger RNAs or proteins) from single cells in a\ngenetically identical population, which could then be compared to predictions\nfrom models that incorporate different molecular mechanisms of transcription\ninitiation. However, this approach suffers from the problem, that processes\ndownstream from transcription can affect the measured output and therefore mask\nthe signature of stochastic transcription initiation on the cell-to-cell\nvariability of the transcriptional outputs. Here we show theoretically that\nmeasurements of the cell-to-cell variability in the number of nascent RNAs\nprovide a more direct test of the mechanism of transcription initiation. We\nderive exact expressions for the first two moments of the distribution of\nnascent RNA molecules and apply our theory to published data for a collection\nof constitutively expressed yeast genes. We find that the measured nascent RNA\ndistributions are inconsistent with transcription initiation proceeding via one\nrate-limiting step, which has been generally inferred from measurements of\ncytoplasmic messenger RNA. Instead, we propose a two-step mechanism of\ninitiation, which is consistent with the available data. These findings for the\nyeast promoters highlight the utility of our theory for deciphering\ntranscriptional dynamics in vivo from experiments that count nascent RNA\nmolecules in single cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 22:15:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Jan 2014 11:37:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Choubey", "Sandeep", ""], ["Kondev", "Jane", ""], ["Sanchez", "Alvaro", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0521", "submitter": "Vladimir Privman", "authors": "Kevin MacVittie, Jan Halamek, Vladimir Privman, Evgeny Katz", "title": "Bioinspired Associative Memory System Based on Enzymatic Cascades", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Chem.

By\nanalysing published data on human follicular growth and granulosa cell\nexpansion during follicular maturation we find that the 4-fold increase of the\nantral follicle diameter is entirely driven by an increase in the follicular\nfluid volume, while the thickness of the surrounding granulosa layer remains\nconstant at about 45+/-10 mkm.

The model further shows that as a result of\nsequestration, an increased granulosa thickness cannot substantially increase\nestradiol production but rather deprives the oocyte from gonadotropins. Larger\nanimals (with a larger blood volume) require more estradiol as produced by the\novaries to downregulate FSH-secretion in the pituitary. Larger follicle\ndiameters result in larger follicle surface areas for constant granulosa layer\nthickness.

Here, a substrate is reversibly modified by two\nantagonistic enzymes (a \"push-pull\" system) and the fraction in modified state\nundergoes a sharp switching from near-zero to near-unity at a critical value of\nthe ratio of the enzyme concentrations, under saturation conditions. ZOU and\nits extensions have been studied for several decades now, ever since the\nseminal paper of Goldbeter and Koshland (1981); however, a complete\nprobabilistic treatment, important for the study of fluctuations in finite\npopulations, is still lacking. In this paper, we study ZOU using a modular\napproach, akin to the total quasi-steady state approximation (tQSSA). This\napproach leads to a set of Fokker-Planck (drift-diffusion) equations for the\nprobability distributions of the intermediate enzyme-bound complexes, as well\nas the modified/unmodified fractions of substrate molecules. We obtain explicit\nexpressions for various average fractions and their fluctuations in the linear\nnoise approximation (LNA). The emergence of a \"critical point\" for the\nswitching transition is rigorously established. New analytical results are\nderived for the average and variance of the fractional substrate concentration\nin various chemical states in the near-critical regime. For the total fraction\nin the modified state, the variance is shown to be a maximum near the critical\npoint and decays algebraically away from it, similar to a second-order phase\ntransition. The new analytical results are compared with existing ones as well\nas detailed numerical simulations using a Gillespie algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2013 04:38:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Jithinraj", "P.

However, the analysis of\nlarge networks is not trivial. In order to simplify the analysis of such\nnetworks, several model reduction algorithms have been proposed; however, it is\nnot clear if such algorithms scale well with respect to the number of nodes.\nThe goal of this paper is to propose and implement an algorithm for the\nreduction of AND-NOT network models for the purpose of steady state\ncomputation. Our method of network reduction is the use of \"steady state\napproximations\" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm\nis designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or\nsimplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes\nadvantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The\nmain features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level,\nit runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We\nused our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed\nthat our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis. Furthermore, our\nalgorithm can handle sparse AND-NOT networks with up to 1000000 nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2013 05:00:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Veliz-Cuba", "Alan", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""], ["Aguilar", "Boris", ""]]}]
