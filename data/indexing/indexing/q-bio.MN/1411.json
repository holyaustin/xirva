Furthermore, between\ntwo random mutant alleles of the same gene, the chance for the allele with more\nsevere mutational consequence to develop a higher percentage of negative\nepistasis than the other allele is 50-70% in eukaryotic organisms, but only\n20-30% in bacteria and archaea. We developed a population genetics model that\npredicts that the observed distribution for the sign of epistasis can speed up\nthe process of purging deleterious mutations in eukaryotic organisms. Our\nresults indicate that epistasis among genes can be dynamically rewired at the\ngenome level, and call on future efforts to revisit theories that can integrate\nepistatic dynamics among genes in biological systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 02:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Lin", ""], ["Barker", "Brandon", ""], ["Gu", "Zhenglong", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.6341", "submitter": "Brandon Barker", "authors": "Brandon Barker, Lin Xu, Zhenglong Gu", "title": "Dynamic Epistasis under Varying Environmental Perturbations", "comments": "22 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 10(1): e0114911", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0114911", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Epistasis describes the phenomenon that mutations at different loci do not\nhave independent effects with regard to certain phenotypes. Understanding the\nglobal epistatic landscape is vital for many genetic and evolutionary theories.\nCurrent knowledge for epistatic dynamics under multiple conditions is limited\nby the technological difficulties in experimentally screening epistatic\nrelations among genes. We explored this issue by applying flux balance analysis\nto simulate epistatic landscapes under various environmental perturbations.\nSpecifically, we looked at gene-gene epistatic interactions, where the\nmutations were assumed to occur in different genes. We predicted that epistasis\ntends to become more positive from glucose-abundant to nutrient-limiting\nconditions, indicating that selection might be less effective in removing\ndeleterious mutations in the latter. We also observed a stable core of\nepistatic interactions in all tested conditions, as well as many epistatic\ninteractions unique to each condition. Interestingly, genes in the stable\nepistatic interaction network are directly linked to most other genes whereas\ngenes with condition-specific epistasis form a scale-free network. Furthermore,\ngenes with stable epistasis tend to have similar evolutionary rates, whereas\nthis co-evolving relationship does not hold for genes with condition-specific\nepistasis. Our findings provide a novel genome-wide picture about epistatic\ndynamics under environmental perturbations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 03:36:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Barker", "Brandon", ""], ["Xu", "Lin", ""], ["Gu", "Zhenglong", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.6772", "submitter": "Erwan Bigan", "authors": "Erwan Bigan, St\\'ephane Douady and Jean-Marc Steyaert", "title": "On necessary and sufficient conditions for proto-cell stationary growth", "comments": "Fifth International Workshop on Static Analysis and Systems Biology\n  (SASB 2014), Munich, Sept 10, 2014.
