ND views protein folding as a\npartial ordering of contacts in a native-state Protein Residue Network (PRN0).\nThe ND process recreates a PRN0 while keeping nodes fixed at PDB positions. ND\napplies two fundamental folding principles: loop-entropy and hydrophobic (and\nother key folding) interactions, via two model parameters which control the\nprobability of edge creation and the probability of node selection. Correlation\nbetween experimental folding rates and ND simulated folding rates is strongest\nwhen the probability of edge creation is higher for contacts with smaller\nsequence separation, and when the probability of node selection is higher for\nnodes with larger remaining degree within a local neighborhood.

A numerical approach has been developed to invert\nsubordination processes and to extract the directing processes from the\nmolecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurrence of events.\n  Conclusions: We observed large fluctuations enclose information hidden in the\nnoise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines. Studying\nthe system under different parametric conditions and stimuli, the results have\nshown that the waiting time distributions of each molecule are a signature of\nthe system's dynamics. The behaviours of the molecular waiting times change\nwith the changing of parameters presenting the same variation of patterns for\nsimilar interacting molecules and identifying specific alterations for key\nmolecules in the mechanotransduction pathway.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Feb 2019 00:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ascolani", "Gianluca", ""], ["Skerry", "Timothy M.", ""], ["Lacroix", "Damien", ""], ["Dall'Ara", "Enrico", ""], ["Shuaib", "Aban", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09059", "submitter": "Jiawei Yin", "authors": "Jiawei Yin, Agung Julius, John T.

Here, we present a theory for the optimal design of\na large class of sensing systems that need to detect time-varying signals, a\nreceptor driving a push-pull network. The theory is based on the concept of the\ndynamic input-output relation, which describes the mapping between the current\nligand concentration and the average receptor occupancy over the past\nintegration time. This concept is used to develop the idea that the cell\nemploys its push-pull network to estimate the receptor occupancy and then uses\nthis estimate to infer the current ligand concentration by inverting the\ndynamic input-output relation. The theory reveals that the sensing error can be\ndecomposed into two terms: the sampling error in the estimate of the receptor\noccupancy and the dynamical error that arises because the average ligand\nconcentration over the past integration time may not reflect the current ligand\nconcentration. The theory generalizes the design principle of optimal resource\nallocation previously identified for static signals, which states that in an\noptimally designed sensing system the three fundamental resource classes of\nreceptors and their integration time, readout molecules, and energy are equally\nlimiting so that no resource is wasted. However, in contrast to static signals,\nreceptors and power cannot be traded freely against time to reach a desired\nsensing precision: there exists an optimal integration time that maximizes the\nsensing precision, which depends on the number of receptors, the receptor\ncorrelation time, and the correlation time and variance of the input signal.\nApplying our theory to the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli indicates that\nthis bacterium has evolved to optimally sense shallow gradients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2019 15:03:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Malaguti", "G.", ""], ["Wolde", "P.

Moreover,\nthe CSC progeny possesses multiple plasticity and cancerous characteristics.\nMany studies have demonstrated that cancer heterogeneity is one of the greatest\nobstacle for therapy.

Furthermore, numerous micro-metastasis leads to the wide\nspread of the tumor cells across the body which is the beginning of metastasis.\nThe epigenetic processes (DNA methylation or histone remodification etc.) can\nprovide a source for certain heterogeneity. In this study, we develop a\nmathematical model to quantify the heterogeneity of SC, CSC and cancer taking\nboth genetic and epigenetic effects into consideration. We uncovered the roles\nand physical mechanisms of heterogeneity from the three aspects (SC, CSC and\ncancer). In the adiabatic regime (relatively fast regulatory binding and\neffective coupling among genes), seven native states (SC, CSC, Cancer,\nPremalignant, Normal, Lesion and Hyperplasia) emerge. In non-adiabatic regime\n(relatively slow regulatory binding and effective weak coupling among genes),\nmultiple meta-stable SC, CS, CSC and differentiated states emerged which can\nexplain the origin of heterogeneity. In other words, the slow regulatory\nbinding mimicking the epigenetics can give rise to heterogeneity.
