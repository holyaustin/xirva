The analysis\nof SSNs may reveal biologically meaningful knowledge. For these aims, the need\nfor the introduction of tool able to manage and analyze SSN arises.\nConsequently we developed SSN-Analyzer a web based tool able to build and\npreprocess SSN. As proof of concept we demonstrate that community detection\nalgorithms applied to filtered (thresholded) networks, have better performances\nin terms of biological relevance of the results, with respect to the use of raw\nunfiltered networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Dec 2014 13:18:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Cannataro", "Mario", ""], ["Guzzi", "Pietro Hiram", ""], ["Milano", "Marianna", ""], ["Veltri", "Pierangelo", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.7767", "submitter": "Thibaud Taillefumier", "authors": "Thibaud Taillefumier and Ned S.

To measure their cell density, bacterial populations produce and\ndetect diffusible molecules called autoinducers. Individual bacteria internally\nrepresent the external concentration of autoinducers via the level of monitor\nproteins. In turn, these monitor proteins typically regulate both their own\nproduction and the production of autoinducers, thereby establishing internal\nand external feedbacks. Here, we ask whether feedbacks can increase the\ninformation available to cells about their local density. We quantify available\ninformation as the mutual information between the abundance of a monitor\nprotein and the local cell density for biologically relevant models of quorum\nsensing. Using variational methods, we demonstrate that feedbacks can increase\ninformation transmission, allowing bacteria to resolve up to two additional\nranges of cell density when compared with bistable quorum-sensing systems. Our\nanalysis is relevant to multi-agent systems that track an external driver\nimplicitly via an endogenously generated signal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 22:34:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 15:39:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Taillefumier", "Thibaud", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8065", "submitter": "John Barton", "authors": "John P.

One or more genes randomly switch between regulatory states, each\nhaving a different mRNA transcription rate. The gene or genes are self\nregulating when the proteins they produce affect the rate of switching between\nregulatory states. Under weak noise conditions, the deterministic forces are\nmuch stronger than fluctuations from gene switching and protein synthesis.\nMetastable transitions, such as bistable switching, can occur under weak noise\nconditions, causing dramatic shifts in the expression of a gene. A general tool\nused to describe metastability is the quasi stationary analysis (QSA). A large\ndeviation principle is derived so that the QSA can explicitly account for\nrandom gene switching without using an adiabatic limit or diffusion\napproximation, which are unreliable and inaccurate for metastable events.This\nallows the existing asymptotic and numerical methods that have been developed\nfor continuous Markov processes to be used to analyze the full model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 20:18:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Newby", "Jay", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8634", "submitter": "Niraj Kumar", "authors": "Niraj Kumar, Abhyudai Singh, and Rahul V.
