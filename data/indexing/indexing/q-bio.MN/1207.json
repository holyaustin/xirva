This\nrenders metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system, and suggests the\norder in which layers of that system emerged. Metabolism also serves as the\nfoundation in other hierarchies, at least up to cellular integration including\nbioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The\nrecapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels,\nsuggests metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of\norganization in the biosphere.\n  We identify as modules widely reused subsets of chemicals, reactions, or\nfunctions, each with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule\nsubstrate level, module boundaries are generally associated with the most\ncomplex reaction mechanisms and the most conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a\nstructurally and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule\nsubstrate. Complex cofactors are often used at module boundaries of the\nsubstrate level, while simpler ones participate in widely used reactions.\nCofactor functions thus act as \"keys\" that incorporate classes of organic\nreactions within biochemistry.\n  The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are\nargued to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core\nmetabolism, especially carbon-fixation, appears to have required few\ninnovations among a small number of conserved modules, to produce adaptations\nto simple biogeochemical changes of environment. We demonstrate these features\nof metabolism at several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule\nsubstrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved\nreactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and\nbiochemical processes in cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 20:58:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 22:40:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Braakman", "Rogier", ""], ["Smith", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6018", "submitter": "Badal Joshi", "authors": "Badal Joshi", "title": "Complete characterization by multistationarity of fully open networks\n  with one non-flow reaction", "comments": "27 pages, 0 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article characterizes certain small multistationary chemical reaction\nnetworks.

One such feature is that of binary gene expression in which the\nexpression level is either low or high, i.e., digital in nature.

The fraction of cells in the high expression state is raised as the\nstrength of the inducing signal is increased indicating that the response is\nnot graded. In this review, we discuss the possible origins of binary gene\nexpression with emphasis on three principal mechanisms: purely stochastic,\npositive feedback-based and emergent bistability. In the latter case, two\nstable expression states are obtained due to an autoregulatory positive\nfeedback loop in protein synthesis along with cell growth retardation by the\nproteins synthesized.
