Although the human milk microbiome has received\nincreasing attention with the expansion of research on the human microbiome,\nour understanding of the milk microbiome has been limited to cataloguing OTUs\nand computation of community diversity indexes. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk\nmicrobiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community\nnetwork with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA\nsequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis\nrevealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected\nsub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of\nseven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria\nare facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other\nsub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are\nmutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include\nsome opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between\nStaphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes\nwho cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the\n'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk\nmicrobiome should have important health implications to lactating women and\ntheir infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be\nresponsible for dysbiosis of the milk microbiome that permits mastitis. A\nrelated study focusing on ecological analysis was reported at\n(http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-09/scp-ahb090214.php).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 17:05:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ma", "Zhanshan", ""], ["Guan", "Qiong", ""], ["Ye", "Chengxi", ""], ["Zhang", "Chengchen", ""], ["Foster", "James A.", ""], ["Forney", "Larry J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.1085", "submitter": "Arash Einolghozati", "authors": "Arash Einolghozati, Mohsen Sardari, Faramarz Fekri", "title": "Design and Analysis of Wireless Communication Systems Using\n  Diffusion-Based Molecular Communication Among Bacteria", "comments": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless communication Vol. 12, 2013. arXiv\n  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1209.2688", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TWC.2013.101813.121884", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.ET math.IT q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The design of biologically-inspired wireless communication systems using\nbacteria as the basic element of the system is initially motivated by a\nphenomenon called \\emph{Quorum Sensing}.

Recently, we studied molecular communication between two nodes\nformed from synthetic bacteria. Due to high randomness in behavior of bacteria,\nwe used a population of them in each node. The reliability of such\ncommunication systems depends on both the maximum concentration of molecules\nthat a transmitter node is able to produce at the receiver node as well as the\nnumber of bacteria in each nodes. This maximum concentration of molecules falls\nwith distance which makes the communication to the far nodes nearly impossible.\nIn order to alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose to use a\nmolecular relaying node. The relay node can resend the message either by the\ndifferent or the same type of molecules as the original signal from the\ntransmitter. We study two scenarios of relaying. In the first scenario, the\nrelay node simply senses the received concentration and forwards it to the\nreceiver. We show that this sense and forward scenario, depending on the type\nof molecules used for relaying, results in either increasing the range of\nconcentration of molecules at the receiver or increasing the effective number\nof bacteria in the receiver node. For both cases of sense and forward relaying,\nwe obtain the resulting improvement in channel capacity. We conclude that\nmulti-type molecular relaying outperforms the single-type relaying. In the\nsecond scenario, we study the decode and forward relaying for the M-ary\nsignaling scheme.

Only after an alignment is constructed,\nthe existing methods evaluate its quality with respect to an alternative\nmeasure, such as \"edge conservation\". Thus, we recently aimed to directly\noptimize edge conservation while constructing an alignment, which improved\nalignment quality. Here, we approach a novel idea of maximizing both node and\nedge conservation, and we also approach this idea from a novel perspective, by\naligning optimally edges between networks first in order to improve node cost\nfunction needed to then align well nodes between the networks. In the process,\nunlike the existing measures of edge conservation that treat each conserved\nedge the same, we favor conserved edges that are topologically similar over\nconserved edges that are topologically dissimilar. We show that our novel\nmethod, which we call GRaphlet Edge AlignmenT (GREAT), improves upon\nstate-of-the-art methods that aim to optimize node conservation only or edge\nconservation only.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Oct 2014 19:03:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Crawford", "Joseph", ""], ["Milenkovi\u0107", "Tijana", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.5324", "submitter": "Angelo Valleriani", "authors": "Celine Sin and Davide Chiarugi and Angelo Valleriani", "title": "Single-molecule modeling of mRNA degradation by miRNA: Lessons from data", "comments": "It contains also the Supplementary Materials as appendix A", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1186/1752-0509-9-S3-S2", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent experimental results on the effect of miRNA on the decay of its target\nmRNA have been analyzed against a previously hypothesized single molecule\ndegradation pathway.
