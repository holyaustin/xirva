Since gene expression is regulated by proteins such\nas transcription factors (TFs), the full set of proteins within the cell\nconstitutes a large system of interacting components. Here, we explore factors\naffecting the stability of this system by coupling the dynamics of mRNAs and\nprotein concentrations in a growing cell. We find that it is possible for\nprotein concentrations to become unstable if the regulation strengths or system\nsize becomes too large, and that other global structural features of the\nnetworks can dramatically enhance the stability of the system. In particular,\ngiven the same number of proteins, TFs, number of interactions, and regulation\nstrengths, a network that resembles a bipartite graph with a lower fraction of\ninteractions that target TFs has a higher chance of being stable. By scrambling\nthe $\\textit{E. coli.}$ transcription network, we find that the randomized\nnetwork with the same number of regulatory interactions is much more likely to\nbe unstable than the real network. These findings suggest that constraints\nimposed by system stability could have played a role in shaping the existing\nregulatory network during the evolutionary process. We also find that contrary\nto what one might expect from random matrix theory and what has been argued in\nthe literature, the degradation rate of mRNA does not affect whether the system\nis stable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 18:06:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2020 03:55:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Yipei", ""], ["Amir", "Ariel", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.00652", "submitter": "Areejit Samal", "authors": "R.P.

In this\npaper, we investigated the role of multivalent actin-binding proteins (ABPs) in\nreorganizing actin filaments into higher-order complex networks via a computer\nmodel of semiflexible filaments. We characterize the importance of local\nconnectivity among actin filaments as well as the global features of actomyosin\nnetworks. We first map the networks into local graph representations and then,\nusing principles from network-theory order parameters, combine properties from\nthese representations to gain insight on the heterogeneous morphologies of\nactomyosin networks at a global level. We find that ABPs with a valency greater\nthan two promote filament bundles and large filament clusters to a much greater\nextent than bivalent multilinkers. We also show that active myosin-like motor\nproteins promote the formation of dendritic branches from a stalk of actin\nbundles. Our work motivates future studies to embrace network theory as a tool\nto characterize complex morphologies of actomyosin detected by experiments,\nleading to a quantitative understanding of the role of ABPs in manipulating the\nself-assembly of actin filaments into unique architectures that underlie the\nstructural scaffold of a cell relating to its mobility and shape.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:20:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2020 01:35:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 19:22:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 20:52:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Eliaz", "Yossi", ""], ["Nedelec", "Francois", ""], ["Morrison", "Greg", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""], ["Cheung", "Margaret S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.06826", "submitter": "Ian Leifer", "authors": "Flaviano Morone, Ian Leifer, Hernan A.

In this\nrepresentation, we find remarkable symmetries in the input trees that\ndeconstruct the network into functional building blocks called fibers. Nodes in\na fiber have isomorphic input trees and thus process equivalent dynamics and\nsynchronize their activity. Each fiber can then be collapsed into a single\nrepresentative base node through an information-preserving transformation\ncalled 'symmetry fibration', introduced by Grothendieck in the context of\nalgebraic geometry. We exemplify the symmetry fibrations in gene regulatory\nnetworks and then show that they universally apply across species and domains\nfrom biology to social and infrastructure networks. The building blocks are\nclassified into topological classes of input trees characterized by integer\nbranching ratios and fractal golden ratios of Fibonacci sequences representing\ncycles of information.

These distributions are determined\nprimarily by the multitude of states of a gene promoter, each driving\ntranscription at a different rate. In an era where single-cell mRNA copy number\ndata are more and more available, there is an increasing need for fast\ncomputations of mRNA distributions. In this paper, we present a method for\ncomputing separate distributions for each species of mRNA molecules, i. e.\nmRNAs that have been either partially or fully processed post-transcription.\nThe method involves the integration over all possible realizations of promoter\nstates, which we cast into a set of linear ordinary differential equations of\ndimension $M\\times n_j$, where $M$ is the number of available promoter states\nand $n_j$ is the mRNA copy number of species $j$ up to which one wishes to\ncompute the probability distribution. This approach is superior to solving the\nMaster equation (ME) directly in two ways: a) the number of coupled\ndifferential equations in the ME approach is\n$M\\times\\Lambda_1\\times\\Lambda_2\\times ...\\times\\Lambda_L$, where $\\Lambda_j$\nis the cutoff for the probability of the $j^{\\text{th}}$ species of mRNA; and\nb) the ME must be solved up to the cutoffs $\\Lambda_j$, which are {\\it ad hoc}\nand must be selected {\\it a priori}. In our approach, the equation for the\nprobability to observe $n$ mRNAs of any species depends only on the the\nprobability of observing $n-1$ mRNAs of that species, thus yielding a correct\nprobability distribution up to an arbitrary $n$. To demonstrate the validity of\nour derivations, we compare our results with Gillespie simulations for ten\nrandomly selected system parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:39:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Albert", "Jaroslav", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.08735", "submitter": "Abhishek Deshpande", "authors": "Yida Ding, Abhishek Deshpande, Gheorghe Craciun", "title": "Minimal invariant regions and minimal globally attracting regions for\n  toric differential inclusions", "comments": "29 pages, 15 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Toric differential inclusions occur as key dynamical systems in the context\nof the Global Attractor Conjecture.
