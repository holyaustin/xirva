Their models\nfailed. However the valid Genetic Code, provided by Nirenberg and Matthaei in\n1961, ignores many theoretical requirements for a perfect Code. Something is\nsimply missing from the canonical Code.\n  Results The 3x redundancy of the Genetic code is usually explained as a\nnecessity to increase the resistance of the mutation resistance of the genetic\ninformation. However it has many additional roles. 1.) It has a periodical\nstructure which corresponds to the physico-chemical and structural properties\nof amino acids. 2.) It provides physico-chemical definition of codon\nboundaries. 3.) It defines a code for amino acid co-locations (interactions) in\nthe coded proteins. 4.) It regulates, through wobble bases the free folding\nenergy (and structure) of mRNAs. I shortly review the history of the Genetic\nCode as well as my own published observations to provide a novel, original\nexplanation of its redundancy.\n  Conclusions The redundant Genetic Code contains biological information which\nis additional to the 64/20 definition of amino acids. This additional\ninformation is used to define the 3D structure of coding nucleic acids as well\nas the coded proteins and it is called the Proteomic Code and mRNA Assisted\nProtein Folding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2008 00:06:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Biro", "Jan C", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0220", "submitter": "Ping Ao", "authors": "P.
