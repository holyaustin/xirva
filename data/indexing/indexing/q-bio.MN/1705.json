One may,\nfor example, be interested in exploring how often certain dynamical behaviours\noccur in small CRNs, or wish to find examples to illustrate some aspect of the\ntheory. In such cases, it is natural to examine one representative from each\nisomorphism class of CRNs. Inspired by the related project of Deckard et al\n(Enumeration and online library of mass-action reaction networks.\nhttp://arXiv.org/abs/0901.3067, 2009), this document outlines the methodology\ninvolved in listing all CRNs in various classes of interest including, for\nexample, general CRNs, dynamically nontrivial CRNs, weakly reversible CRNs,\nfully open CRNs, etc. The accompanying data (i.e., lists of nonisomorphic CRNs\nin the various classes) is at https://reaction-networks.net/networks/. Note\nthat both document and data are work in progress.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 11:02:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Banaji", "Murad", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.10913", "submitter": "Anne Shiu", "authors": "Carsten Conradi and Anne Shiu", "title": "Dynamics of post-translational modification systems: recent progress and\n  future directions", "comments": "13 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2017.11.3787", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins plays a key role in signal\ntransduction, and hence significant effort has gone toward understanding how\nPTM networks process information.

In this Perspective, we highlight\nrecent progress in this area and point out some important future directions.\nAlong the way, we summarize several techniques for analyzing general networks,\nsuch as eliminating variables to obtain steady-state parametrizations, and\nharnessing results on how incorporating intermediates affects dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 02:00:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Oct 2017 21:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Conradi", "Carsten", ""], ["Shiu", "Anne", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.10922", "submitter": "Sahil Shah", "authors": "Sahil D.

A key challenge is to analyze this data in\nthe context of the regulatory networks and pathways that control cellular\nprocesses, while still obtaining insights that can be used to design new\ndiagnostic and therapeutic interventions. While classical differential\nexpression analysis provides specific and hence targetable gene-level insights,\nit does not include any systems-level information. On the other hand, pathway\nanalyses integrate systems-level information with expression data, but are\noften limited in their ability to indicate specific molecular targets. We\nintroduce GeneSurrounder, an analysis method that takes into account the\ncomplex structure of interaction networks to identify specific genes that\ndisrupt pathway activity in a disease-specific manner. GeneSurrounder\nintegrates transcriptomic data and pathway network information in a novel\ntwo-step procedure to detect genes that (i) appear to influence the expression\nof other genes local to it in the network and (ii) are part of a subnetwork of\ndifferentially expressed genes. Combined, this evidence can be used to pinpoint\nspecific genes that have a mechanistic role in the phenotype of interest.\nApplying GeneSurrounder to three distinct ovarian cancer studies using a global\nKEGG network, we show that our method is able to identify biologically relevant\ngenes and genes missed by single-gene association tests, integrate pathway and\nexpression data, and yield more consistent results across multiple studies of\nthe same phenotype than competing methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 May 2017 02:40:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Jan 2019 23:08:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Shah", "Sahil D.", ""], ["Braun", "Rosemary", ""]]}]
