Signaling is typically a cooperative\nprocess which requires the occurrence of multiple binding events so that\nreaction rates have a nonlinear dependence on the amount of signaling molecule.\nIt is this nonlinearity that endows biological signaling networks with robust\nswitch-like properties which are critical to their biological function. In this\nstudy, we investigate how the properties of these signaling systems depend on\nthe network architecture. Our main result is that these nonlinear networks\nexhibit bistability where the network activity can switch between states that\ncorrespond to a low and high activity level. We show that this bistable regime\nemerges at a critical coupling strength that is determined by the spectral\nstructure of the network. In particular, the set of nodes that correspond to\nlarge components of the leading eigenvector of the adjacency matrix determines\nthe onset of bistability. Above this transition, the eigenvectors of the\nadjacency matrix determine a hierarchy of clusters, defined by its spectral\nproperties, which are activated sequentially with increasing network activity.\nWe argue further that the onset of bistability occurs either continuously or\ndiscontinuously depending upon whether the leading eigenvector is localized or\ndelocalized.
