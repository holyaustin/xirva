However, when\ndesigning experiments, it is important to be precise about the low-level\nmechanistic details as to how each such relation is implemented. The rule-based\nmodelling language Kappa allows to unambiguously specify mechanistic details\nsuch as DNA binding sites, dimerisation of transcription factors, or\nco-operative interactions. However, such a detailed description comes with\ncomplexity and computationally costly execution. We propose a general method\nfor automatically transforming a rule-based program, by eliminating\nintermediate species and adjusting the rate constants accordingly. Our method\nconsists of searching for those interaction patterns known to be amenable to\nequilibrium approximations (e.g. Michaelis-Menten scheme). The reduced model is\nefficiently obtained by static inspection over the rule-set, and it represents\na particular theoretical limit of the original model. The Bhattacharyya\ndistance is proposed as a metric to estimate the reduction error for a given\nobservable. The tool is tested on a detailed rule-based model of a\n$\\lambda$-phage switch, which lists $96$ rules and $16$ agents. The reduced\nmodel has $11$ rules and $5$ agents, and provides a dramatic reduction in\nsimulation time of several orders of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 17:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Beica", "Andreea", ""], ["Guet", "Calin", ""], ["Petrov", "Tatjana", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01282", "submitter": "Jack Peterson", "authors": "Jack Peterson, Steve Presse, Kristin S.

Nevertheless, the majority of available protein-protein\ninteraction networks are context-less, i.e. without any reference to the\nspatial, temporal or physiological conditions in which the interactions may\noccur. In this work, we are proposing a protocol to infer the most likely\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) network in human macrophages. Results: We\nintegrated the PPI dataset from the Agile Protein Interaction DataAnalyzer\n(APID) with different meta-data to infer a contextualized macrophage-specific\ninteractome using a combination of statistical methods. The obtained\ninteractome is enriched in experimentally verified interactions and in proteins\ninvolved in macrophage-related biological processes (i.e. immune response\nactivation, regulation of apoptosis).

Conclusion: Our work confirms that\ncontextualizing interactomes improves the biological significance of\nbioinformatic analyses.
