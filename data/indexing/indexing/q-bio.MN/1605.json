In the last years severalmethods for accurately\napproximating the statistical moments of such models have become very popular\nsince they allow an efficient analysis of complex networks. We propose a\ngeneralized method of moments approach for inferring the parameters of reaction\nnetworks based on a sophisticated matching of the statistical moments of the\ncorresponding stochastic model and the sample moments of population snapshot\ndata. The proposed parameter estimation method exploits recently developed\nmoment-based approximations and provides estimators with desirable statistical\nproperties when a large number of samples is available. We demonstrate the\nusefulness and efficiency of the inference method on two case studies. The\ngeneralized method of moments provides accurate and fast estimations of unknown\nparameters of reaction networks. The accuracy increases when also moments of\norder higher than two are considered.

Taking gene expression noise into account predicts that the final\nboundary position of a morphogen-induced toggle switch, although robust to\nchanges in the details of the noise, is distinct from that of the deterministic\nsystem. Moreover, stochastic switching introduces differences in patterning\ntime along the morphogen gradient that result in a patterning wave propagating\naway from the morphogen source.

The model includes three key mechanotransducers: mechanosensing ion\nchannels, integrins and G-protein-coupled receptors. The reaction cascade\nconsists of two interconnected parts. The first is rapid activation of calcium,\nwhich results in formation of calcium-calmodulin complexes, followed by\nrecruitment of eNOS from caveolae. The second is phosphoryaltion of eNOS by\nprotein kinases PKC and AKT. The model also includes a negative feedback loop\ndue to inhibition of calcium influx into the cell by cyclic guanosine\nmonophosphate (cGMP). In this feedback, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels\ncause an increase in cGMP levels, so that cGMP inhibition of calcium influx can\nlimit NO production. The model was used to predict the dynamics of NO\nproduction by an EC subjected to a step increase of WSS from zero to a finite\nphysiologically relevant value. Among several experimentally observed features,\nthe model predicts a highly nonlinear, biphasic transient behavior of eNOS\nactivation and NO production: a rapid initial activation due to the very rapid\ninflux of calcium into the cytosol (occurring within 1 to 5 minutes) is\nfollowed by a sustained period of activation due to protein kinases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 May 2016 04:08:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Sriram", "Krishna", ""], ["Laughlin", "Justin G.", ""], ["Rangamani", "Padmini", ""], ["Tartakovsky", "Daniel M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.07072", "submitter": "Christian Mueller", "authors": "Christian L.
