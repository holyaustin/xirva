Important open questions\ninclude the relation between neuronal versus astrocytic energy demand, glucose\nuptake and intercellular lactate transfer, as well as their dependence on the\nlevel of activity. We have developed a large-scale, constraint-based network\nmodel of the metabolic partnership between astrocytes and glutamatergic neurons\nthat allows for a quantitative appraisal of the extent to which stoichiometry\nalone drives the energetics of the system. We find that the velocity of the\nglutamate-glutamine cycle ($V_{cyc}$) explains part of the uncoupling between\nglucose and oxygen utilization at increasing $V_{cyc}$ levels. Thus, we are\nable to characterize different activation states in terms of the tissue\noxygen-glucose index (OGI). Calculations show that glucose is taken up and\nmetabolized according to cellular energy requirements, and that partitioning of\nthe sugar between different cell types is not significantly affected by\n$V_{cyc}$. Furthermore, both the direction and magnitude of the lactate shuttle\nbetween neurons and astrocytes turn out to depend on the relative cell glucose\nuptake while being roughly independent of $V_{cyc}$. These findings suggest\nthat, in absence of ad hoc activity-related constraints on neuronal and\nastrocytic metabolism, the glutamate-glutamine cycle does not control the\nrelative energy demand of neurons and astrocytes, and hence their glucose\nuptake and lactate exchange.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 10:40:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Massucci", "Francesco Alessandro", ""], ["DiNuzzo", "Mauro", ""], ["Giove", "Federico", ""], ["Maraviglia", "Bruno", ""], ["Castillo", "Isaac Perez", ""], ["Marinari", "Enzo", ""], ["De Martino", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7083", "submitter": "Andrew Teschendorff", "authors": "Christopher R.S.

Its characteristic signature is the biphasic kill curve,\nwhereby microbes exposed to a bactericidal agent are initially killed very\nrapidly but then much more slowly. Here we relate this problem to the more\ngeneral problem of understanding the emergence of distinct growth phenotypes in\nclonal populations. We address the problem mathematically by adopting the\nframework of the phenomenon of so-called weak ergodicity breaking, well known\nin dynamical physical systems, which we extend to the biological context. We\nshow analytically and by direct stochastic simulations that distinct growth\nphenotypes can emerge as a consequence of slow-down of stochastic fluctuations\nin the expression of a gene controlling growth rate. In the regime of fast gene\ntranscription, the system is ergodic, the growth rate distribution is unimodal,\nand accounts for one phenotype only. In contrast, at slow transcription and\nfast translation, weakly non-ergodic components emerge, the population\ndistribution of growth rates becomes bimodal, and two distinct growth\nphenotypes are identified. When coupled to the well-established growth rate\ndependence of antibiotic killing, this model describes the observed fast and\nslow killing phases, and reproduces much of the phenomenology of bacterial\npersistence. The model has major implications for efforts to develop control\nstrategies for persistent infections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:07:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rocco", "Andrea", ""], ["Kierzek", "Andrzej M.", ""], ["McFadden", "Johnjoe", ""]]}]
