The complexity\nof these models and their description makes the use of computational tools an\nessential element in their research. Therefore there is a strong need of\nefficient and versatile computational tools for the research in this area.\n  Results: In this manuscript we present PyNetMet, a Python library of tools to\nwork with networks and metabolic models. These are open-source free tools for\nuse in a Python platform, which adds considerably versatility to them when\ncompared with their desktop software similars. On the other hand these tools\nallow one to work with different standards of metabolic models (OptGene and\nSBML) and the fact that they are programmed in Python opens the possibility of\nefficient integration with any other already existing Python tool.\n  Conclusions: PyNetMet is, therefore, a collection of computational tools that\nwill facilitate the research work with metabolic models and networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 09:25:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gamermann", "D.", ""], ["Montagud", "A.", ""], ["Infante", "R.

Binding specificity has a strong impact on the evolution of\ngene expression, because it determines how easily regulatory interactions are\ngained and lost. Nevertheless, we have a relatively poor understanding of what\nevolutionary forces determine the specificity of binding sites. Here we address\nthis question by studying regulatory modules composed of multiple binding\nsites. Using a population-genetic model, we show that more complex regulatory\nmodules, composed of a greater number of binding sites, must employ binding\nsites that are individually less specific, compared to less complex regulatory\nmodules. This effect is extremely general, and it hold regardless of the\nregulatory logic of a module. We attribute this phenomenon to the inability of\nstabilising selection to maintain highly specific sites in large regulatory\nmodules. Our analysis helps to explain broad empirical trends in the yeast\nregulatory network: those genes with a greater number of transcriptional\nregulators feature by less specific binding sites, and there is less variance\nin their specificity, compared to genes with fewer regulators. Likewise, our\nresults also help to explain the well-known trend towards lower specificity in\nthe transcription factor binding sites of higher eukaryotes, which perform\ncomplex regulatory tasks, compared to prokaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 18:21:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Stewart", "Alexander J.", ""], ["Plotkin", "Joshua B.", ""]]}]
