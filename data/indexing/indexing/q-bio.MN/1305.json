This\nform of response was obtained as a function of the two inputs in each of the\nrealized biochemical systems. The enzymatic gate processes in the first system\nwere activated with two chemical inputs and resulted in optically detected\nchromogen oxidation, which happens when either one or both of the inputs are\npresent.

We\ndemonstrate that the addition of a \"filtering\" biocatalytic process leads to a\nconsiderable reduction of the noise transmission factor and the resulting gate\nresponse has sigmoid shape in both inputs. The second system was developed for\nfunctioning as an AND gate, where the output signal was activated only by a\nsimultaneous action of two enzymatic biomarkers. This response can be used as\nan indicator of liver damage, but only if both of these of the inputs are\npresent at their elevated, pathophysiological values of concentrations.

Here we show that the GDNF-RET regulatory interaction gives\nrise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing model that reproduces the observed budding\nof the ureteric bud from the Wolffian duct, its invasion into the mesenchyme,\nand the observed branching pattern. The model also recapitulates all relevant\nprotein expression patterns in wild-type and mutant mice. The lung and kidney\nmodels are both based on a particular receptor- ligand interaction and require:\n(1) cooperative binding of ligand and receptor, (2) a lower diffusion\ncoefficient for the receptor than for the ligand, and (3) an increase in the\nreceptor concentration in response to receptor-ligand binding (by enhanced\ntranscription, more recycling or similar). These conditions are met also by\nother receptor-ligand systems.
