Date hubs display low co-expression with\ntheir partners, whilst party hubs have high co-expression. It was proposed that\nparty hubs are local coordinators whereas date hubs are global connectors. Here\nwe show that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can\nin fact be attributed to a tiny subset of them. Crucially, these few, extremely\ncentral, hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation,\nundermining the idea of a link between this quantity and hub function. The\ndate/party distinction was originally motivated by an approximately bimodal\ndistribution of hub co-expression; we show that this feature is not always\nrobust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs\ndo not in general correlate with co-expression. Thus, we suggest that a\ndate/party dichotomy is not meaningful and it might be more useful to conceive\nof roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. We\nfind significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional\nsimilarity of the interacting proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 23:44:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 19:29:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Agarwal", "Sumeet", ""], ["Deane", "Charlotte M.", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Jones", "Nick S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0529", "submitter": "Benedicte Mengel", "authors": "Benedicte Mengel, Sandeep Krishna, Mogens H.Jensen, Ala Trusina", "title": "Theoretical analyses predict A20 regulates period of NF-kB oscillation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph q-bio.CB q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling of NF-kB is characterized by damped\noscillations of the nuclear concentration with a time period of around 1-2\nhours.
