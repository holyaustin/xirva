Here we ask the question what makes a protein\npromiscuous, i.e., prone to non-specific interactions, and structurally\ndisordered. We predict that multi-scale correlations of amino acid positions\nwithin protein sequences statistically enhance the propensity for promiscuous\nintra- and inter-protein binding. We show that sequence correlations between\namino acids of the same type are statistically enhanced in structurally\ndisordered proteins and in hubs of organismal proteomes. We also show that\nstructurally disordered proteins possess a significantly higher degree of\nsequence order than structurally ordered proteins. We develop an analytical\ntheory for this effect and predict the robustness of our conclusions with\nrespect to the amino acid composition and the form of the microscopic potential\nbetween the interacting sequences.
