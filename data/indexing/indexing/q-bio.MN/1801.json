Most biomedical facts are\nhowever not readily available, but buried in the form of unstructured text, and\nhence their exploitation requires the time-consuming manual curation of\npublished articles. Here we present INtERAcT, a novel approach to extract\nprotein-protein interactions from a corpus of biomedical articles related to a\nbroad range of scientific domains in a completely unsupervised way. INtERAcT\nexploits vector representation of words, computed on a corpus of domain\nspecific knowledge, and implements a new metric that estimates an interaction\nscore between two molecules in the space where the corresponding words are\nembedded. We demonstrate the power of INtERAcT by reconstructing the molecular\npathways associated to 10 different cancer types using a corpus of\ndisease-specific articles for each cancer type. We evaluate INtERAcT using\nSTRING database as a benchmark, and show that our metric outperforms currently\nadopted approaches for similarity computation at the task of identifying known\nmolecular interactions in all studied cancer types. Furthermore, our approach\ndoes not require text annotation, manual curation or the definition of semantic\nrules based on expert knowledge, and hence it can be easily and efficiently\napplied to different scientific domains.

The first section provides a brief history of\nempirical observations on toxicity dating back to the dawn of Sumerian\ncivilization. Interestingly, the concept of dose emerged very early on, leading\nup to the modern emphasis on kinetic properties, which in turn encodes the\ninsight that toxicity is not solely a property of a compound but instead\ndepends on the interaction with the host organism. The next logical step is the\ncurrent conception of evaluating drugs from a personalized medicine\npoint-of-view. We review recent work on integrating what could be referred to\nas classical pharmacokinetic analysis with emerging systems biology approaches\nincorporating multiple omics data. These systems approaches employ advanced\nstatistical analytical data processing complemented with machine learning\ntechniques and use both pharmacokinetic and omics data. We find that such\nintegrated approaches not only provide improved predictions of toxicity but\nalso enable mechanistic interpretations of the molecular mechanisms\nunderpinning toxicity and drug resistance. We conclude the chapter by\ndiscussing some of the main challenges, such as how to balance the inherent\ntension between the predictive capacity of models, which in practice amounts to\nconstraining the number of features in the models versus allowing for rich\nmechanistic interpretability, i.e. equipping models with numerous molecular\nfeatures. This challenge also requires patient-specific predictions on\ntoxicity, which in turn requires proper stratification of patients as regards\nhow they respond, with or without adverse toxic effects. In summary, the\ntransformation of the ancient concept of dose is currently successfully\noperationalized using rich integrative data encoded in patient-specific models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jan 2018 22:46:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Kiani", "Narsis A.", ""], ["Shang", "Ming-Mei", ""], ["Zenil", "Hector", ""], ["Tegn\u00e9r", "Jesper", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.05392", "submitter": "Harmen Wierenga", "authors": "Harmen Wierenga, Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Nils B.

Some constraint-based flux prediction methods score\nfluxes by heuristic flux costs as proxies of enzyme investments. However,\nlinear cost functions ignore enzyme kinetics and the tight coupling between\nfluxes, metabolite levels and enzyme levels. To derive more realistic cost\nfunctions, I define an apparent \"enzymatic flux cost\" as the minimal enzyme\ncost at which the fluxes can be realised in a given kinetic model, and a\n\"kinetic flux cost\", which includes metabolite cost. I discuss the mathematical\nproperties of such flux cost functions, their usage for flux prediction, and\ntheir importance for cells' metabolic strategies. The enzymatic flux cost\nscales linearly with the fluxes and is a concave function on the flux polytope.\nThe costs of two flows are usually not additive, due to an additional\n\"compromise cost\". Between flux polytopes, where fluxes change their\ndirections, the enzymatic cost shows a jump. With strictly concave flux cost\nfunctions, cells can reduce their enzymatic cost by running different fluxes in\ndifferent cell compartments or at different moments in time. The enzymactic\nflux cost can be translated into an approximated cell growth rate, a convex\nfunction on the flux polytope.

The results are applied in the context of systems biology,\nwhere noise-induced mixing is shown to play a biochemically important role,\nproducing phenomena such as stochastic multimodality and oscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jan 2018 09:18:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Plesa", "Tomislav", ""], ["Erban", "Radek", ""], ["Othmer", "Hans G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.09507", "submitter": "Juan Kuntz", "authors": "Juan Kuntz, Philipp Thomas, Guy-Bart Stan, Mauricio Barahona", "title": "The exit time finite state projection scheme: bounding exit\n  distributions and occupation measures of continuous-time Markov chains", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing (2019) 41:A748-A769", "doi": "10.1137/18M1168261", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech math.OC q-bio.MN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the exit time finite state projection (ETFSP) scheme, a\ntruncation-based method that yields approximations to the exit distribution and\noccupation measure associated with the time of exit from a domain (i.e., the\ntime of first passage to the complement of the domain) of time-homogeneous\ncontinuous-time Markov chains. We prove that: (i) the computed approximations\nbound the measures from below; (ii) the total variation distances between the\napproximations and the measures decrease monotonically as states are added to\nthe truncation; and (iii) the scheme converges, in the sense that, as the\ntruncation tends to the entire state space, the total variation distances tend\nto zero. Furthermore, we give a computable bound on the total variation\ndistance between the exit distribution and its approximation, and we delineate\nthe cases in which the bound is sharp. We also revisit the related finite state\nprojection scheme and give a comprehensive account of its theoretical\nproperties. We demonstrate the use of the ETFSP scheme by applying it to two\nbiological examples: the computation of the first passage time associated with\nthe expression of a gene, and the fixation times of competing species subject\nto demographic noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:59:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Oct 2018 14:58:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 14:26:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kuntz", "Juan", ""], ["Thomas", "Philipp", ""], ["Stan", "Guy-Bart", ""], ["Barahona", "Mauricio", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10144", "submitter": "Manlio De Domenico", "authors": "Giuseppe Mangioni, Giuseppe Jurman, Manlio De Domenico", "title": "Multilayer flows in molecular networks identify biological modules in\n  the human proteome", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A variety of complex systems exhibit different types of relationships\nsimultaneously that can be modeled by multiplex networks. A typical problem is\nto determine the community structure of such systems that, in general, depend\non one or more parameters to be tuned. In this study we propose one measure,\ngrounded on information theory, to find the optimal value of the relax rate\ncharacterizing Multiplex Infomap, the generalization of the Infomap algorithm\nto the realm of multilayer networks. We evaluate our methodology on synthetic\nnetworks, to show that the most representative community structure can be\nreliably identified when the most appropriate relax rate is used. Capitalizing\non these results, we use this measure to identify the most reliable meso-scale\nfunctional organization in the human protein-protein interaction multiplex\nnetwork and compare the observed clusters against a collection of independently\nannotated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Our\nanalysis reveals that modules obtained with the optimal value of the relax rate\nare biologically significant and, remarkably, with higher functional content\nthan the ones obtained from the aggregate representation of the human proteome.\nOur framework allows us to characterize the meso-scale structure of those\nmultilayer systems whose layers are not explicitly interconnected each other --\nas in the case of edge-colored models -- the ones describing most biological\nnetworks, from proteomes to connectomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jan 2018 18:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mangioni", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Jurman", "Giuseppe", ""], ["De Domenico", "Manlio", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.10227", "submitter": "Song Feng", "authors": "Ryan Suderman, Eshan D.
