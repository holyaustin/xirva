The intracellular signaling processes and their control mechanisms,\nhowever, are susceptible to both extrinsic and intrinsic noise. In this\narticle, we present numerical evidence for a universal dynamic behavior of\nNF-{\\kappa}B, namely oscillatory nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, due to the\nfundamentally stochastic nature of the NF-{\\kappa}B signaling network. We\nsimulated the effect of extrinsic noise with a deterministic ODE model, using a\nstatistical ensemble approach, generating many copies of the signaling network\nwith different kinetic rates sampled from a biologically feasible parameter\nspace. We modeled the effect of intrinsic noise by simulating the same networks\nstochastically using the Gillespie algorithm. The results demonstrate that\nextrinsic noise diversifies the shuttling patterns of NF-{\\kappa}B response,\nwhereas intrinsic noise induces oscillatory behavior in many of the otherwise\nnon-oscillatory patterns. We identify two key model parameters which\nsignificantly affect the NF-{\\kappa}B dynamic response and deduce a\ntwo-dimensional phase-diagram of the NF-{\\kappa}B response as a function of\nthese parameters. We conclude that if single-cell experiments are performed, a\nrich variety of NF-{\\kappa}B response will be observed, even if\npopulation-level experiments, which average response over large numbers of\ncells, do not evidence oscillatory behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Oct 2010 14:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Joo", "Jaewook", ""], ["Plimpton", "Steven J.", ""], ["Faulon", "Jean-Loup", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0904", "submitter": "Jaewook Joo", "authors": "Jaewook Joo, Steven J.
