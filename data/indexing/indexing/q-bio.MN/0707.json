Early studies showed\nthat bistability occurs during growth on TMG/succinate and lactose + glucose,\nbut not during growth on lactose. More recent studies with lacGFP-transfected\ncells show bistability with TMG/succinate, but not with lactose and lactose +\nglucose. In the literature, these results are attributed to variations of the\npositive feedback generated by induction. Specifically, during growth on\nTMG/succinate, induction generates positive feedback because the permease\nstimulates the accumulation of TMG, which, in turn, promotes the synthesis of\nmore permease. This positive feedback is attenuated during growth on lactose\nbecause hydrolysis of lactose by galactosidase suppresses the stimulatory\neffect of the permease. But the stabilizing effect of dilution also changes\ndramatically as a function of the medium composition. For instance, during\ngrowth on TMG/succinate, the dilution rate of the permease is proportional to\nits activity, $e$, because the specific growth rate is independent of $e$.\nHowever, during growth on lactose, the permease dilution rate is proportional\nto $e^2$ because the specific growth rate is proportional to the specific\nlactose uptake rate, which in turn, proportional to $e$. Here, we show that:\n(a) This dependence on $e^2$ creates such a strong stabilizing effect that\nbistability is virtually impossible during growth on lactose, even in the face\nof positive feedback. (b) This stabilizing effect is weakened during growth on\nlactose + glucose because the specific growth rate on glucose is independent of\n$e$, so that the dilution rate once again contains a term that is proportional\nto $e$.
