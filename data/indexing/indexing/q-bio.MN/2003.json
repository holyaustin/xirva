On the basis of this new model we modify the non-backtracking flow\noperator and suggest the first protocol for annotation of compartmental domains\nin sparse single cell Hi-C matrices. In particular, we prove that our approach\ncorresponds to the maximum entropy principle. The benchmark analyses\ndemonstrates that the spectrum of the polymer non-backtracking operator\nresolves the true compartmental structure up to the theoretical detectability\nthreshold, while all commonly used operators fail above it. We test various\noperators on real data and conclude that the sizes of the non-backtracking\nsingle cell domains are most close to the sizes of compartments from the\npopulation data. Moreover, the found domains clearly segregate in the gene\ndensity and correlate with the population compartmental mask, corroborating\nbiological significance of our annotation of the chromatin compartmental\ndomains in single cells Hi-C matrices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 17:08:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2020 21:28:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Polovnikov", "K.", ""], ["Gorsky", "A.", ""], ["Nechaev", "S.", ""], ["Razin", "S.

Learning the causal structure among latent variables\nremains an important open problem, particularly when using high-dimensional\ndata. In this paper, we address a problem for which it is known that inputs\ncause outputs, and these causal relationships are encoded by a causal network\namong a set of an unknown number of latent variables. We developed a deep\nlearning model, which we call a redundant input neural network (RINN), with a\nmodified architecture and a regularized objective function to find causal\nrelationships between input, hidden, and output variables. More specifically,\nour model allows input variables to directly interact with all latent variables\nin a neural network to influence what information the latent variables should\nencode in order to generate the output variables accurately. In this setting,\nthe direct connections between input and latent variables makes the latent\nvariables partially interpretable; furthermore, the connectivity among the\nlatent variables in the neural network serves to model their potential causal\nrelationships to each other and to the output variables. A series of simulation\nexperiments provide support that the RINN method can successfully recover\nlatent causal structure between input and output variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 20:52:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 17:01:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Sep 2020 16:31:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "Jonathan D.", ""], ["Andrews", "Bryan", ""], ["Cooper", "Gregory F.", ""], ["Lu", "Xinghua", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13655", "submitter": "Gian Tartaglia", "authors": "Andrea Vandelli, Michele Monti, Edoardo Milanetti, Riccardo Delli\n  Ponti and Gian Gaetano Tartaglia", "title": "Structural analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and prediction of the human\n  interactome", "comments": "30 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.GN q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Specific elements of viral genomes regulate interactions within host cells.\nHere, we calculated the secondary structure content of >2500 coronaviruses and\ncomputed >100000 human protein interactions with severe acute respiratory\nsyndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
