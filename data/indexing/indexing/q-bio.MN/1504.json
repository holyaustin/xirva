However,\nat a systems-level it is unclear how these perturbations give rise to the\nobserved increased plasticity. Elucidating such systems-level principles is key\nfor an improved understanding of cancer. Recently, it has been shown that\nsignaling entropy, an overall measure of signaling pathway promiscuity, and\ncomputable from integrating a sample's gene expression profile with a protein\ninteraction network, correlates with phenotypic plasticity and is increased in\ncancer compared to normal tissue. Here we develop a computational framework for\nstudying the effects of network perturbations on signaling entropy. We\ndemonstrate that the increased signaling entropy of cancer is driven by two\nfactors: (i) the scale-free (or near scale-free) topology of the interaction\nnetwork, and (ii) a subtle positive correlation between differential gene\nexpression and node connectivity. Indeed, we show that if protein interaction\nnetworks were random graphs, described by Poisson degree distributions, that\ncancer would generally not exhibit an increased signaling entropy. In summary,\nthis work exposes a deep connection between cancer, signaling entropy and\ninteraction network topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 06:50:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Teschendorff", "Andrew E.", ""], ["Banerji", "Christopher R.

This remarkable stability is frequently counter\nto modelers' experience with the inherent stochasticity of chemical reactions\nin the regime of low copy numbers. Moreover, the effects of noise and\nnonlinearities can lead to \"counter-intuitive\" behavior, as demonstrated for a\nbasic enzymatic reaction scheme that can display stochastic focusing (SF).\nUnder the assumption of rapid signal fluctuations, SF has been shown to convert\na graded response into a threshold mechanism, thus attenuating the detrimental\neffects of signal noise. However, when the rapid fluctuation assumption is\nviolated, this gain in sensitivity is generally obtained at the cost of very\nlarge product variance, and this unpredictable behavior may be one possible\nexplanation of why, more than a decade after its introduction, SF has still not\nbeen observed in real biochemical systems.\n  In this work we explore the noise properties of a simple enzymatic reaction\nmechanism with a small and fluctuating number of active enzymes that behaves as\na high-gain, noisy amplifier due to SF caused by slow enzyme fluctuations. We\nthen show that the inclusion of a plausible negative feedback mechanism turns\nthe system from a noisy signal detector to a strong homeostatic mechanism by\nexchanging high gain with strong attenuation in output noise and robustness to\nparameter variations. Moreover, we observe that the discrepancy between\ndeterministic and stochastic descriptions of stochastically focused systems in\nthe evolution of the means almost completely disappears, despite very low\nmolecule counts and the additional nonlinearity due to feedback.\n  The reaction mechanism considered here can provide a possible resolution to\nthe apparent conflict between intrinsic noise and high precision in critical\nintracellular processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 08:32:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:34:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Milias-Argeitis", "Andreas", ""], ["Engblom", "Stefan", ""], ["Bauer", "Pavol", ""], ["Khammash", "Mustafa", ""]]}]
