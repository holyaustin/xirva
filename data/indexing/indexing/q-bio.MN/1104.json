We begin to address this problem by employing chemical reaction\nnetwork theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity\nfor bistability of more than 40,000 simple networks that can be formed by two\ntranscription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins (assuming only\nthe most elementary biochemical processes).

A\ntopological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or\nabsence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks\n(i.e., bistable networks that do not contain within them a smaller bistable\nsubnetwork). The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies\nsuggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with\nrelative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution.

Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard\nbecause topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined\nas the number of edges in an unweighted graph. In this paper, we evaluate the\nbenefits and limitations associated with using cost-integrated topological\nmetrics. Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs\nusing global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of\nweighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows\nthat integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic\ntransformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating\nover cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a\nmonotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted\ntopological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling\ndifferences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the\nuse of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid\napproach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use\nof the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing\nweighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted\ncosts and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We\ndemonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI\nworking memory task.
