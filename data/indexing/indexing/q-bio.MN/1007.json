Such information can be used to improve estimation\nand inference, and to obtain better insights into the underlying cellular\nmechanisms. Discovering regulatory interactions among genes is therefore an\nimportant problem in systems biology. Whole-genome expression data over time\nprovides an opportunity to determine how the expression levels of genes are\naffected by changes in transcription levels of other genes, and can therefore\nbe used to discover regulatory interactions among genes.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel penalization method, called truncating\nlasso, for estimation of causal relationships from time-course gene expression\ndata. The proposed penalty can correctly determine the order of the underlying\ntime series, and improves the performance of the lasso-type estimators.\nMoreover, the resulting estimate provides information on the time lag between\nactivation of transcription factors and their effects on regulated genes. We\nprovide an efficient algorithm for estimation of model parameters, and show\nthat the proposed method can consistently discover causal relationships in the\nlarge $p$, small $n$ setting. The performance of the proposed model is\nevaluated favorably in simulated, as well as real, data examples.

We review information-theoretic approaches to\nthe problem of the code's origin and discuss the results of a recent work that\ntreats the code in terms of an evolving, error-prone information channel. Our\nmodel - which utilizes the rate-distortion theory of noisy communication\nchannels - suggests that the genetic code originated as a result of the\ninterplay of the three conflicting evolutionary forces: the needs for diverse\namino-acids, for error-tolerance and for minimal cost of resources. The\ndescription of the code as an information channel allows us to mathematically\nidentify the fitness of the code and locate its emergence at a second-order\nphase transition when the mapping of codons to amino-acids becomes nonrandom.\nThe noise in the channel brings about an error-graph, in which edges connect\ncodons that are likely to be confused. The emergence of the code is governed by\nthe topology of the error-graph, which determines the lowest modes of the\ngraph-Laplacian and is related to the map coloring problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jul 2010 15:05:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Tlusty", "Tsvi", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4031", "submitter": "Dionysios Barmpoutis", "authors": "Dionysios Barmpoutis and Richard M.

Considering the amino\nacids as nodes and the interactions among them as edges we have constructed and\nanalyzed protein contact networks at different length scales, long and\nshort-range. While long and short-range interactions are determined by the\npositions of amino acids in primary chain, the contact networks are constructed\nbased on the 3D spatial distances of amino acids. We have further divided these\nnetworks into sub-networks of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and charged residues.\nOur analysis reveals that a significantly higher percentage of assortative\nsub-clusters of long-range hydrophobic networks helps a protein in\ncommunicating the necessary information for protein folding in one hand; on the\nother hand the higher values of clustering coefficients of hydrophobic\nsub-clusters play a major role in slowing down the process so that necessary\nlocal and global stability can be achieved through intra connectivities of the\namino acid residues. Further, higher degrees of hydrophobic long-range\ninteractions suggest their greater role in protein folding and stability. The\nsmall-range all amino acids networks have signature of hierarchy. The present\nanalysis with other evidences suggest that in a protein's 3D conformational\nspace, the growth of connectivity is not evolved either through preferential\nattachment or through random connections; rather, it follows a specific\nstructural necessity based guiding principle - where some of the interactions\nare primary while the others, generated as a consequence of these primary\ninteractions are secondary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Jul 2010 10:52:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Sengupta", "Dhriti", ""], ["Kundu", "Sudip", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4149", "submitter": "Tsvi Tlusty", "authors": "Tsvi Tlusty", "title": "A rate-distortion scenario for the emergence and evolution of noisy\n  molecular codes", "comments": "PACS numbers: 87.10.+e, 87.14.Gg, 87.14.Ee", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Such differences arise from stochastic events\nin individual cells that are averaged out in cell populations.

Opposed to some previous models, we build a fully stochastic model of a\nnegative feedback loop that explicitly takes into account the RNA stochastic\ndynamics. We find that messenger RNA random fluctuations can be amplified\nduring translation and produce sustained pulses of protein expression.\nMotivated by the recent appreciation of the importance of non--coding\nregulatory RNAs in post--transcription regulation, we also consider the\npossibility that a regulatory RNA transcript could bind to the messenger RNA\nand repress translation. Our findings show that the regulatory transcript helps\nreduce gene expression variability both at the single cell level and at the\ncell population level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2010 21:36:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00ednez", "Mar\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez", ""], ["Soriano", "Jordi", ""], ["Tlusty", "Tsvi", ""], ["Pilpel", "Yitzhak", ""], ["Furman", "Itay", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.5035", "submitter": "Tam\\'as Szabados", "authors": "Tamas Szabados and Tibor Bakacs", "title": "A new homeostatic model of the T cell system", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Journal of Biological Systems, 19, 299-317, 2011", "doi": "10.1142/S0218339011003919", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our main tenet argues that the primary role of positive thymic selection and\nthe resulting T cell population is the maintenance of a homeostatic equilibrium\nwith self MHC-self peptide complexes.
