We investigated a biophysical\nmodel of gene regulation, where the fractional occupancy of a transcription\nfactor (TF) on the cis-regulated promoter site it binds to is determined by\nbinding energy (-{\\Delta}G) and TF dosage. Transcription and gene expression\nproceed when the TF is bound to the promoter. In diploids, individuals may be\nheterozygous at the cis-site, at the TF's coding region, or at the TF's own\npromoter, which determines allele-specific dosage. We find that when the TF's\ncoding region is heterozygous, TF alleles compete for occupancy at the cis\nsites and the tighter-binding TF is dominant in proportion to the difference in\nbinding strength. When the TF's own promoter is heterozygous, the TF produced\nat the higher dosage is also dominant. Cis-site heterozygotes have additive\nexpression and therefore codominant phenotypes. Binding dominance propagates to\naffect the expression of downstream loci and it is sensitive in both magnitude\nand direction to genetic background, but its detectability often attenuates.\nWhile binding dominance is inevitable at the molecular level, it is difficult\nto detect in the phenotype under some biophysical conditions, more so when TF\ndosage is high and allele-specific binding affinities are similar.
