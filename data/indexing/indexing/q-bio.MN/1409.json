There is\nincreasing evidence that cell signaling pathways encode temporal information,\nand thus cell fate may be determined by the dynamics of protein levels. We have\ndeveloped a mathematical model to describe the transient dynamics of the\nHIF-1{\\alpha} protein measured in single cells subjected to hypoxic shock. The\nessential characteristics of these data are modeled with a system of\ndifferential equations describing the feedback inhibition between HIF-1{\\alpha}\nand Prolyl Hydroxylases (PHD) oxygen sensors. Heterogeneity in the single-cell\ndata is accounted for through parameter variation in the model. We previously\nidentified the PHD2 isoform as the main PHD responsible for controlling the\nHIF-1{\\alpha} transient response, and make here testable predictions regarding\nHIF-1{\\alpha} dynamics subject to repetitive hypoxic pulses. The model is\nfurther developed to describe the dynamics of HIF-1{\\alpha} in cells cultured\nas 3D spheroids, with oxygen dynamics parameterized using experimental\nmeasurements of oxygen within spheroids. We show that the dynamics of\nHIF-1{\\alpha} and transcriptional targets of HIF-1{\\alpha} display a\nnon-monotone response to the oxygen dynamics. Specifically we demonstrate that\nthe dynamic transient behavior of HIF-1{\\alpha} results in differential\ndynamics in transcriptional targets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Sep 2014 12:56:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Sep 2014 15:47:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Leedale", "Joseph", ""], ["Herrmann", "Anne", ""], ["Bagnall", "James", ""], ["Fercher", "Andreas", ""], ["Papkovsky", "Dmitri", ""], ["S\u00e9e", "Violaine", ""], ["Bearon", "Rachel N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.5182", "submitter": "Rami Pugatch", "authors": "Rami Pugatch", "title": "Catalytic Buffering for Optimal Scheduling of Self-Replication", "comments": "9 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the scheduling problem of a self-replicating factory.

Optimally scheduled self-replication is facilitated by allowing\nseveral production lines to run in parallel. The excess inventory of catalysts\nand substrates decouples these lines, while dynamical balancing tunes average\nand variance completion, resulting in an overall universal distribution for the\nreplication times belonging to the generalized extreme value family. We discuss\nbiological implications and postulate that bacteria that are tuned by evolution\nfor fast replication employ this natural scheduling strategy to achieve optimal\nasymptotic growth rates by stoichiometrically balancing the amount of work in\nprogress thus globally controlling the number of parallel basic\nself-replicating units within them.
