The stochasticity stems from the updating schedule. Standard updating\nschedules include the synchronous update, where all the nodes are updated at\nthe same time, and the asynchronous update where a random node is updated at\neach time step. The former produces a deterministic dynamics while the latter a\nstochastic dynamics. A more general stochastic setting considers propensity\nparameters for updating each node. Stochastic Discrete Dynamical Systems (SDDS)\nis a modeling framework that considers two propensity parameters for updating\neach node and uses one when the update has a positive impact on the variable,\nthat is, when the update causes the variable to increase its value, and uses\nthe other when the update has a negative impact, that is, when the update\ncauses it to decrease its value. This framework offers additional features for\nsimulations but also adds a complexity in parameter estimation of the\npropensities. This paper presents a method for estimating the propensity\nparameters for SDDS. The method is based on adding noise to the system using\nthe Google PageRank approach to make the system ergodic and thus guaranteeing\nthe existence of a stationary distribution. Then with the use of a genetic\nalgorithm, the propensity parameters are estimated.

Our model outperforms a rule-based expert system in the reaction\nprediction task for 180,000 randomly selected binary reactions. We show that\nour data-driven model generalises even beyond known reaction types, and is thus\ncapable of effectively (re-) discovering novel transformations (even including\ntransition-metal catalysed reactions). Our model enables computers to infer\nhypotheses about reactivity and reactions by only considering the intrinsic\nlocal structure of the graph, and because each single reaction prediction is\ntypically achieved in a sub-second time frame, our model can be used as a\nhigh-throughput generator of reaction hypotheses for reaction discovery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 12:45:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Segler", "Marwin H.

Accordingly, we generalize this result to\nallow for processive phosphorylation networks in which each reaction may be\nirreversible, and also to account for possible product inhibition. We\naccomplish this by defining an all-encompassing processive network that\nencapsulates all of these schemes, and then appealing to recent results of\nMarcondes de Freitas, Wiuf, and Feliu that assert global convergence by way of\nmonontone systems theory and network/graph reductions (which correspond to\nremoval of intermediate complexes).

Catalysis allows catalytic sets within a molecular reaction network to\ndominate the non catalytic parts of the network by processing most of the\navailable substrate. As a consequence one may consider a 'catalytic fitness' of\nsets of molecular species. The fittest sets emerge as the expressed chemical\nbackbone or sub-network of larger chemical reaction networks employed by\norganisms. However, catalytic fitness depends on the systemic context and the\nstability of systemic dynamics. Unstable reaction networks would easily be\nreshaped or destroyed by fluctuations of the chemical environment. In this\npaper we therefore focus on recognizing systemic stability as an evolutionary\nselection criterion. In fact, instabilities of regulatory systems dynamics\nbecome predictive for associated evolutionary forces driving the emergence\nlarge reaction networks that avoid or control inherent instabilities. Systemic\ninstabilities can be identified and analyzed using relatively simple\nmathematical random networks models of complex regulatory systems. Using a\nstatistical ensemble approach one can identify fundamental causes of instable\ndynamics, infer evolutionary preferred network properties, and predict\nevolutionary emergent control mechanisms and their entanglement with cell\ndifferentiation processes. Surprisingly, what systemic stability tells us here\nis that cells (or other non-linear regulatory systems) never had to learn how\nto differentiate, but rather how to avoid and control differentiation. For\nexample, in this framework we can predict that regulatory systems will\nevolutionary favor networks where the number of catalytic enhancers is not\nlarger than the number of suppressors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 15:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Hanel", "Rudolf", ""]]}]
