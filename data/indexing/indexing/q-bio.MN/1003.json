Knockout resilience in the dynamics of the\nremaining nodes is a sign of robustness.

Beside random sequences with biologically plausible\nconstraints, we analyze the cell cycle sequence of the species Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae and the Boolean networks implementing it. Comparing with an\nappropriate null model we do not find evidence that the yeast wildtype network\nis optimized for high knockout resilience.

Here we study the quantitative relation between\nadaptive response and background compensation within a modeling framework. We\nshow that any particular type of adaptive response is neither sufficient nor\nnecessary for adaptive enlargement of dynamic range. In particular a precise\nadaptive response, where system activity is maintained at a constant level at\nsteady state, does not ensure a large dynamic range neither in input signal nor\nin system output. A general mechanism for input dynamic range enlargement can\ncome about from the activity-dependent modulation of protein responsiveness by\nmultiple biochemical modification, regardless of the type of adaptive response\nit induces. Therefore hierarchical biochemical processes such as methylation\nand phosphorylation are natural candidates to induce this property in signaling\nsystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Mar 2010 15:45:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2010 10:57:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Jun 2011 15:01:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Friedlander", "Tamar", ""], ["Brenner", "Naama", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2811", "submitter": "Shane Jensen", "authors": "Sira Sriswasdi and Shane T.
