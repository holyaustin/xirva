In this work, we present a\nstochastic approach for analyzing the dynamics and effect of negative feedback\nloops (FBL) on the transcriptional noise. First, our analysis allows us to\nidentify a bimodal activity depending of the strength of self-repression\ncoupling D. In the strong coupling region D>>1, the variance of the\ntranscriptional noise is found to be reduced a 28 % more than described\nearlier. Secondly, the contribution of the noise effect to the abundance of\nregulating protein becomes manifest when the coefficient of variation is\ncomputed. In the strong coupling region, this coefficient is found to be\nindependent of all parameters and in fair agreement with the experimentally\nobserved values. Finally, our analysis reveals that the regulating protein is\nsignificantly induced by the intrinsic and external noise in the strong\ncoupling region. In short, it indicates that the existence of inherent noise in\nFBL makes it possible to produce a basal amount of proteins even though the\nrepression level D is very strong.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2007 13:25:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Nacher", "J.

However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently\n(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated\nproduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable\nindicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic\nacid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance\nof the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by\noxidative stress.
