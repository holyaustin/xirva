In many cases these groups are found to correspond to\nknown functional units, such as ecological niches in food webs, modules in\nbiochemical networks (protein interaction networks, metabolic networks, or\ngenetic regulatory networks), or communities in social networks. Here we\npresent a general technique for inferring hierarchical structure from network\ndata and demonstrate that the existence of hierarchy can simultaneously explain\nand quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties of\nnetworks, such as right-skewed degree distributions, high clustering\ncoefficients, and short path lengths. We further show that knowledge of\nhierarchical structure can be used to predict missing connections in partially\nknown networks with high accuracy, and for more general network structures than\ncompeting techniques. Taken together, our results suggest that hierarchy is a\ncentral organizing principle of complex networks, capable of offering insight\ninto many network phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 15:30:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Clauset", "Aaron", ""], ["Moore", "Cristopher", ""], ["Newman", "M.
