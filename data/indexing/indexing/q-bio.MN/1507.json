In particular, only when\ndeficiency is zero does the average stochastic dissipation rate equal that of\nthe corresponding deterministic model, where correlations are disregarded. In\nfact, dissipation can be reduced by the effect of noise, as occurs in a toy\nmodel of metabolism that we employ to illustrate our findings.

We here analyze the dynamics of genetic\nregulatory networks responsible for the regulation of cell cycle and cell\ndifferentiation in three organisms or cell types each, and show that they obey\na version of Hebb's rule which we term as coherence. More precisely, we find\nthat simultaneously expressed genes with a common target are less likely to\nconflict at the attractors of the regulatory dynamics. We then investigate the\ndependence of coherence on structural parameters, such as the mean number of\ninputs per node and the activatory/repressory interaction ratio, as well as on\ndynamically determined quantities, such as the basin size and the number of\nexpressed genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 08:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Aral", "N.", ""], ["Kabakcioglu", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08262", "submitter": "Cameron Mura", "authors": "Cynthia Gray, Carol W.

The rationale behind this choice is that gene\nco-expression and protein-protein interactions require a tight coregulation of\nthe partners and that such a fine tuned regulation can be obtained only\ncombining both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional layers of\nregulation. To extract the relevant biological information from the\nmulti-network we studied its partition into communities. To this end we applied\na consensus clustering algorithm based on state of art community detection\nmethods. Even if our procedure is valid in principle for any pathology in this\nwork we concentrate on gastric, lung, pancreas and colorectal cancer and\nidentified from the enrichment analysis of the multi-network communities a set\nof candidate driver cancer genes.
