To help facilitate the\ncollaboration needed for such models, the community developed the Simulation\nExperiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML), a common format for describing\nsimulations. However, the utility of SED-ML has been hampered by limited\nsupport for SED-ML among modeling software tools and by different\ninterpretations of SED-ML among the tools that support the format. To help\nmodelers debug their simulations and to push the community to use SED-ML\nconsistently, we developed a tool for validating SED-ML files.

Although it is apparently beneficial for the\norganisms to reduce both error and energy cost of the discrimination process,\nit remains unclear to what extent these two quantities can be minimized\nsimultaneously. Here, with a chemical kinetic formalism, we identify a\nfundamental error-cost bound which tightly constrains the system's performance\nunder any parameter variations preserving the rate discrimination between\nsubstrates. The analytic form of bound is obtained in a large class of\nproofreading networks and supported by numeric sampling. Furthermore, this\nbound is kinetically controlled, i.e. completely determined by the difference\nbetween the transition state energies of corresponding enzymatic reactions on\nthe free energy landscape. The importance of the bound is analyzed for three\nbiological processes. DNA replication by T7 DNA polymerase is shown to be\nnearly optimized, i.e. its kinetic parameters place it in the immediate\nproximity of the error-cost bound. The isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IleRS) of E.\ncoli also operates close to the bound, but further optimization is prevented by\nthe need for reaction speed. On the contrary, speed requirement forces E. coli\nribosome to operate in a high-dissipation regime. Together, these findings\nestablish a fundamental relation between error and energy cost in biological\nproofreading networks and provide a theoretical framework for studying\nerror-dissipation trade-off in other systems with biological discrimination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2021 18:45:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Qiwei", ""], ["Kolomeisky", "Anatoly B.", ""], ["Igoshin", "Oleg A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.02246", "submitter": "Michelle Li", "authors": "Michelle M.

In the induced state of the\nlac-pathway, the genes comprising the lac-operon are transcribed, leading to\nthe production of proteins which import and metabolize lactose. In the\nuninduced state, a stable repressor-DNA loop frequently blocks the\ntranscription of the lac-genes. Transitions from one phenotypic state to the\nother are driven by fluctuations, which arise from the random timing of the\nbinding of ligands and proteins. This stochasticity affects transcription and\ntranslation, and ultimately molecular copy numbers. Our aim is to understand\nthe transition from the induced to the uninduced state of the lac-operon. We\nuse a detailed computational model to show that repressor-operator\nbinding/unbinding, fluctuations in the total number of repressors, and\ninducer-repressor binding/unbinding all play a role in this transition. Based\non the timescales on which these processes operate, we construct a minimal\nmodel of the transition to the uninduced state and compare the results with\nsimulations and experimental observations. The induced state turns out to be\nvery stable, with a transition rate to the uninduced state lower than $2 \\times\n10^{-9}$ per minute.

It\nconstructs a nonlinear singling network, and leads to robust switchlike\nproperties which are critical to biological function. Network architectures and\nstate transitions of receptor will affect the performance of this biological\nnetwork. In this work, we perform a study of nonlinear signaling on biological\nnetwork with multistate by analyzing network dynamics of the Ca$^{2+}$ induced\nCa$^{2+}$ release mechanism, where fast and slow processes are involved and the\nreceptor has four conformational states. Three types of networks,\nErd\\\"os-R\\'enyi network, Watts-Strogatz network and BaraB\\'asi-Albert network,\nare considered with different parameters. The dynamics of the biological\nnetworks exhibit different patterns at different time scales. At short time\nscale, the second open state is essential to reproduce the quasi-bistable\nregime, which emerges at a critical strength of connection for all three states\ninvolved in the fast processes and disappears at another critical point. The\npattern at short time scale is not sensitive to the network architecture. At\nlong time scale, only monostable regime is observed, and difference of network\narchitectures affects the results more seriously. Our finding identifies\nfeatures of nonlinear signaling networks with multistate that may underlie\ntheir biological function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jun 2021 09:40:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Han-Yu", ""], ["He", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.08067", "submitter": "Jaroslav Albert", "authors": "Jaroslav Albert", "title": "Stochastic fluctuations in protein interaction networks are nearly\n  Poissonian", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Gene regulatory networks are comprised of biochemical reactions, which are\ninherently stochastic. Each reaction channel contributes to this stochasticity\nin different measure. In this paper we study the stochastic dynamics of protein\ninteraction networks (PIN) that are made up of monomers and dimers. The network\nis defined by the dimers, which are formed by hybridizing two monomers. The\nsize of a PIN was defined as the number of monomers that interacts with at\nleast one other monomer (including itself). We generated 4200 random PIN of\nsizes between 2 and 8 (600 per size) and simulated via the Gillespie algorithm\nthe stochastic evolution of copy numbers of all monomers and dimers until they\nreached a steady state. The simulations revealed that the Fano factors of both\nmonomers and dimers in all networks and for all time points were close to one,\neither from below or above. Only 10% of Fano factors for monomers were above\n1.3 and 10% of Fano factors for dimers were above 1.17, with 5.54 and 3.47 as\nthe maximum value recorded for monomers and dimers, respectively. These\nfindings suggests that PIN in real biological setting contribute to the overall\nstochastic noise that is close to Poisson. Our results also show a correlation\nbetween stochastic noise, network size and network connectivity: for monomers,\nthe Fano factors tend towards 1 from above, while the Fano factors for dimers\ntend towards 1 from below. For monomers, this tendency is amplified with\nincreased network connectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 11:47:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Albert", "Jaroslav", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.11698", "submitter": "Zheng Zhao", "authors": "Zheng Zhao and Philip E.

Also, modifications of the\ndefault Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex\ninteraction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based\nHill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)\nleaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the\ncomplex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific\nstructure in advance.
