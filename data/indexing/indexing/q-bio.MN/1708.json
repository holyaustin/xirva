It is not clear though if\nexposure to these chemicals can exert toxic effects on the host and gut\nmicrobiome. Conflicting studies have been reported on whether AgNPs result in\ngut dysbiosis and other changes within the host. We sought to examine whether\nexposure of Sprague-Dawley male rats for two weeks to different shapes of\nAgNPs, cube (AgNC) and sphere (AgNS) affects gut microbiota, select behaviors,\nand induces histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal system and brain.\nIn the elevated plus maze (EPM), AgNS-exposed rats showed greater number of\nentries into closed arms and center compared to controls and those exposed to\nAgNC. AgNS and AgNC treated groups had select reductions in gut microbiota\nrelative to controls. Clostridium spp., Bacteroides uniformis,\nChristensenellaceae, and Coprococcus eutactus were decreased in AgNC exposed\ngroup, whereas, Oscillospira spp., Dehalobacterium spp., Peptococcaeceae,\nCorynebacterium spp., Aggregatibacter pneumotropica were reduced in AgNS\nexposed group. Bacterial reductions correlated with select behavioral changes\nmeasured in the EPM. No significant histopathological changes were evident in\nthe gastrointestinal system or brain. Findings suggest short-term exposure to\nAgNS or AgNC can lead to behavioral and gut microbiome changes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 21:47:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Javurek", "Angela B.", ""], ["Suresh", "Dhananjay", ""], ["Spollen", "William G.", ""], ["Hart", "Marcia L.", ""], ["Hansen", "Sarah A.", ""], ["Ellersieck", "Mark R.", ""], ["Bivens", "Nathan J.", ""], ["Givan", "Scott A.", ""], ["Upendran", "Anandhi", ""], ["Kannan", "Raghuraman", ""], ["Rosenfeld", "Cheryl S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09312", "submitter": "Edgar Herrera-Delgado", "authors": "Edgar Herrera-Delgado (1 and 2), Ruben Perez-Carrasco (3), James\n  Briscoe (1) and Peter Sollich (2) ((1) The Francis Crick Institute, London,\n  UK, (2) King's College London, London, UK, (3) University College London,\n  London, UK)", "title": "Memory functions reveal structural properties of gene regulatory\n  networks", "comments": "28 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS Comput Biol. 2018 Feb 22;14(2):e1006003", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) control cellular function and decision making\nduring tissue development and homeostasis. Mathematical tools based on\ndynamical systems theory are often used to model these networks, but the size\nand complexity of these models mean that their behaviour is not always\nintuitive and the underlying mechanisms can be difficult to decipher. For this\nreason, methods that simplify and aid exploration of complex networks are\nnecessary. To this end we develop a broadly applicable form of the Zwanzig-Mori\nprojection. By first converting a thermodynamic state ensemble model of gene\nregulation into mass action reactions we derive a general method that produces\na set of time evolution equations for a subset of components of a network. The\ninfluence of the rest of the network, the bulk, is captured by memory functions\nthat describe how the subnetwork reacts to its own past state via components in\nthe bulk. These memory functions provide probes of near-steady state dynamics,\nrevealing information not easily accessible otherwise. We illustrate the method\non a simple cross-repressive transcriptional motif to show that memory\nfunctions not only simplify the analysis of the subnetwork but also have a\nnatural interpretation. We then apply the approach to a GRN from the vertebrate\nneural tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network\ncomposed of four interacting transcription factors. The memory functions reveal\nthe function of specific links within the neural tube network and identify\nfeatures of the regulatory structure that specifically increase the robustness\nof the network to initial conditions. Taken together, the study provides\nevidence that Zwanzig-Mori projections offer powerful and effective tools for\nsimplifying and exploring the behaviour of GRNs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 15:03:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Mar 2018 10:45:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Herrera-Delgado", "Edgar", "", "1 and 2"], ["Perez-Carrasco", "Ruben", ""], ["Briscoe", "James", ""], ["Sollich", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09356", "submitter": "Daniele Cappelletti", "authors": "David F.

Space and stochasticity therefore play an\nessential role in biochemical networks. Spatial-stochastic simulations have\nbecome a prominent tool for understanding how stochasticity at the microscopic\nlevel influences the macroscopic behavior of such systems. However, while\nparticle-based models guarantee the level of detail necessary to accurately\ndescribe the microscopic dynamics at very low copy numbers, the algorithms used\nto simulate them oftentimes imply trade-offs between computational efficiency\nand accuracy. eGFRD (enhanced Green's Function Reaction Dynamics) is an exact\nalgorithm that evades such trade-offs by partitioning the N-particle system\ninto M<N analytically tractable one- and two-particle systems; the analytical\nsolutions (Green's functions) then are used to implement an event-driven\nparticle-based scheme that allows particles to make large jumps in time and\nspace while retaining access to their state variables at any moment. Here we\npresent \"eGFRD2\", a new eGFRD version that implements the principle of eGFRD in\nall dimensions, enabling efficient simulation of biochemical reaction-diffusion\nprocesses in the 3D cytoplasm, on 2D planes representing membranes, and on 1D\nelongated cylinders representative of, e.g., cytoskeletal tracks or DNA; in 1D,\nit also incorporates convective motion used to model active transport. We find\nthat, for low particle densities, eGFRD2 is up to 3 orders of magnitude faster\nthan optimized Brownian Dynamics. We exemplify the capabilities of eGFRD2 by\nsimulating an idealized model of Pom1 gradient formation, which involves 3D\ndiffusion, active transport on microtubules, and autophosphorylation on the\nmembrane, confirming recent results on this system and demonstrating that it\ncan efficiently operate under genuinely stochastic conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 16:54:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Sokolowski", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Bossen", "Laurens", ""], ["Wehrens", "Martijn", ""], ["Miedema", "Thomas", ""], ["Becker", "Nils B.", ""], ["Kaizu", "Kazunari", ""], ["Takahashi", "Koichi", ""], ["Dogterom", "Marlieen", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}]
