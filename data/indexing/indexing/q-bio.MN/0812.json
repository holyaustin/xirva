These kinetic properties allow the system to selectively\nrespond to sustained (as opposed to transient) stimuli, and thus establish a\ntemporal threshold, which prevents energetically costly IsiA accumulation under\nshort-term stress conditions.

For the toggle switch, we additionally find that\nthe presence of a protein dimer, either homodimer or heterodimer, may\nsignificantly reduce its random switching rate. Hence, the dimer promotes the\nrobust function of bistable switches by preventing the uninduced (induced)\nstate from randomly being induced (uninduced). The specific binding between\nregulatory proteins provides a buffer that may prevent the propagation of\nfluctuations in genetic activity. The capacity of the buffer is a non-monotonic\nfunction of association-dissociation rates.

While there is a rich literature in estimating a static or\ntemporally invariant network from observation data, little has been done toward\nestimating time-varying networks from time series of entity attributes. In this\npaper we present two new machine learning methods for estimating time-varying\nnetworks, which both build on a temporally smoothed $l_1$-regularized logistic\nregression formalism that can be cast as a standard convex-optimization problem\nand solved efficiently using generic solvers scalable to large networks. We\nreport promising results on recovering simulated time-varying networks. For\nreal data sets, we reverse engineer the latent sequence of temporally rewiring\npolitical networks between Senators from the US Senate voting records and the\nlatent evolving regulatory networks underlying 588 genes across the life cycle\nof Drosophila melanogaster from the microarray time course.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 15:45:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Oct 2010 06:26:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kolar", "Mladen", ""], ["Song", "Le", ""], ["Ahmed", "Amr", ""], ["Xing", "Eric P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.5094", "submitter": "Areejit Samal", "authors": "Areejit Samal", "title": "Study of the structure and dynamics of complex biological networks", "comments": "165 Pages, PhD Thesis, University of Delhi, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this thesis, we have studied the large scale structure and system level\ndynamics of certain biological networks using tools from graph theory,\ncomputational biology and dynamical systems.

We also study the\ndynamics of the large scale genetic network controlling E. coli metabolism. We\nhave tried to explain the observed system level dynamical properties of these\nnetworks in terms of their underlying structure. Our studies of the system\nlevel dynamics of these large scale biological networks provide a different\nperspective on their functioning compared to that obtained from purely\nstructural studies. Our study also leads to some new insights on features such\nas robustness, fragility and modularity of these large scale biological\nnetworks.
