Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants.

Coregulation can also arise through the physical\nassociation of multi-gene complexes through chromosomal looping, which are then\ntranscribed together.
