Their classical representation has\nproven useful but is inconsistent in the meaning assigned to each arrow (or\nedge) and inadvertently implies the isolation of one pathway from another.\nConversely, modern high-throughput experiments give rise to standardized\nnetworks facilitating topological calculations. Combining these perspectives,\nwe can embed classical pathways within large-scale networks and thus\ndemonstrate the crosstalk between them. As more diverse types of\nhigh-throughput data become available, we can effectively merge both\nperspectives, embedding pathways simultaneously in multiple networks. However,\nthe original problem still remains - the current edge representation is\ninadequate to accurately convey all the information in pathways.

It is a top-down approach using time\ndiscrete dynamical systems. One of its key steps includes the choice of a term\norder. The aim of this paper is to identify minimal requirements on data sets\nto be used with this algorithm and to characterize optimal data sets. We found\nminimal requirements on a data set based on how many terms the functions to be\nreverse engineered display. Furthermore, we identified optimal data sets, which\nwe characterized using a geometric property called \"general position\".\nMoreover, we developed a constructive method to generate optimal data sets,\nprovided a codimensional condition is fulfilled. In addition, we present a\ngeneralization of their algorithm that does not depend on the choice of a term\norder. For this method we derived a formula for the probability of finding the\ncorrect model, provided the data set used is optimal. We analyzed the\nasymptotic behavior of the probability formula for a growing number of\nvariables n (i.e. interacting chemicals). Unfortunately, this formula converges\nto zero as fast as r^(q^n), where q is a natural number and 0<r<1. Therefore,\neven if an optimal data set is used and the restrictions in using term orders\nare overcome, the reverse engineering problem remains unfeasible, unless\nprodigious amounts of data are available.
