OR) operator only. The main results of this\npaper describe network dynamics in terms of the structure of the network\ndependency graph (topology). For a given such network, all possible limit cycle\nlengths are computed and lower and upper bounds for the number of cycles of\neach length are given. In particular, the exact number of fixed points is\nobtained. The bounds are in terms of structural features of the dependency\ngraph and its partially ordered set of strongly connected components. For\nnetworks with strongly connected dependency graph, the exact cycle structure is\ncomputed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 17:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jarrah", "Abdul Salam", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""], ["Veliz-Cuba", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0326", "submitter": "Andrew Berdahl", "authors": "Andrew Berdahl, Amer Shreim, Vishal Sood, Joern Davidsen, Maya\n  Paczuski", "title": "Avalanches, branching ratios, and clustering of attractors in Random\n  Boolean Networks and in the segment polarity network of \\emph{Drosophila}", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/10/6/063002", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss basic features of emergent complexity in dynamical systems far\nfrom equilibrium by focusing on the network structure of their state space. We\nstart by measuring the distributions of avalanche and transient times in Random\nBoolean Networks (RBNs) and in the \\emph{Drosophila} polarity network by exact\nenumeration. A transient time is the duration of the transient from a starting\nstate to an attractor. An avalanche is a special transient which starts as\nsingle Boolean element perturbation of an attractor state. Significant\ndifferences at short times between the avalanche and the transient times for\nRBNs with small connectivity $K$ -- compared to the number of elements $N$ --\nindicate that attractors tend to cluster in configuration space. In addition,\none bit flip has a non-negligible chance to put an attractor state directly\nonto another attractor. This clustering is also present in the segment polarity\ngene network of \\emph{Drosophila melanogaster}, suggesting that this may be a\nrobust feature of biological regulatory networks. We also define and measure a\nbranching ratio for the state space networks and find evidence for a new time\nscale that diverges roughly linearly with $N$ for $2\\leq K \\ll N$. Analytic\narguments show that this time scale does not appear in the random map nor can\nthe random map exhibit clustering of attractors. We further show that for K=2\nthe branching ratio exhibits the largest variation with distance from the\nattractor compared to other values of $K$ and that the avalanche durations\nexhibit no characteristic scale within our statistical resolution. Hence, we\npropose that the branching ratio and the avalanche duration are new indicators\nfor scale-free behavior that may or may not be found simultaneously with other\nindicators of emergent complexity in extended, deterministic dynamical systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 22:34:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Berdahl", "Andrew", ""], ["Shreim", "Amer", ""], ["Sood", "Vishal", ""], ["Davidsen", "Joern", ""], ["Paczuski", "Maya", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0835", "submitter": "Masaki Sasai", "authors": "Kohei Eguchi, Mitsumasa Yoda, Tomoki P.

This finding indicates that protein-protein interactions and the\nassociated hydrolysis of ATP suffice to generate the circadian rhythm. Several\ntheoretical models have been proposed to explain the rhythm generated in this\n\"protein-only\" system, but the clear criterion to discern different possible\nmechanisms was not known. In this paper, we discuss a model based on the two\nbasic assumptions: The assumption of the allosteric transition of a KaiC\nhexamer and the assumption of the monomer exchange between KaiC hexamers. The\nmodel shows a stable rhythmic oscillation of the phosphorylation level of KaiC,\nwhich is robust against changes in concentration of Kai proteins. We show that\nthis robustness gives a clue to distinguish different possible mechanisms. We\nalso discuss the robustness of oscillation against the change in the system\nsize.
