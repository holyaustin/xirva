One way to tackle questions regarding\nrelationships between form and function is to perturb the form (e.g., change\nthe protein abundances) and observe the resulting changes in some function.\nHere we take on the form-function relationship from the inverse perspective,\nasking instead what specific constraints on cell-to-cell variations in protein\nabundance are imposed by a given functional phenotype.

Furthermore, the dynamic interspecies\ntranscript profiling revealed that C. albicans activated its filamentous\nformation during invasion and the iron scavenging functions during the damage\nphases, whereas zebrafish ceased its iron homeostasis function following\nmassive hemorrhage during the later stages of infection. This was followed by\nmassive hemorrhaging toward the end stage of infection. Most of the immune\nrelated genes were expressed as the infection progressed from invasion to the\ndamage phase.
