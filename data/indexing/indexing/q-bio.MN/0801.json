These growth\npatterns are manifested in all types of bacteria and yeasts. The ubiquity of\nthese growth patterns suggests that they are driven by a universal mechanism\ncommon to all microbial species. In previous work, we showed that a minimal\nmodel accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution explains the phenotypes\nobserved in batch cultures of various wild-type and mutant/recombinant cells.\nHere, we examine the extension of the minimal model to continuous cultures. We\nshow that: (1) Several enzymatic trends, usually attributed to specific\nregulatory mechanisms such as catabolite repression, are completely accounted\nfor by dilution. (2) The bifurcation diagram of the minimal model for\ncontinuous cultures, which classifies the substrate consumption pattern at any\ngiven dilution rate and feed concentrations, provides a a precise explanation\nfor the empirically observed correlation between the growth patterns in batch\nand continuous cultures. (3) Numerical simulations of the model are in\nexcellent agreement with the data. The model captures the variation of the\nsteady state substrate concentrations, cell densities, and enzyme levels during\nthe single- and mixed-substrate growth of bacteria and yeasts at various\ndilution rates and feed concentrations. (4) This variation is well-approximated\nby simple analytical expressions that furnish physical insights into the steady\nstates of continuous cultures. The minimal model provides a framework for\nquantitating the effect of regulatory mechanisms. We illustrate this by\nanalyzing several data sets from the literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jan 2008 19:00:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Noel", "Jason T.", ""], ["Narang", "Atul", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.1386", "submitter": "Ralf Blossey", "authors": "Ralf Blossey, Helmut Schiessel", "title": "Kinetic proofreading of gene activation by chromatin remodeling", "comments": "8 pages, 2 Figures; application added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.2976/1.2909080", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.BM", "license": null, "abstract": "  Gene activation in eukaryotes involves the concerted action of histone tail\nmodifiers, chromatin remodellers and transcription factors, whose precise\ncoordination is currently unknown.

Pathway activation arises when production of a certain\nbiomolecule is required due to changing environmental conditions. Under the\npremise that biological systems have been optimized through evolutionary\nprocesses, a biologically meaningful optimal control problem is posed. In this\nsetup, the enzyme concentrations are assumed to be time dependent and\nconstrained by a limited overall enzyme production capacity, while the\noptimization criterion accounts for both time and resource usage.\n  Using geometric arguments we establish the bang-bang nature of the solution\nand reveal that each reaction must be sequentially activated in the same order\nas they appear in the pathway.

Of particular importance for\nbiological applications are networks in which the indegree for each variable is\nbounded by a fixed constant, as was stressed by Kauffman in his original\npapers.\n  An important question is which conditions on the network topology can rule\nout exponentially long periodic orbits in the system. In this paper we consider\ncooperative systems, i.e. systems with positive feedback interconnections among\nall variables, which in a continuous setting guarantees a very stable dynamics.\nIn Part I of this paper we presented a construction that shows that for an\narbitrary constant 0<c<2 and sufficiently large n there exist n-dimensional\nBoolean cooperative networks in which both the indegree and outdegree of each\nfor each variable is bounded by two (bi-quadratic networks) and which\nnevertheless contain periodic orbits of length at least c^n.\n  In this part, we prove an inverse result showing that for sufficiently large\nn and for 0<c<2 sufficiently close to 2, any n-dimensional cooperative,\nbi-quadratic Boolean network with a cycle of length at least c^n must have a\nlarge proportion of variables with indegree 1. Such systems therefore share a\nstructural similarity to the systems constructed in Part I.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jan 2008 20:50:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Just", "Winfried", ""], ["Enciso", "German", ""]]}]
