EMT can also be co-opted by cancer cells to\nacquire metastatic potential and drug-resistance. Recent research has argued\nthat epithelial (E) cells can undergo either a partial EMT to attain a hybrid\nepithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype that typically displays collective\nmigration, or a complete EMT to adopt a mesenchymal (M) phenotype that shows\nindividual migration. The core EMT regulatory network -\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 - has been identified by various studies, but how\nthis network regulates the transitions among the E, E/M, and M phenotypes\nremains controversial. Two major mathematical models - ternary chimera switch\n(TCS) and cascading bistable switches (CBS) - that both focus on the\nmiR-34/SNAIL/miR-200/ZEB1 network, have been proposed to elucidate the EMT\ndynamics, but a detailed analysis of how well either or both of these two\nmodels can capture recent experimental observations about EMT dynamics remains\nto be done. Results: Here, via an integrated experimental and theoretical\napproach, we first show that both these two models can be used to understand\nthe two-step transition of EMT - E-E/M-M, the different responses of SNAIL and\nZEB1 to exogenous TGF-b and the irreversibility of complete EMT. Next, we\npresent new experimental results that tend to discriminate between these two\nmodels. We show that ZEB1 is present at intermediate levels in the hybrid E/M\nH1975 cells, and that in HMLE cells, overexpression of SNAIL is not sufficient\nto initiate EMT in the absence of ZEB1 and FOXC2. Conclusions: These\nexperimental results argue in favor of the TCS model proposing that\nmiR-200/ZEB1 behaves as a three-way decision-making switch enabling transitions\namong the E, hybrid E/M and M phenotypes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 19:57:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Jia", "Dongya", ""], ["Jolly", "Mohit Kumar", ""], ["Tripathi", "Satyendra C.", ""], ["Hollander", "Petra Den", ""], ["Huang", "Bin", ""], ["Lu", "Mingyang", ""], ["Celiktas", "Muge", ""], ["Ramirez-Pe\u00f1a", "Esmeralda", ""], ["Ben-Jacob", "Eshel", ""], ["Onuchic", "Jos\u00e9 N.", ""], ["Hanash", "Samir M.", ""], ["Mani", "Sendurai A.", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02126", "submitter": "Andrea Agazzi", "authors": "Andrea Agazzi, Amir Dembo and Jean-Pierre Eckmann", "title": "Large deviations theory for Markov jump models of chemical reaction\n  networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove a sample path Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for a class of jump\nprocesses whose rates are not uniformly Lipschitz continuous in phase space.\nBuilding on it we further establish the corresponding Wentzell-Freidlin (W-F)\n(infinite time horizon) asymptotic theory.

In contrast, strengthening the contribution of inhibitory neurons can\nhave a sharpening effect on tuning. In addition local representational topology\nalso plays a role: In the pinwheel-domain model effects were strongest within\ndomains - regions where neighboring neurons share preferred orientations.\nAround pinwheels but also within salt-and-pepper networks the effects were less\nstrong. Our model proposes that the pharmacological intervention in ferret\nincreases the contribution of excitatory cells, while the reduced expression in\nmouse increases the contribution of inhibitory cells to network activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 15:52:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Mergenthaler", "Konstantin", ""], ["Oschmann", "Franziska", ""], ["Petravicz", "Jeremy", ""], ["Roy", "Dipanjan", ""], ["Sur", "Mriganka", ""], ["Obermayer", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08842", "submitter": "Vipin Vijayan", "authors": "Vipin Vijayan, Dominic Critchlow, and Tijana Milenkovic", "title": "Alignment of dynamic networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI physics.soc-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Networks can model real-world systems in a variety of domains. Network\nalignment (NA) aims to find a node mapping that conserves similar regions\nbetween compared networks. NA is applicable to many fields, including\ncomputational biology, where NA can guide the transfer of biological knowledge\nfrom well- to poorly-studied species across aligned network regions. Existing\nNA methods can only align static networks. However, most complex real-world\nsystems evolve over time and should thus be modeled as dynamic networks. We\nhypothesize that aligning dynamic network representations of evolving systems\nwill produce superior alignments compared to aligning the systems' static\nnetwork representations, as is currently done. For this purpose, we introduce\nthe first ever dynamic NA method, DynaMAGNA++. This proof-of-concept dynamic NA\nmethod is an extension of a state-of-the-art static NA method, MAGNA++. Even\nthough both MAGNA++ and DynaMAGNA++ optimize edge as well as node conservation\nacross the aligned networks, MAGNA++ conserves static edges and similarity\nbetween static node neighborhoods, while DynaMAGNA++ conserves dynamic edges\n(events) and similarity between evolving node neighborhoods. For this purpose,\nwe introduce the first ever measure of dynamic edge conservation and rely on\nour recent measure of dynamic node conservation. Importantly, the two dynamic\nconservation measures can be optimized using any state-of-the-art NA method and\nnot just MAGNA++. We confirm our hypothesis that dynamic NA is superior to\nstatic NA, under fair comparison conditions, on synthetic and real-world\nnetworks, in computational biology and social network domains.
