Nonetheless, it might be difficult to gather\nenough data to precisely capture the behavior of a biological system into a set\nof Boolean functions. These issues can be dealt with to some extent using\nparametrised Boolean networks (ParBNs), as it allows to leave some update\nfunctions unspecified. In this paper, we attack the control problem for ParBNs\nwith asynchronous semantics. While there is an extensive work on controlling\nBNs without parameters, the problem of control for ParBNs has not been in fact\naddressed yet. The goal of control is to ensure the stabilisation of a system\nin a given state using as few interventions as possible. There are many ways to\ncontrol BN dynamics. Here, we consider the one-step approach in which the\nsystem is instantaneously perturbed out of its actual state. A naive approach\nto handle control of ParBNs is using parameter scan and solve the control\nproblem for each parameter valuation separately using known techniques for\nnon-parametrised BNs. This approach is however highly inefficient as the\nparameter space of ParBNs grows doubly-exponentially in the worst case. In this\npaper, we propose a novel semi-symbolic algorithm for the one-step control\nproblem of ParBNs, that builds on a symbolic data structures to avoid scanning\nindividual parameters.

While traditional parameter optimization\nmethods have been focusing on finding the best parameter vector, in most\ncircumstances modelers would like to find a set of parameter vectors that\ngenerate similar system dynamics and results. This paper proposes a general\n$\\alpha$-$\\beta$-$\\gamma$ rule to return an acceptable parameter region of the\nstochastic Hill function based on a quasi-Newton stochastic optimization\n(QNSTOP) algorithm. Different objective functions are investigated\ncharacterizing different features of the simulation-based empirical data, among\nwhich the approximate maximum log-likelihood method is recommended for general\napplications. Numerical results demonstrate that with an appropriate parameter\nvector value, the stochastic Hill function model depicts the multisite\nphosphorylation process well except the initial (transient) period.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 10:27:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Minghan", ""], ["Ahmadian", "Mansooreh", ""], ["Watson", "Layne", ""], ["Cao", "Yang", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06524", "submitter": "Sohei Tasaki", "authors": "Sohei Tasaki, Madoka Nakayama, Izumi Takagi, Jun-ichi Wakita and\n  Wataru Shoji", "title": "Necessary and sufficient condition for hysteresis in the mathematical\n  model of the cell type regulation of Bacillus subtilis", "comments": "24 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.CB q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The key to a robust life system is to ensure that each cell population is\nmaintained in an appropriate state. In this work, a mathematical model was used\nto investigate the control of the switching between the migrating and\nnon-migrating states of the Bacillus subtilis cell population. In this case,\nthe motile cells and matrix producers were the predominant cell types in the\nmigrating cell population and non-migrating state, respectively, and could be\nsuitably controlled according to the environmental conditions and cell density\ninformation. A minimal smooth model consisting of four ordinary differential\nequations was used as the mathematical model to control the B. subtilis cell\ntypes. Furthermore, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the hysteresis,\nwhich pertains to the change in the pheromone concentration, were clarified. In\ngeneral, the hysteretic control of the cell state enables stable switching\nbetween the migrating and growth states of the B. subtilis cell population,\nthereby facilitating the biofilm life cycle. The results of corresponding\nculture experiments were examined, and the obtained corollaries were used to\ndevelop a model to input environmental conditions, especially, the external pH.\nOn this basis, the environmental conditions were incorporated in a simulation\nmodel for the cell type control. In combination with a mathematical model of\nthe cell population dynamics, a prediction model for colony growth involving\nmultiple cell states, including concentric circular colonies of B. subtilis,\ncould be established.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2020 15:39:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2021 03:54:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tasaki", "Sohei", ""], ["Nakayama", "Madoka", ""], ["Takagi", "Izumi", ""], ["Wakita", "Jun-ichi", ""], ["Shoji", "Wataru", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.06577", "submitter": "Guilherme Innocentini", "authors": "Guilherme C.P.

This is in part due to challenges associated with\ndelineating the interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their\ntarget genes. A possible path forward in this issue is provided by increasingly\navailable expression data as a basis for linking differentiation stages and\ngene activities. Here, we present a novel hierarchical approach to identify\ncharacteristic expression peak patterns that global regulators expose along the\ndifferentiation path of cell lineages. Based on such simple patterns, we\nidentify cell state-specific marker genes and extract TFs that likely drive\ntheir differentiation. Integration of the mean expression values of\nstage-specific key player genes yields a distinct peaking pattern for each\nlineage that is used to identify further genes in the dataset behaving\nsimilarly.
