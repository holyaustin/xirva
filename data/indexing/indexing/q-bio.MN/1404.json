This hypothesis and its consequences can be studied by kinetic\nmodels in which enzyme profiles are chosen by optimality principles. In\nenzyme-optimal states, active enzymes must provide benefits: a higher enzyme\nlevel must provide a metabolic benefit to justify the additional enzyme cost.\nThis entails general relations between metabolic fluxes, reaction elasticities,\nand enzyme costs, the laws of metabolic economics. The laws can be formulated\nusing economic potentials and loads, state variables that quantify how\nmetabolites, reactions, and enzymes affect the metabolic performance in a\nsteady state. Economic balance equations link them to fluxes, reaction\nelasticities, and enzyme levels locally in the network. Economically feasible\nfluxes must be free of futile cycles and must lead from lower to higher\neconomic potentials, just like thermodynamics makes them lead from higher to\nlower chemical potentials. Metabolic economics provides algebraic conditions\nfor economical fluxes, which are independent of the underlying kinetic models.\nIt justifies and extends the principle of minimal fluxes and shows how to\nconstruct kinetic models in enzyme-optimal states, where all enzymes have a\npositive influence on the metabolic performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2014 17:45:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Liebermeister", "Wolfram", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.5345", "submitter": "Zhiyuan Li", "authors": "Zhiyuan Li, Simone Bianco, Zhaoyang Zhang, Chao Tang", "title": "Generic Properties of Random Gene Regulatory Networks", "comments": "4 figures", "journal-ref": "Quantitative Biology, December 2013, Volume 1, Issue 4, pp 253-260", "doi": "10.1007/s40484-014-0026-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modeling gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is an important topic in systems\nbiology.

Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving\nsystem subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these\nprocesses to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple\nbiological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the\nmicroenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the\ncell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways\nthat are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a\nmassive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e.\ngenotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the\nsurface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as\na means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to\neasily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this\nheterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More\nspecifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different\naspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the\nimpact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from\ngenotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway\nactivity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:37:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gerlee", "Philip", ""], ["Kim", "Eunjung", ""], ["Anderson", "Alexander R.

Examples include metabolism where a handful of building blocks\nmediate between multiple input nutrients and multiple output biomass\ncomponents, and signaling networks where information from numerous receptor\ntypes passes through a small set of signaling pathways to regulate multiple\noutput genes. Little is known, however, about how bow-tie architectures evolve.\nHere, we address the evolution of bow-tie architectures using simulations of\nmulti-layered systems evolving to fulfill a given input-output goal. We find\nthat bow-ties spontaneously evolve when two conditions are met: (i) the\nevolutionary goal is rank deficient, where the rank corresponds to the minimal\nnumber of input features on which the outputs depend, and (ii) The effects of\nmutations on interaction intensities between components are described by\nproduct rule - namely the mutated element is multiplied by a random number.\nProduct-rule mutations are more biologically realistic than the commonly used\nsum-rule mutations that add a random number to the mutated element. These\nconditions robustly lead to bow-tie structures. The minimal width of the\nintermediate network layers (the waist or knot of the bow-tie) equals the rank\nof the evolutionary goal.
