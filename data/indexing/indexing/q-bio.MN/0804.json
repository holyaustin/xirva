This paper will be denoted as SDS III.\nThe existence of a dynamical potential with both local and global meanings in\ngeneral nonequilibrium processes has been controversial. Following an earlier\nexplicit construction by one of us (Ao, J. Phys. {\\bf A37}, L25 '04,\narXiv:0803.4356, referred to as SDS II), in the present paper we show\nrigorously its existence for a generic class of situations in physical and\nbiological sciences. The local dynamical meaning of this potential function is\ndemonstrated via a special stochastic differential equation and its global\nsteady-state meaning via a novel and explicit form of Fokker-Planck equation,\nthe zero mass limit. We also give a procedure to obtain the special stochastic\ndifferential equation for any given Fokker-Planck equation. No detailed balance\ncondition is required in our demonstration. For the first time we obtain here a\nformula to describe the noise induced shift in drift force comparing to the\nsteady state distribution, a phenomenon extensively observed in numerical\nstudies. The comparison to two well known stochastic integration methods, Ito\nand Stratonovich, are made ready. Such comparison was made elsewhere (Ao, Phys.\nLife Rev. {\\bf 2} (2005) 117. q-bio/0605020).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2008 15:31:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ao", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0977", "submitter": "Sitabhra Sinha", "authors": "Sitabhra Sinha", "title": "From Network Structure to Dynamics and Back Again: Relating dynamical\n  stability and connection topology in biological complex systems", "comments": "15 pages, 6 figures, to appear in Proceedings of \"Dynamics On and Of\n  Complex Networks\", ECSS'07 Satellite Workshop, Dresden, Oct 1-5, 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-0-8176-4751-3_1", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The recent discovery of universal principles underlying many complex networks\noccurring across a wide range of length scales in the biological world has\nspurred physicists in trying to understand such features using techniques from\nstatistical physics and non-linear dynamics.

We also studied the effect of dynamic disorders on the\nproposed biochemical switch, in which the enzymatic reaction rates, instead of\nconstant, appear as stochastic functions of time. We showed that the system is\nrobust to dynamic disorder at bulk concentration. But if the dynamic disorder\nis quasi-static, large fluctuations of the switch response behavior may be\nobserved at low concentrations. Such fluctuation is relevant to many biological\nfunctions.
