The objective of the present work is to describe affinity maturation of\nB lymphocytes (in which random events are perhaps the most characteristic), and\nto study a possible network model of immune memory. In our model stochastic\nprocesses govern all events. A major novelty of this approach is that it\npermits studying random variations in the immune process. Four basic components\nare simulated in the model: non-immune self cells, nonself cells (pathogens), B\nlymphocytes, and bone marrow cells that produce naive B lymphocytes. A point in\na generalized shape space plus the size of the corresponding population\nrepresents nonself and non-immune self cells. On the other hand, each\nindividual B cell is represented by a disc that models its recognition region\nin the shape space. Infection is simulated by an \"injection\" of nonself cells\ninto the system. Division of pathogens may instigate an attack of naive B\ncells, which in turn may induce clonal proliferation and hypermutation in the\nattacking B cells, and which eventually may slow down and stop the exponential\ngrowth of pathogens. Affinity maturation of newly produced B cells becomes\nexpressed as a result of selection when the number of pathogens decreases.\nUnder favorable conditions, the expanded primary B cell clones may stimulate\nthe expansion of secondary B cell clones carrying complementary receptors to\nthe stimulating B cells. Like in a hall of mirrors, the image of pathogens in\nthe primary B cell clones then will be reflected in secondary B cell clones.\nThis \"ping-pong\" game may survive for a long time even in the absence of the\npathogen, creating a local network memory. This memory ensures that repeated\ninfection by the same pathogen will be eliminated more efficiently.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2015 14:42:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Szabados", "Tam\u00e1s", ""], ["Tusn\u00e1dy", "G\u00e1bor", ""], ["Varga", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3", ""], ["Bak\u00e1cs", "Tibor", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.00925", "submitter": "Sriganesh Srihari Dr", "authors": "Sriganesh Srihari and Hon Wai Leong", "title": "Parameterized Algorithms for Clustering PPI Networks", "comments": "10 pages, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.CE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the advent of high-throughput wet lab technologies the amount of protein\ninteraction data available publicly has increased substantially, in turn\nspurring a plethora of computational methods for in silico knowledge discovery\nfrom this data.

But, just because its complexity, it provides more\ninformation about the rate constants than Michaelis-Menten curve does.\n  Finally, we get a better replacement of the Michaelis-Menten equation by\ncombing A(S,E)=0 and the equation $dP/dt=k_2C(t)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 May 2015 17:33:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Banghe", ""], ["Li", "Bo", ""], ["Shen", "Yuefeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.05179", "submitter": "Xiao-Jun Tian", "authors": "Xiao-Jun Tian, Hang Zhang, Jens Sannerud, and Jianhua Xing", "title": "Achieving Diverse and Monoallelic Olfactory Receptor Selection Through\n  Dual-Objective Optimization Design", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n  2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1601722113", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.NC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Multiple-objective optimization is common in biological systems. In the\nmammalian olfactory system, each sensory neuron stochastically expresses only\none out of up to thousands of olfactory receptor (OR) gene alleles; at organism\nlevel the types of expressed ORs need to be maximized. Existing models focus\nonly on monoallele activation, and cannot explain recent observations in\nmutants, especially the reduced global diversity of expressed ORs in G9a/GLP\nknockouts. In this work we integrated existing information on OR expression,\nand constructed a comprehensive model that has all its components based on\nphysical interactions. Analyzing the model reveals an evolutionarily optimized\nthree-layer regulation mechanism, which includes zonal segregation, epigenetic\nbarrier crossing coupled to a negative feedback loop that mechanistically\ndiffers from previous theoretical proposals, and a previously unidentified\nenhancer competition step. This model not only recapitulates monoallelic OR\nexpression, but also elucidates how the olfactory system maximizes and\nmaintains the diversity of OR expression, and has multiple predictions\nvalidated by existing experimental results. Through making analogy to a\nphysical system with thermally activated barrier crossing and comparative\nreverse engineering analyses, the study reveals that the olfactory receptor\nselection system is optimally designed, and particularly underscores\ncooperativity and synergy as a general design principle for multi-objective\noptimization in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2015 20:41:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 18:49:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 19:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 14:08:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2016 20:41:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Tian", "Xiao-Jun", ""], ["Zhang", "Hang", ""], ["Sannerud", "Jens", ""], ["Xing", "Jianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.05193", "submitter": "Steven Woodhouse", "authors": "Jasmin Fisher, Ali Sinan K\\\"oksal, Nir Piterman and Steven Woodhouse", "title": "Synthesising Executable Gene Regulatory Networks from Single-cell Gene\n  Expression Data", "comments": "Final published version to appear in Computer Aided Verification\n  (CAV), Springer, July 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.LO q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent experimental advances in biology allow researchers to obtain gene\nexpression profiles at single-cell resolution over hundreds, or even thousands\nof cells at once.

Chemical concentration measurements start with the binding of\nligand molecules to receptor proteins, which is an inherently noisy process,\nespecially at low concentrations. The signaling networks that transmit the\ninformation on the ligand concentration from the receptors into the cell have\nto filter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much as possible. These networks,\nhowever, are also stochastic in nature, which means that they will also add\nnoise to the transmitted signal. In this review, we will first discuss how the\ndiffusive transport and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor\ncorrelation time, and then how downstream signaling pathways integrate the\nnoise in the receptor state; we will discuss how the number of receptors, the\nreceptor correlation time, and the effective integration time together set a\nfundamental limit on the precision of sensing. We then discuss how cells can\nremove the receptor noise while simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise\nin the signaling network. We describe why this mechanism of time integration\nrequires three classes of resources---receptors and their integration time,\nreadout molecules, energy---and how each resource class sets a fundamental\nsensing limit. We also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood\nestimation, the role of receptor cooperativity, and how cellular copy protocols\ndiffer from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational\nliterature, explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the\nLandauer limit on the optimal trade-off between accuracy and energetic cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 09:27:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Becker", "Nils B.", ""], ["Ouldridge", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Mugler", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07335", "submitter": "Guy Karlebach", "authors": "Guy Karlebach", "title": "A Novel Algorithm for the Maximal Fit Problem in Boolean Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.CE cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are increasingly used for explaining\nbiological processes with complex transcriptional regulation.

One canonical cell-fate decision that\ncancer cells undergo is Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and its\nreverse Mesenchymal-to-Epithelial Transition (MET). While transitioning between\nthese two phenotypes - epithelial and mesenchymal - cells can also attain a\nhybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (i.e. partial or intermediate EMT) phenotype.\nCells in this phenotype have mixed epithelial (e.g. adhesion) and mesenchymal\n(e.g. migration) properties, thereby allowing them to move collectively as\nclusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). If these clusters enter the\ncirculation, they can be more apoptosis-resistant and more capable of\ninitiating metastatic lesions than cancer cells moving individually with wholly\nmesenchymal phenotypes, having undergo a complete EMT. Here, we review the\noperating principles of the core regulatory network for EMT/MET that acts as a\nthree-way switch giving rise to three distinct phenotypes - epithelial,\nmesenchymal and hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal. We further characterize this\nhybrid E/M phenotype in terms of its capabilities in terms of collective cell\nmigration, tumor-initiation, cell-cell communication, and drug resistance. We\nelucidate how the highly interconnected coupling between these modules\ncoordinates cell-fate decisions among a population of cancer cells in the\ndynamic tumor, hence facilitating tumor-stoma interactions, formation of CTC\nclusters, and consequently cancer metastasis. Finally, we discuss the multiple\nadvantages that the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype have as compared to\na complete EMT phenotype and argue that these collectively migrating cells are\nthe primary 'bad actors' of metastasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2015 21:18:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Jolly", "Mohit Kumar", ""], ["Boareto", "Marcelo", ""], ["Huang", "Bin", ""], ["Jia", "Dongya", ""], ["Lu", "Mingyang", ""], ["Onuchic", "Jose N", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""], ["Ben-Jacob", "Eshel", ""]]}]
