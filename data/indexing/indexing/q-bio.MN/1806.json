Variation in $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ is especially important\nfor stability in highly complex systems, in which the probability of stability\nwould otherwise be negligible.

Many computational\nmethods have been performed to detect micoRNAs association with cancer, but\nmore effort is needed with higher accuracy. Increasing research has shown that\nrelationship between microRNAs and TFs play a significant role in the diagnosis\nof cancer. Therefore, we developed a new computational framework (CAMIRADA) to\nidentify cancer-related microRNA based on the relationship between microRNAs\nand disease genes (DG) in the protein network, the functional relationships\nbetween microRNAs and Transcription Factors (TF) on the co-expression network,\nand the relationship between microRNAs and the Differential Expression Gene\n(DEG) on co-expression network. The CAMIRADA was applied to assess breast\ncancer data from two HMDD and miR2Disease databases.
