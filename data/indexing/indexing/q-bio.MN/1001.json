Many methods have been developed to use statistical\ncorrelations in high-throughput datasets to infer such interactions. However,\ncellular pathways are highly cooperative, often requiring the joint effect of\nmany molecules, and few methods have been proposed to explicitly identify such\nhigher-order interactions, partially due to the fact that the notion of\nmultivariate statistical dependency itself remains imprecisely defined. We\ndefine the concept of dependence among multiple variables using maximum entropy\ntechniques and introduce computational tests for their identification.\nSynthetic network results reveal that this procedure uncovers dependencies even\nin undersampled regimes, when the joint probability distribution cannot be\nreliably estimated. Analysis of microarray data from human B cells reveals that\nthird-order statistics, but not second-order ones, uncover relationships\nbetween genes that interact in a pathway to cooperatively regulate a common set\nof targets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2010 16:06:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Margolin", "Adam A.", ""], ["Wang", "Kai", ""], ["Califano", "Andrea", ""], ["Nemenman", "Ilya", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.1944", "submitter": "Ed Reznik", "authors": "Ed Reznik, Daniel Segr\\`e", "title": "On the Stability of Metabolic Cycles", "comments": "26 pages, 7 figures, Accepted by Journal of Theoretical Biology,\n  Corrected Section on Non-autocatalytic cycles", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the stability properties of two different classes of metabolic\ncycles using a combination of analytical and computational methods.
