New\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\nODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem\nbecause each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one\ntimeslice. A \"loopy belief propagation\" algorithm solves this factorized\napproximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage\nof the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial\nin the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the\nbiochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,\nand we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods. BPPE\nis demonstrated for a novel model of Akt activation dynamics including\nredox-mediated inactivation of PTEN.

Our approach allows us to exploit methods\nfrom Bayesian statistics, including efficient exploration of models spaces and\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces, and the ability to rank models with respect\nto their ability to generate certain types of data. Bayesian model selection\nfurthermore automatically strikes a balance between complexity and (predictive\nor explanatory) performance of mathematical models. In order to deal with the\ncomplexities of molecular systems we employ an approximate Bayesian computation\nscheme which only requires us to simulate from different competing models in\norder to arrive at rational criteria for choosing between them. We illustrate\nthe advantages resulting from combining the design and modeling (or in-silico\nprototyping) stages currently seen as separate in synthetic biology by\nreference to deterministic and stochastic model systems exhibiting adaptive and\nswitch-like behavior, as well as bacterial two-component signaling systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Mar 2011 11:51:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Barnes", "Chris", ""], ["Silk", "Daniel", ""], ["Sheng", "Xia", ""], ["Stumpf", "Michael P.

By non-redundant, we mean that the\naccounting of evidence for every interaction should be faithful: each\nindependent experimental support is counted exactly once, no more, no less.\nWhile many interactions are shared among public repositories, none of them\ncontains the complete known interactome for any model organism. In addition,\nthe annotations of the same experimental result by different repositories often\ndisagree. This brings up the issue of which annotation to keep while\nconsolidating evidences that are the same. The iRefIndex database, including\ninteractions from most popular repositories with a standardized protein\nnomenclature, represents a significant advance in all aspects, especially in\ncomprehensiveness. However, iRefIndex aims to maintain all\ninformation/annotation from original sources and requires users to perform\nadditional processing to fully achieve the aforementioned goals.\n  To address issues with iRefIndex and to achieve our goals, we have developed\nppiTrim, a script that processes iRefIndex to produce non-redundant,\nconsistently annotated datasets of physical interactions. Our script proceeds\nin three stages: mapping all interactants to gene identifiers and removing all\nundesired raw interactions, deflating potentially expanded complexes, and\nreconciling for each interaction the annotation labels among different source\ndatabases. As an illustration, we have processed the three largest organismal\ndatasets: yeast, human and fruitfly. While ppiTrim can resolve most apparent\nconflicts between different labelings, we also discovered some unresolvable\ndisagreements mostly resulting from different annotation policies among\nrepositories.\n  URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CBBresearch/Yu/downloads/ppiTrim.html\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Mar 2011 22:47:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 02:12:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 01:53:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Stojmirovi\u0107", "Aleksandar", ""], ["Yu", "Yi-Kuo", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.2273", "submitter": "Markus Buehler", "authors": "David I.

An olog is like a \"concept web\" or \"semantic network\" except\nthat it follows a rigorous mathematical formulation based on category theory.\nThis key difference ensures that an olog is unambiguous, highly adaptable to\nevolution and change, and suitable for sharing concepts with other olog. We\nconsider simple cases of alpha-helical and amyloid-like protein filaments\nsubjected to axial extension and develop an olog representation of their\nstructural and resulting mechanical properties. We also construct a\nrepresentation of a social network in which people send text-messages to their\nnearest neighbors and act as a team to perform a task. We show that the olog\nfor the protein and the olog for the social network feature identical\ncategory-theoretic representations, and we proceed to precisely explicate the\nanalogy or isomorphism between them. The examples presented here demonstrate\nthat the intrinsic nature of a complex system, which in particular includes a\nprecise relationship between structure and function at different hierarchical\nlevels, can be effectively represented by an olog. This, in turn, allows for\ncomparative studies between disparate materials or fields of application, and\nresults in novel approaches to derive functionality in the design of de novo\nhierarchical systems.
