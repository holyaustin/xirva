The question is then whether electronic neural\nnetworks (electronic schemes that act somewhat similarly to human brains) can\nbe built to perform this type of function. Although the field of neural\nnetworks has developed for many years, a key element, namely the synapses\nbetween adjacent neurons, has been lacking a satisfactory electronic\nrepresentation.
