In this paper we propose a\nmodel-based approach to analyze what we will refer to as the dynamic tomography\nof such time-evolving networks. Our approach offers an intuitive but powerful\ntool to infer the semantic underpinnings of each actor, such as its social\nroles or biological functions, underlying the observed network topologies. Our\nmodel builds on earlier work on a mixed membership stochastic blockmodel for\nstatic networks, and the state-space model for tracking object trajectory. It\novercomes a major limitation of many current network inference techniques,\nwhich assume that each actor plays a unique and invariant role that accounts\nfor all its interactions with other actors; instead, our method models the role\nof each actor as a time-evolving mixed membership vector that allows actors to\nbehave differently over time and carry out different roles/functions when\ninteracting with different peers, which is closer to reality. We present an\nefficient algorithm for approximate inference and learning using our model; and\nwe applied our model to analyze a social network between monks (i.e., the\nSampson's network), a dynamic email communication network between the Enron\nemployees, and a rewiring gene interaction network of fruit fly collected\nduring its full life cycle.

However, the directed flow from origins to destinations\nwas induced via a potential function that was heuristic. Here, with a\ntheoretically sound approach called the channel mode, we extend our earlier\nwork for directed information flow.

For each network node, the channel mode combines the solutions of\nemitting and absorbing modes in the same context, producing what we call a\nchannel tensor. The entries of the channel tensor at each node can be\ninterpreted as the amount of flow passing through that node from an origin to a\ndestination.

For technical reasons, comparing large networks is\ncomputationally infeasible, and thus heuristics such as the degree distribution\nhave been sought. It is easy to demonstrate that two networks are different by\nsimply showing a short list of properties in which they differ. It is much\nharder to show that two networks are similar, as it requires demonstrating\ntheir similarity in all of their exponentially many properties. Clearly, it is\ncomputationally prohibitive to analyze all network properties, but the larger\nthe number of constraints we impose in determining network similarity, the more\nlikely it is that the networks will truly be similar.\n  We introduce a new systematic measure of a network's local structure that\nimposes a large number of similarity constraints on networks being compared. In\nparticular, we generalize the degree distribution, which measures the number of\nnodes 'touching' k edges, into distributions measuring the number of nodes\n'touching' k graphlets, where graphlets are small connected non-isomorphic\nsubgraphs of a large network. Our new measure of network local structure\nconsists of 73 graphlet degree distributions (GDDs) of graphlets with 2-5\nnodes, but it is easily extendible to a greater number of constraints (i.e.\ngraphlets). Furthermore, we show a way to combine the 73 GDDs into a network\n'agreement' measure. Based on this new network agreement measure, we show that\nalmost all of the 14 eukaryotic PPI networks, including human, are better\nmodeled by geometric random graphs than by Erdos-Reny, random scale-free, or\nBarabasi-Albert scale-free networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jan 2009 00:30:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Przulj", "Natasa", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4785", "submitter": "Golan Bel", "authors": "Golan Bel and Ilya Nemenman", "title": "Ergodic and Nonergodic Anomalous Diffusion in Coupled Stochastic\n  Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "New J.

Integrating out the latter, we derive\nthe long time behaviour of the mean square displacement. Anomalous diffusion is\nfound. Since the diffusion exponent can not be predicted using a simple scaling\nargument, anomalous scaling appears as well. We also find that the coupling can\nlead to ergodic or non-ergodic behaviour of the studied process. We compare our\ntheoretical predictions with numerical simulations and find an excellent\nagreement.
