Although the majority of enzymatic networks have very\nelaborate structures, there are many experimental observations indicating that\nsome turnover rates still follow a simple Michaelis-Menten relation with a\nhyperbolic dependence on a substrate concentration. The original\nMichaelis-Menten mechanism has been derived as a steady-state approximation for\na single-pathway enzymatic chain. The validity of this mechanism for many\ncomplex enzymatic systems is surprising. To determine general conditions when\nthis relation might be observed in experiments, enzymatic networks consisting\nof coupled parallel pathways are investigated theoretically. It is found that\nthe Michaelis-Menten equation is satisfied for specific relations between\nchemical rates, and it also corresponds to the situation with no fluxes between\nparallel pathways.
