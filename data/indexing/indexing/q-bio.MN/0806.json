The combination of the two quantitatively\ncharacterizes the discrete biological interactions. A number of simple networks\nwere analyzed. The main results include: we proved the theorems to determine\nbistable states and oscillation behaviors of networks, we showed that time\ndelays are essential for oscillation structures, we proved that single variable\nnetworks do not have chaotic behaviors, and we explained why one signal can\nhave multiply responses. In addition, we applied the present method to the\nanalysis of the MAPK cascade, feed-forward loops, and mitosis cycle of budding\nyeast cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2008 19:55:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lyu", "Suping", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2331", "submitter": "Raj Chakrabarti", "authors": "Raj Chakrabarti, Herschel Rabitz, George McLendon", "title": "Optimal Control of Evolutionary Dynamics", "comments": "Extends \"Mutagenic evidence for the optimal control of evolutionary\n  dynamics\" (accepted, Physical Review Letters)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Elucidating the fitness measures optimized during the evolution of complex\nbiological systems is a major challenge in evolutionary theory.

Even in such a heavily simplified method, which\ndisregards most of the dynamic aspects of biochemistry, one is faced with\nfundamental questions, such as how the chemical reaction systems should be\nreduced to a graph retaining as much functional information as possible from\nthe original reaction system. In such graph representations, should the edges\ngo between substrates and products, or substrates and substrates, or both?\nShould vertices represent substances or reactions? Different definitions encode\ndifferent information about the reaction system. In this paper we evaluate four\ndifferent graph representations of metabolism, applied to data from different\norganisms and databases. The graph representations are evaluated by comparing\nthe overlap between clusters (network modules) and annotated functions, and\nalso by comparing the set of identified currency metabolites with those that\nother authors have identified using qualitative biological arguments. We find\nthat a \"substance network,\" where all metabolites participating in a reaction\nare connected, is relatively better than others, evaluated both with respect to\nthe functional overlap between modules and functions and to the number and\nidentity of identified currency metabolites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jun 2008 11:47:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2008 12:31:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Holme", "Petter", ""], ["Huss", "Mikael", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.3048", "submitter": "Dejan Stokic", "authors": "Dejan Stokic, Rudolf Hanel, Stefan Thurner", "title": "A fast and efficient gene-network reconstruction method from multiple\n  over-expression experiments", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks presents one of the big\nchallenges in systems biology.

Model scalability becomes of paramount interest. In an effort to start\naddressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and\nmulti-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While \"multi-scale\" refers\nto employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular\nnetwork to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic\nenvironment, \"multi-resolution\" is achieved through algorithms that classify\ncells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the\nresolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources\nwhere and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive\npower of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.\nUsing a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four\ndifferent computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,\nthree of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution\nsimulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we\nrank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation\nruns versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution\nresults of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the\nunderlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Le", ""], ["Chen", "L.

A hybrid\nagent-based model has been developed to investigate the synergistic and\nantagonistic cell motility-impacting effects of three microenvironment\nvariables simultaneously: chemoattraction, haptotactic permission, and\nbiomechanical constraint or resistance. Reflecting distinct cell-specific\nintracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety\nof spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors\nwith differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to\nchemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating\npermission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with\ngreater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the\nligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous\npopulation of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal\ndiversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data\ncan be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of\npopulation heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system\nbecomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase.
