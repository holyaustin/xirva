The method provides the {\\it a posteriori} probability\nthat a given gene regulates positively, negatively or does not regulate each\none of the network genes. This approach also allows the introduction of prior\nknowledge and the quantification of the information gain from experimental data\nused in the inference procedure. This information gain can be used to chose\ngenes to be perturbed in subsequent experiments in order to refine the\nknowledge about the architecture of an underlying gene regulatory network. The\nperformance of the proposed approach has been studied by {\\it in numero}\nexperiments.

Much less is known\nabout the factors that influence the evolutionary accessibility of such\nphenotypes, a pre-requisite for their emergence in a population. Here, we\ninvestigate the influence of environmental quality on the accessibility of\nadaptive phenotypes of Escherichia coli's central metabolic network. We used an\nestablished flux-balance model of metabolism as the basis for a\ngenotype-phenotype map (GPM). We quantified the effects of seven qualitatively\ndifferent environments (corresponding to both carbohydrate and gluconeogenic\nmetabolic substrates) on the structure of this GPM. We found that the GPM has a\nmore rugged structure in qualitatively poorer environments, suggesting that\nadaptive phenotypes could be intrinsically less accessible in such\nenvironments. Nevertheless, on average ~74% of the genotype can be altered by\nneutral drift, in the environment where the GPM is most rugged; this could\nallow evolving populations to circumvent such ruggedness. Furthermore, we found\nthat the normalized mutual information (NMI) of genotype differences relative\nto phenotype differences, which measures the GPM's capacity to transmit\ninformation about phenotype differences, is positively correlated with\n(simulation-based) estimates of the accessibility of adaptive phenotypes in\ndifferent environments.
