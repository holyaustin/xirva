The model rationalizes an unexpected poor correlation between the\nmid-point of in vivo promoter activity profiles and in vitro equilibrium\nconstants for MarA binding to promoter sequences. Analysis of the promoter\nactivity data using the model yielded the following predictions regarding\nactivation mechanisms: (1) MarA activation of the marRAB, sodA, and micF\npromoters involves a net acceleration of the kinetics of transitions after RNA\npolymerase binding, up to and including promoter escape and message elongation;\n(2) RNA polymerase binds to these promoters with nearly unit occupancy in the\nabsence of MarA, making recruitment of polymerase an insignificant factor in\nactivation of these promoters; and (3) instead of recruitment, activation of\nthe micF promoter might involve a repulsion of polymerase combined with a large\nacceleration of the kinetics of polymerase activity. These predictions are\nconsistent with published chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of interactions\nbetween polymerase and the E. coli chromosome. A lack of recruitment in\ntranscriptional activation represents an exception to the textbook description\nof activation of bacterial sigma-70 promoters. However, use of accelerated\npolymerase kinetics instead of recruitment might confer a competitive advantage\nto E. coli by decreasing latency in gene regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2009 18:59:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wall", "Michael E.", ""], ["Markowitz", "David A.", ""], ["Rosner", "Judah L.", ""], ["Martin", "Robert G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1052", "submitter": "Andrea De Martino", "authors": "C.

In this task, it is important to devise\nreasonable approximation schemes that rely on the stoichiometric data only,\nbecause full-scale kinetic approaches are computationally affordable only for\nsmall networks (e.g. red blood cells, about 50 reactions). Methods commonly\nemployed are based on finding the stationary flux configurations that satisfy\nmass-balance conditions for metabolites, often coupling them to local\noptimization rules (e.g. maximization of biomass production) to reduce the size\nof the solution space to a single point. Such methods have been widely applied\nand have proven able to reproduce experimental findings for relatively simple\norganisms in specific conditions. Here we define and study a constraint-based\nmodel of cellular metabolism where neither mass balance nor flux stationarity\nare postulated, and where the relevant flux configurations optimize the global\ngrowth of the system. In the case of E. coli, steady flux states are recovered\nas solutions, though mass-balance conditions are violated for some metabolites,\nimplying a non-zero net production of the latter. Such solutions furthermore\nturn out to provide the correct statistics of fluxes for the bacterium E. coli\nin different environments and compare well with the available experimental\nevidence on individual fluxes. Conserved metabolic pools play a key role in\ndetermining growth rate and flux variability. Finally, we are able to connect\nphenomenological gene essentiality with `frozen' fluxes (i.e. fluxes with\nsmaller allowed variability) in E. coli metabolism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2009 10:33:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Martelli", "C.", ""], ["De Martino", "A.", ""], ["Marinari", "E.", ""], ["Marsili", "M.", ""], ["Castillo", "I.

The diabetic phenotype\nmakes its appearance when a sizable fraction of the $\\beta$-cells is in the OFF\nstate.
