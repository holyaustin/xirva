It\nprovides access to ITM Probe either through a web server or locally. The input,\nconsisting of a Cytoscape network, together with the desired origins and/or\ndestinations of information and a dissipation coefficient, is specified through\na query form. The results are shown as a subnetwork of significant nodes and\nseveral summary tables. Users can control the composition and appearance of the\nsubnetwork and interchange their ITM Probe results with other software tools\nthrough tab-delimited files.\n  The main strength of CytoITMprobe is its flexibility. It allows the user to\nspecify as input any Cytoscape network, rather than being restricted to the\npre-compiled protein-protein interaction networks available through the ITM\nProbe web service. Users may supply their own edge weights and\ndirectionalities. Consequently, as opposed to ITM Probe web service,\nCytoITMprobe can be applied to many other domains of network-based research\nbeyond protein-networks. It also enables seamless integration of ITM Probe\nresults with other Cytoscape plugins having complementary functionality for\ndata analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2011 22:10:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Mar 2012 22:22:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Stojmirovi\u0107", "Aleksandar", ""], ["Bliskovsky", "Alexander", ""], ["Yu", "Yi-Kuo", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.0121", "submitter": "Michael Strasser", "authors": "Michael K.

In this\ncontribution, we study the stability and dynamics of a two-stage gene\nexpression switch within a probabilistic framework inspired by the properties\nof the Pu/Gata toggle switch in myeloid progenitor cells. We focus on low mRNA\nnumbers, high protein abundance and monomeric transcription factor binding.\nContrary to the expectation from a deterministic description, this switch shows\ncomplex multi-attractor dy- namics without autoactivation and cooperativity.\nMost importantly, the four attractors of the system, which only emerge in a\nprobabilistic two-stage description, can be identified with committed and\nprimed states in cell differentiation. We first study the dynamics of the\nsystem and infer the mechanisms that move the system between attractors using\nboth the quasi-potential and the probability flux of the system. Second, we\nshow that the residence times of the system in one of the committed attractors\nare geometrically distributed and provide an analytical expression of the\ndistribution. Most importantly we find that the mean residence time increases\nlinearly with the mean protein level. Finally, we study the implications of\nthis distribution for the stability of a switch and discuss the influence of\nthe stability on a specific cell differentiation mechanism. Our model explains\nlineage priming and proposes the need of either high protein numbers or long\nterm modifications such as chromatin remodeling to achieve stable cell fate\ndecisions. Notably we present a system with high protein abundance that\nnevertheless requires a probabilistic description to exhibit multistability,\ncomplex switching dynamics and lineage priming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 09:34:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-26", "authors_parsed": [["Strasser", "Michael K.", ""], ["Theis", "Fabian J.", ""], ["Marr", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.0270", "submitter": "Mariano Beguerisse-D\\'iaz", "authors": "Mariano Beguerisse-Diaz, Radhika Desikan, Mauricio Barahona", "title": "Linear models of activation cascades: analytical solutions and\n  coarse-graining of delayed signal transduction", "comments": "18 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves\nagainst perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback\nloops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters\ndistinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in\nterms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of\nperformance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a\nmathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order\nto understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two\ncharacters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character\nbuffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased\nperturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases\nsensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive\ncharacter. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to\na less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox\nof robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an\nevolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character,\nleading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by\nnatural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary\ntime, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the\nunderlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance\ncomponents. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for\nunderstanding organismal design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 16:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.3802", "submitter": "Ana Nunes", "authors": "Tom\\'as Aquino, Elsa Abranches and Ana Nunes", "title": "Stochastic single-gene auto-regulation", "comments": "15 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.85.061913", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A detailed stochastic model of single-gene auto-regulation is established and\nits solutions are explored when mRNA dynamics is fast compared with protein\ndynamics and in the opposite regime.
