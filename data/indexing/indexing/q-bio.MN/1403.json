Therefore, their\nvalues must be estimated from time-series experimental data.\n  In recent years, it has been suggested that dynamic systems biology models\nare universally sloppy so their parameters cannot be uniquely estimated. In\nthis work, we re-examine this concept, establishing links with the notions of\nidentifiability and experimental design. Further, considering a set of\nexamples, we address the following fundamental questions: i) is sloppiness\ninherent to model structure?; ii) is sloppiness influenced by experimental data\nor noise?; iii) does sloppiness mean that parameters cannot be identified?, and\niv) can sloppiness be modified by experimental design?\n  Our results indicate that sloppiness is not equivalent to lack of structural\nor practical identifiability (although they can be related), so sloppy models\ncan be identifiable. Therefore, drawing conclusions about the possibility of\nestimating unique parameter values by sloppiness analysis can be misleading.\nChecking structural and practical identifiability analyses is a better approach\nto asses the uniqueness and confidence in parameter estimation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 11:45:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Chis", "Oana-Teodora", ""], ["Banga", "Julio R.", ""], ["Balsa-Canto", "Eva", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.1610", "submitter": "Vadim N.

These self-sustained rhythms are coordinated and\nentrained by a master circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).\nWithin the SCN, the individual rhythms of each neuron are synchronized through\nintercellular signaling. One important feature of SCN is that the synchronized\nperiod is close to the cell population mean of intrinsic periods. In this way,\nthe synchronized period of the SCN stays close to the periods of cells in\nperipheral tissues. This is important for SCN to entrain cells throughout the\nbody. However, the mechanism that drives the period of the coupled SCN cells to\nthe population mean is not known. We use mathematical modeling and analysis to\nshow that the mechanism of transcription repression plays a pivotal role in\nregulating the coupled period. Specifically, we use phase response curve\nanalysis to show that the coupled period within the SCN stays near the\npopulation mean if transcriptional repression occurs via protein sequestration.\nIn contrast, the coupled period is far from the mean if repression occurs\nthrough highly nonlinear Hill-type regulation (e.g. oligomer- or\nphosphorylation-based repression). Furthermore, we find that the timescale of\nintercellular coupling needs to be fast compared to that of intracellular\nfeedback to maintain the mean period. These findings reveal the important\nrelationship between the intracellular transcriptional feedback loop and\nintercellular coupling. This relationship explains why transcriptional\nrepression appears to occur via protein sequestration in multicellular\norganisms, mammals and Drosophila, in contrast with the phosphorylation-based\nrepression in unicellular organisms. That is, transition to protein\nsequestration is essential for synchronizing multiple cells with a period close\nto the population mean (~24hr).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 22:36:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Jae Kyoung", ""], ["Kilpatrick", "Zachary P.", ""], ["Bennett", "Matthew R.", ""], ["Josi\u0107", "Kre\u0161imir", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3265", "submitter": "Martin Jansen", "authors": "Martin Jansen", "title": "Stochastic equations for a self-regulating gene", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Int.

In general, such complexity is seen to increase with the\ncomplexity of the organism, with a concomitant increase of the accuracy and\nspecificity of the cellular processes. The question thus arises how the\ncomplexification of systems - modeled here by simple interacting birth-death\ntype processes - can lead to a reduction of the noise - described by the\nvariance of the number of molecules. To gain understanding of this issue, we\ninvestigated the difference between a single system containing molecules that\nare produced and degraded, and the same system - with the same average number\nof molecules - connected to a buffer. We modeled these systems using Ito\nstochastic differential equations in discrete time, as they allow\nstraightforward analytical developments. In general, when the molecules in the\nsystem and the buffer are positively correlated, the variance on the number of\nmolecules in the system is found to decrease compared to the equivalent system\nwithout a buffer. Only buffers that are too noisy by themselves tend to\nincrease the noise in the main system. We tested this result on two model\ncases, in which the system and the buffer contain proteins in their active and\ninactive state, or protein monomers and homodimers. We found that in the second\ntest case, where the interconversion terms are non-linear in the number of\nmolecules, the noise reduction is much more pronounced; it reaches up to 20%\nreduction of the Fano factor with the parameter values tested in numerical\nsimulations on an unperturbed birth-death model.
