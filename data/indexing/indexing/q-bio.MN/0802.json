The number of functionally unclassified\nproteins is large even for simple and well studied organisms such as baker's\nyeast. Methods for determining protein function have shifted their focus from\ntargeting specific proteins based solely on sequence homology to analyses of\nthe entire proteome based on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Since\nproteins aggregate to perform a certain function, analyzing structural\nproperties of PPI networks may provide useful clues about the biological\nfunction of individual proteins, protein complexes they participate in, and\neven larger subcellular machines.\n  We design a sensitive graph theoretic method for comparing local structures\nof node neighborhoods that demonstrates that in PPI networks, biological\nfunction of a node and its local network structure are closely related. The\nmethod groups topologically similar proteins under this measure in a PPI\nnetwork and shows that these protein groups belong to the same protein\ncomplexes, perform the same biological functions, are localized in the same\nsubcellular compartments, and have the same tissue expressions.

Numerical\nanalysis of equations describing regulation by artificial inducers revealed two\nnatural bistability parameters that can be used to control the range of inducer\nconcentrations over which the model exhibits bistability. By tuning these\nbistability parameters, we found a family of biophysically reasonable systems\nthat are consistent with an experimentally determined bistable region for\ninduction by thio-methylgalactoside (Ozbudak et al. Nature 427:737, 2004). The\nmodel predicts that bistability can be abolished when passive transport or\npermease export becomes sufficiently large; the former case is especially\nrelevant to induction by isopropyl-beta, D-thiogalactopyranoside. To model\nregulation by lactose, we developed similar equations in which allolactose, a\nmetabolic intermediate in lactose metabolism and a natural inducer of lac, is\nthe inducer. For biophysically reasonable parameter values, these equations\nyield no bistability in response to induction by lactose; however, systems with\nan unphysically small permease-dependent export effect can exhibit small\namounts of bistability for limited ranges of parameter values. These results\ncast doubt on the relevance of bistability in the lac operon within the natural\ncontext of E. coli, and help shed light on the controversy among existing\ntheoretical studies that address this issue. The results also suggest an\nexperimental approach to address the relevance of bistability in the lac operon\nwithin the natural context of E. coli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2008 22:21:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dreisigmeyer", "David W.", ""], ["Stajic", "Jelena", ""], ["Nemenman", "Ilya", ""], ["Hlavacek", "William S.", ""], ["Wall", "Michael E.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1287", "submitter": "Atul Narang", "authors": "J.

Most models in the literature assume that the inducer\nenters the cell via the carrier (permease), and exits by a diffusion-like\nprocess. The diffusive influx and carrier efflux are neglected. However,\nanalysis of the data shows that in non-induced cells, the diffusive influx is\ncomparable to the carrier influx, and in induced cells, the carrier efflux is 7\ntimes the diffusive efflux. Since bistability entails the coexistence of steady\nstates corresponding to both non-induced and induced cells, neither one of\nthese fluxes can be ignored. Here, we formulate a model accounting for both\nfluxes. We show that: (a) The thresholds of bistability are profoundly affected\nby both fluxes. The diffusive influx reduces the on threshold by enhancing\ninducer accumulation in non-induced cells. The carrier efflux increases the off\nthreshold by decreasing inducer accumulation in induced cells.

Using this model and enzyme concentrations appropriate for\nneurons, we simulated bistable MAPK activity, but bistability only was present\nwithin a relatively narrow range of activity of Raf, the first pathway kinase.\nStochastic fluctuations in molecule numbers eliminated bistability for small\nmolecule numbers, such as are expected in the volume of a dendritic spine.\nHowever, positive feedback loops have been posited from MAPK up to Raf\nactivation.
