Therefore, it has been suggested\nthat robustness against extrinsic noise increases with the level of the\nintrinsic noise. We call this phenomenon intrinsic noise-induced robustness\n(INIR). As previous studies on this phenomenon have focused on complex\nbiochemical reactions, the relation between INIR and the input--output of a\nsystem is unclear.

Moreover, the robustness against the extrinsic\nnoise is more strongly dependent on the intrinsic noise when the variance of\nthe intrinsic noise is larger than that of the input distribution. Next, we\nanalyze a threshold model in which the output depends on whether the input\nexceeds the threshold. When the threshold is equal to the mean of the input,\nINIR is realized, but when the threshold is much larger than the mean, the\nthreshold model exhibits stochastic resonance, and INIR is not always apparent.\nThe robustness against extrinsic noise and the transmitted information can be\ntraded off against one another in the linear model and the threshold model\nwithout stochastic resonance, whereas they can be simultaneously increased in\nthe threshold model with stochastic resonance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Apr 2019 06:48:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2019 03:25:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Oct 2019 01:14:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Tottori", "Takehiro", ""], ["Fujii", "Masashi", ""], ["Kuroda", "Shinya", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06973", "submitter": "Ali Jalilvand", "authors": "Ali Jalilvand, Behzad Akbari, Fatemeh Zare Mirakabad, Foad Ghaderi", "title": "Disease gene prioritization using network topological analysis from a\n  sequence based human functional linkage network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sequencing large number of candidate disease genes which cause diseases in\norder to identify the relationship between them is an expensive and\ntime-consuming task.
