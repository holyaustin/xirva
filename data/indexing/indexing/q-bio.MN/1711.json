Thermodynamically infeasible cy-cles (TICs) causing unbounded\nmetabolic flux ranges are often encountered. TICs satisfy the mass balance and\ndirectionality constraints but violate the second law of thermodynamics.\nCurrent prac-tices involve implementing additional constraints to ensure not\nonly optimal but also loopless flux distributions. However, the mixed integer\nlinear programming problems required to solve become computationally\nintractable for genome-scale metabolic models. Results: We aimed to identify\nthe fewest needed constraints sufficient for optimality under the loop-less\nrequirement. We found that loopless constraints are required only for the\nreactions that share elementary flux modes representing TICs with reactions\nthat are part of the objective function. We put forth the concept of localized\nloopless constraints (LLCs) to enforce this minimal required set of loopless\nconstraints. By combining with a novel procedure for minimal null-space\ncalculation, the computational time for loopless flux variability analysis is\nreduced by a factor of 10-150 compared to the original loopless constraints and\nby 4-20 times compared to the currently fastest method Fast-SNP with the\npercent improvement increasing with model size. Importantly, LLCs offer a\nscalable strategy for loopless flux calculations for\nmulti-compartment/multi-organism models of very large sizes (e.g. >104\nreactions) not feasible before.

We used\nthe cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) to quantify the hierarchical\norganization in the expression of collective dissemination associated and IBC\nassociated genes, and found that the CCC of both gene sets was higher in (a)\nepithelial cell lines as compared to mesenchymal cell lines and (b) IBC tumor\nsamples as compared to non-IBC breast cancer samples. A higher CCC of both\nnetworks was also correlated with a higher rate of metastatic relapse in breast\ncancer patients. Gene set enrichment analysis could not provide similar\ninsights, indicating that the CCC provides additional information regarding the\norganizational complexity of gene expression. These results suggest that\nretention of epithelial traits in disseminating tumor cells as IBC progresses\npromotes successful metastasis and the CCC may be a prognostic factor for IBC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Nov 2017 19:19:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tripathi", "Shubham", ""], ["Jolly", "Mohit Kumar", ""], ["Woodward", "Wendy A.", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""], ["Deem", "Michael W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.09124", "submitter": "Michael Deem", "authors": "Fengdan Ye, Dongya Jia, Mingyang Lu, Herbert Levine, and Michael W\n  Deem", "title": "Modularity of the metabolic gene network as a prognostic biomarker for\n  hepatocellular carcinoma", "comments": "32 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Abnormal metabolism is an emerging hallmark of cancer.

Understanding the metabolic reprogramming in\ncancer can help design therapies to target metabolism and thereby to improve\nprognosis. We have previously argued that more malignant tumors are usually\ncharacterized by a more modular expression pattern of cancer-associated genes.\nIn this work, we analyzed the expression patterns of metabolism genes in terms\nof modularity for 371 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples from the Cancer\nGenome Atlas (TCGA). We found that higher modularity significantly correlated\nwith glycolytic phenotype, later tumor stages, higher metastatic potential, and\ncancer recurrence, all of which contributed to poorer overall prognosis. Among\npatients that recurred, we found the correlation of greater modularity with\nworse prognosis during early to mid-progression. Furthermore, we developed\nmetrics to calculate individual modularity, which was shown to be predictive of\ncancer recurrence and patients' survival and therefore may serve as a\nprognostic biomarker. Our overall conclusion is that more aggressive HCC\ntumors, as judged by decreased host survival probability, had more modular\nexpression patterns of metabolic genes.

Treating\noriginal and duplicated node mutation rates as independent parameters has no\neffect on this result. However, difference in these parameters results in a\nslower rate of convergence and in different degree distributions. The more\ndifferent these parameters are, the denser the tail of the distribution. We\ncompare the solutions obtained with simulated networks.
