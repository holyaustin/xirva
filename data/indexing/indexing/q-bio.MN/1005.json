These systems are based on an\nintercellular feedback loop in which Notch activation leads to down-regulation\nof Delta. However, even in relatively well-characterized systems, the pathway\nleading from Notch activation to Delta repression often remains elusive. Recent\nwork has shown that cis-interactions between Notch and Delta lead to mutual\ninactivation of both proteins. Here we show that this type of cis-interaction\nenables a simpler and more direct mechanism for lateral inhibition feedback\nthan those proposed previously. In this mechanism, Notch signaling directly\nup-regulates Notch expression, thereby inactivating Delta through the mutual\ninactivation of Notch and Delta proteins. This mechanism, which we term\nSimplest Lateral Inhibition by Mutual Inactivation (SLIMI), can implement\npatterning without requiring any additional genes or regulatory interactions.\nMoreover, the key interaction of Notch expression in response to Notch\nsignaling has been observed in some systems. Stability analysis and simulation\nof SLIMI mathematical models show that this lateral inhibition circuit is\ncapable of pattern formation across a broad range of parameter values.

Similar results are found for networks with SFboth\nand SFout topologies. The functionality of the SFout topology, which most\nclosely resembles the structure of biological gene networks (Babu et al.,\n2004), is compared to the ER topology in further detail through an extension to\nmultiple target outputs, with either an oscillatory or a non-oscillatory\nnature. For multiple oscillatory targets of the same length, the differences\nbetween SFout and ER networks are enhanced, but for non-oscillatory targets\nboth types of networks show fairly similar evolvability. We find that SF\nnetworks generate oscillations much more easily than ER networks do, and this\nmay explain why SF networks are more evolvable than ER networks are for\noscillatory phenotypes. In spite of their greater evolvability, we find that\nnetworks with SFout topologies are also more robust to mutations than ER\nnetworks. Furthermore, the SFout topologies are more robust to changes in\ninitial conditions (environmental robustness). For both topologies, we find\nthat once a population of networks has reached the target state, further\nneutral evolution can lead to an increase in both the mutational robustness and\nthe environmental robustness to changes in initial conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 May 2010 14:49:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Greenbury", "Sam F.", ""], ["Johnston", "Iain G.", ""], ["Smith", "Matthew A.", ""], ["Doye", "Jonathan P.
