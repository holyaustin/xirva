It is shown how well-established control engineering\nconcepts, such as loop-gain, arise from energy feedback loops and are therefore\namenable to control engineering insight. In particular, a novel method is\nintroduced to allow the transfer function based approach of classical linear\ncontrol to be utilised in the analysis of feedback systems modelled by network\nthermodynamics and thus amalgamate energy-based modelling with control systems\nanalysis. The approach is illustrated using a class of metabolic cycles with\nactivation and inhibition leading the concept of Cyclic Flow Modulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2020 12:00:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:57:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2021 11:04:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gawthrop", "Peter J", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15642", "submitter": "Francois Fages", "authors": "Elisabeth Degrand (Lifeware), Fran\\c{c}ois Fages (Lifeware), Sylvain\n  Soliman (Lifeware)", "title": "Graphical Conditions for Rate Independence in Chemical Reaction Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Proceedings CMSB 2020: The 18th International Conference on\n  Computational Methods in Systems Biology, Sep 2020, Konstanz, Germany", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.SC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs) provide a useful abstraction of molecular\ninteraction networks in which molecular structures as well as mass conservation\nprinciples are abstracted away to focus on the main dynamical properties of the\nnetwork structure. In their interpretation by ordinary differential equations,\nwe say that a CRN with distinguished input and output species computes a\npositive real function $f : R+ $\\rightarrow$ R+$, if for any initial\nconcentration x of the input species, the concentration of the output molecular\nspecies stabilizes at concentration f (x). The Turing-completeness of that\nnotion of chemical analog computation has been established by proving that any\ncomputable real function can be computed by a CRN over a finite set of\nmolecular species. Rate-independent CRNs form a restricted class of CRNs of\nhigh practical value since they enjoy a form of absolute robustness in the\nsense that the result is completely independent of the reaction rates and\ndepends solely on the input concentrations. The functions computed by\nrate-independent CRNs have been characterized mathematically as the set of\npiecewise linear functions from input species. However, this does not provide a\nmean to decide whether a given CRN is rate-independent. In this paper, we\nprovide graphical conditions on the Petri Net structure of a CRN which entail\nthe rate-independence property either for all species or for some output\nspecies. We show that in the curated part of the Biomodels repository, among\nthe 590 reaction models tested, 2 reaction graphs were found to satisfy our\nrate-independence conditions for all species, 94 for some output species, among\nwhich 29 for some non-trivial output species. Our graphical conditions are\nbased on a non-standard use of the Petri net notions of place-invariants and\nsiphons which are computed by constraint programming techniques for efficiency\nreasons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2020 11:41:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Degrand", "Elisabeth", "", "Lifeware"], ["Fages", "Fran\u00e7ois", "", "Lifeware"], ["Soliman", "Sylvain", "", "Lifeware"]]}, {"id": "2007.15917", "submitter": "Peter Gawthrop", "authors": "Peter J.
