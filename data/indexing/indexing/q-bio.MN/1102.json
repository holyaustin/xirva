The corresponding polynomial dynamical systems are often large\n(consisting of tens or even hundreds of ordinary differential equations) and\npoorly parametrized (due to noisy measurement data and a small number of data\npoints and repetitions). Therefore, it is often difficult to establish the\nexistence of (positive) steady states or to determine whether more complicated\nphenomena such as multistationarity exist. If, however, the steady state ideal\nof the system is a binomial ideal, then we show that these questions can be\nanswered easily. The focus of this work is on systems with this property, and\nwe say that such systems have toric steady states. Our main result gives\nsufficient conditions for a chemical reaction system to have toric steady\nstates. Furthermore, we analyze the capacity of such a system to exhibit\npositive steady states and multistationarity. Examples of systems with toric\nsteady states include weakly-reversible zero-deficiency chemical reaction\nsystems. An important application of our work concerns the networks that\ndescribe the multisite phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase/phosphatase\npair in a sequential and distributive mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Feb 2011 12:43:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2011 13:20:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Millan", "Mercedes Perez", ""], ["Dickenstein", "Alicia", ""], ["Shiu", "Anne", ""], ["Conradi", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2922", "submitter": "David Anderson", "authors": "David F.
