These signaling processes strongly differ in\ntype with TGFb ligands eliciting both sustained or transient responses. Members\nof the TGFb family can also act as morphogen and cellular responses would then\nbe expected to provide a direct read-out of the extracellular ligand\nconcentration. We were interested to define the set of minimal modifications\nthat are required to change the type of signal processing in the TGFb signaling\nnetwork. To define the key aspects for signaling plasticity we focused on the\ncore of the TGFb signaling network. With the help of a parameter screen we\nidentified ranges of kinetic parameters and protein concentrations that give\nrise to transient, sustained, or oscillatory responses to constant stimuli, as\nwell as those parameter ranges that enable a proportional response to\ntime-varying ligand concentrations (as expected in the read-out of morphogens).\nA combination of a strong negative feedback and fast shuttling to the nucleus\nbiases signaling to a transient rather than a sustained response, while\noscillations were obtained if ligand binding to the receptor is weak and the\nturn-over of the I-Smad is fast. A proportional read-out required inefficient\nreceptor activation in addition to a low affinity of receptor-ligand binding.\nWe find that targeted modification of single parameters suffices to alter the\nresponse type. The architecture of the TGFb pathway enables the observed\nsignaling plasticity. The observed range of signaling outputs to TGFb ligand in\ndifferent cell types and under different conditions can be explained with\ndifferences in cellular protein concentrations and with changes in effective\nrate constants due to cross-talk with other signaling pathways.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2011 13:34:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 14:54:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Celliere", "Geraldine", ""], ["Fengos", "Georgios", ""], ["Herve", "Marianne", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.2759", "submitter": "Matthew Macauley", "authors": "Lori Layne, Elena Dimitrova, Matthew Macauley", "title": "Nested canalyzing depth and network stability", "comments": "13 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Bull.

In order to account for these\nproperties, in this paper we provide a generalization of growing network models\nwith preferential attachment that includes the effect of heterogeneous features\nof the nodes. The main effect of heterogeneity is the emergence of an\n\"effective fitness\" for each class of nodes, determining the rate at which\nnodes acquire new links. The degree distribution exhibits a multiscaling\nbehaviour analogous to the the fitness model. This property is robust with\nrespect to variations in the model, as long as links are assigned through\neffective preferential attachment. Beyond the degree distribution, in this\npaper we give a full characterization of the other relevant properties of the\nmodel. We evaluate the clustering coefficient and show that it disappears for\nlarge network size, a property shared with the Barab\\'asi-Albert model.\nNegative degree correlations are also present in the studied class of models,\nalong with non-trivial mixing patterns among features. We therefore conclude\nthat both small clustering coefficients and disassortative mixing are outcomes\nof the preferential attachment mechanism in general growing networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2011 21:09:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2012 11:21:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ferretti", "Luca", ""], ["Cortelezzi", "Michele", ""], ["Yang", "Bin", ""], ["Marmorini", "Giacomo", ""], ["Bianconi", "Ginestra", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4106", "submitter": "Jose Vilar", "authors": "Jose M.
