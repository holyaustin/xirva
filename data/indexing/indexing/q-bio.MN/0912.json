As various adaptations of\nthe method family, we developed several algorithms, which provide an efficient\nanalysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine pervasively\noverlapping modules with high resolution; (2) uncover a detailed hierarchical\nnetwork structure allowing an efficient, zoom-in analysis of large networks;\n(3) allow the determination of key network nodes and (4) help to predict\nnetwork dynamics.

This interest stems from the realization that glia participates\nin cognitive functions and information processing and is involved in many brain\ndisorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia\ncommunications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the\nmodulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model\nfor glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the\nessential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol\n1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel\nmodel for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the\nIP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state\nmodel (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations\ntriggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external\nglutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models\ninclude a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation\npathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise\nformulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate\nthe existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between\nIP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator\nproperties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure\namplitude modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in\ngeneral agreement with available experimental data and may have important\nimplications on the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 05:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["De Pitta`", "Maurizio", "", "2 and 3"], ["Goldberg", "Mati", "", "2 and 3"], ["Volman", "Vladislav", "", "2 and 3"], ["Berry", "Hugues", "", "1 and 2"], ["Ben-Jacob", "Eshel", "", "1 and 2"]]}, {"id": "0912.3941", "submitter": "Pan-Jun Kim", "authors": "Pan-Jun Kim, Nathan D.
