Recent studies in Naked Mole Rat (NMR) and long- lived sea\nurchin showed that the level of gene expression changes with age is lower than\nin other organisms. These phenotypic observations correlate well with\nexceptional endurance of NMR tissues to various genotoxic stresses. Therefore,\nthe lifelong transcriptional stability of an organism may be a key determinant\nof longevity. However, the exact relation between genetic network stability,\nstress-resistance and aging has not been defined. We analyze the stability of a\nsimple genetic- network model of a living organism under the influence of\nexternal and endogenous factors. We demonstrate that under most common\ncircumstances a gene network is inherently unstable and suffers from\nexponential accumulation of gene-regulation deviations leading to death.\nHowever, should the repair systems be sufficiently effective, the gene network\ncan stabilize so that gene damage remains constrained along with mortality of\nthe organism, which may then enjoy a remarkable degree of stability over very\nlong times. We clarify the relation between stress-resistance and aging and\nsuggest that stabilization of the genetic network may provide a mathematical\nexplanation of the Gompertz equation describing the relationship between age\nand mortality in many species, and of the apparently negligible senescence\nobserved in exceptionally long-lived animals. The model may support a range of\napplications, such as systematic searches for therapeutics to extend lifespan\nand healthspan.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 07:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kogan", "Valeria", ""], ["Molodtcov", "Ivan", ""], ["Menshikov", "Leonid I.", ""], ["Reis", "Robert J.

However, diseases such as cancer are a\nresult of the combined effect of multiple genes. Gene products such as proteins\nseldom act in isolation, but instead constitute stable multi-protein complexes\nperforming dedicated functions. Therefore, complexes aggregate the effect of\nindividual genes (proteins) and can be used to gain a better understanding of\ncancer mechanisms. Here, we observe that complexes show considerable changes in\ntheir expression, in turn directed by the concerted action of transcription\nfactors (TFs), across cancer conditions. We seek to gain novel insights into\ncancer mechanisms through a systematic analysis of complexes and their\ntranscriptional regulation.\n  Results: We integrated large-scale protein-interaction (PPI) and\ngene-expression datasets to identify complexes that exhibit significant changes\nin their expression across different conditions in cancer. We devised a\nlog-linear model to relate these changes to the differential regulation of\ncomplexes by TFs. The application of our model on two case studies involving\npancreatic and familial breast tumour conditions revealed: (i) complexes in\ncore cellular processes, especially those responsible for maintaining genome\nstability and cell proliferation (e.g. DNA damage repair and cell cycle) show\nconsiderable changes in expression; (ii) these changes include decrease and\ncountering increase for different sets of complexes indicative of compensatory\nmechanisms coming into play in tumours; and (iii) TFs work in cooperative and\ncounteractive ways to regulate these mechanisms.

When the target\ndynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the\nsearch and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of\neach generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known\nsmall GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include\nthese GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more\ncomplex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we\ntruncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty\nterm, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by\nincorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find\nminimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:56:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia-Bernardo", "Javier", ""], ["Eppstein", "Margaret J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5405", "submitter": "Khalid Raza", "authors": "Khalid Raza and Mansaf Alam", "title": "Recurrent Neural Network Based Hybrid Model of Gene Regulatory Network", "comments": "18 pages, 9 figures and 4 tables", "journal-ref": "Computational Biology and Chemistry, 64: 322-334, 2016", "doi": "10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2016.08.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.CE q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Systems biology is an emerging interdisciplinary area of research that\nfocuses on study of complex interactions in a biological system, such as gene\nregulatory networks. The discovery of gene regulatory networks leads to a wide\nrange of applications, such as pathways related to a disease that can unveil in\nwhat way the disease acts and provide novel tentative drug targets. In\naddition, the development of biological models from discovered networks or\npathways can help to predict the responses to disease and can be much useful\nfor the novel drug development and treatments. The inference of regulatory\nnetworks from biological data is still in its infancy stage. This paper\nproposes a recurrent neural network (RNN) based gene regulatory network (GRN)\nmodel hybridized with generalized extended Kalman filter for weight update in\nbackpropagation through time training algorithm. The RNN is a complex neural\nnetwork that gives a better settlement between the biological closeness and\nmathematical flexibility to model GRN. The RNN is able to capture complex,\nnon-linear and dynamic relationship among variables. Gene expression data are\ninherently noisy and Kalman filter performs well for estimation even in noisy\ndata. Hence, non-linear version of Kalman filter, i.e., generalized extended\nKalman filter has been applied for weight update during network training. The\ndeveloped model has been applied on DNA SOS repair network, IRMA network, and\ntwo synthetic networks from DREAM Challenge. We compared our results with other\nstate-of-the-art techniques that show superiority of our model. Further, 5%\nGaussian noise has been added in the dataset and result of the proposed model\nshows negligible effect of noise on the results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 18:35:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 12:38:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-13", "authors_parsed": [["Raza", "Khalid", ""], ["Alam", "Mansaf", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5628", "submitter": "Jorge G.

In some cases, such as the clustering of Ras proteins on the\nmembranes of mammalian cells, proper cell signaling is critically dependent on\nthe maintenance of these clusters. Yet, the mechanism by which clusters form\nand are maintained in these systems remains unclear. Recently, it has been\ndiscovered that activated Ras promotes further Ras activation. Here we show\nusing particle-based simulation that this positive feedback is sufficient to\nproduce persistent clusters of active Ras molecules at the nanometer scale via\na dynamic nucleation mechanism. Furthermore, we find that our cluster\nstatistics are consistent with experimental observations of the Ras system.\nInterestingly, we show that our model does not support a Turing regime of\nmacroscopic reaction-diffusion patterning, and therefore that the clustering we\nobserve is a purely stochastic effect, arising from the coupling of positive\nfeedback with the discrete nature of individual molecules. These results\nunderscore the importance of stochastic and dynamic properties of reaction\ndiffusion systems for biological behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 15:15:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wehrens", "Martijn", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Mugler", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6303", "submitter": "Anatol Wegner", "authors": "Anatol E.
