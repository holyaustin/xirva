An immediate\nconsequence of this rareness is burstiness in mRNA and protein copy numbers, a\nwell known experimentally observed effect. We introduce the concept of\nstochastic cooperativity and show that this phenomenon is a natural consequence\nof high dimensionality coupled with highly nonlinearity of a dynamical system.\nIn mathematical terms, burstiness is associated with heavy-tailed probability\ndistributions of stochastic processes describing the dynamics of the system.\nThe sequence of stochastic cooperativity events allows for transition from\ncontinuous deterministic dynamics expressed in terms of ordinary differential\nequations (ODE) to discrete stochastic dynamics expressed in terms of Langevin\nand Fokker-Plank equations. We demonstrate also that high-dimensional nonlinear\nsystems, even in the absence of explicit mechanisms for suppressing inherent\ninstability, may nevertheless reside in a state of stationary pseudo-random\nfluctuations which for all practical purposes may be regarded as stochastic\nprocess. This type of stochastic behavior is an inherent property of such\nsystems and requires neither an external random force, nor highly specialized\nconditions of bistability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2007 13:32:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Rosenfeld", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3156", "submitter": "Carsten Marr", "authors": "Carsten Marr, Marcel Geertz, Marc-Thorsten Huett, Georgi\n  Muskhelishvili", "title": "Two distinct logical types of network control in gene expression\n  profiles", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.MN", "license": null, "abstract": "  In unicellular organisms such as bacteria the same acquired mutations\nbeneficial in one environment can be restrictive in another.
