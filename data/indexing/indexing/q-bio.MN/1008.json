Many signaling pathways contain several layers of modification cycles\nthat mediate and change the signal through the pathway. Here, we study a simple\nsignaling cascade consisting of n layers of modification cycles, such that the\nmodified protein of one layer acts as modifier in the next layer. Assuming\nmass-action kinetics and taking the formation of intermediate complexes into\naccount, we show that the steady states are solutions to a polynomial in one\nvariable, and in fact that there is exactly one steady state for any given\ntotal amounts of substrates and enzymes.\n  We demonstrate that many steady state concentrations are related through\nrational functions, which can be found recursively. For example,\nstimulus-response curves arise as inverse functions to explicit rational\nfunctions. We show that the stimulus-response curves of the modified substrates\nare shifted to the left as we move down the cascade. Further, our approach\nallows us to study enzyme competition, sequestration and how the steady state\nchanges in response to changes in the total amount of substrates.\n  Our approach is essentially algebraic and follows recent trends in the study\nof posttranslational modification systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 00:37:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 18 Dec 2010 18:31:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Feliu", "Elisenda", ""], ["Knudsen", "Michael", ""], ["Andersen", "Lars N.", ""], ["Wiuf", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0576", "submitter": "Wiet de Ronde", "authors": "Wiet de Ronde and Filipe Tostevin and Pieter Rein ten Wolde", "title": "Multiplexing Biochemical Signals", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

We assume that E. coli is in a state of balanced\nexponential steadystate growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant\nenvironment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past\nmeasurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been\nmeasured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from\none to seven (the wild-type copy number). These experiments show that growth\nrate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the\nmodel, we were able to reproduce these measurements. We show that the model\nthat best fits these data suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules\ninside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied.\nMoreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven\nresults in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming\nthat under such overcrowded conditions prolonged diffusion times tend to weaken\nbinding affinities, the model predicts that growth rate will not increase\nsubstantially beyond the wild-type growth rate, as indicated by other\nexperiments. Our model therefore suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy\nnumber of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does\nnot substantially increase their growth rate. Other observations regarding\nstrains with an altered rRNA operon copy number, such as nucleoid compaction\nand the rRNA operon feedback response, appear to be qualitatively consistent\nwith this model. In addition, we discuss possible design principles suggested\nby the model and propose further experiments to test its validity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Aug 2010 08:47:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tadmor", "Arbel D.", ""], ["Tlusty", "Tsvi", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1273", "submitter": "Anyou Wang", "authors": "Anyou Wang, Hong Li", "title": "A Systemic Receptor Network Triggered by Human cytomegalovirus Entry", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": "Advances in Virology Volume 2011 (2011), Article ID 262080, 11\n  pages", "doi": "10.1155/2011/262080", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Virus entry is a multistep process that triggers a variety of cellular\npathways interconnecting into a complex network, yet the molecular complexity\nof this network remains largely unsolved. Here, by employing systems biology\napproach, we reveal a systemic virus-entry network initiated by human\ncytomegalovirus (HCMV), a widespread opportunistic pathogen. This network\ncontains all known interactions and functional modules (i.e. groups of\nproteins) coordinately responding to HCMV entry. The number of both genes and\nfunctional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly,\nwithin 25 min post-infection. While modules annotated as receptor system, ion\ntransport, and immune response are continuously activated during the entire\nprocess of HCMV entry, those for cell adhesion and skeletal movement are\nspecifically activated during viral early attachment, and those for immune\nresponse during virus entry. HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network\ninvolving different cellular components, comprising not only cell surface\nreceptors, but also pathway components in signal transduction, skeletal\ndevelopment, immune response, endocytosis, ion transport, macromolecule\nmetabolism and chromatin remodeling. Interestingly, genes that function in\nchromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system, suggesting\nthat global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in\nHCMV entry. Results of in silico knock out further reveal that this entire\nreceptor network is primarily controlled by multiple elements, such as EGFR\n(Epidermal Growth Factor) and SLC10A1 (sodium/bile acid cotransporter family,\nmember 1). Thus, our results demonstrate that a complex systemic network, in\nwhich components coordinating efficiently in time and space contributes to\nvirus entry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Aug 2010 20:16:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-17", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Anyou", ""], ["Li", "Hong", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1932", "submitter": "Alvaro Sanchez", "authors": "Alvaro Sanchez, Hernan Garcia, Daniel Jones, Rob Phillips and Jane'\n  Kondev", "title": "Effect of promoter architecture on the cell-to-cell variability in gene\n  expression", "comments": "35 pages, 6 figures, Submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001100", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  According to recent experimental evidence, the architecture of a promoter,\ndefined as the number, strength and regulatory role of the operators that\ncontrol the promoter, plays a major role in determining the level of\ncell-to-cell variability in gene expression.
