For scenarios that have been covered\nin the literature, we provide a brief review. For scenarios that have not been\ncovered in literature, if the structure can be inferred, we propose new\nmethods. Otherwise, we prove that the structure cannot be inferred.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Jul 2021 22:59:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yue", ""], ["Wang", "Zikun", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13195", "submitter": "Jozsef Prechl", "authors": "Jozsef Prechl", "title": "Complex physical properties of a self-organizing biological system", "comments": "20 pages, 5 figures, supplementary text", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  The physical interpretation of the functioning of the adaptive immune system,\nwhich maintains host integrity by accelerated protein evolution, provides a\nunique opportunity to observe and define a self-organizing system in its\nentirety. Using a configuration space model of immune function, wherein\ndirected chemical potentials of the system components create a vector space of\ninteractions, the architecture of self-organization suggests that a fractal\nscale-free network distributes energy through the system. In the physical sense\nthe adaptive immune system adjusts the chemical potential of all available\nmolecules by tuning the chemical potential and organizing the network hierarchy\nof its sensor-effector molecules, antibodies. Coupling of free energy sensors\nand effectors allows the system to regulate its composition, while network\norganization helps minimize chemical potentials and maximize diversity.\nOverall, a stochastic model of adaptive immunity may provide a universal\nphysical model for self-organizing systems with power law distribution of\nthermodynamic activities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 06:59:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Prechl", "Jozsef", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.13300", "submitter": "Gholamreza Jafari", "authors": "Nastaran Allahyari, Ali Hosseiny, Nima Abedpour, and G.

In this regard, a wide range of studies has focused on\npairwise interactions. Understanding collective performance beyond pairwise\ninteractions is a great goal in this field of research. In this work, we aim to\nanalyze the structure of the genes interaction network through the random\nmatrix theory. We focus on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient network of about\n6000 genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By comparing the spectrum of\nthe eigenvalues of the interaction networks itself with the spectrum of the\nshuffled ones, we observe clear evidence that unveils the existence of the\nstructure beyond pairwise interactions in the network of genes. In the global\nnetwork, we identify 140 eigenvectors that have unnormal large eigenvalues.It\nis interesting to observe that when the essential genes as the influential and\nhubs of the network are excluded, still the special spectrum of the eigenvalues\nis preserved which is quite different from the random networks. In another\nanalysis we derive the spectrum of genes based on the node participation ratio\n(NPR) index. We again observe noticeable deviation from a random structure. We\nindicate about 500 genes that have high values of NPR. Comparing with the\nrecords of the shuffled network, we present clear pieces of evidence that these\nhigh values of NPR are a consequence of the structures of the network. We have\ntabled the list of such genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 11:46:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Allahyari", "Nastaran", ""], ["Hosseiny", "Ali", ""], ["Abedpour", "Nima", ""], ["Jafari", "G.

Further, advances in synthetic\nbiology herald the time when we'll be able to rationally engineer complex\nchemical systems, and when idealized formal models will become blueprints for\nengineering. Coupled chemical interactions in a well-mixed solution are\ncommonly formalized as chemical reaction networks (CRNs). However, despite the\nwidespread use of CRNs in the natural sciences, the range of computational\nbehaviors exhibited by CRNs is not well understood. Here we study the following\nproblem: what functions $f:\\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can be computed by a\nCRN, in which the CRN eventually produces the correct amount of the \"output\"\nmolecule, no matter the rate at which reactions proceed? This captures a\npreviously unexplored, but very natural class of computations: for example, the\nreaction $X_1 + X_2 \\to Y$ can be thought to compute the function $y =\n\\min(x_1, x_2)$. Such a CRN is robust in the sense that it is correct whether\nits evolution is governed by the standard model of mass-action kinetics,\nalternatives such as Hill-function or Michaelis-Menten kinetics, or other\narbitrary models of chemistry that respect the (fundamentally digital)\nstoichiometric constraints (what are the reactants and products?). We develop a\nformal definition of such computation using a novel notion of reachability, and\nprove that a function is computable in this manner if and only if it is\n*continuous piecewise linear*.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2021 00:37:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Ho-Lin", ""], ["Doty", "David", ""], ["Soloveichik", "David", ""], ["Reeves", "Wyatt", ""]]}]
