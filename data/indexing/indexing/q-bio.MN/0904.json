One of the major types of glycans, N-linked glycans, is formed by\nsequential attachments of monosaccharides to proteins by a limited number of\nenzymes. Many of these enzymes can accept multiple N-linked glycans as\nsubstrates, thereby generating a large number of glycan intermediates and their\nintermingled pathways.

Under point mutations, which establish or delete\nsingle interactions, the neutral space of functional networks is fragmented\ninto 4.7 * 10^8 components. One of the smaller ones contains the wildtype\nnetwork. On average, functional networks reachable from the wildtype by\nmutations are sparser, have higher noise resilience and fewer fixed point\nattractors as compared with networks outside of this wildtype component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2009 14:05:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Boldhaus", "Gunnar", ""], ["Klemm", "Konstantin", ""]]}]
