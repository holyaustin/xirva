Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we\nderive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform\nmultiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm\nbefore binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on\nthe precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics\nsimulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically\nrelevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent\napproximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and\nunbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of\nsliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important\nimplications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to\nminimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)\nthe complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion\nalong the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the\npromoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently\nsimulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations. Based on the recent\nexperimental observation that sliding can speed up the promoter search by a\nfactor of 4, our theory predicts that sliding can enhance the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation by a factor of 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 12:46:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1135", "submitter": "Arnaud Poret", "authors": "Arnaud Poret, Claudio Monteiro Sousa, Jean-Pierre Boissel", "title": "Enhancing Boolean networks with continuous logical operators and edge\n  tuning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the scarcity of quantitative details about biological phenomena,\nquantitative modeling in systems biology can be compromised, especially at the\nsubcellular scale.

To this end, various\nstandards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations,\ndata or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute\nvarious separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific\nresult.\n  Results: We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with\nthe use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology\nNetwork (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that\nsupports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and\nsimulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes\na manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file\nadding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing\nthe model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in\nCOMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined\nby an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are\navailable, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.\n  Conclusions: The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and\nsimulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in\none file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in\nbuilding activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive\nwill become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger,\nmore complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital\norganisms, and bioengineering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2014 13:41:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 15:38:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bergmann", "Frank T.", ""], ["Adams", "Richard", ""], ["Moodie", "Stuart", ""], ["Cooper", "Jonathan", ""], ["Glont", "Mihai", ""], ["Golebiewski", "Martin", ""], ["Hucka", "Michael", ""], ["Laibe", "Camille", ""], ["Miller", "Andrew K.", ""], ["Nickerson", "David P.", ""], ["Olivier", "Brett G.", ""], ["Rodriguez", "Nicolas", ""], ["Sauro", "Herbert M.", ""], ["Scharm", "Martin", ""], ["Soiland-Reyes", "Stian", ""], ["Waltemath", "Dagmar", ""], ["Yvon", "Florent", ""], ["Nov\u00e8re", "Nicolas Le", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5503", "submitter": "Ellen Baake", "authors": "Corinna Ernst and Ellen Baake", "title": "Rare event simulation in immune biology: Models of negative selection in\n  T-cell maturation", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures; accepted for 10th International Workshop on Rare\n  Event Simulation, Amsterdam, Aug. 27-29, 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.CB math.PR q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a probabilistic T-cell model that includes negative selection and\ntakes contrasting models of tissue-restricted antigen (TRA) expression in the\nthymus into account.

Here we numerically study the\nconditions under which the MA equations yield results reflecting the true\nstochastic dynamics of the system. We show that for bistable and oscillatory\nchemical systems with deterministic initial conditions, the solution of the MA\nequations can be interpreted as a valid approximation to the true moments of\nthe CME, only when the steady-state mean molecule numbers obtained from the\nchemical master equation fall within a certain finite range. The same validity\ncriterion for monostable systems implies that the steady-state mean molecule\nnumbers obtained from the chemical master equation must be above a certain\nthreshold. For mean molecule numbers outside of this range of validity, the MA\nequations lead to either qualitatively wrong oscillatory dynamics or to\nunphysical predictions such as negative variances in the molecule numbers or\nmultiple steady-state moments of the stationary distribution as the initial\nconditions are varied. Our results clarify the range of validity of the MA\napproach and show that pitfalls in the interpretation of the results can only\nbe overcome through the systematic comparison of the solutions of the MA\nequations of a certain order with those of higher orders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 08:45:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Aug 2014 10:08:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2015 13:01:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Schnoerr", "David", ""], ["Sanguinetti", "Guido", ""], ["Grima", "Ramon", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8508", "submitter": "Alessandro Filisetti Dr.", "authors": "Roberto Serra, Alessandro Filisetti, Marco Villani, Alex Graudenzi,\n  Chiara Damiani and Tommaso Panini", "title": "A stochastic model of catalytic reaction networks in protocells", "comments": "20 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11047-014-9445-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN cs.CE math.DS nlin.AO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Protocells are supposed to have played a key role in the self-organizing\nprocesses leading to the emergence of life. Existing models either (i) describe\nprotocell architecture and dynamics, given the existence of sets of\ncollectively self-replicating molecules for granted, or (ii) describe the\nemergence of the aforementioned sets from an ensemble of random molecules in a\nsimple experimental setting (e.g. a closed system or a steady-state flow\nreactor) that does not properly describe a protocell. In this paper we present\na model that goes beyond these limitations by describing the dynamics of sets\nof replicating molecules within a lipid vesicle. We adopt the simplest possible\nprotocell architecture, by considering a semi-permeable membrane that selects\nthe molecular types that are allowed to enter or exit the protocell and by\nassuming that the reactions take place in the aqueous phase in the internal\ncompartment. As a first approximation, we ignore the protocell growth and\ndivision dynamics. The behavior of catalytic reaction networks is then\nsimulated by means of a stochastic model that accounts for the creation and the\nextinction of species and reactions. While this is not yet an exhaustive\nprotocell model, it already provides clues regarding some processes that are\nrelevant for understanding the conditions that can enable a population of\nprotocells to undergo evolution and selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jul 2014 15:53:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Serra", "Roberto", ""], ["Filisetti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Villani", "Marco", ""], ["Graudenzi", "Alex", ""], ["Damiani", "Chiara", ""], ["Panini", "Tommaso", ""]]}]
