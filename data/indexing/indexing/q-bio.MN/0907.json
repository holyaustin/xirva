A well-known example is the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\ncascade, where in each layer of the cascade a protein is phosphorylated at two\nsites. It has long been known that the response of a MAPK pathway strongly\ndepends on whether the enzymes that modify the protein act processively or\ndistributively: distributive mechanism, in which the enzyme molecules have to\nrelease the substrate molecules in between the modification of the two sites,\ncan generate an ultrasensitive response and lead to hysteresis and bistability.\nWe study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics, a stochastic scheme that makes\nit possible to simulate biochemical networks at the particle level and in time\nand space, a dual phosphorylation cycle in which the enzymes act according to a\ndistributive mechanism. We find that the response of this network can differ\ndramatically from that predicted by a mean-field analysis based on the chemical\nrate equations. In particular, rapid rebindings of the enzyme molecules to the\nsubstrate molecules after modification of the first site can markedly speed up\nthe response, and lead to loss of ultrasensitivity and bistability. In essence,\nrapid enzyme-substrate rebindings can turn a distributive mechanism into a\nprocessive mechanism. We argue that slow ADP release by the enzymes can protect\nthe system against these rapid rebindings, thus enabling ultrasensitivity and\nbistability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2009 15:36:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Takahashi", "Koichi", ""], ["Tanase-Nicola", "Sorin", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.1056", "submitter": "Edgardo Ugalde", "authors": "Ricardo Lima, Arnaud Meyroneinc, Edgardo Ugalde", "title": "Open Regulatory Networks and Modularity", "comments": "31 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the dynamical properties of small regulatory networks treated as non\nautonomous dynamical systems called modules when working inside larger networks\nor, equivalently when subject to external signal inputs.
