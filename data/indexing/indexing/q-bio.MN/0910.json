One central question in developmental biology is how\nsuch coordinated expression patterns are robustly controlled. During embryonic\ndevelopment of the Drosophila central nervous system, neural stem cells called\nneuroblasts sequentially express a group of genes in a definite order, which\ngenerates the diversity of cell types. By producing all possible regulatory\nnetworks of these genes and examining their expression dynamics numerically, we\nidentify requisite regulations and predict an unknown factor to reproduce known\nexpression profiles caused by loss-of-function or overexpression of the genes\nin vivo, as well as in the wild type. We then evaluate the stability of the\nactual Drosophila network for sequential expression. This network shows the\nhighest robustness against parameter variations and gene expression\nfluctuations among the possible networks that reproduce the expression\nprofiles. We propose a regulatory module composed of three kinds of regulations\nwhich is responsible for precise sequential expression. The present study\nsuggests an underlying principle on how biological systems are robustly\ndesigned under functional constraint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2009 08:12:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Nakajima", "Akihiko", ""], ["Isshiki", "Takako", ""], ["Kaneko", "Kunihiko", ""], ["Ishihara", "Shuji", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.5822", "submitter": "Vasily Ogryzko V", "authors": "Evelyne Saade, Undine Mechold, Arman Kulyyassov, Damien Vertut, Marc\n  Lipinski and Vasily Ogryzko", "title": "Analysis of interaction partners of H4 histone by a new proteomics\n  approach", "comments": "30 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe a modification of the TAP method for purification and analysis of\nmultiprotein complexes, termed here DEF-TAP (for Differential Elution\nFractionation after Tandem Affinity Purification). Its essential new feature is\nthe use for last purification step of 6XHis-Ni++ interaction, which is\nresistant to a variety of harsh washing conditions, including high ionic\nstrength and presence of organic solvents. This allows us to use various\nfractionation schemes before the protease digestion, which is expected to\nimprove the coverage of the analysed protein mixture and also to provide an\nadditional insight into the structure of the purified macromolecular complex\nand the nature of protein-protein interactions involved. We illustrate our new\napproach by analysis of soluble nuclear complexes containing histone H4\npurified from HeLa cells. In particular, we observed different fractionation\npatterns of HAT1 and RbAp46 proteins as compared to RbAp48 protein, all\nidentified as interaction partners of H4 histone. In addition, we report all\ncomponents of the licensing MCM2-7 complex and the apoptosis-related DAXX\nprotein among the interaction partners of the soluble H4. Finally, we show that\nHAT1 requires N-terminal tail of H4 for its stable association with this\nhistone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 09:35:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Saade", "Evelyne", ""], ["Mechold", "Undine", ""], ["Kulyyassov", "Arman", ""], ["Vertut", "Damien", ""], ["Lipinski", "Marc", ""], ["Ogryzko", "Vasily", ""]]}]
