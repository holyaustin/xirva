We focus on the effect that\ninherent time scales on the underlying fine-grained scale can have on the\nbifurcation patterns on a coarser scale in time. Time scales are set by the\nbinding and unbinding rates of the transcription factors to the promoter\nregions of the genes. Depending on the ratio of these rates to the decay times\nof the proteins, the appropriate averaging procedure for obtaining a\ncoarse-grained description changes and leads to sets of deterministic\nequations, which differ in their bifurcation structure. In particular the\ndesired intermediate range of regular limit cycles fades away when the binding\nrates of genes are of the same order or less than the decay time of at least\none of the proteins.

In simulations on the same system studied by Gonze et al., we find\nthe system is sensitive to the fluctuation in the transcription regulation; the\nperiod of oscillation fluctuates about 30 min even when the regulation time\nscale $\\tau$ is around 30 s, that is even smaller than 1/1000 of its circadian\nperiod. We also demonstrate that the distribution width for the oscillation\nperiod and the amplitude scales with $\\sqrt\\tau$, and the correlation time of\nthe oscillation scales with $1/\\tau$ in the small $\\tau$ regime. The relative\nfluctuations for the period are about half of that for the amplitude, namely,\nthe periodicity is more stable than the amplitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2012 13:29:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Nishino", "Ryota", ""], ["Sakaue", "Takahiro", ""], ["Nakanishi", "Hiizu", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6277", "submitter": "Johannes Klotz", "authors": "Johannes Georg Klotz and Reinhard Heckel and Steffen Schober", "title": "Bounds on the Average Sensitivity of Nested Canalizing Functions", "comments": "revised submission to PLOS ONE", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0064371", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nested canalizing Boolean (NCF) functions play an important role in\nbiological motivated regulative networks and in signal processing, in\nparticular describing stack filters.

In apoptosis, tens\nof species are involved in many biochemical reactions with times scales of\nwidely differing orders of magnitude. By the law of mass action, the process is\nmathematically described with a large and stiff system of ODEs (ordinary\ndifferential equations). The goal of this work is to simplify such systems of\nODEs with the PEA (partial equilibrium approximation) method. In doing so, we\npropose a general framework of the PEA method together with some conditions,\nunder which the PEA method can be justified rigorously. The main condition is\nthe principle of detailed balance for fast reactions as a whole. With the\njustified method as a tool, we made many attempts via numerical tests to\nsimplify the Fas-signaling pathway model due to Hua et al.

This\npaper reports our simplification of Hua at el.'s model with the PEA method\nbased on the fastness of the nine reactions, together with numerical results\nwhich confirm the reliability of our simplified model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 04:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Ya-Jing", ""], ["Yong", "Wen-An", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6488", "submitter": "Georg Regensburger", "authors": "Stefan M\\\"uller and Georg Regensburger", "title": "Generalized mass action systems: Complex balancing equilibria and sign\n  vectors of the stoichiometric and kinetic-order subspaces", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics 72 (2012) 1926-1947", "doi": "10.1137/110847056", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mass action systems capture chemical reaction networks in homogeneous and\ndilute solutions.
