Most explanations start with Gibrat's rule of\nproportional growth but require additional constraints. We show that Gibrat's\nrule, at all firm levels, yields Zipf's law under a balance condition between\nthe effective growth rate of incumbent firms (which includes their possible\ndemise) and the growth rate of investments in entrant firms. Remarkably, Zipf's\nlaw is the signature of the long-term optimal allocation of resources that\nensures the maximum sustainable growth rate of an economy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 14:16:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Malevergne", "Y.", ""], ["Saichev", "A.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0249", "submitter": "Nataliya  Horbenko", "authors": "Nataliya Horbenko, Peter Ruckdeschel, Taehan Bae", "title": "Robust Estimation of Operational Risk", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  According to the Loss Distribution Approach, the operational risk of a bank\nis determined as 99.9% quantile of the respective loss distribution, covering\nunexpected severe events. The 99.9% quantile can be considered a tail event. As\nsupported by the Pickands-Balkema-de Haan Theorem, tail events exceeding some\nhigh threshold are usually modeled by a Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).\nEstimation of GPD tail quantiles is not a trivial task, in particular if one\ntakes into account the heavy tails of this distribution, the possibility of\nsingular outliers, and, moreover, the fact that data is usually pooled among\nseveral sources. Moreover, if, as is frequently the case, operational losses\nare pooled anonymously, relevance of the fitting data for the respective bank\nis not self-evident. In such situations, robust methods may provide stable\nestimates when classical methods already fail. In this paper, optimally-robust\nprocedures MBRE, OMSE, RMXE are introduced to the application domain of\noperational risk. We apply these procedures to parameter estimation of a GPD at\ndata from Algorithmics Inc. To better understand these results, we provide\nsupportive diagnostic plots adjusted for this context: influence plots,\noutlyingness plots, and QQ plots with robust confidence bands.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 17:07:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Feb 2011 16:23:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2011 15:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Horbenko", "Nataliya", ""], ["Ruckdeschel", "Peter", ""], ["Bae", "Taehan", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.0349", "submitter": "Martin Gould", "authors": "Martin D.

Our calculations indicate that this\ndynamics is close to the one of the \"bubbles\" studied by Sornette and that the\nmost probable timing of the \"burst of the gold bubble\" is April - June 2011.\nThe obtained result has been additionally checked with two different methods.\nFirst of all, we have compared the pattern of changes of the forecasted timing\nof the gold bubble crash with the retrospective changes of forecasts of the oil\nbubble crash (that took place in July 2008). This comparison indicates that the\nperiod when the timing of the crash tended to change is close to the end, and\nthe burst of the gold bubble is the most probable in May or June 2011.\nSecondly, we used the estimates of critical time for the hyperbolic trend (that\nhas been shown in our previous publications to be typical for many\nsocioeconomic processes). Our calculations with this method also indicate May -\nJune 2011 as the most probable time of the burst of the gold bubble. Naturally,\nthis forecast should not be regarded as an exact prediction as this implies the\nstability of the finance policies of the USA, European Union, and China,\nwhereas a significant intervention of giant players (like the Federal Reserve\nSystem, or the Central Bank of China) could affect the course of the exchange\ngame in a rather significant way. We also analyze possible consequences of the\nburst of the \"gold bubble\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 Dec 2010 20:33:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-21", "authors_parsed": [["Tsirel", "Sergey V.", ""], ["Akaev", "Askar", ""], ["Fomin", "Alexey", ""], ["Korotayev", "Andrey V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.5932", "submitter": "Juan C.
