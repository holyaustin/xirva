The foundation of this work is the\nmatrix-variate dynamic linear model, for the volatility of which we adopt a\nmultiplicative stochastic evolution, using Wishart and singular multivariate\nbeta distributions. A diagonal matrix of discount factors is employed in order\nto discount the variances element by element and therefore allowing a flexible\nand pragmatic variance modelling approach. Diagnostic tests and sequential\nmodel monitoring are discussed in some detail. The proposed estimation theory\nis applied to a four-dimensional time series, comprising spot prices of\naluminium, copper, lead and zinc of the London metal exchange. The empirical\nfindings suggest that the proposed Bayesian procedure can be effectively\napplied to financial data, overcoming many of the disadvantages of existing\nvolatility models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2008 22:35:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Triantafyllopoulos", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.0220", "submitter": "Kostas Triantafyllopoulos", "authors": "K.

The model is casted\ninto a state-space form that allows flexible description and analysis. The\nvolatility covariance matrix of the time series is modelled via inverted\nWishart and singular multivariate beta distributions allowing a fully conjugate\nBayesian inference. Model performance and model comparison is done via the\nlikelihood function, sequential Bayes factors, the mean of squared standardized\nforecast errors, the mean of absolute forecast errors (known also as mean\nabsolute deviation), and the mean forecast error. Bayes factors are also used\nin order to choose the autoregressive order of the model. Multi-step\nforecasting is discussed in detail and a flexible formula is proposed to\napproximate the forecast function. Two examples, consisting of bivariate data\nof IBM shares and of foreign exchange (FX) rates for 8 currencies, illustrate\nthe methods. For the IBM data we discuss model performance and multi-step\nforecasting in some detail. For the FX data we discuss sequential portfolio\nallocation; for both data sets our empirical findings suggest that the TV-VAR\nmodels outperform the widely used VAR models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2008 22:58:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2008 12:00:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Triantafyllopoulos", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.0223", "submitter": "Kostas Triantafyllopoulos", "authors": "K.
