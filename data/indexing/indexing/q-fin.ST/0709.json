This can be\nviewed as a very simple agent based model in which all components of the model\nare validated against real data. Our empirical studies of order flow uncover\nseveral interesting regularities in the way trading orders are placed and\ncancelled. The resulting simple model of order flow is used to simulate price\nformation under a continuous double auction, and the statistical properties of\nthe resulting simulated sequence of prices are compared to those of real data.\nThe model is constructed using one stock (AZN) and tested on 24 other stocks.\nFor low volatility, small tick size stocks (called Group I) the predictions are\nvery good, but for stocks outside Group I they are not good. For Group I, the\nmodel predicts the correct magnitude and functional form of the distribution of\nthe volatility and the bid-ask spread, without adjusting any parameters based\non prices. This suggests that at least for Group I stocks, the volatility and\nheavy tails of prices are related to market microstructure effects, and\nsupports the hypothesis that, at least on short time scales, the large\nfluctuations of absolute returns are well described by a power law with an\nexponent that varies from stock to stock.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2007 07:59:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mike", "Szabolcs", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

When multiple\nco-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how\nthese streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns\nwithout imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence.\nIn this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version\nof ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression\ncoefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating\napplication is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits\npatterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is\nalgebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take\nadvantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest\na more efficient algorithm.
