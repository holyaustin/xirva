It is well known that many physical\nprocesses in nature and society display long range correlations. Hence, in the\nlast few years, considerable research effort has been directed towards studying\nthe distribution of return intervals for long range correlated time series.\nBased on numerical simulations, it was shown that the return interval\ndistributions are of stretched exponential type. In this paper, we obtain an\nanalytical expression for the distribution of return intervals in long range\ncorrelated time series which holds good when the average return intervals are\nlarge. We show that the distribution is actually a product of power law and a\nstretched exponential form. We also discuss the regimes of validity and perform\ndetailed studies on how the return interval distribution depends on the\nthreshold used to define extreme events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2008 05:31:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Santhanam", "M.
