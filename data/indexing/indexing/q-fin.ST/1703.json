Among one\nof the earliest SVM, Taylor (1982) proposed a hierarchical model, where the\ncurrent return is a function of the current latent volatility, which is further\nmodeled as an auto-regressive process. In an attempt to make the SVMs more\nappropriate for complex realistic market behavior, a leverage parameter was\nintroduced in the Taylor SVM, which however led to the violation of the\nefficient market hypothesis (EMH, a necessary mean-zero condition for the\nreturn distribution that prevents arbitrage possibilities).
