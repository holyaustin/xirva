Investment banks usually place trading\norders for multiple clients with the same target assets but different order\nsizes and diverse requirements such as time frame and risk aversion level,\nthereby total earning and individual earning cannot be optimized at the same\ntime. Orders executed earlier would affect the market price level, so late\nexecution usually means additional implementation cost. In this paper, we\npropose a novel scheme that utilizes multi-agent reinforcement learning systems\nto derive stock trading strategies for all clients which keep a balance between\nrevenue and fairness. First, we demonstrate that Reinforcement learning (RL) is\nable to learn from experience and adapt the trading strategies to the complex\nmarket environment. Secondly, we show that the Multi-agent RL system allows\ndeveloping trading strategies for all clients individually, thus optimizing\nindividual revenue. Thirdly, we use the Generalized Gini Index (GGI)\naggregation function to control the fairness level of the revenue across all\nclients. Lastly, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of the novel scheme\nin improving fairness meanwhile maintaining optimization of revenue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Dec 2019 16:58:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bao", "Wenhang", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.01127", "submitter": "Roberto Tonelli", "authors": "Nicola Uras and Lodovica Marchesi and Michele Marchesi and Roberto\n  Tonelli", "title": "Forecasting Bitcoin closing price series using linear regression and\n  neural networks models", "comments": "25 pages, 4 figures, Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies how to forecast daily closing price series of Bitcoin,\nusing data on prices and volumes of prior days.
