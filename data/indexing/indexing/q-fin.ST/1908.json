We applied this\nstatistical methodology to financial uninterrupted daily trends returns and to\nother derived observable. In our opinion, to study distributional symmetry,\ntrends returns offer more advantages than the commonly used daily financial\nreturns; the two most important being: 1) Trends returns involve sampling over\ndifferent time scales and 2) By construction, this variable time series\ncontains practically the same number of non-negative and negative entry values.\nWe also show that these time multi-scale returns display distributional\nbi-modality. Daily financial indices analyzed in this work, are the Mexican\nIPC, the American DJIA, DAX from Germany and the Japanese Market index Nikkei,\ncovering a time period from 11-08-1991 to 06-30-2017. We show that, at the time\nscale resolution and significance considered in this paper, it is almost always\nfeasible to find an interval of possible symmetry points containing one most\nplausible symmetry point denoted by C. Finally, we study the temporal evolution\nof C showing that this point is seldom zero and responds with sensitivity to\nextreme market events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Aug 2019 19:24:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez", "C.
