In particular, we uncover different characteristics of the\nfour markets by analyzing the sector and subsector structures which are\ndetected through the random matrix theory. Meanwhile, we observe that the\nTaiwan and Hongkong stock markets show a negative return-volatility\ncorrelation, i.e., the so-called leverage effect. The Shanghai and Shenzhen\nstock markets are more complicated. Before the year 2000, the two markets\nexhibit a strong positive return-volatility correlation, which is called the\nanti-leverage effect. After 2000, however, it gradually changes to the leverage\neffect. We also find that the recurrence interval distributions of both the\ntrading volume volatilities and price volatilities follow a power law behavior,\nwhile the exponents vary among different markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 14:17:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ouyang", "F.

This assumption prompted a\nTwitter-based exchange rate model that harnesses regARIMA analyses for\nshort-term out-of-sample ex post forecasts of the daily closing prices of\nEUR/USD spot exchange rates. The analyses used Tweet counts collected from\nJanuary 1, 2012 - September 27, 2013. To identify concepts mentioned on Twitter\nwith a predictive potential the analysis followed a 2-step selection. Firstly,\na heuristic qualitative analysis assembled a long list of 594 concepts, e.g.,\nMerkel, Greece, Cyprus, crisis, chaos, growth, unemployment expected to covary\nwith the ups and downs of the EUR/USD exchange rate. Secondly, cross-validation\nusing window averaging with a fixed-sized rolling origin was deployed to select\nconcepts and corresponding univariate time series that had error scores below\nchance level as defined by the random walk model. With regard to a short list\nof 17 concepts (covariates), in particular SP (Standard & Poor's) and risk, the\nout-of-sample predictive accuracy of the Twitter-based regARIMA model was found\nto be repeatedly better than that obtained from both the random walk model and\na random noise covariate in 1-step ahead forecasts of the EUR/USD exchange\nrate.
