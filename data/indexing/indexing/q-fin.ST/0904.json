We provide here an empirical\nstudy of the cross-correlation between all these different events, and their\nrespective impact on future price changes. We define and extract from the data\nthe \"bare\" impact these events would have, if they were to happen in isolation.\nFor large tick stocks, we show that a model where the bare impact of all events\nis permanent and non-fluctuating is in good agreement with the data. For small\ntick stocks, however, bare impacts must contain a history dependent part,\nreflecting the internal fluctuations of the order book. We show that this\neffect can be accurately described by an autoregressive model on the past order\nflow. This framework allows us to decompose the impact of an event into three\nparts: an instantaneous jump component, the modification of the future rates of\nthe different events, and the modification of the future gaps behind the best\nquotes. We compare in detail the present formalism with the temporary impact\nmodel that was proposed earlier to describe the impact of market orders when\nother types of events are not observed. Finally, we extend the model to\ndescribe the dynamics of the bid-ask spread.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2009 10:23:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Mar 2010 09:31:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:37:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eisler", "Zoltan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Kockelkoren", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1042", "submitter": "Guohua Mu", "authors": "Guo-Hua Mu, Wei Chen, J\\'anos Kert\\'esz, Wei-Xing Zhou", "title": "Long-term correlations and multifractal analysis of trading volumes for\n  Chinese stocks", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Physics Procedia,Volume 3, Issue 5, August 2010, Pages 1631-1640", "doi": "10.1016/j.phpro.2010.07.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the temporal correlations and multifractal nature of trading\nvolume of 22 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003.

Modeling the index movements and log-index movements as stationary\nGaussian processes, we find a total of 116 and 119 statistically stationary\nsegments respectively. These can then be grouped into between five to seven\nclusters, each representing a different macroeconomic phase. The macroeconomic\nphases are distinguished primarily by their volatilities. We find the US\neconomy, as measured by the DJI, spends most of its time in a low-volatility\nphase and a high-volatility phase. The former can be roughly associated with\neconomic expansion, while the latter contains the economic contraction phase in\nthe standard economic cycle. Both phases are interrupted by a\nmoderate-volatility market, but extremely-high-volatility market crashes are\nfound mostly within the high-volatility phase. From the temporal distribution\nof various phases, we see a high-volatility phase from mid-1998 to mid-2003,\nand another starting mid-2007 (the current global financial crisis).\nTransitions from the low-volatility phase to the high-volatility phase are\npreceded by a series of precursor shocks, whereas the transition from the\nhigh-volatility phase to the low-volatility phase is preceded by a series of\ninverted shocks. The time scale for both types of transitions is about a year.\nWe also identify the July 1997 Asian Financial Crisis to be the trigger for the\nmid-1998 transition, and an unnamed May 2006 market event related to\ncorrections in the Chinese markets to be the trigger for the mid-2007\ntransition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2009 11:28:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Wong Jian", ""], ["Heng", "Lian", ""], ["Ann", "Cheong Siew", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.4131", "submitter": "Alexander Weiss", "authors": "Alexander Weiss", "title": "Executing large orders in a microscopic market model", "comments": "32 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a recent paper, Alfonsi, Fruth and Schied (AFS) propose a simple order\nbook based model for the impact of large orders on stock prices.

In particular, from our simulations the recovery speed of\nthe market after a large order is clearly dependent on the order size, whereas\nthe AFS model assumes a constant speed. For this reason, we propose a\ngeneralization of the AFS model, the GAFS model, that incorporates this\ndependency, and prove the optimal investment strategies. As a corollary, we\nfind that we can derive the ``correct'' constant resilience speed for the AFS\nmodel from the GAFS model such that the optimal strategies of the AFS and the\nGAFS model coincide. Finally, we show that the costs of applying the optimal\nstrategies of the GAFS model to the artificial market environment still differ\nsignificantly from the model predictions, indicating that even the improved\nmodel does not capture all of the relevant details of a real market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2009 11:27:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2010 08:03:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Weiss", "Alexander", ""]]}]
