For correlation matrices of multivariate Gaussian variables we\nanalytically determine the expected values of the Kullback-Leibler distance of\na sample correlation matrix from a reference model and we show that the\nexpected values are known also when the specific model is unknown. We propose\nto make use of the Kullback-Leibler distance to estimate the information\nextracted from a correlation matrix by correlation filtering procedures. We\nalso show how to use this distance to measure the stability of filtering\nprocedures with respect to statistical uncertainty. We explain the\neffectiveness of our method by comparing four filtering procedures, two of them\nbeing based on spectral analysis and the other two on hierarchical clustering.\nWe compare these techniques as applied both to simulations of factor models and\nempirical data. We investigate the ability of these filtering procedures in\nrecovering the correlation matrix of models from simulations. We discuss such\nan ability in terms of both the heterogeneity of model parameters and the\nlength of data series. We also show that the two spectral techniques are\ntypically more informative about the sample correlation matrix than techniques\nbased on hierarchical clustering, whereas the latter are more stable with\nrespect to statistical uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2007 14:51:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Tumminello", "Michele", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Mantegna", "Rosario Nunzio", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1247", "submitter": "S\\'ilvio Duarte Queir\\'os M.", "authors": "Silvio M.

For such series, the sample\nautocorrelations decay slowly and log-log periodogram plots indicate a\nstraight-line relationship. This necessitates a class of models for describing\nsuch behavior. A popular class of such models is the autoregressive\nfractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) which is a linear process.\nHowever, there is also a need for nonlinear long memory models. For example,\nseries of returns on financial assets typically tend to show zero correlation,\nwhereas their squares or absolute values exhibit long memory. Furthermore, the\nsearch for a realistic mechanism for generating long memory has led to the\ndevelopment of other nonlinear long memory models. In this chapter, we will\npresent several nonlinear long memory models, and discuss the properties of the\nmodels, as well as associated parametric andsemiparametric estimators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2007 07:00:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Deo", "Rohit", "", "IOMS"], ["Hsieh", "Meng-Chen", "", "IOMS"], ["Hurvich", "Clifford M.", "", "IOMS"], ["Soulier", "Philippe", "", "MODAL'X"]]}, {"id": "0706.2140", "submitter": "Zhi-Qiang Jiang", "authors": "Zhi-Qiang Jiang, Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST)", "title": "Multifractality in stock indexes: Fact or fiction?", "comments": "14 elsart pages including 6 eps figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 387 (14), 3605-3614 (2008).", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2008.02.015", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  Multifractal analysis and extensive statistical tests are performed upon\nintraday minutely data within individual trading days for four stock market\nindexes (including HSI, SZSC, S&P500, and NASDAQ) to check whether the indexes\n(instead of the returns) possess multifractality.

We consider how their dynamics\ndepends on the agents' initial preferences of strategies, when the agents use\nlinear or quadratic payoff functions to evaluate their strategies. We find that\nthe fluctuations of the population making certain decisions (the volatility)\ndepends on the diversity of the distribution of the initial preferences of\nstrategies. When the diversity decreases, more agents tend to adapt their\nstrategies together. In systems with linear payoffs, this results in dynamical\ntransitions from vanishing volatility to a non-vanishing one. For low signal\ndimensions, the dynamical transitions for the different signals do not take\nplace at the same critical diversity. Rather, a cascade of dynamical\ntransitions takes place when the diversity is reduced. In contrast, no phase\ntransitions are found in systems with the quadratic payoffs. Instead, a basin\nboundary of attraction separates two groups of samples in the space of the\nagents' decisions. Initial states inside this boundary converge to small\nvolatility, while those outside diverge to a large one. Furthermore, when the\npreference distribution becomes more polarized, the dynamics becomes more\nerratic. All the above results are supported by good agreement between\nsimulations and theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2007 10:56:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2007 18:11:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "H.
