In response to the crisis, drastic actions have been\ntaken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because\ninterest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates\nimply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates\nalso increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If\nthere is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute\nto---rather than be caused by---default risk. Here we build a quantitative\nequilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able\nto determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show\nthat over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates\nof Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The\nrelationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the\nGreek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude\nnon-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find\nevidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According\nto the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March\n2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of\ndefault by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and\ninternational interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be\nreduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to\nprevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of\nprojected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy\nto be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively.
