Using a forecasting model based on\nRealized GARCH with multiple time-frequency decomposed realized volatility\nmeasures, we study the influence of different timescales on volatility\nforecasts. The decomposition of volatility into several timescales approximates\nthe behaviour of traders at corresponding investment horizons. The proposed\nmethodology is moreover able to account for impact of jumps due to a recently\nproposed jump wavelet two scale realized volatility estimator. We propose a\nrealized Jump-GARCH models estimated in two versions using maximum likelihood\nas well as observation-driven estimation framework of generalized\nautoregressive score. We compare forecasts using several popular realized\nvolatility measures on foreign exchange rate futures data covering the recent\nfinancial crisis. Our results indicate that disentangling jump variation from\nthe integrated variation is important for forecasting performance. An\ninteresting insight into the volatility process is also provided by its\nmultiscale decomposition. We find that most of the information for future\nvolatility comes from high frequency part of the spectra representing very\nshort investment horizons. Our newly proposed models outperform statistically\nthe popular as well conventional models in both one-day and multi-period-ahead\nforecasting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 11:34:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2013 21:13:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 09:40:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 20:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Barunik", "Jozef", ""], ["Krehlik", "Tomas", ""], ["Vacha", "Lukas", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.3136", "submitter": "Paulsamy Muruganandam", "authors": "Eder Lucio Fonseca, Fernando F.

The\nexponential probability distribution of wages, predicted by the statistical\nequilibrium theory of a labor market developed by Foley in 1996, is supported\nby empirical data on income distribution in the USA for the majority (about\n97%) of population. In addition, the upper tail of income distribution (about\n3% of population) follows a power law and expands dramatically during financial\nbubbles, which results in a significant increase of the overall income\ninequality. A mathematical analysis of the empirical data clearly demonstrates\nthe two-class structure of a society, as pointed out Karl Marx and recently\nhighlighted by the Occupy Movement.
