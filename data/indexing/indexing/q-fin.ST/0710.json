An incorrect assumption of stationary increments\ngenerates spurious stylized facts, fat tails and a Hurst exponent H_s=1/2, when\nthe increments are nonstationary, as they are in FX markets. The\nnonstationarity arises from systematic uneveness in noise traders' behavior.\nSpurious results arise mathematically from using a log increment with a\n'sliding window'. We explain why a hard to beat market demands martingale\ndynamics , and martingales with nonlinear variance generate nonstationary\nincrements. The nonstationarity is exhibited directly for Euro/Dollar FX data.\nWe observe that the Hurst exponent H_s generated by the using the sliding\nwindow technique on a time series plays the same role as does Mandelbrot's\nJoseph exponent. Finally, Mandelbrot originally assumed that the 'badly\nbehaved' second moment of cotton returns is due to fat tails, but that\nnonconvergent behavior is instead direct evidence for nonstationary increments.\nSummarizing, the evidence for scaling and fat tails as the basis for\neconophysics and financial economics is provided neither by FX markets nor by\ncotton price data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Oct 2007 05:12:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["McCauley", "Joseph L.", ""], ["Bassler", "Kevin E.", ""], ["Gunaratne", "Gemunu H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.2991", "submitter": "Claudio Albanese", "authors": "Claudio Albanese and Adel Osseiran", "title": "Moment Methods for Exotic Volatility Derivatives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST math.GN math.PR", "license": null, "abstract": "  The latest generation of volatility derivatives goes beyond variance and\nvolatility swaps and probes our ability to price realized variance and sojourn\ntimes along bridges for the underlying stock price process.
