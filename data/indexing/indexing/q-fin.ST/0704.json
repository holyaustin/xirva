These analyses confirm the existence\nof a real-estate bubble, defined as a price acceleration faster than\nexponential, which is found however to be confined to a rather limited time\ninterval in the recent past from approximately 2003 to mid-2004 and has\nprogressively transformed into a more normal growth rate comparable to\npre-bubble levels in 2005. There has been no bubble till 2002 except for a\nmedium-sized surge in 1990. In addition, we have identified a strong yearly\nperiodicity which provides a good potential for fine-tuned prediction from\nmonth to month. A monthly monitoring using a model that we have developed could\nconfirm, by testing the intra-year structure, if indeed the market has returned\nto ``normal'' or if more turbulence is expected ahead. We predict the evolution\nof the indexes one year ahead, which is validated with new data up to Sep.\n2006. The present analysis demonstrates the existence of very significant\nvariations at the local scale, in the sense that the bubble in Las Vegas seems\nto have preceded the more global USA bubble and has ended approximately two\nyears earlier (mid 2004 for Las Vegas compared with mid-2006 for the whole of\nthe USA).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2007 15:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Sornette", "Didier", "", "ETH Zurich"]]}, {"id": "0704.0664", "submitter": "Jaroslaw Kwapien", "authors": "S.
