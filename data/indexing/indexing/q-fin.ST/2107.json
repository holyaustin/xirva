As such, the transition\nfrom current state to another depends on the holding time of the process in the\nstate.

To address the above issues, we\npropose a novel framework-LARA(Locality-Aware Attention and Adaptive Refined\nLabeling), which contains the following three components: 1)Locality-aware\nattention automatically extracts the potentially profitable samples by\nattending to their label information in order to construct a more accurate\nclassifier on these selected samples. 2)Adaptive refined labeling further\niteratively refines the labels, alleviating the noise of samples. 3)Equipped\nwith metric learning techniques, Locality-aware attention enjoys task-specific\ndistance metrics and distributes attention on potentially profitable samples in\na more effective way. To validate our method, we conduct comprehensive\nexperiments on three real-world financial markets: ETFs, the China's A-share\nstock market, and the cryptocurrency market. LARA achieves superior performance\ncompared with the time-series analysis methods and a set of machine learning\nbased competitors on the Qlib platform. Extensive ablation studies and\nexperiments demonstrate that LARA indeed captures more reliable trading\nopportunities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2021 05:52:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Zeng", "Liang", ""], ["Wang", "Lei", ""], ["Niu", "Hui", ""], ["Li", "Jian", ""], ["Zhang", "Ruchen", ""], ["Dai", "Zhonghao", ""], ["Zhu", "Dewei", ""], ["Wang", "Ling", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.12872", "submitter": "Ioane Muni Toke", "authors": "Emmanouil Sfendourakis, Ioane Muni Toke", "title": "LOB modeling using Hawkes processes with a state-dependent factor", "comments": "28 pages, 8 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A point process model for order flows in limit order books is proposed, in\nwhich the conditional intensity is the product of a Hawkes component and a\nstate-dependent factor.

In\nthis paper, we present a collaborative temporal-relational modeling framework\nfor end-to-end stock trend prediction. The temporal dynamics of stocks is\nfirstly captured with an attention-based recurrent neural network. Then,\ndifferent from existing studies relying on the pairwise correlations between\nstocks, we argue that stocks are naturally connected as a collective group, and\nintroduce the hypergraph structures to jointly characterize the stock\ngroup-wise relationships of industry-belonging and fund-holding. A novel\nhypergraph tri-attention network (HGTAN) is proposed to augment the hypergraph\nconvolutional networks with a hierarchical organization of intra-hyperedge,\ninter-hyperedge, and inter-hypergraph attention modules. In this manner, HGTAN\nadaptively determines the importance of nodes, hyperedges, and hypergraphs\nduring the information propagation among stocks, so that the potential\nsynergies between stock movements can be fully exploited. Extensive experiments\non real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Also, the\nresults of investment simulation show that our approach can achieve a more\ndesirable risk-adjusted return.

Our results shows that proper feature\nselection approach could significantly improve the model performance, and for\nfinancial data, some features have high importance score in many models.
