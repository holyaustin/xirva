The latter ones make the method\na significant improvement over the standard least squares estimation.\nTheoretical claims are supported by Monte Carlo simulations.

The abstracted problem,\nextensively studied in the literature, corresponds to finding a probability\nmeasure that minimizes relative entropy with respect to a specified measure\nwhile satisfying constraints on moments of associated random variables. These\nmoments may correspond to views held by experts in the portfolio risk setting\nand to market prices of liquid options for options pricing models. However, it\nis reasonable that in the former settings, the experts may have views on tails\nof risks of some securities. Similarly, in options pricing, significant\nliterature focuses on arriving at the implied risk neutral density of benchmark\ninstruments through observed market prices. With the intent of calibrating\nmodels to these more general stipulations, we develop a unified entropy based\nmethodology to allow constraints on both moments as well as marginal\ndistributions of functions of underlying securities. This is applied to\nMarkowitz portfolio framework, where a view that a particular portfolio incurs\nheavy tailed losses is shown to lead to fatter and more reasonable tails for\nlosses of component securities.

In order to capture the features of influence by the\nswarm behaviors, from price data derived from our simulations using these\nmodels, we analyzed the price movement range, that is, how much the price is\nmoved when it is continuously moved in a single direction. Depending on the\ntype of swarm behavior, we saw a difference in the cumulative frequency\ndistribution of this price movement range. In particular, for the model of\ninvestors who followed a trend in the historical price movement, we saw the\npower law in the tail of the cumulative frequency distribution of this price\nmovement range.
