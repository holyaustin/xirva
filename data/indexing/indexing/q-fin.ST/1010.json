This paper studies the behaviour of\ndifferent insurance policies in the context of capital reduction for a range of\npossible extreme loss models and insurance policy scenarios in a multi-period,\nmultiple risk settings. A Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) for modelling of\nthe annual loss process, involving homogeneous compound Poisson processes for\nthe annual losses, with heavy tailed severity models comprised of alpha-stable\nseverities is considered. There has been little analysis of such models to date\nand it is believed, insurance models will play more of a role in OpRisk\nmitigation and capital reduction in future. The first question of interest is\nwhen would it be equitable for a bank or financial institution to purchase\ninsurance for heavy tailed OpRisk losses under different insurance policy\nscenarios? The second question then pertains to Solvency II and addresses what\nthe insurers capital would be for such operational risk scenarios under\ndifferent policy offerings. In addition we consider the insurers perspective\nwith respect to fair premium as a percentage above the expected annual claim\nfor each insurance policy. The intention being to address questions related to\nVaR reduction under Basel II, SCR under Solvency II and fair insurance premiums\nin OpRisk for different extreme loss scenarios. In the process we provide\nclosed form solutions for the distribution of loss process and claims process\nin an LDA structure as well as closed form analytic solutions for the Expected\nShortfall, SCR and MCR under Basel II and Solvency II.
