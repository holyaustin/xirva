However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and\nanti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects\nin agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing\nmicroscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters\nfrom empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results.\n  Methods: To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility\ncorrelation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and\ncollective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based\nmodel. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and\nparticularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors' asymmetric\ntrading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we\npropose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from\nhistorical market data.\n  Results: With the model parameters determined for six representative\nstock-market indices in the world respectively, we obtain the corresponding\nleverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in\nagreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time,\nour model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail\ndistribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities.\n  Conclusions: We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both\nthe investors' asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation\nmechanisms. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the\ndetermination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems\nwith similar asymmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 09:22:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jun-jie", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""], ["Tan", "Lei", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5466", "submitter": "Ladislav Kristoufek", "authors": "Ladislav Kristoufek and Petra Lunackova", "title": "Rockets and feathers meet Joseph: Reinvestigating the oil-gasoline\n  asymmetry on the international markets", "comments": "20 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": "Energy Economics, Volume 49, May 2015, Pages 1-8", "doi": "10.1016/j.eneco.2015.01.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  We reinvestigate the \"rockets and feathers\" effect between retail gasoline\nand crude oil prices in a new framework of fractional integration, long-term\nmemory and borderline (non-)stationarity.

The statistical analysis of such a\nmulti-dimensional time series of option prices corresponding to $n$ strikes\n(with $n$ large, e.g. $n\\geq 40$) and the same maturity, is a difficult task\ndue to the fact that option prices at any moment in time satisfy non-linear and\nnon-explicit no-arbitrage restrictions.
