This flattening of the distribution\ncontrasts with a large body of empirical literature which finds a Pareto\ndistribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time. Pareto\ndistributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of proportional random\ngrowth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale.

The exogenous component of overnight volatilities is\nfound to be close to zero, which means that the lion's share of overnight\nvolatility comes from feedback effects. The residual kurtosis of returns is\nsmall for intra-day returns but infinite for overnight returns. We provide a\nplausible interpretation for these findings, and show that our\nIntra-Day/Overnight model significantly outperforms the standard ARCH framework\nbased on daily returns for Out-of-Sample predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 13:59:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2014 15:46:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Blanc", "Pierre", ""], ["Chicheportiche", "R\u00e9my", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.7119", "submitter": "Yanshan Wang", "authors": "Yanshan Wang", "title": "Stock price direction prediction by directly using prices data: an\n  empirical study on the KOSPI and HSI", "comments": "in International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining,\n  2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1504/IJBIDM.2014.065091", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.LG q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as an early\nrecommendation system for short-term investors and as an early financial\ndistress warning system for long-term shareholders. Many stock prediction\nstudies focus on using macroeconomic indicators, such as CPI and GDP, to train\nthe prediction model. However, daily data of the macroeconomic indicators are\nalmost impossible to obtain. Thus, those methods are difficult to be employed\nin practice. In this paper, we propose a method that directly uses prices data\nto predict market index direction and stock price direction. An extensive\nempirical study of the proposed method is presented on the Korean Composite\nStock Price Index (KOSPI) and Hang Seng Index (HSI), as well as the individual\nconstituents included in the indices. The experimental results show notably\nhigh hit ratios in predicting the movements of the individual constituents in\nthe KOSPI and HIS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2013 05:35:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Jul 2016 15:12:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 7 Jan 2017 00:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yanshan", ""]]}]
