However, an in-depth analysis\nof the data using maximum likelihood estimation and different goodness-of-fit\ntests rejects the L\\'evy-stable law as a plausible underlying probabilistic\nmodel. The analysis shows that the Normal Inverse Gaussian distribution\nprovides an overall fit for the data better than any of the other subclasses of\nthe family of the Generalized Hyperbolic distributions and certainly much\nbetter than the L\\'evy-stable laws. Furthermore, the right (resp. left) tail of\nthe distribution seems to follow a power-law with exponent \\alpha=4.60 (resp.\n\\alpha =4.28).

We argue that the concept\nof corridor implied volatility (CIV) should be used instead of the popular\nmodel-free option-implied volatility (MFIV) when assessing the fractional\ncointegrating relation as the latter may introduce bias to the estimation. For\nthe realized volatility, we use recently proposed methods which are robust to\nnoise as well as jumps and interestingly we find that it does not affect the\nimplied-realized volatility relation. In addition, we develop a new tool for\nthe estimation of fractional cointegrating relation between implied and\nrealized volatility based on wavelets, a wavelet band least squares (WBLS). The\nmain advantage of WBLS in comparison to other frequency domain methods is that\nit allows us to work conveniently with potentially non-stationary volatility\ndue to the properties of wavelets. We study the dynamics of the relationship in\nthe time-frequency domain with the wavelet coherence confirming that the\ndependence comes solely from the lower frequencies of the spectra. Motivated by\nthis result we estimate the relationship only on this part of the spectra using\nWBLS and compare our results to the fully modified narrow-band least squares\n(FMNBLS) based on the Fourier frequencies. In the estimation, we use the S&P\n500 and DAX monthly and bi-weekly option prices covering the recent financial\ncrisis and we conclude that in the long-run, volatility inferred from the\noption prices using the corridor implied volatility (CIV) provides an unbiased\nforecast of the realized volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Aug 2012 19:18:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Feb 2013 19:47:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Barunik", "Jozef", ""], ["Barunikova", "Michaela", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5896", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Paulette Clippe and Marcel Ausloos", "title": "Benford's law and Theil transform of financial data", "comments": "23 pages, 3 tables, 52 refs., 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A (2012) 6556-6567", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2012.07.063", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Among econophysics investigations, studies of religious groups have been of\ninterest.

On the other hand,\nBenford's law is known to be invariant under scale and base transformation.\nTherefore, as a further test, of both such data and Benford's law use, the\nyearly financial reports are nonlinearly remapped through a sort of Theil\ntransformation, i.e. based on a log-transformation. The resulting data is again\nanalyzed along the Benford's law scheme.
