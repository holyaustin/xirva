We show that the econometric structure of the problem\nallows us to construct convenient and powerful confidence regions based upon\nthe weighted likelihood ratio and weighted Wald (directed weighted Hausdorff)\nstatistics. The statistics we formulate differ (in part) from existing\nstatistics in that they enforce either exact or first order equivariance to\ntransformations of parameters, making them especially appealing in the target\napplications. Moreover, the resulting inference procedures are also more\npowerful than the structured projection methods, which rely upon building\nconfidence sets for the frontier-determining sufficient parameters (e.g.\nfrontier-spanning portfolios), and then projecting them to obtain confidence\nsets for HJ sets or MF sets. Lastly, the framework we put forward is also\nuseful for analyzing intersection bounds, namely sets defined as solutions to\nmultiple smooth inequalities, since multiple inequalities can be conservatively\napproximated by a single smooth inequality.
