It is known that quantile based risk measures\nsuch as value at risk are elicitable. In this paper we show that law-invariant\nspectral risk measures such as expected shortfall are not elicitable unless\nthey reduce to minus the expected value.

This is a well known\nfinancial puzzle to explain, since assuming foreign exchange risk is\nuninhibited and the markets have rational risk-neutral investors, then one\nwould not expect profits from such strategies. That is uncovered interest rate\nparity (UIP), the parity condition in which exposure to foreign exchange risk,\nwith unanticipated changes in exchange rates, should result in an outcome that\nchanges in the exchange rate should offset the potential to profit from such\ninterest rate differentials. The two primary assumptions required for interest\nrate parity are related to capital mobility and perfect substitutability of\ndomestic and foreign assets. Given foreign exchange market equilibrium, the\ninterest rate parity condition implies that the expected return on domestic\nassets will equal the exchange rate-adjusted expected return on foreign\ncurrency assets.\n  However, it has been shown empirically, that investors can actually earn\narbitrage profits by borrowing in a country with a lower interest rate,\nexchanging for foreign currency, and investing in a foreign country with a\nhigher interest rate, whilst allowing for any losses (or gains) from exchanging\nback to their domestic currency at maturity. Therefore trading strategies that\naim to exploit the interest rate differentials can be profitable on average.\nThe intention of this paper is therefore to reinterpret the currency carry\ntrade puzzle in light of heavy tailed marginal models coupled with multivariate\ntail dependence features in the analysis of the risk-reward for the currency\nportfolios with high interest rate differentials and low interest rate\ndifferentials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 16:43:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Mar 2013 09:27:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 12 Jan 2014 13:09:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ames", "Matthew", ""], ["Bagnarosa", "Guillaume", ""], ["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.4351", "submitter": "Alessandro Pluchino", "authors": "A.E.Biondo, A.Pluchino, A.Rapisarda, D.Helbing", "title": "Are random trading strategies more successful than technical ones?", "comments": "17 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 8(7): e68344 (2013)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0068344", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we explore the specific role of randomness in financial\nmarkets, inspired by the beneficial role of noise in many physical systems and\nin previous applications to complex socio- economic systems.
