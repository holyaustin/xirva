Due to the absence of readily available Uganda\nStock Exchange(USE) data, and the placement of daily price lists in pdf only,\non the USE website: http://www.use.or.ug, the article also discusses the\nprocedures taken to mine the data needed. The securities were all put in one\nportfolio in order to diversify away the firm-specific part of returns thereby\nenhancing the precision of the beta estimates. This paper should be of interest\nto both Ugandan and non-Ugandan investors and market researchers. While many\ndeveloping countries have legal restrictions against foreign participation in\ncapital and money markets, this is not so in Uganda, where it has become part\nof government policy to encourage foreign capital in flow, inorder to stimulate\nthe development of the small and underdeveloped markets.\n  The Black, Jensen, and Scholes (1972) CAPM version is examined in this\narticle. This version predicts a non zero-beta rate, along with the relation of\nhigher returns to higher risk. The estimated zero-beta rate obtained is not\nstatistically different from zero, and the estimated portfolio beta coefficient\nis statistically significant, providing evidence that the traditional form of\nCAPM holds on the USE, albeit having a beta coefficient that is not good at\nexplaining the relationship between risk and return.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 00:26:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wakyiku", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0240", "submitter": "Andrew Wilson", "authors": "Andrew Gordon Wilson, Zoubin Ghahramani", "title": "Generalised Wishart Processes", "comments": "14 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

Unlike existing models, it can\ncapture a diverse class of covariance structures, it can easily handle missing\ndata, the dependent variable can readily include covariates other than time,\nand it scales well with dimension; there is no need for free parameters, and\noptional parameters are easy to interpret. We describe how to construct the\nGWP, introduce general procedures for inference and predictions, and show that\nit outperforms its main competitor, multivariate GARCH, even on financial data\nthat especially suits GARCH. We also show how to predict the mean of a\nmultivariate process while accounting for dynamic correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 12:25:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wilson", "Andrew Gordon", ""], ["Ghahramani", "Zoubin", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1847", "submitter": "Matthieu Cristelli", "authors": "M.

For example, in the case\nof the VEC family, the number of parameters involved in the model grows as a\npolynomial of order four on the dimensionality of the problem. Moreover, these\nparameters are subjected to convoluted nonlinear constraints necessary to\nensure, for instance, the existence of stationary solutions and the positive\nsemidefinite character of the conditional covariance matrices used in the model\ndesign. So far, this problem has been addressed in the literature only in low\ndimensional cases with strong parsimony constraints. In this paper we propose a\ngeneral formulation of the estimation problem in any dimension and develop a\nBregman-proximal trust-region method for its solution. The Bregman-proximal\napproach allows us to handle the constraints in a very efficient and natural\nway by staying in the primal space and the Trust-Region mechanism stabilizes\nand speeds up the scheme. Preliminary computational experiments are presented\nand confirm the very good performances of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 08:41:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Chr\u00e9tien", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Ortega", "Juan-Pablo", ""]]}]
