We find evidence\nthat healthcare expenditures are quantifiable as an infusion-diffusion process,\nwhich can be thought of intuitively as a steady change in the intensity of\ntreatment superimposed on a random process reflecting variations in the\nefficiency and effectiveness of treatment. The arithmetic mean represents the\nnet average annual cost of healthcare; and when multiplied by the arithmetic\nstandard deviation, which represents the effective risk, the result is a\nmeasure of healthcare cost control. Policymakers, providers, payors, or\npatients that decrease these parameters are generating value in healthcare. The\nmodel has an average absolute prediction error of approximately 10-12% across\nthe range of expenditures which spans 6 orders of magnitude over a nearly\n10-year period. For the top 1% of the population with the largest expenditures,\nrepresenting 20%-30% of total spending on healthcare, a power-law relationship\nemerges. This relationship also applies to the most expensive medical\nconditions in the US. A fundamental connection between healthcare expenditures\nand mathematical finance is found by showing that the process healthcare\nexpenditures follow is similar to a widely used model for managing financial\nassets, leading to the conclusion that a combination of these two fields may\nyield useful results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Jun 2008 21:54:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gardner", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2617", "submitter": "S\\'ilvio Duarte Queir\\'os M.", "authors": "Silvio M.

Our agents\ninvest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on\nthree sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)\ninformation from their \"friendship\" network and (iii) private information. Our\nbounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the\ncurrent market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in\ntheir trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find\nthat bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due\nto a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a\ntransient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the\nprice has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,\nwhich brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients\nprovide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial\nmarkets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current\nmarket regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.\nA positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms\n(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles\nand crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite\n(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a\nsingle framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the\ndistribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are\nqualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 13:14:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:52:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Harras", "Georges", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.3171", "submitter": "Markus Porto", "authors": "H.
