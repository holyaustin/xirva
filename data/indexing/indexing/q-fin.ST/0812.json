Yearly samples available from 1978 to 2005 were studied\nand evidence was found that the complementary cumulative distribution of\npersonal income for 99% of the economically less favorable population is well\nrepresented by a Gompertz curve of the form $G(x)=\\exp [\\exp (A-Bx)]$, where\n$x$ is the normalized individual income. The complementary cumulative\ndistribution of the remaining 1% richest part of the population is well\nrepresented by a Pareto power law distribution $P(x)= \\beta x^{-\\alpha}$. This\nresult means that similarly to other countries, Brazil's income distribution is\ncharacterized by a well defined two class system. The parameters $A$, $B$,\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ were determined by a mixture of boundary conditions,\nnormalization and fitting methods for every year in the time span of this\nstudy. Since the Gompertz curve is characteristic of growth models, its\npresence here suggests that these patterns in income distribution could be a\nconsequence of the growth dynamics of the underlying economic system. In\naddition, we found out that the percentage share of both the Gompertzian and\nParetian components relative to the total income shows an approximate cycling\npattern with periods of about 4 years and whose maximum and minimum peaks in\neach component alternate at about every 2 years. This finding suggests that the\ngrowth dynamics of Brazil's economic system might possibly follow a\nGoodwin-type class model dynamics based on the application of the\nLotka-Volterra equation to economic growth and cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2008 13:04:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Moura", "Newton J.", "Jr."], ["Ribeiro", "Marcelo B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3538", "submitter": "Nicolas Savy", "authors": "A.
