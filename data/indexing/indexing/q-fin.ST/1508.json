Rather than building ad hoc analytic approximations, we advocate\nthe use of modern statistical tools from machine learning to generate a\nflexible, non-parametric surrogate for the true mappings.

Non-parametric empirical estimates of drift and volatility\nshow that the predicted first-order analogy between economics and physics are\nincorrect. The clue is to realise that the random walk nature of financial\nprices results from the continuous anticipations of traders about future\nopportunities, whose aggregate actions translate into an approximate efficient\nmarket with almost no arbitrage opportunities. With the Swiss National Bank\nstated commitment to enforce the barrier, traders's anticipation of this action\nleads to a vanishing drift together with a volatility of the exchange rate that\ndepends on the distance to the barrier. We give direct quantitative empirical\nevidence that this effect is well described by Krugman's target zone model\n[P.R. Krugman.
