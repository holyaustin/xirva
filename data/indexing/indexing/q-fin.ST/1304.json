The data sets\nused cover the world's richest persons over 1996-2012, the richest Americans\nover 1988-2012, the richest Chinese over 2006-2012 and the richest Russians\nover 2004-2011. Using a recently introduced comprehensive empirical methodology\nfor detecting power laws, which allows for testing goodness of fit as well as\nfor comparing the power-law model with rival distributions, we find that a\npower-law model is consistent with data only in 35% of the analysed data sets.\nMoreover, even if wealth data are consistent with the power-law model, usually\nthey are also consistent with some rivals like the log-normal or stretched\nexponential distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Mar 2013 14:45:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Brzezinski", "Michal", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.0353", "submitter": "Pedro Vitoria", "authors": "Galen Sher, Pedro Vitoria", "title": "An Information-Theoretic Test for Dependence with an Application to the\n  Temporal Structure of Stock Returns", "comments": "22 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.IT math.IT stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Information theory provides ideas for conceptualising information and\nmeasuring relationships between objects.

It uses data compression to\nestimate the entropy rate of a stochastic process, which allows it to measure\ndependence among sets of random variables, as opposed to the existing\neconometric literature that uses entropy and finds itself restricted to\npairwise tests of dependence.

Furthermore, DD allows for changes in the\nsupport of the mid asset price distribution, allowing one to include a minimum\npermitted value for the mid price, either positive or negative. We study the\ndependence of the optimal solution on the choice of the risk aversion\ncriterion.
