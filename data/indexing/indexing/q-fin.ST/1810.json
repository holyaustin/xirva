Although deep learning performs quite well, it has\nsignificant disadvantages such as a lack of transparency and limitations to the\ninterpretability of the prediction. This is prone to practical problems in\nterms of accountability. Thus, we construct a multifactor model by using\ninterpretable deep learning. We implement deep learning as a return model to\npredict stock returns with various factors. Then, we present the application of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to decompose attributes of the predicted\nreturn as a risk model. By applying LRP to an individual stock or a portfolio\nbasis, we can determine which factor contributes to prediction. We call this\nmodel a deep factor model. We then perform an empirical analysis on the\nJapanese stock market and show that our deep factor model has better predictive\ncapability than the traditional linear model or other machine learning methods.\nIn addition , we illustrate which factor contributes to prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2018 04:18:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Nakagawa", "Kei", ""], ["Uchida", "Takumi", ""], ["Aoshima", "Tomohisa", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.04725", "submitter": "Richard Chen", "authors": "Richard Y.

The study employs an aggregate of four sets of portfolios mimicking size\nand industry with varying dimensions.

The second set comprises of five index portfolios, third, a four-set\nof twenty-five portfolios each sorted on size to B/M, size to investment, size\nto profitability, and size to momentum, and the final set constitute thirty\nindustry portfolios. To estimate the parameters of six-factor asset pricing\nmodel for the four sets of variant portfolios, we use OLS and Generalized\nmethod of moments based robust instrumental variables technique (IVGMM). The\nresults obtained from the relevance, endogeneity, overidentifying restrictions,\nand the Hausman's specification, tests indicate that the parameter estimates of\nthe six-factor model using IVGMM are robust and performs better than the OLS\napproach. The human capital component shares equally the predictive power\nalongside the factors in the framework in explaining the variations in return\non portfolios. Furthermore, we assess the t-ratio of the human capital\ncomponent of each IVGMM estimates of the six-factor asset pricing model for the\nfour sets of variant portfolios. The t-ratio of the human capital of the\neighty-three IVGMM estimates are more than 3.00 with reference to the standard\nproposed by Harvey et al. (2016).
