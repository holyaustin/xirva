We\nquantify the rate n(t) of aftershocks following an interest rate change at time\nT, and find power-law decay which scales as n(t-T) (t-T)^-$\\Omega$, with\n$\\Omega$ positive. Surprisingly, we find that the same law describes the rate\nn'(|t-T|) of \"pre-shocks\" before the interest rate change at time T. This is\nthe first study to quantitatively relate the size of the market response to the\nnews which caused the shock and to uncover the presence of quantifiable\npreshocks. We demonstrate that the news associated with interest rate change is\nresponsible for causing both the anticipation before the announcement and the\nsurprise after the announcement. We estimate the magnitude of financial news\nusing the relative difference between the U. S. Treasury Bill and the Federal\nFunds Effective rate. Our results are consistent with the \"sign effect,\" in\nwhich \"bad news\" has a larger impact than \"good news.\" Furthermore, we observe\nsignificant volatility aftershocks, confirming a \"market underreaction\" that\nlasts at least 1 trading day.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2009 22:05:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2009 16:43:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 3 Oct 2010 13:10:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Petersen", "Alexander M.", ""], ["Wang", "Fengzhong", ""], ["Havlin", "Shlomo", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

Where separation of time scales occurs, identification of analogous\nobjects in financial markets can help advance our understanding of their\ndynamics. To detect separated time scales and identify their associated\neffective degrees of freedom in financial markets, we devised a two-stage\nstatistical clustering scheme to analyze the price movements of stocks in\nseveral equity markets.

In general,\nthe detailed compositions of these dynamical structures cannot be deduced based\non raw financial intuition alone, and must be explained in terms of the\nunderlying portfolios, and investment strategies of market players.
