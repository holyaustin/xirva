This paper proposes a new dynamic portfolio strategy based on\nthe time-varying structures of MST networks in Chinese stock markets, where the\nmarket condition is further considered when using the optimal portfolios for\ninvestment. A portfolio strategy comprises two stages: selecting the portfolios\nby choosing central and peripheral stocks in the selection horizon using five\ntopological parameters, i.e., degree, betweenness centrality, distance on\ndegree criterion, distance on correlation criterion and distance on distance\ncriterion, then using the portfolios for investment in the investment horizon.\nThe optimal portfolio is chosen by comparing central and peripheral portfolios\nunder different combinations of market conditions in the selection and\ninvestment horizons. Market conditions in our paper are identified by the\nratios of the number of trading days with rising index or the sum of the\namplitudes of the trading days with rising index to the total number of trading\ndays. We find that central portfolios outperform peripheral portfolios when the\nmarket is under a drawup condition, or when the market is stable or drawup in\nthe selection horizon and is under a stable condition in the investment\nhorizon. We also find that the peripheral portfolios gain more than central\nportfolios when the market is stable in the selection horizon and is drawdown\nin the investment horizon.
