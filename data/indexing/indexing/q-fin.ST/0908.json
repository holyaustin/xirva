A\nsignificant anti-correlation between dispersion and cross-sectional kurtosis is\nfound such that dispersion is high but kurtosis is low in panic times, and the\nopposite in normal times. The co-movement of stock returns also increases in\npanic times. We define a simple statistic $s$, the normalized sum of signs of\nreturns on a given day, to capture the degree of correlation in the system. $s$\ncan be seen as the order parameter of the system because if $s= 0$ there is no\ncorrelation (a disordered state), whereas for $s \\ne 0$ there is correlation\namong stocks (an ordered state). We make an analogy to non-equilibrium phase\ntransitions and hypothesize that financial markets undergo self-organization\nwhen the external volatility perception rises above some critical value.\nIndeed, the distribution of $s$ is unimodal in normal times, shifting to\nbimodal in times of panic. This is consistent with a second order phase\ntransition. Simulations of a joint stochastic process for stocks use a multi\ntimescale process in the temporal direction and an equation for the order\nparameter $s$ for the dynamics of the cross-sectional correlation. Numerical\nresults show good qualitative agreement with the stylized facts of real data,\nin both normal and panic times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2009 09:27:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 03:50:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Borland", "Lisa", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0202", "submitter": "Esteban Moro", "authors": "Esteban Moro, Javier Vicente, Luis G.

The\ntemporal structure and fat-tailed distribution of the returns are considered as\npossible influence factors. The multifractal spectrum of the original return\nseries is compared with those of four kinds of surrogate data: (1) shuffled\ndata that contain no temporal correlation but have the same distribution, (2)\nsurrogate data in which any nonlinear correlation is removed but the\ndistribution and linear correlation are preserved, (3) surrogate data in which\nlarge positive and negative returns are replaced with small values, and (4)\nsurrogate data generated from alternative fat-tailed distributions with the\ntemporal correlation preserved. We find that all these factors have influence\non the multifractal spectrum. We also find that the temporal structure (linear\nor nonlinear) has minor impact on the singularity width $\\Delta\\alpha$ of the\nmultifractal spectrum while the fat tails have major impact on $\\Delta\\alpha$,\nwhich confirms the earlier results. In addition, the linear correlation is\nfound to have only a horizontal translation effect on the multifractal spectrum\nin which the distance is approximately equal to the difference between its DFA\nscaling exponent and 0.5. Our method can also be applied to other financial or\nphysical variables and other multifractal formalisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Aug 2009 17:24:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2009 04:54:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}, {"id": "0908.1555", "submitter": "Stefan Thurner", "authors": "Stefan Thurner, J.

All this changes when the funds are\nallowed to leverage, i.e. borrow from a bank, to purchase more assets than\ntheir wealth would otherwise permit. During good times competition drives\ninvestors to funds that use more leverage, because they have higher profits. As\nleverage increases price fluctuations become heavy tailed and display clustered\nvolatility, similar to what is observed in real markets. Previous explanations\nof fat tails and clustered volatility depended on \"irrational behavior\", such\nas trend following. Here instead this comes from the fact that leverage limits\ncause funds to sell into a falling market: A prudent bank makes itself locally\nsafer by putting a limit to leverage, so when a fund exceeds its leverage\nlimit, it must partially repay its loan by selling the asset. Unfortunately\nthis sometimes happens to all the funds simultaneously when the price is\nalready falling. The resulting nonlinear feedback amplifies large downward\nprice movements. At the extreme this causes crashes, but the effect is seen at\nevery time scale, producing a power law of price disturbances. A standard\n(supposedly more sophisticated) risk control policy in which individual banks\nbase leverage limits on volatility causes leverage to rise during periods of\nlow volatility, and to contract more quickly when volatility gets high, making\nthese extreme fluctuations even worse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2009 18:31:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jan 2010 14:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Thurner", "Stefan", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

We introduce the \"quasi-unbiased estimators\", that can address any\ntype of desirable constraints. The main tool of our theory is the parsimonious\nencoding of all the information contained in the OHLC prices for a given time\ninterval in the form of the joint distributions of the high-minus-open,\nlow-minus-open and close-minus-open values, whose analytical expression is\nderived exactly for Wiener processes with drift. The distributions can be\ncalculated to yield the most efficient estimators associated with any\nstatistical properties of the underlying log-price stochastic process. Applied\nto Wiener processes for log-prices with drift, we provide explicit analytical\nexpressions for the most efficient point-wise volatility and variance\nestimators, based on the analytical expression of the joint distribution of the\nhigh-minus-open, low-minus-open and close-minus-open values.
