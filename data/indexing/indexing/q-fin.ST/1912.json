The experiment results show\nthat ADNN can construct more informative and diversified features than GP,\nwhich can effectively enriches the current factor pool. The fully-connected\nnetwork and recurrent network are better at extracting information from the\nfinancial time series than the convolution neural network. In real practice,\nfeatures constructed by ADNN can always improve multi-factor strategies'\nrevenue, sharpe ratio, and max draw-down, compared with the investment\nstrategies without these factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Dec 2019 03:10:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Jan 2020 06:29:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 12:57:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:51:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2020 06:18:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 3 Oct 2020 16:07:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2020 16:29:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2020 06:22:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Fang", "Jie", ""], ["Xia", "Shutao", ""], ["Lin", "Jianwu", ""], ["Xia", "Zhikang", ""], ["Liu", "Xiang", ""], ["Jiang", "Yong", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.12354", "submitter": "Michael Benzaquen", "authors": "Armine Karami, Raphael Benichou, Michael Benzaquen, Jean-Philippe\n  Bouchaud", "title": "Conditional Correlations and Principal Regression Analysis for Futures", "comments": "12 pages, 14 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cond-mat.stat-mech q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We explore the effect of past market movements on the instantaneous\ncorrelations between assets within the futures market.

In revisiting the role of gold, our\nstudy proposes new insights into the literature. First, our empirical design\nrelaxes the assumption of homogeneous investors in favour of agents with\ndifferent horizons. Second, we develop a new measure of correlation based on\nthe fractal approach, called the q-detrending moving average cross-correlation\ncoefficient. This allows us to measure the dependence for calm and extreme\nmovements. The proposed measure is both time-varying and time-scale varying,\ntaking into account the complex pattern of commodities and financial time\nseries (chaotic, non-stationary, etc.). Using intraday data from May 2017 to\nMarch 2019, including 35608 observations for each variable, our results are as\nfollows. First, we show a negative and significant average and tail dependence\nfor all time scales between gold and USD exchange rates that is consistent with\nthe gold's role as an effective hedge and safe-haven asset. Second, this study\nputs out average independence and positive and significant tail independence\nbetween gold and oil indicating that gold can be used by investors as a weak\nhedge but cannot be used as an effective safe-haven asset under exceptional\nmarket circumstances for all time scales. Third, we examine the hedging and\nstabilising benefits of gold over calm and turmoil periods for gold-oil futures\nand gold-currency portfolios by estimation of the optimal portfolio weights and\nthe optimal hedge ratio. We confirm the usefulness of gold for hedging and safe\nhavens at different investment horizons, which favors the inclusion of gold\nfutures in oil futures and currency portfolios for risk management purposes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Dec 2019 06:31:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Madani", "Mohamed Arbi", ""], ["Ftiti", "Zied", ""]]}]
