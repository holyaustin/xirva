The proliferation of financial\ninstruments apparently provides more means for risk diversification, making the\nmarket more efficient and complete. In the simple market of interacting traders\ndiscussed here, the proliferation of financial instruments erodes systemic\nstability and it drives the market to a critical state characterized by large\nsusceptibility, strong fluctuations and enhanced correlations among risks. This\nsuggests that the hypothesis of APT may not be compatible with a stable market\ndynamics. In this perspective, market stability acquires the properties of a\ncommon good, which suggests that appropriate measures should be introduced in\nderivative markets, to preserve stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 12:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0087", "submitter": "Md Nurujjaman", "authors": "A.N.Sekar Iyengar", "title": "Wavelet Based Volatility Clustering Estimation of Foreign Exchange Rates", "comments": "Time-Scale analysis, Intermittency, Nonlinearity, Chaos and finance", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST nlin.CD", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We have presented a novel technique of detecting intermittencies in a\nfinancial time series of the foreign exchange rate data of U.S.- Euro\ndollar(US/EUR) using a combination of both statistical and spectral techniques.\nThis has been possible due to Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) analysis which\nhas been popularly applied to fluctuating data in various fields science and\nengineering and is also being tried out in finance and economics.

The branching ratio $b_x$ is defined as $b_x=\nE[\\xi_x/x]$. The random variable $\\xi_x$ is the value of the next signal given\nthat the previous one is equal to $x$, so $\\xi_x=\\{X_{t+1}|X_t=x\\}$.

For stock prices we find $b_x=1$\nwithin statistical uncertainty, for all $x$, consistent with an ``efficient\nmarket hypothesis''. For stock volumes, solar X-ray flux intensities, and the\nBak-Tang-Wiesenfeld (BTW) sandpile model, $b_x$ is supercritical for small\nvalues of activity and subcritical for the largest ones, indicating a tendency\nto return to a typical value. For stock volumes this tendency has an\napproximate power law behavior. For solar X-ray flux and the BTW model, there\nis a broad regime of activity where $b_x \\simeq 1$, which we interpret as an\nindicator of critical behavior. This is true despite different underlying\nprobability distributions for $X_t$, and for $\\xi_x$. For the BTW model the\ndistribution of $\\xi_x$ is Gaussian, for $x$ sufficiently larger than one, and\nits variance grows linearly with $x$. Hence, the activity in the BTW model\nobeys a central limit theorem when sampling over past histories. The broad\nregion of activity where $b_x$ is close to one disappears once bulk dissipation\nis introduced in the BTW model -- supporting our hypothesis that it is an\nindicator of criticality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 18:18:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Elliot", ""], ["Shreim", "Amer", ""], ["Paczuski", "Maya", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.2474", "submitter": "Maria N.
