This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It\nintroduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to\nseveral other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a\nnon-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The\nanalysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly\ncorrelated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such\nas bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a\nmarginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the\ninteractions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a\ncausality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures\nand shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across\ncurrencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of\nsignificative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich\nstructure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other\nboth instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is\nthat minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in\nshaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level\nof noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are\nsignificant with all links statistically validated and with a structural\norganisation consistently reproduced across all networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 09:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aste", "Tomaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.00954", "submitter": "Jonas Rothfuss", "authors": "Jonas Rothfuss, Fabio Ferreira, Simon Walther, Maxim Ulrich", "title": "Conditional Density Estimation with Neural Networks: Best Practices and\n  Benchmarks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.LG q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Given a set of empirical observations, conditional density estimation aims to\ncapture the statistical relationship between a conditional variable\n$\\mathbf{x}$ and a dependent variable $\\mathbf{y}$ by modeling their\nconditional probability $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$.
