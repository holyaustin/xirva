The common\nproblem is that the latent parameters of many volatility models are\nhigh-dimensional and analytically intractable, which means inferences require\napproximations using, for example, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Laplace\nmethods. Some SV models are expressed as a linear Gaussian state-space model\nthat leads to a marginal likelihood, reducing the dimensionality of the\nproblem. Others are not linearized, and the latent parameters are integrated\nout. However, these present a quite restrictive evolution equation. Thus, we\npropose a Bayesian GED-Gamma SV model with a direct marginal likelihood that is\na product of the generalized Student's t-distributions in which the latent\nstates are related across time through a stationary Gaussian evolution\nequation. Then, an approximation is made for the prior distribution of\nlog-precision/volatility, without the need for model linearization. This also\nallows for the computation of the marginal likelihood function, where the\nhigh-dimensional latent states are integrated out and easily sampled in blocks\nusing a smoothing procedure.

Then we develop maximum\nlikelihood estimation methodology for parametric specifications of the process.\nWe apply state-dependent Hawkes processes to high-frequency limit order book\ndata, allowing us to build a novel model that captures the feedback loop\nbetween the order flow and the shape of the limit order book. We estimate two\nspecifications of the model, using the bid-ask spread and the queue imbalance\nas state variables, and find that excitation effects in the order flow are\nstrongly state-dependent. Additionally, we find that the endogeneity of the\norder flow, measured by the magnitude of excitation, is also state-dependent,\nbeing more pronounced in disequilibrium states of the limit order book.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2018 12:29:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2018 18:42:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Morariu-Patrichi", "Maxime", ""], ["Pakkanen", "Mikko S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08403", "submitter": "Knut Solna", "authors": "Josselin Garnier, Knut Solna", "title": "Chaos and Order in the Bitcoin Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2019.04.164", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The bitcoin price has surged in recent years and it has also exhibited phases\nof rapid decay. In this paper we address the question to what extent this novel\ncryptocurrency market can be viewed as a classic or semi-efficient market.\nNovel and robust tools for estimation of multi-fractal properties are used to\nshow that the bitcoin price exhibits a very interesting multi-scale correlation\nstructure. This structure can be described by a power-law behavior of the\nvariances of the returns as functions of time increments and it can be\ncharacterized by two parameters, the volatility and the Hurst exponent. These\npower-law parameters, however, vary in time. A new notion of generalized Hurst\nexponent is introduced which allows us to check if the multi-fractal character\nof the underlying signal is well captured. It is moreover shown how the\nmonitoring of the power-law parameters can be used to identify regime shifts\nfor the bitcoin price. A novel technique for identifying the regimes switches\nbased on a goodness of fit of the local power-law parameters is presented. It\nautomatically detects dates associated with some known events in the bitcoin\nmarket place. A very surprising result is moreover that, despite the wild ride\nof the bitcoin price in recent years and its multi-fractal and non-stationary\ncharacter, this price has both local power-law behaviors and a very orderly\ncorrelation structure when it is observed on its entire period of existence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2018 08:16:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2019 00:42:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Garnier", "Josselin", ""], ["Solna", "Knut", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08416", "submitter": "Henrik Rasmussen Dr", "authors": "Henrik O.
