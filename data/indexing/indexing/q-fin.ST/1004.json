We\nreplace the popular approach to sampling Bayesian CVAR models, involving griddy\nGibbs, with an automated efficient alternative, based on the Adaptive\nMetropolis algorithm of Roberts and Rosenthal, (2009). Developing the adaptive\nMCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of\nposterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than\npreviously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional\nCVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension $3n^2 + n$, with\nsignificant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables.\nWe also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint\ninference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian\nposterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model\nparameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.\nPractically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated\nBayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering\ninstruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets. Previously the\nliterature on financial applications of CVAR trading models typically only\nconsiders pairs trading (n=2) due to the computational cost of the griddy\nGibbs. We are able to extend under our adaptive framework to $n >> 2$ and\ndemonstrate an example with n = 10, resulting in a posterior distribution with\nparameters up to dimension 310. By also considering the rank as a random\nquantity we can ensure our resulting trading models are able to adjust to\npotentially time varying market conditions in a coherent statistical framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2010 02:26:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Kannan", "Balakrishnan", ""], ["Lasscock", "Ben", ""], ["Mellen", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4402", "submitter": "Junjie Wang", "authors": "Junjie Wang, Shuigeng Zhou, Jihong Guan", "title": "Characteristics of Real Futures Trading Networks", "comments": "18 pages, 9 figures.

The required high-dimensional\nvolatility matrix can be estimated by using high frequency financial data. This\nenables us to better adapt to the local volatilities and local correlations\namong vast number of assets and to increase significantly the sample size for\nestimating the volatility matrix. This paper studies the volatility matrix\nestimation using high-dimensional high-frequency data from the perspective of\nportfolio selection. Specifically, we propose the use of \"pairwise-refresh\ntime\" and \"all-refresh time\" methods proposed by Barndorff-Nielsen et al (2008)\nfor estimation of vast covariance matrix and compare their merits in the\nportfolio selection. We also establish the concentration inequalities of the\nestimates, which guarantee desirable properties of the estimated volatility\nmatrix in vast asset allocation with gross exposure constraints. Extensive\nnumerical studies are made via carefully designed simulations. Comparing with\nthe methods based on low frequency daily data, our methods can capture the most\nrecent trend of the time varying volatility and correlation, hence provide more\naccurate guidance for the portfolio allocation in the next time period.
