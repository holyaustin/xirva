They are traded online, often with\ncryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded as smart contracts on a\nblockchain. Media and public attention towards NFTs has exploded in 2021, when\nthe NFT art market has experienced record sales while celebrated new star\nartists. However, little is known about the overall structure and evolution of\nthe NFT market. Here, we analyse data concerning 6.1 million trades of 4.7\nmillion NFTs generating a total trading volume of 935 millions US dollars. Our\ndata are obtained primarily from the Ethereum and WAX blockchains and cover the\nperiod between June 23, 2017 and April 27, 2021. First, we characterize the\nstatistical properties of the market. Second, we build the network of\ninteractions and show that traders have bursts of activity followed by inactive\nperiods, and typically specialize on NFTs associated to similar objects. Third,\nwe cluster objects associated to NFTs according to their visual features and\nshow that NFTs within the same category tend to be visually homogeneous.\nFinally, we investigate the predictability of NFT sales. We use simple machine\nlearning algorithms and find that prices can be best predicted by the sale\nhistory of the NFT collection, but also by some features describing the\nproperties of the associated object (e.g., visual features of digital images).\nWe anticipate that our analysis will be of interest to both researchers and\npractitioners and will spark further research on the NFT production, adoption\nand trading in different contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 17:25:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2021 16:22:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nadini", "Matthieu", ""], ["Alessandretti", "Laura", ""], ["Di Giacinto", "Flavio", ""], ["Martino", "Mauro", ""], ["Aiello", "Luca Maria", ""], ["Baronchelli", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.02131", "submitter": "Nestor Parolya Dr.", "authors": "Taras Bodnar, Nestor Parolya and Erik Thorsen", "title": "Dynamic Shrinkage Estimation of the High-Dimensional Minimum-Variance\n  Portfolio", "comments": "28 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST math.ST q-fin.PM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, new results in random matrix theory are derived which allow us\nto construct a shrinkage estimator of the global minimum variance (GMV)\nportfolio when the shrinkage target is a random object.

Recently, machine learning based\nsolutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and\nbecome indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.\nHowever, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the\nexistence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably\nlimits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to\nempower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple\nstock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists\nof a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a\nrouter to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of\nexplicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective\nTRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning\nalgorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to\npredictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment\nthrough an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking\ntask show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM\nand Transformer, the proposed method can improve information coefficient (IC)\nfrom 0.053 to 0.059 and 0.051 to 0.056 respectively.
