With this strategy we\nconstruct the multivariate distributions of elementary returns based on the\nscaling with time of the probability density of their aggregates. In its\nsimplest version the model is the product of an endogenous auto-regressive\ncomponent and a random rescaling factor designed to embody also exogenous\ninfluences. Mathematical properties like increments' stationarity and\nergodicity can be proven. Thanks to the relatively low number of parameters,\nmodel calibration can be conveniently based on a method of moments, as\nexemplified in the case of historical data of the S&P500 index. The calibrated\nmodel accounts very well for many stylized facts, like volatility clustering,\npower law decay of the volatility autocorrelation function, and multiscaling\nwith time of the aggregated return distribution. In agreement with empirical\nevidence in finance, the dynamics is not invariant under time reversal and,\nwith suitable generalizations, skewness of the return distribution and leverage\neffects can be included. The analytical tractability of the model opens\ninteresting perspectives for applications, for instance in terms of obtaining\nclosed formulas for derivative pricing. Further important features are: The\npossibility of making contact, in certain limits, with auto-regressive models\nwidely used in finance; The possibility of partially resolving the long-memory\nand short-memory components of the volatility, with consistent results when\napplied to historical series.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2013 18:35:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2013 09:04:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2013 14:29:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zamparo", "Marco", ""], ["Baldovin", "Fulvio", ""], ["Caraglio", "Michele", ""], ["Stella", "Attilio L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.4173", "submitter": "Rostislav Serota", "authors": "Tao Ma and R.
