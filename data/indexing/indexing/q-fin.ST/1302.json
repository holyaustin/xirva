Using several estimation methods, we find\nthat the Hawkes kernel is power-law with a decay exponent close to -1.15 at\nshort times, less than approximately 10^3 seconds, and crosses over to a second\npower-law regime with a larger decay exponent of approximately -1.45 for longer\ntimes scales in the range [10^3, 10^6] seconds. More importantly, we find that\nthe Hawkes kernel integrates to unity independently of the analysed period,\nfrom 1998 to 2011. This suggests that markets are and have always been close to\ncriticality, challenging a recent study which indicates that reflexivity\n(endogeneity) has increased in recent years as a result of increased automation\nof trading. However, we note that the scale over which market events are\ncorrelated has decreased steadily over time with the emergence of higher\nfrequency trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:24:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 16:39:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hardiman", "Stephen J.", ""], ["Bercot", "Nicolas", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.3169", "submitter": "Mario Guti\\'errez-Roig", "authors": "Mario Guti\\'errez-Roig and Josep Perell\\'o", "title": "Volatility polarization of non-specialized investors' heterogeneous\n  activity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial markets provide an ideal frame for studying decision making in\ncrowded environments.

We analyse the\nactivity of 29,930 non-expert individuals that represent a small portion of the\nwhole market trading volume. The very heterogeneous activity of individuals\nobeys a Zipf's law, while synchronization network properties unveil a community\nstructure. We thus correlate individual activity with the most eminent\nmacroscopic signal in financial markets, that is volatility, and quantify how\nindividuals are clearly polarized by volatility. The assortativity by\nattributes of our synchronization networks also indicates that individuals look\nat the volatility rather than imitate directly each other thus providing an\ninteresting interpretation of herding phenomena in human activity. The results\ncan also improve agent-based models since they provide direct estimation of the\nagent's parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2013 17:20:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-14", "authors_parsed": [["Guti\u00e9rrez-Roig", "Mario", ""], ["Perell\u00f3", "Josep", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.3197", "submitter": "S\\'ilvio Duarte Queir\\'os M.", "authors": "Sabrina Camargo, Silvio M.
