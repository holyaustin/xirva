In this\npaper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both\nfundamental and technical traders. This is based on a Poisson trade arrival\nmodel with variable size orders. With simplifications we are led to a hybrid\nSDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions, whose solution is\ngiven by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against\nanother, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the\nhybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered\nby Nagahara, which is a type of \"Pearson diffusion\", or equivalently a\nhyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on\nthe balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally\nat an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type\nIV form. Under less restrictive assumptions richer dynamics are possible,\nincluding bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is\nidentified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a\npriori been expected, so that \"$25\\sigma$\" events are significantly more\nprobable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation\nthat shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian\nfacade. These are elementary members of an extended class of distributions with\na rich and varied structure, capable of describing a wide range of market\nbehaviours. Several approaches to the density function are possible, and an\nexample of the computation of a hyperbolic VaR is given. The model also\nsuggests generalizations of the Bougerol identity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Nov 2008 18:01:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Dec 2008 11:23:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2009 12:53:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 18 Aug 2009 12:51:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2009 09:03:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0376", "submitter": "Ivan Kitov O.", "authors": "Ivan O.

The return is represented by a sum of\nmonthly returns during previous twelve months. The change rate of the specific\nage population is represented by moving averages. The period between January\n1990 and December 2003 is described by monthly population intercensal estimates\nas provided by the US Census Bureau. Four years before 1990 are described using\nthe estimates of the number of 17 year-olds shifted 8 years back. The\nprediction of S&P 500 returns for the months after 2003, including those beyond\n2007, are obtained using the number of 3 year-olds between 1990 and 2003\nshifted by 6 years ahead and quarterly estimates of real GDP per capita. A\nprediction is available for the period beyond 2007. There are two sharp drops\nin the predicted returns - in 2007 and 2009, and one strong rally in 2008.\nEquivalently, S&P 500 index should drop in 2007 and 2009 to the level observed\none year before. Potential link between S&P 500 returns and 9-year-old\npopulation is tested for cointegration. The Engle-Granger and Johansen tests\ndemonstrate the presence of a long-term equilibrium (cointegrating) relation\nbetween these variables. This makes valid standard statistical estimates.\nCorrelation between the predicted and observed indices, including RMS\ndifference, linear regression, and VAR demonstrate good prediction accuracy at\ntwo-year horizon, when the prediction uses 7-year-olds instead of 9-year-olds.\nThe RMS difference between the observed and predicted returns for the period\nbetween 1992 and 2003 is only 0.09 with standard deviation of the observed\nseries for the same period of 0.12 and the naive (random walk) RMS deference of\n0.18.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2008 19:29:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kitov", "Ivan O.", ""], ["Kitov", "Oleg I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0448", "submitter": "Woo-Sung Jung", "authors": "Cheoljun Eom, Okyu Kwon, Woo-Sung Jung", "title": "Statistical properties of information flow in financial time series", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 08:57:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 01:55:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Eom", "Cheoljun", ""], ["Kwon", "Okyu", ""], ["Jung", "Woo-Sung", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0473", "submitter": "Daniel Sevcovic", "authors": "B.

In this model the\ndispersion of the stochastic short rate (square of volatility) is assumed to be\nstochastic as well and it follows a non-negative process with volatility\nproportional to the square root of dispersion. The drift of the stochastic\nprocess for the dispersion is assumed to be in a rather general form including,\nin particular, linear function having one root (yielding the original\nFong--Vasicek model or a cubic like function having three roots (yielding a\ngeneralized Fong--Vasicek model for description of the volatility clustering).\nWe consider averaged bond prices with respect to the limiting distribution of\nstochastic dispersion. The averaged bond prices depend on time and current\nlevel of the short rate like it is the case in many popular one-factor interest\nrate model including in particular the Vasicek and Cox--Ingersoll-Ross model.\nHowever, as a main result of this paper we show that there is no such\none-factor model yielding the same bond prices as the averaged values described\nabove.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 20:09:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Stehlikova", "B.", ""], ["Sevcovic", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3122", "submitter": "Johannes Siven", "authors": "Johannes Vitalis Siven, Jeffrey Todd Lins, Jonas Lundbek Hansen", "title": "A multiscale view on inverse statistics and gain/loss asymmetry in\n  financial time series", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.
