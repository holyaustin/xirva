Financial firms bailed-out as a consequence of the 2007-2010 credit\ncrisis show a neat increase with time of the generalized Hurst exponent in the\nperiod preceding the unfolding of the crisis. Conversely, firms belonging to\nother market sectors, which suffered the least throughout the crisis, show\nopposite behaviors. These findings suggest the possibility of using the scaling\nbehavior as a tool to track the level of stability of a firm. In this paper, we\nintroduce a method to compute the generalized Hurst exponent which assigns\nlarger weights to more recent events with respect to older ones. In this way\nlarge fluctuations in the remote past are less likely to influence the recent\npast. We also investigate the scaling associated with the tails of the\nlog-returns distributions and compare this scaling with the scaling associated\nwith the Hurst exponent, observing that the processes underlying the price\ndynamics of these firms are truly multi-scaling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2011 14:56:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Morales", "Raffaello", ""], ["Di Matteo", "T.", ""], ["Gramatica", "Ruggero", ""], ["Aste", "Tomaso", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0642", "submitter": "Leonidas Sandoval", "authors": "Leonidas Sandoval Junior", "title": "Pruning a Minimum Spanning Tree", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Physica A 391 (2012) 2678-2711", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2011.12.052", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work employs some techniques in order to filter random noise from the\ninformation provided by minimum spanning trees obtained from the correlation\nmatrices of international stock market indices prior to and during times of\ncrisis.

Proposed causes such as shortages of grain due to\nadverse weather, increasing meat consumption in China and India, conversion of\ncorn to ethanol in the US, and investor speculation on commodity markets lead\nto widely differing implications for policy. A lack of clarity about which\nfactors are responsible reinforces policy inaction. Here, for the first time,\nwe construct a dynamic model that quantitatively agrees with food prices. The\nresults show that the dominant causes of price increases are investor\nspeculation and ethanol conversion. Models that just treat supply and demand\nare not consistent with the actual price dynamics. The two sharp peaks in\n2007/2008 and 2010/2011 are specifically due to investor speculation, while an\nunderlying upward trend is due to increasing demand from ethanol conversion.\nThe model includes investor trend following as well as shifting between\ncommodities, equities and bonds to take advantage of increased expected\nreturns. Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be\ninvalid by direct analysis of price setting practices of granaries. Both causes\nof price increase, speculative investment and ethanol conversion, are promoted\nby recent regulatory changes---deregulation of the commodity markets, and\npolicies promoting the conversion of corn to ethanol.
