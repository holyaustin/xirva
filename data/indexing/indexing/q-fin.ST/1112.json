The type of manipulation, a \"bear raid,\"\nwould have been prevented by a regulation that was repealed by the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in July 2007. The regulation, the uptick rule, was\ndesigned to prevent manipulation and promote stability and was in force from\n1938 as a key part of the government response to the 1929 market crash and its\naftermath. On November 1, 2007, Citigroup experienced an unusual increase in\ntrading volume and decrease in price. Our analysis of financial industry data\nshows that this decline coincided with an anomalous increase in borrowed\nshares, the selling of which would be a large fraction of the total trading\nvolume. The selling of borrowed shares cannot be explained by news events as\nthere is no corresponding increase in selling by share owners. A similar number\nof shares were returned on a single day six days later. The magnitude and\ncoincidence of borrowing and returning of shares is evidence of a concerted\neffort to drive down Citigroup's stock price and achieve a profit, i.e., a bear\nraid. Interpretations and analyses of financial markets should consider the\npossibility that the intentional actions of individual actors or coordinated\ngroups can impact market behavior. Markets are not sufficiently transparent to\nreveal even major market manipulation events. Our results point to the need for\nregulations that prevent intentional actions that cause markets to deviate from\nequilibrium and contribute to crashes. Enforcement actions cannot reverse\nsevere damage to the economic system.

When focusing on the order cancellation positions in the\nqueue at each price level, we find that the profiles increase rapidly in the\nfront of the queue, and then fluctuate around a constant value till the end of\nthe queue. These profiles are similar for different stocks. In addition, the\nprofiles of cancellation positions can be fitted by an exponent function for\nboth buy and sell orders.
