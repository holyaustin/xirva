The high\nvolatility of one financial asset today could affect the volatility of another\nasset tomorrow. These lagged effects among volatilities - which we call\nvolatility spillovers - are studied using the Vector AutoRegressive (VAR)\nmodel. We account for the possible fat-tailed distribution of the VAR model\nerrors using a VAR model with errors following a multivariate Student\nt-distribution with unknown degrees of freedom. Moreover, we study volatility\nspillovers among a large number of assets. To this end, we use penalized\nestimation of the VAR model with t-distributed errors. We study volatility\nspillovers among energy, biofuel and agricultural commodities and reveal\nbidirectional volatility spillovers between energy and biofuel, and between\nenergy and agricultural commodities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 11:21:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Barbaglia", "Luca", ""], ["Croux", "Christophe", ""], ["Wilms", "Ines", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02625", "submitter": "Jethro Browell", "authors": "Jethro Browell", "title": "Risk Constrained Trading Strategies for Stochastic Generation with a\n  Single-Price Balancing Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3390/en11061345", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the limited predictability of wind power and other stochastic\ngeneration, trading this energy in competitive electricity markets is\nchallenging.
