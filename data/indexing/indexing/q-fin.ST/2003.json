Then, we investigate how the non-Gaussianity of the\nvariables affects the coupling structure of them. By applying the multifractal\nmethod, one can see that the non-Gaussianity depends on the scales. While the\nnon-Gaussianity of unemployment is noticeable only for periods smaller than 1\nyear and for longer periods tends to Gaussian behavior, the non-Gaussianities\nof inflation persist for all time scales. Also, it is observed that the\ncoupling structure of these variables tends to a Gaussian behavior after $2$\nyears.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2020 22:13:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Lai", "Z.

In multivariate price processes, we\nconsider both contamination by the market microstructure noise and the\nnon-synchronicity of the observations. We formulate a multi-scale, flat-top\nrealized kernel, non-flat-top realized kernel, pre-averaging and modulated\nrealized covariance estimators in quadratic form and fix their bandwidth\nparameter at a constant value. This allows us to operate with limited memory\nand formulate this estimation as a streaming algorithm. We compare the\nperformance of the estimators with fixed bandwidth parameter in a simulation\nstudy. We find that the estimators ensuring positive semidefiniteness require\nmuch higher bandwidth than the estimators without this constraint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Mar 2020 16:04:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Mar 2021 22:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hol\u00fd", "Vladim\u00edr", ""], ["Tomanov\u00e1", "Petra", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13517", "submitter": "Eugene Tartakovsky", "authors": "Eugene Tartakovsky, Ksenia Plesovskikh, Anastasiia Sarmakeeva,\n  Alexander Bibik", "title": "Autocorrelation of returns in major cryptocurrency markets", "comments": "11 pages, 12 figures.

A number of statistical tests and\nproperties of statistical distributions will be used to assess if\ncryptocurrency markets are efficient, and how their efficiency changes over\ntime. In this paper, we analyze autocorrelation of returns in major\ncryptocurrency markets using the following methods: Pearson's autocorrelation\ncoefficient of different orders, Ljung-Box test, and first-order Pearson's\nautocorrelation coefficient in a rolling window. All experiments are conducted\non the BTC/USD, ETH/USD, ETH/BTC markets on Bitfinex exchange, and the XBT/USD\nmarket on Bitmex exchange, each on 5-minute, 1-hour, 1-day, and 1-week time\nframes. The results are represented visually on charts. Statistically\nsignificant autocorrelation is persistently present on the 5m and 1H time\nframes on all markets.
