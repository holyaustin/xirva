The abstracted problem\ncorresponds to finding a probability measure that minimizes the relative\nentropy (also called $I$-divergence) with respect to a known measure while it\nsatisfies certain moment constraints on functions of underlying assets. In this\npaper, we show that under $I$-divergence, the optimal solution may not exist\nwhen the underlying assets have fat tailed distributions, ubiquitous in\nfinancial practice. We note that this drawback may be corrected if\n`polynomial-divergence' is used. This divergence can be seen to be equivalent\nto the well known (relative) Tsallis or (relative) Renyi entropy. We discuss\nexistence and uniqueness issues related to this new optimization problem as\nwell as the nature of the optimal solution under different objectives. We also\nidentify the optimal solution structure under $I$-divergence as well as\npolynomial-divergence when the associated constraints include those on marginal\ndistribution of functions of underlying assets. These results are applied to a\nsimple problem of model calibration to options prices as well as to portfolio\nmodeling in Markowitz framework, where we note that a reasonable view that a\nparticular portfolio of assets has heavy tailed losses may lead to fatter and\nmore reasonable tail distributions of all assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Mar 2012 11:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Santanu", ""], ["Juneja", "Sandeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1313", "submitter": "Marco  Lagi", "authors": "Marco Lagi, Yavni Bar-Yam, Karla Z.

To our knowledge, this is the first extensive study of this kind (a\nprevious japanese taxpayers survey was limited to two years). In the high\nincome limit we prove once again the validity of Pareto's law, obtaining a\nperfect scaling on four orders of magnitude in the rank for all the studied\nyears. The obtained Pareto exponents are quite stable with values around\n$\\alpha \\approx 2.5$, in spite of the fact that during this period the economy\ndeveloped rapidly and also a financial-economic crisis hit Romania in\n2007-2008. For the low and medium income category we confirmed the\nexponential-type income distribution. Following the income of employees in\ntime, we have found that the top limit of the income distribution is a highly\ndynamical region with strong fluctuations in the rank. In this region, the\nobserved dynamics is consistent with a multiplicative random growth hypothesis.\nContrarily with previous results obtained for the japanese employees, we find\nthat the logarithmic growth-rate is not independent of the income.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 18:38:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Derzsy", "N.", ""], ["Neda", "Z.", ""], ["Santos", "M.
