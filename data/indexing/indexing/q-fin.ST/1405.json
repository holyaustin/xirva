In the paper, we rebuild the\nLOB dynamics based on the order flow data of 26 A-share stocks traded on the\nShenzhen Stock Exchange in 2003. Three key empirical statistical properties of\nprice gaps are investigated. We find that the distribution of price gaps has a\npower-law tail for all stocks with an average tail exponent close to 3.2.\nApplying modern statistical methods, we confirm that the gap time series are\nlong-range correlated and possess multifractal nature. These three features\nvary from stock to stock and are not universal. Furthermore, we also unveil\nbuy-sell asymmetry phenomena in the properties of price gaps on the buy and\nsell sides of the LOBs for individual stocks. These findings deepen our\nunderstanding of the dynamics of liquidity of common stocks and can be used to\ncalibrate agent-based computational financial models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2014 12:38:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Yong-Jie", "", "TJU"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}, {"id": "1405.1326", "submitter": "Jianxi Su", "authors": "Edward Furman, Jianxi Su, and Ri\\v{c}ardas Zitikis", "title": "Paths and indices of maximal tail dependence", "comments": "ASTIN Bulletin: The Journal of the International Actuarial\n  Association, 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.ST q-fin.RM q-fin.ST stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the existing methods\nfor measuring tail dependence in copulas may sometimes underestimate the extent\nof extreme co-movements of dependent risks and, therefore, may not always\ncomply with the new paradigm of prudent risk management.
