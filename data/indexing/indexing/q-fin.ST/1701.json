To obtain such a reduction, we chop the data into B blocks, compute the\nRK (or QMLE) on each block, and aggregate the block estimates. The ratio of\nasymptotic variance over the bound of asymptotic efficiency converges as B\nincreases to the ratio in the parametric version of the problem, i.e. 1.0025 in\nthe case of the fastest RK Tukey-Hanning 16 and 1 for the QMLE. The impact of\nstochastic sampling times and jump in the price process is examined carefully.\nThe finite sample performance of both estimators is investigated in\nsimulations, while empirical work illustrates the gain in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 00:13:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 06:16:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2018 01:57:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Clinet", "Simon", ""], ["Potiron", "Yoann", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.01255", "submitter": "Aleksejus Kononovicius", "authors": "V.
