For the\nuncorrelated series at the border (q=5/3) between the Gaussian and the Levy\nbasins of attraction asymptotically we find a phase-like transition between\nmonofractal and bifractal characteristics. This indicates that these may solely\nbe the specific nonlinear temporal correlations that organize the series into a\ngenuine multifractal hierarchy. For analyzing various features of\nmultifractality due to such correlations, we use the model series generated\nfrom the binomial cascade as well as empirical series. Then, within the\ntemporal ranges of well developed power-law correlations we find a fast\nconvergence in all multifractal measures.
