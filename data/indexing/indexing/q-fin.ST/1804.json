These products are: return optimization securities,\nyield magnet notes, reverse exchangeable securities, and principal-protected\nnotes. We describe the basic structure of these products, analyze them\nprobabilistically using the Law of Total Expectation, and assess the practical\nimplications of buying them in the mid-2000s. By estimating expected rates of\nreturn under various scenarios, we conclude in each case that buyers were\nlikely to experience grave difficulties from the start. By inspecting various\nprospectuses, we detect that many structured products were designed to the\ndetriment of buyers and to the advantage of the issuing banks and\nbroker-dealers. Therefore, we find it difficult to understand why any\ninvestment advisor, in exercising fiduciary care of clients' funds, would have\nadvised a client to purchases these products in the mid-2000's.\n  In light of these results, we fear that the on-going worldwide financial\ncrisis will be lengthened because of these structured products and others even\nmore arcane than the ones considered here. We note that problems caused by\nstructured products have increased investors' fears about the economy and the\nfinancial markets, causing many of them to purchase U.S. Treasury securities at\nnegative real-interest rates. This has caused increases in the prices of U.S.\nTreasuries to record levels, and we fear for the day when this trend reverses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 04:23:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Richards", "Donald St. P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.00825", "submitter": "Donald Richards", "authors": "Gilna K.

We deduce\ntwo possible interpretations of the payment procedure for the notes and apply\nthe Law of Total Expectation to develop a probabilistic analysis for each\ninterpretation. We also determine the corresponding expected net payments to\nnote-holders under various scenarios for the financial markets and show that,\nunder a broad range of scenarios, note-holders were likely to suffer\nsubstantial losses.\n  As a consequence, we infer that the prospectus is sufficiently complex that\nfinancial advisers generally lacked the mathematical knowledge and expertise to\nunderstand the prospectus completely. Therefore, financial advisers who\nrecommended purchases of the notes did not have the knowledge and expertise\nthat is required by a fiduciary relationship, hence were unable to exercise\nfiduciary duty, and ultimately misguided their clients. We conclude that these\nreverse convertibles notes were designed by financial institutions to insure\nthemselves, against significant declines in the equities markets, at the\nexpense of note-holders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 05:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Samuel", "Gilna K.", ""], ["Richards", "Donald St. P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02350", "submitter": "Marco Alberto Javarone", "authors": "Marco Alberto Javarone and Craig Steven Wright", "title": "From Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash: a network analysis", "comments": "CryBlock 18, June 15, 2018, Munich, Germany 5 pages, 3 figures, 1\n  table, ACM Proceeding CryBlock'18 1st Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and\n  Blockchains for Distributed Systems 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1145/3211933.3211947", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bitcoins and Blockchain technologies are attracting the attention of\ndifferent scientific communities.

Following Mantegna's seminal paper, the linear Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient between pairs of stocks has been the usual way to determine network\nedges. Recently, possible effects of nonlinearity on the graph-theoretical\nproperties of such networks have been demonstrated when using nonlinear\nmeasures such as mutual information instead of linear correlation. In this\npaper, we quantitatively characterize the nonlinearity in stock time series and\nthe effect it has on stock network properties. This is achieved by a systematic\nmulti-step approach that allows us to quantify the nonlinearity of coupling;\ncorrect its effects wherever it is caused by simple univariate non-Gaussianity;\npotentially localize in space and time any remaining strong sources of this\nnonlinearity; and, finally, study the effect nonlinearity has on global network\nproperties. By applying this multi-step approach to stocks included in three\nprominent indices (NYSE100, FTSE100 and SP500), we establish that the apparent\nnonlinearity that has been observed is largely due to univariate\nnon-Gaussianity. Furthermore, strong nonstationarity in a few specific stocks\nmay play a role. In particular, the sharp decrease in some stocks during the\nglobal financial crisis of 2008 gives rise to apparent nonlinear dependencies\namong stocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 19:59:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2018 11:15:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Hartman", "David", ""], ["Hlinka", "Jaroslav", ""]]}]
