The results indicate that the stock market dynamics is not\nsimply decomposable into 'market', 'sectors', and the Wishart random bulk. This\nclearly is seen when the time series used to construct the correlation matrices\nare sufficiently long and thus the measurement noise suppressed. Instead, a\nhierarchically convoluted and highly nonlinear organization of the market\nemerges and indicates that the relevant information about the whole market is\nencoded already in its constituents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2007 14:25:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Drozdz", "S.", ""], ["Kwapien", "J.", ""], ["Oswiecimka", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.0729", "submitter": "Massimiliano Zanin", "authors": "Massimiliano Zanin", "title": "Forbidden patterns in financial time series", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures; affiliation updated", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.2841197", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  The existence of forbidden patterns, i.e., certain missing sequences in a\ngiven time series, is a recently proposed instrument of potential application\nin the study of time series. Forbidden patterns are related to the permutation\nentropy, which has the basic properties of classic chaos indicators, thus\nallowing to separate deterministic (usually chaotic) from random series;\nhowever, it requires less values of the series to be calculated, and it is\nsuitable for using with small datasets. In this Letter, the appearance of\nforbidden patterns is studied in different economical indicators like stock\nindices (Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite), NYSE stocks (IBM\nand Boeing) and others (10-year Bond interest rate), to find evidences of\ndeterministic behavior in their evolutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2007 20:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2007 18:58:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zanin", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.1595", "submitter": "Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos", "authors": "Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos, Petros Dellaportas, Gareth O.

Such a task\npresents two interesting problems. First, the construction of the MCMC scheme\nshould ensure that the correlation coefficients are updated subject to the\npositive definite constraints of the diffusion matrix. Second, a diffusion may\nonly be observed at a finite set of points and the marginal likelihood for the\nparameters based on these observations is generally not available. We overcome\nthe first issue by using the Cholesky factorisation on the diffusion matrix. To\ndeal with the likelihood unavailability, we generalise the data augmentation\nframework of Roberts and Stramer (2001 Biometrika 88(3):603-621) to\nd-dimensional correlated diffusions including multivariate stochastic\nvolatility models. Our methodology is illustrated through simulation based\nexperiments and with daily EUR /USD, GBP/USD rates together with their implied\nvolatilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Nov 2007 13:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kalogeropoulos", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Dellaportas", "Petros", ""], ["Roberts", "Gareth O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.1836", "submitter": "Pavel Exner", "authors": "Pavel Exner and Petr \\v{S}eba", "title": "A Markov process associated with plot-size distribution in Czech Land\n  Registry and its number-theoretic properties", "comments": "LaTeX, 7 pages with two ps figure.

Specifically, we find that for one hour intervals this model\nconsistently over-predicts the volatility of real price series by about 70%,\nand that this effect becomes stronger as the length of the intervals increases.\nBy selectively shuffling some components of the data while preserving others we\nare able to show that this discrepancy is caused by a subtle but long-range\nnon-contemporaneous correlation between the signs and sizes of individual\nreturns.
