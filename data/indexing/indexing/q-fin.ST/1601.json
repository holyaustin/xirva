Which are the benchmark interest rates that have broad\ninfluences on most interest rates is a major concern for economists. In this\npaper, multi-variable Granger causality test is developed and applied to\nconstruct a directed network of interest rates, whose important nodes, regarded\nas key interest rates, are evaluated with inverse Page Rank scores. The results\nindicate that some short-term interest rates have larger influences on the most\nkey interest rates, while repo rates are the benchmark of short-term rates. It\nis also found that central bank bills'rates are in the core position of\nmid-term interest rates'network, and treasury bond rates are leading the\nlong-term bonds rates. The evolution of benchmark interest rates is also\nstudied from 2008 to 2014, and it's found that SHIBOR has generally become the\nbenchmark interest rate in China.
