Efficiency refers to weak-form efficient\nmarket hypothesis (EMH) in terms of the information of past price changes. The\nprediction power corresponds to the hit-rate, which is the rate of the\nconsistency between the direction of actual price change and that of predicted\none, calculated by the nearest neighbor prediction method (NN method) using the\nout-of-sample. In this manuscript, the Hurst exponent and the approximate\nentropy (ApEn) are used as the quantitative measurements of the degree of\nefficiency. The relationship between the Hurst exponent, reflecting the various\ntime correlation property, and the ApEn value, reflecting the randomness in the\ntime series, shows negative correlation. However, the average prediction power\non the direction of future price change has the strongly positive correlation\nwith the Hurst exponent, and the negative correlation with the ApEn. Therefore,\nthe market index with less market efficiency has higher prediction power for\nfuture price change than one with higher market efficiency when we analyze the\nmarket using the past price change pattern. Furthermore, we show that the Hurst\nexponent, a measurement of the long-term memory property, provides more\nsignificant information in terms of prediction of future price changes than the\nApEn and the NN method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2007 15:31:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eom", "Cheoljun", ""], ["Oh", "Gabjin", ""], ["Jung", "Woo-Sung", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.4347", "submitter": "Andrzej Z.

The magnitude of this eigenvalue depends\nhowever crucially on which currency is used as a base currency for the\nremaining ones.
