The chapter begins with the characterization of a\nwell-known L\\'evy process: The compound Poisson process. The semi-Markov\nextension of the compound Poisson process naturally leads to the compound\nfractional Poisson process, where the Poisson counting process is replaced by\nthe Mittag-Leffler counting process also known as fractional Poisson process.\nThis process is no longer Markovian and L\\'evy. However, several analytical\nresults are available and some of them are discussed here. The functional limit\nof the compound Poisson process is an $\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy process, whereas\nin the case of the compound fractional Poisson process, one gets an\n$\\alpha$-stable L\\'evy process subordinated to the fractional Poisson process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 10:34:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Scalas", "Enrico", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.0893", "submitter": "Joachim Krug", "authors": "Gregor Wergen, Miro Bogner and Joachim Krug", "title": "Record statistics for biased random walks, with an application to\n  financial data", "comments": "16 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The statistics of records in symmetric random\nwalks was previously analyzed by Majumdar and Ziff and is well understood.\nUnlike the case of symmetric jump distributions, in the asymmetric case the\nstatistics of records depends on the choice of the jump distribution. We\ncompute the record rate $P_n(c)$, defined as the probability for the $n$th\nvalue to be larger than all previous values, for a Gaussian jump distribution\nwith standard deviation $\\sigma$ that is shifted by a constant drift $c$. For\nsmall drift, in the sense of $c/\\sigma \\ll n^{-1/2}$, the correction to\n$P_n(c)$ grows proportional to arctan$(\\sqrt{n})$ and saturates at the value\n$\\frac{c}{\\sqrt{2} \\sigma}$. For large $n$ the record rate approaches a\nconstant, which is approximately given by\n$1-(\\sigma/\\sqrt{2\\pi}c)\\textrm{exp}(-c^2/2\\sigma^2)$ for $c/\\sigma \\gg 1$.\nThese asymptotic results carry over to other continuous jump distributions with\nfinite variance. As an application, we compare our analytical results to the\nrecord statistics of 366 daily stock prices from the Standard & Poors 500\nindex. The biased random walk accounts quantitatively for the increase in the\nnumber of upper records due to the overall trend in the stock prices, and after\ndetrending the number of upper records is in good agreement with the symmetric\nrandom walk. However the number of lower records in the detrended data is\nsignificantly reduced by a mechanism that remains to be identified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Mar 2011 13:23:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Wergen", "Gregor", ""], ["Bogner", "Miro", ""], ["Krug", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1501", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz, Jose-Luis Lopez, Xavier Calbet", "title": "Exponential wealth distribution: a new approach from functional\n  iteration theory", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO q-bio.GN q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Exponential distribution is ubiquitous in the framework of multi-agent\nsystems.
