As such\nnetworks encode the causal structure of a system, infering lead-lag networks\nfor many pairs of timescales provides a global picture of the mutual influence\nbetween timescales. We apply our method to two trader-resolved FX data sets and\ndocument strong and complex asymmetric influence of timescales on the structure\nof lead-lag networks. Expectedly, this asymmetry extends to trader activity:\nfor institutional clients in our dataset, past activity on timescales longer\nthan 3 hours is more correlated with future activity at shorter timescales than\nthe opposite (Zumbach effect), while a reverse Zumbach effect is found for past\ntimescales shorter than 3 hours; retail clients have a totally different, and\nmuch more intricate, structure of asymmetric timescale influence. The causality\nstructures are clearly caused by markedly different behaviors of the two types\nof traders. Hence, market nanostructure, i.e., market dynamics at the\nindividual trader level, provides an unprecedented insight into the causality\nstructure of financial markets, which is much more complex than previously\nthought.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2019 18:09:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2020 11:35:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2020 09:21:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cordi", "Marcus", ""], ["Challet", "Damien", ""], ["Kassibrakis", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.02419", "submitter": "Gordon Chavez", "authors": "Gordon V.

This formalism can accommodate a\nwide variety of nonlinear dependence, as well as conditional power law-tail\nbehavior ranging from weakly non-Gaussian to Cauchy-like tails.

Tests carried out for both long (~18 years) and shorter terms (~9\nyears), which include the dot-com bubble and the 2008 crash periods, show that\na linear fit can be obtained for the risk-excess return profiles of all four\nrisk measures.
