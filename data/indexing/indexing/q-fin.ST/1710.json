For the swaptions that we study, three parameters are taken into\naccount for indexing the implied volatilities and form a \"volatility cube\":\nstrike (or moneyness), time to maturity of the option contract, duration of the\nunderlying swap contract. It should be noted that the implied volatility\nstructure changes across time, which makes it important to study its dynamics\nin order to well manage the volatility risk. As volatilities are correlated\nacross the cube, it is preferable to decompose the dynamics on orthogonal\nprincipal components, which is the idea of Karhunen-Lo\\`eve decomposition that\nwe have adopted in the article. The projections on principal components are\ninvestigated by Filtered Historical Simulation in order to predict the Value at\nRisk (VaR), which is then examined by standard tests and non-arbitrage\ncondition to ensure its appropriateness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 18:37:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yao", "Jinglun", ""], ["Laurent", "Sabine", ""], ["B\u00e9naben", "Brice", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.05513", "submitter": "Ziping Zhao", "authors": "Ziping Zhao and Daniel P.

In this work, such\nentropy measure is implemented on the time series of prices and volatilities of\nsix financial markets. The analysis has been performed, on tick-by-tick data\nsampled every minute for six years of data from 1999 to 2004, for a broad range\nof moving average windows and volatility horizons. The study shows that the\nentropy of the volatility series depends on the individual market, while the\nentropy of the price series is practically a market-invariant for the six\nmarkets. Finally, a cumulative information measure - the `Market Heterogeneity\nIndex'- is derived from the integral of the proposed entropy measure. The\nvalues of the Market Heterogeneity Index are discussed as possible tools for\noptimal portfolio construction and compared with those obtained by using the\nSharpe ratio a traditional risk diversity measure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 19:44:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Feb 2018 21:57:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ponta", "Linda", ""], ["Carbone", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.07470", "submitter": "Jing-Chao Chen", "authors": "Jing-Chao Chen, Yu Zhou, Xi Wang", "title": "Profitability of simple stationary technical trading rules with\n  high-frequency data of Chinese Index Futures", "comments": "24 pages,11 figures, 19 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2017.11.088", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Technical trading rules have been widely used by practitioners in financial\nmarkets for a long time.
