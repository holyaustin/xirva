Our motivation for introducing this algorithm is that the already\nexisting methods like MF-DXA have at best serious limitations for most of the\nsignals describing complex natural processes and often indicate multifractal\ncross-correlations when there are none. The principal component of the present\nextension is proper incorporation of the sign of fluctuations to their\ngeneralized moments. Furthermore, we present a broad analysis of the model\nfractal stochastic processes as well as of the real-world signals and show that\nMFCCA is a robust and selective tool at the same time, and therefore allows for\na reliable quantification of the cross-correlative structure of analyzed\nprocesses. In particular, it allows one to identify the boundaries of the\nmultifractal scaling and to analyze a relation between the generalized Hurst\nexponent and the multifractal scaling parameter $\\lambda_q$. This relation\nprovides information about character of potential multifractality in\ncross-correlations and thus enables a deeper insight into dynamics of the\nanalyzed processes than allowed by any other related method available so far.\nBy using examples of time series from stock market, we show that financial\nfluctuations typically cross-correlate multifractally only for relatively large\nfluctuations, whereas small fluctuations remain mutually independent even at\nmaximum of such cross-correlations. Finally, we indicate possible utility of\nMFCCA to study effects of the time-lagged cross-correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 13:11:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 15:36:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["O\u015bwi\u0229cimka", "Pawe\u0142", ""], ["Dro\u017cd\u017c", "Stanis\u0142aw", ""], ["Forczek", "Marcin", ""], ["Jadach", "Stanis\u0142aw", ""], ["Kwapie\u0144", "Jaros\u0142aw", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6756", "submitter": "Vladimir Filimonov", "authors": "Vladimir Filimonov, Didier Sornette", "title": "Apparent criticality and calibration issues in the Hawkes self-excited\n  point process model: application to high-frequency financial data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a careful analysis of possible issues on the application of the\nself-excited Hawkes process to high-frequency financial data. We carefully\nanalyze a set of effects leading to significant biases in the estimation of the\n\"criticality index\" n that quantifies the degree of endogeneity of how much\npast events trigger future events. We report a number of model biases that are\nintrinsic to the estimation of brnaching ratio (n) when using power law memory\nkernels. We demonstrate that the calibration of the Hawkes process on mixtures\nof pure Poisson process with changes of regime leads to completely spurious\napparent critical values for the branching ratio (n~1) while the true value is\nactually n=0. More generally, regime shifts on the parameters of the Hawkes\nmodel and/or on the generating process itself are shown to systematically lead\nto a significant upward bias in the estimation of the branching ratio. We also\ndemonstrate the importance of the preparation of the high-frequency financial\ndata and give special care to the decrease of quality of the timestamps of tick\ndata due to latency and grouping of messages to packets by the stock exchange.\nAltogether, our careful exploration of the caveats of the calibration of the\nHawkes process stresses the need for considering all the above issues before\nany conclusion can be sustained. In this respect, because the above effects are\nplaguing their analyses, the claim by Hardiman, Bercot and Bouchaud (2013) that\nfinancial market have been continuously functioning at or close to criticality\n(n~1) cannot be supported. In contrast, our previous results on E-mini S&P 500\nFutures Contracts and on major commodity future contracts are upheld.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 14:23:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 10:59:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 14:49:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Filimonov", "Vladimir", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}]
