Several statistical\nissues related to this model are studied. We first make a quick but extensive\nreview of their main properties and show that most of these properties can be\nanalytically studied. We then develop an approximation theory of these\nprocesses in the limit of small intermittency $\\lambda^2\\ll 1$, i.e., when the\ndegree of multifractality is small. This allows us to prove that the\nprobability distributions associated with these processes possess some very\nsimple aggregation properties accross time scales. Such a control of the\nprocess properties at different time scales, allows us to address the problem\nof parameter estimation. We show that one has to distinguish two different\nasymptotic regimes: the first one, referred to as the ''low frequency regime'',\ncorresponds to taking a sample whose overall size increases whereas the second\none, referred to as the ''high frequency regime'', corresponds to sampling the\nprocess at an increasing sampling rate. We show that, the first regime leads to\nconvergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the situation is\nmuch more intricate : only the intermittency coefficient $\\lambda^2$ can be\nestimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical\nsituations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency\nversus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the estimations of the\nother parameters are reliable or not. We finally illustrate how both our\nresults on parameter estimation and on aggregation properties, allow one to\nsuccessfully use these models for modelization and prediction of financial time\nseries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2008 14:10:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bacry", "E.", ""], ["Kozhemyak", "A.", ""], ["Muzy", "J. -F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0331", "submitter": "Fulvio Baldovin", "authors": "Attilio L.
