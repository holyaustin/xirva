It is based on the\ndetrended cross-correlation and detrended fluctuation analyses (DCCA and DFA,\nrespectively) and can be viewed as an analogue of the Pearson coefficient in\nthe case of the fluctuation analysis. The coefficient $\\rho_{\\rm DCCA}$ works\nwell in many practical situations but by construction its applicability is\nlimited to detection of whether two signals are generally cross-correlated,\nwithout possibility to obtain information on the amplitude of fluctuations that\nare responsible for those cross-correlations. In order to introduce some\nrelated flexibility, here we propose an extension of $\\rho_{\\rm DCCA}$ that\nexploits the multifractal versions of DFA and DCCA: MFDFA and MFCCA,\nrespectively. The resulting new coefficient $\\rho_q$ not only is able to\nquantify the strength of correlations, but also it allows one to identify the\nrange of detrended fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two signals\nunder study. We show how the coefficient $\\rho_q$ works in practical situations\nby applying it to stochastic time series representing processes with long\nmemory: autoregressive and multiplicative ones. Such processes are often used\nto model signals recorded from complex systems and complex physical phenomena\nlike turbulence, so we are convinced that this new measure can successfully be\napplied in time series analysis. In particular, we present an example of such\napplication to highly complex empirical data from financial markets. The\npresent formulation can straightforwardly be extended to multivariate data in\nterms of the $q$-dependent counterpart of the correlation matrices and then to\nthe network representation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:44:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 15:43:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kwapien", "Jaroslaw", ""], ["Oswiecimka", "Pawel", ""], ["Drozdz", "Stanislaw", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08847", "submitter": "Provash  Mali", "authors": "Provash Mali and Amitabha Mukhopadhyay", "title": "Multifractal characterization of gold market: a multifractal detrended\n  fluctuation analysis", "comments": "20 pages, 7 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": "Physica A 413,2014,361-372", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2014.06.076", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis technique is employed to\nanalyze the time series of gold consumer price index (CPI) and the market trend\nof three world's highest gold consuming countries, namely China, India and\nTurkey for the period: 1993-July 2013.
