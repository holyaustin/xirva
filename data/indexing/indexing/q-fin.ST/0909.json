Since its name was coined in 1995\nby merging the words Economics and Physics, this new interdisciplinary field\nhas grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics (wealth\ndistributions), microstructure of financial markets (order book modelling),\neconometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. In the first part of the\nreview, we discuss on the emergence of Econophysics. Then we present empirical\nstudies revealing statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the\npresentation with the widely acknowledged stylized facts which describe the\nreturns of financial assets- fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation,\netc.- and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way\ntime is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties\nobserved on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this\nreview, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own\nhigh-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of\ncorrelations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are\npresented. In the second part of the review, we deal with models in\nEconophysics through the point of view of agent-based modelling. Amongst a\nlarge number of multi-agent-based models, we have identified three\nrepresentative areas. First, using previous work originally presented in the\nfields of behavioural finance and market microstructure theory, econophysicists\nhave developed agent-based models of order-driven markets that are extensively\npresented here. Second, kinetic theory models designed to explain some\nempirical facts on wealth distribution are reviewed. Third, we briefly\nsummarize game theory models by reviewing the now classic minority game and\nrelated problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 15:25:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 13:43:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborti", "Anirban", ""], ["Toke", "Ioane Muni", ""], ["Patriarca", "Marco", ""], ["Abergel", "Frederic", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2885", "submitter": "Ioane Muni Toke", "authors": "Frederic Abergel, Nicolas Huth, Ioane Muni Toke", "title": "Financial bubbles analysis with a cross-sectional estimator", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We highlight a very simple statistical tool for the analysis of financial\nbubbles, which has already been studied in [1].

As in several natural phenomena, the\npredictions of such a model must be compared with the data of a single process\nrealization in our records. In order to give statistical significance to such a\ncomparison, assumptions of stationarity for some quantities extracted from the\nsingle historical time series, like the distribution of the returns over a\ngiven time interval, cannot be avoided. Such assumptions entail the risk of\nmasking or misrepresenting non-stationarities of the underlying process, and of\ngiving an incorrect account of its correlations. Here we overcome this\ndifficulty by showing that five years of daily Euro/US-Dollar trading records\nin the about three hours following the New York market opening, provide a rich\nenough ensemble of histories. The statistics of this ensemble allows to propose\nand test an adequate model of the stochastic process driving the exchange rate.\nThis turns out to be a non-Markovian, self-similar process with non-stationary\nreturns. The empirical ensemble correlators are in agreement with the\npredictions of this model, which is constructed on the basis of the\ntime-inhomogeneous, anomalous scaling obeyed by the return distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2009 14:38:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Sep 2010 06:48:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Baldovin", "Fulvio", ""], ["Bovina", "Dario", ""], ["Camana", "Francesco", ""], ["Stella", "Attilio L.", ""]]}]
