We found the two facts by featuring the\ntime-varying nature of the market efficiency. First, the intervention with\ndiscretionary power disrupted the rice market and reduced market efficiency in\nthe exchange. Second, the market efficiency improved in accordance with\nreduction in the government's discretionary power to operate the rice policy.\nWhen the government obtained the discretionary power to operate the policy\nregarding commodity market, the market efficiency often reduced. Conversely,\neven if the government implemented a large-scale intervention, the market\nefficiency improved when the government chose a systematic rule-like behavior\nfollowing the law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 12:42:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:35:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 06:40:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:41:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 1 Oct 2017 02:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 07:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Mikio", ""], ["Maeda", "Kiyotaka", ""], ["Noda", "Akihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01028", "submitter": "Matthias Raddant", "authors": "Matthias Raddant and Dror Y.

We present\nhere an original contribution that combines Information Theory with graph\nconcepts, to study the return rate series of 32 global trade markets.\nSpecifically, we propose a very simple quantifier that shows to be highly\ncorrelated with global financial instability periods, being also a good\nestimator of the market crisis risk and market resilience. We show that this\nestimator displays striking results when applied to countries that played\ncentral roles during the last major global market crisis.

The search for possible\norigins of such \"anomalous\" scaling and approaches to quantify them are the\nmotivations for the work reported here. In processes with stationary\nincrements, where the stochastic process is time-independent, auto-correlations\nbetween increments and infinite variance of increments can cause anomalous\nscaling. These sources have been referred to as the $\\it{Joseph}$ $\\it{effect}$\nthe $\\it{Noah}$ $\\it{effect}$, respectively. If the increments are\nnon-stationary, then scaling of increments with $t$ can also lead to anomalous\nscaling, a mechanism we refer to as the $\\it{Moses}$ $\\it{effect}$. Scaling\nexponents quantifying the three effects are defined and related to the Hurst\nexponent that characterizes the overall scaling of the stochastic process.\nMethods of time series analysis that enable accurate independent measurement of\neach exponent are presented. Simple stochastic processes are used to illustrate\neach effect. Intraday Financial time series data is analyzed, revealing that\nits anomalous scaling is due only to the Moses effect. In the context of\nfinancial market data, we reiterate that the Joseph exponent, not the Hurst\nexponent, is the appropriate measure to test the efficient market hypothesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 19:51:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Lijian", ""], ["Bassler", "Kevin E.", ""], ["McCauley", "Joseph L.", ""], ["Gunaratne", "Gemunu H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08175", "submitter": "Olivier Scaillet", "authors": "Olivier Scaillet, Adrien Treccani, Christopher Trevisan", "title": "High-Frequency Jump Analysis of the Bitcoin Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use the database leak of Mt.
