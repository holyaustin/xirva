On both PPV and\nNPV metrics, our classifiers do well in identifying up and down market moves\nover the next 1 hour. Beyond evaluating classification accuracy, we also\ndevelop a strategy for translating 1-hour-ahead class predictions into trading\ndecisions, along with a backtester that simulates trading in a realistic\nenvironment. We find that support vector machines yield the most profitable\ntrading strategies, which outperform the market on average for Bitcoin,\nEthereum and Litecoin over the past 22 months, since January 2018.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2019 20:26:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 22:58:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zhao", "David", ""], ["Rinaldo", "Alessandro", ""], ["Brookins", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.11971", "submitter": "Kristoffer Glover", "authors": "Kristoffer Glover", "title": "With or without replacement?

It is shown that cumulative abnormal returns on\nstocks added to the index are significantly positive in the three trading weeks\nprior to the official announcement. The post-listing correction result posited\nto date is also demonstrated to hold; the proportion of periods with\nsignificant negative returns is low, however. Announcement, rather than\neffective dates are critical to returns. Differentials between these stages in\nthe chronology is an important contribution of this paper.

For this paper, the analysis is restricted to\ncrude oil price dynamics. A simple way of improving the BN-S model with the\nimplementation of various machine learning algorithms is proposed. This refined\nBN-S model is more efficient and has fewer parameters than other models which\nare used in practice as improvements of the BN-S model.
