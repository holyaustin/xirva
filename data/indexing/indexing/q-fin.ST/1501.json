Many networks contain \"communities\" of nodes that are more densely\nconnected to each other than to nodes in the rest of the network. In this\npaper, we investigate the detection of communities in temporal networks\nrepresented as multilayer networks. As a focal example, we study time-dependent\nfinancial-asset correlation networks. We first argue that the use of the\n\"modularity\" quality function---which is defined by comparing edge weights in\nan observed network to expected edge weights in a \"null network\"---is\napplication-dependent. We differentiate between \"null networks\" and \"null\nmodels\" in our discussion of modularity maximization, and we highlight that the\nsame null network can correspond to different null models. We then investigate\na multilayer modularity-maximization problem to identify communities in\ntemporal networks. Our multilayer analysis only depends on the form of the\nmaximization problem and not on the specific quality function that one chooses.\nWe introduce a diagnostic to measure \\emph{persistence} of community structure\nin a multilayer network partition. We prove several results that describe how\nthe multilayer maximization problem measures a trade-off between static\ncommunity structure within layers and larger values of persistence across\nlayers. We also discuss some computational issues that the popular \"Louvain\"\nheuristic faces with temporal multilayer networks and suggest ways to mitigate\nthem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 22:52:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 14 Feb 2015 18:55:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 24 Dec 2017 18:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bazzi", "Marya", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Williams", "Stacy", ""], ["McDonald", "Mark", ""], ["Fenn", "Daniel J.", ""], ["Howison", "Sam D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00818", "submitter": "Rick Steinert", "authors": "Florian Ziel, Rick Steinert, Sven Husmann", "title": "Forecasting day ahead electricity spot prices: The impact of the EXAA to\n  other European electricity markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Energy Economics, 51 (2015) 430-444", "doi": "10.1016/j.eneco.2015.08.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR econ.EM q-fin.ST stat.AP stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In our paper we analyze the relationship between the day-ahead electricity\nprice of the Energy Exchange Austria (EXAA) and other day-ahead electricity\nprices in Europe.

Such network can be inferred through correlations\nbetween time series of companies stock prices, allowing the overall system to\nbe characterized by techniques borrowed from network science. Here we study the\npresence of communities in the inferred stock market network, and show that the\nknowledge about the communities alone can provide a nearly complete\nrepresentation of the system topology.

We show that many topological\ncharacteristics of the inferred networks are carried over the networks\ngenerated by the null model. In particular, we find that in periods of\ninstability, such as during a financial crisis, the network strays away from a\nstate of well-defined community structure to a much more uniform topological\norganization. We show that the framework presented here provides a good null\nmodel representation of topological variations taking place in the market\nduring crises.
