This involves a choice of $k$ out of $T$ years in which to apply\nthe insurance policy coverage by making claims against losses in the given\nyear. The insurance product structure presented can accommodate any kind of\nannual mitigation, but we present three basic generic insurance policy\nstructures that can be combined to create more complex types of coverage.\nFollowing the Loss Distributional Approach (LDA) with Poisson distributed\nannual loss frequencies and Inverse-Gaussian loss severities we are able to\ncharacterize in closed form analytical expressions for the multiple optimal\ndecision strategy that minimizes the expected Operational Risk loss over the\nnext $T$ years. For the cases where the combination of insurance policies and\nLDA model does not lead to closed form expressions for the multiple optimal\ndecision rules, we also develop a principled class of closed form\napproximations to the optimal decision rule. These approximations are developed\nbased on a class of orthogonal Askey polynomial series basis expansion\nrepresentations of the annual loss compound process distribution and functions\nof this annual loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 11:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Targino", "Rodrigo S.", ""], ["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Sofronov", "Georgy", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0557", "submitter": "Steven Pav", "authors": "Steven E.
