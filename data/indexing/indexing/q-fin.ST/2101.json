The energy and variogram scores are two rules that have\nrecently gained some popularity in multivariate settings because their\ncomputation does not require a forecast to have parametric density function and\nso they are broadly applicable. Here we conduct a simulation study to compare\nthe discrimination ability between the energy score and three variogram scores.\nCompared with other studies, our simulation design is more realistic because it\nis supported by a historical data set containing commodity prices, currencies\nand interest rates, and our data generating processes include a diverse\nselection of models with different marginal distributions, dependence\nstructure, and calibration windows. This facilitates a comprehensive comparison\nof the performance of proper scoring rules in different settings. To compare\nthe scores we use three metrics: the mean relative score, error rate and a\ngeneralised discrimination heuristic. Overall, we find that the variogram score\nwith parameter p=0.5 outperforms the energy score and the other two variogram\nscores.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 17:23:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Alexander", "Carol", ""], ["Coulon", "Michael", ""], ["Han", "Yang", ""], ["Meng", "Xiaochun", ""]]}]
