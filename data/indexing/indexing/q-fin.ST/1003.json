We find a\nsignificant reversal of price for both intraday price decreases and increases\nwith a permanent price impact. The volatility, the volume of different types of\norders, the bid-ask spread, and the volume imbalance increase before the\nextreme events and decay slowly as a power law, which forms a well-established\npeak. The volume of buy market orders increases faster and the corresponding\npeak appears earlier than for sell market orders around positive events, while\nthe volume peak of sell market orders leads buy market orders in the magnitude\nand time around negative events. When orders are divided into four groups\naccording to their aggressiveness, we find that the behaviors of order volume\nand order number are similar, except for buy limit orders and canceled orders\nthat the peak of order number postpones two minutes later after the peak of\norder volume, implying that investors placing large orders are more informed\nand play a central role in large price fluctuations. We also study the relative\nrates of different types of orders and find differences in the dynamics of\nrelative rates between buy orders and sell orders and between individual\ninvestors and institutional investors. There is evidence showing that\ninstitutions behave very differently from individuals and that they have more\naggressive strategies. Combing these findings, we conclude that institutional\ninvestors are more informed and play a more influential role in driving large\nprice fluctuations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2010 07:51:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mu", "Guo-Hua", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Kertesz", "Janos", "", "BME"]]}, {"id": "1003.1802", "submitter": "Edouard Debonneuil", "authors": "Edouard Debonneuil", "title": "A simple model of mortality trends aiming at universality: Lee Carter +\n  Cohort", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Lee Carter modelling framework is widely used because of its simplicity\nand robustness despite its inability to model specific cohort effects.
