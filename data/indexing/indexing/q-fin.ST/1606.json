Our framework is very general and\nallows integrated regressors and trends as well as stationary regressors. The\nnull hypothesis is that breaks in different parameters occur at common\nlocations and are separated by some positive fraction of the sample size unless\nthey occur across different equations. Under the alternative hypothesis, the\nbreak dates across parameters are not the same and also need not be separated\nby a positive fraction of the sample size whether within or across equations.\nThe test considered is the quasi-likelihood ratio test assuming normal errors,\nthough as usual the limit distribution of the test remains valid with\nnon-normal errors. Of independent interest, we provide results about the rate\nof convergence of the estimates when searching over all possible partitions\nsubject only to the requirement that each regime contains at least as many\nobservations as some positive fraction of the sample size, allowing break dates\nnot separated by a positive fraction of the sample size across equations.\nSimulations show that the test has good finite sample properties. We also\nprovide an application to issues related to level shifts and persistence for\nvarious measures of inflation to illustrate its usefulness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 01:55:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jan 2018 01:35:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Oka", "Tatsushi", ""], ["Perron", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.01218", "submitter": "Marcin W\\k{a}torek", "authors": "Marcin W\\k{a}torek, Stanis{\\l}aw Dro\\.zd\\.z, Pawe{\\l} O\\'swi\\k{e}cimka", "title": "World Financial 2014-2016 Market Bubbles: Oil Negative - US Dollar\n  Positive", "comments": "presented at FENS2015 conference, to appear in Acta Physica Polonica\n  A. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1003.5926 by other authors", "journal-ref": "M.

Anchoring as a heuristic bias causes\ninvestors focusing on recent price changes and price levels, which two lead to\na belief in continuing trend and mean-reversion respectively. The empirical\nresults support our theoretical explanation through an analysis of large price\nfluctuations in the S&P 500 and the resulting effects on implied and realized\nvolatility. These results indicate that asymmetry (a negative relationship)\nbetween shocks and volatility in the subsequent period indeed exists. Moreover,\ncontrary to previous research, our empirical tests also suggest that implied\nvolatility is not simply an upward biased predictor of future deviation\ncompensating for the variance of the volatility but rather, due to investors\nsystematic anchoring to losses and gains in their volatility forecasts, it is a\nco-integrated yet asymmetric over/under estimated financial instrument. We also\nprovide results indicating that the medium-term implied volatility (measured by\nthe VIX Index) is an unbiased though inefficient estimation of realized\nvolatility, while in contrast, the short-term volatility (measured by the\nrecently introduced VXST Index representing the 9-day implied volatility) is\nalso unbiased and yet efficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 13:59:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ormos", "Mihaly", ""], ["Timotity", "Dusan", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.04872", "submitter": "Vincenzo Nicosia", "authors": "Nicol\\'o Musmeci, Vincenzo Nicosia, Tomaso Aste, Tiziana Di Matteo,\n  Vito Latora", "title": "The multiplex dependency structure of financial markets", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.CE q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose here a multiplex network approach to investigate simultaneously\ndifferent types of dependency in complex data sets.
