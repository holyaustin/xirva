The problem whether and how volatilities\naffect the price movement draws much attention. Although many efforts have been\nmade, it remains challenging. Physicists usually apply the concepts and methods\nin statistical physics, such as temporal correlation functions, to study\nfinancial dynamics. However, the usual volatility-return correlation function,\nwhich is local in time, typically fluctuates around zero. Here we construct\ndynamic observables nonlocal in time to explore the volatility-return\ncorrelation, based on the empirical data of hundreds of individual stocks and\n25 stock market indices in different countries. Strikingly, the correlation is\ndiscovered to be non-zero, with an amplitude of a few percent and a duration of\nover two weeks. This result provides compelling evidence that past volatilities\nnonlocal in time affect future returns. Further, we introduce an agent-based\nmodel with a novel mechanism, that is, the asymmetric trading preference in\nvolatile and stable markets, to understand the microscopic origin of the\nvolatility-return correlation nonlocal in time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 12:03:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Lei", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""], ["Chen", "Jun-Jie", ""], ["Jiang", "Xiong-Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02963", "submitter": "Ricardo Cris\\'ostomo", "authors": "Ricardo Crisostomo", "title": "An Analysis of the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model: Implementation\n  and Calibration using Matlab", "comments": "34 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.NA math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyses the implementation and calibration of the Heston\nStochastic Volatility Model.

According to scaling\nexponent given by AMF-DFA, $h(q=2)>1$, we find that all underlying data sets\nbelong to non-stationary process. According to EMH, only 8 markets are\nclassified in uncorrelated processes at $2\\sigma$ confidence interval. 6 Stock\nmarkets belong to anti-correlated class and dominant part of markets has memory\nin corresponding daily index prices during January 1995 to February 2014.\nNew-Zealand with $H=0.457\\pm0.004$ and Jordan with $H=0.602\\pm 0.006$ are far\nfrom EMH. The nature of cross-correlation exponents based on AMF-DXA is almost\nmultifractal for all pair of Stock markets. The empirical relation, $H_{xy}\\le\n[H_{xx}+H_{yy}]/2$, is confirmed.

For larger fluctuations, the cross-correlation contains information from\nboth local and global conditions.
