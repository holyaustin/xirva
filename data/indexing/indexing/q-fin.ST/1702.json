We find that the distribution of share price follows Zipf's law;\nthat is, it can be approximated by a power law distribution with exponent equal\nto 1. An examination of the distributions of dividends per share, cash flow per\nshare, and book value per share - three financial indicators that can be\nassumed to influence corporate value (i.e. share price) - shows that these\ndistributions can also be approximated by a power law distribution with\npower-law exponent equal to 1. We estimate a panel regression model in which\nshare price is the dependent variable and the three financial indicators are\nexplanatory variables. The two-way fixed effects model that was selected as the\nbest model has quite high power for explaining the actual data. From these\nresults, we can surmise that the reason why share price follows Zipf's law is\nthat corporate value, i.e. company fundamentals, follows Zipf's law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 06:22:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kaizoji", "Taisei", ""], ["Miyano", "Michiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00586", "submitter": "Gregory Schehr", "authors": "Claude Godreche, Satya N.
