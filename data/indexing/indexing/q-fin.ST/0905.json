The distribution of the relative price, defined as the\nrelative difference between the order price in opening call auction and the\nclosing price of last trading day, is asymmetric and that the distribution\ndisplays a sharp peak at zero relative price and a relatively wide peak at\nnegative relative price. The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method is\nadopted to investigate the long-term memory of relative order prices. We\nfurther study the statistical regularities of order sizes in opening call\nauction, and observe a phenomenon of number preference, known as order size\nclustering. The probability density function (PDF) of order sizes could be well\nfitted by a $q$-Gamma function, and the long-term memory also exists in order\nsizes. In addition, both the average volume and the average number of orders\ndecrease exponentially with the price level away from the best bid or ask price\nlevel in the limit-order book (LOB) established immediately after the opening\ncall auction, and a price clustering phenomenon is observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2009 11:39:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Gao-Feng", ""], ["Ren", "Fei", ""], ["Ni", "Xiao-Hui", ""], ["Chen", "Wei", ""], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.1518", "submitter": "Victor M.
