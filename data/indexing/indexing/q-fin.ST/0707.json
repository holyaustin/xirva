To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the\nunderlined non-linear mechanism, we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks\nwhich consist of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the cumulative\ndistribution of return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling. We\nsupport this finding by studying the m-th moment $\\mu_m \\equiv\n<(\\tau/<\\tau>)^m>^{1/m}$, which show a certain trend with the mean interval\n$<\\tau>$. We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method, and find\nthat their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and\nmoments are almost constant for most range of $<\\tau>$. Those substantial\ndifferences suggest that non-linear correlations in the original volatility\nsequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law. We also find\nthat the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and\nlong $<\\tau>$, due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records\nrespectively. To avoid as possible those effects for testing the multiscaling\nbehavior, we investigate the moments in the range $10<<\\tau>\\leq100$, and find\nthe exponent $\\alpha$ from the power law fitting $\\mu_m\\sim<\\tau>^\\alpha$ has a\nnarrow distribution around $\\alpha\\neq0$ which depend on m for the 500 stocks.\nThe distribution of $\\alpha$ for the surrogate records are very narrow and\ncentered around $\\alpha=0$. This suggests that the return interval distribution\nexhibit multiscaling behavior due to the non-linear correlations in the\noriginal volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2007 15:14:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Fengzhong", ""], ["Yamasaki", "Kazuko", ""], ["Havlin", "Shlomo", ""], ["Stanley", "H.
