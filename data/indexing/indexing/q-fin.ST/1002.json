Through the addition\nof perturbations to the one-factor model, (leading to a 'market plus sectors'\nmodel), additional sectoral features are added, resulting in an Inverse\nParticipation Ratio comparable to that found for empirical data.

We identify 11 crashes\non the Hang Seng market over the period 1970 to 2008.

We also find that influence percolation combined with a martingale\ncondition holds for only half of the pre-crash bubbles previously reported.\nOverall, the mechanism posited as underlying the LPPL does not do so, and the\ndata used to support the fit of the LPPL to bubbles does so only partially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 15:04:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Apr 2013 15:38:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bree", "David S.", "", "Institute for Scientific Interchange, Torino"], ["Joseph", "Nathan Lael", "", "Aston University, Birmingham"]]}, {"id": "1002.1653", "submitter": "Fei Ren", "authors": "Fei Ren and Wei-Xing Zhou", "title": "Recurrence interval analysis of trading volumes", "comments": "9 pages, 9 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": "Physical Review E 81 (6), 066107 (2010)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.81.066107", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the statistical properties of the recurrence intervals $\\tau$\nbetween successive trading volumes exceeding a certain threshold $q$.
