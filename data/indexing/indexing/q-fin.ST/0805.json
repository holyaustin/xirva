One\npossible such extension is the diffusion limit of Nelson, but this is\nproblematic in that the discrete-time GARCH model and its continuous-time\ndiffusion limit are not statistically equivalent. As an alternative,\nKl\\\"{u}ppelberg et al. recently introduced a continuous-time version of the\nGARCH (the `COGARCH' process) which is constructed directly from a background\ndriving L\\'{e}vy process. The present paper shows how to fit this model to\nirregularly spaced time series data using discrete-time GARCH methodology, by\napproximating the COGARCH with an embedded sequence of discrete-time GARCH\nseries which converges to the continuous-time model in a strong sense (in\nprobability, in the Skorokhod metric), as the discrete approximating grid grows\nfiner. This property is also especially useful in certain other applications,\nsuch as options pricing. The way is then open to using, for the COGARCH,\nsimilar statistical techniques to those already worked out for GARCH models and\nto illustrate this, an empirical investigation using stock index data is\ncarried out.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2008 15:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Maller", "Ross A.", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Gernot", ""], ["Szimayer", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.2194", "submitter": "Tian Qiu", "authors": "Tian Qiu (NHU), Liang Guo (ECUST), Guang Chen (NHU)", "title": "Scaling and Memory Effect in Volatility Return Interval of the Chinese\n  Stock Market", "comments": "10 elsart pages including 7 eps figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2008.09.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate the probability distribution of the volatility return\nintervals $\\tau$ for the Chinese stock market.

The statistical distances between countries are\ncalculated for various moving time windows, and the time variation of the mean\nstatistical distance is investigated. The decreasing of the mean statistical\ndistance between EU countries is reflected in the correlated fluctuations of\nthe basic ME indicators: GDP, GDP/capita, Consumption and Investments. This\nempirical evidence can be seen as an economic aspect of globalization. The\nMoving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows to search for a\ncluster-like structures derived both from the hierarchical organization of\ncountries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy. It is found\nthat the strongly correlated countries with respect to GDP fluctuations can be\npartitioned into stable clusters. Some of the highly correlated countries, with\nrespect to GDP fluctuations, display strong correlations also in the Final\nConsumption Expenditure, while others are strongly correlated in Gross Capital\nFormation. On the other hand, one notices the similitude of the classifications\nregarding GDP and Net Exports fluctuations as concerns the squared sum of the\ncorrelation coefficients (so called country sensitivity). The final structure\nproves to be robust against the constant size time window moving over the\nscanned time interval.

There are three key ingredients in the Mike-Farmer\n(MF) model: the long memory of order signs characterized by the Hurst index\n$H_s$, the distribution of relative order prices $x$ in reference to the same\nbest price described by a Student distribution (or Tsallis' $q$-Gaussian), and\nthe dynamics of order cancelation. They showed that different values of the\nHurst index $H_s$ and the freedom degree $\\alpha_x$ of the Student distribution\ncan always produce power-law tails in the return distribution $f(r)$ with\ndifferent tail exponent $\\alpha_r$. In this paper, we study the origin of the\npower-law tails of the return distribution $f(r)$ in the MF model, based on\nextensive simulations with different combinations of the left part $f_L(x)$ for\n$x<0$ and the right part $f_R(x)$ for $x>0$ of $f(x)$. We find that power-law\ntails appear only when $f_L(x)$ has a power-law tail, no matter $f_R(x)$ has a\npower-law tail or not. In addition, we find that the distributions of returns\nin the MF model at different timescales can be well modeled by the Student\ndistributions, whose tail exponents are close to the well-known cubic law and\nincrease with the timescale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2008 08:19:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}]
