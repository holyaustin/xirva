We focus on the efficiency ranking of gold markets with respect to\nthe currency of purchase. By utilizing the Efficiency Index (EI) based on\nfractal dimension, approximate entropy and long-term memory on a wide portfolio\nof 142 gold price series for different currencies, we construct the efficiency\nranking based on the extended EI methodology we provide. Rather unexpected\nresults are uncovered as the gold prices in major currencies lay among the\nleast efficient ones whereas very minor currencies are among the most efficient\nones. We argue that such counterintuitive results can be partly attributed to a\nunique period of examination (2011-2014) characteristic by quantitative easing\nand rather unorthodox monetary policies together with the investigated illegal\ncollusion of major foreign exchange market participants, as well as some other\nfactors discussed in some detail.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 09:46:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kristoufek", "Ladislav", ""], ["Vosvrda", "Miloslav", ""]]}]
