It is natural to ask whether these\nevents indicate a transition to a new regime of market behavior, particularly\ngiven the dramatic fluctuations --- both gains and losses --- in the weeks\nsince. To illuminate this matter, we can apply a model grounded in the science\nof complex systems, a model that demonstrated considerable success at\nunraveling the stock-market dynamics from the 1980s through the 2000s. By using\nlarge-scale comovement of stock prices as an early indicator of unhealthy\nmarket dynamics, this work found that abrupt drops in a certain parameter $U$\nprovide an early warning of single-day panics and economic crises. Decreases in\n$U$ indicate regimes of \"high co-movement\", a market behavior that is not the\nsame as volatility, though market volatility can be a component of co-movement.\nApplying the same analysis to stock-price data from the beginning of 2016 until\nnow, we find that the $U$ value for the period since 5 February is\nsignificantly lower than for the period before. This decrease entered the\n\"danger zone\" in the last week of May, 2018.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2018 19:56:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Stacey", "Blake C.", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.01616", "submitter": "Ladislav Kristoufek", "authors": "Ladislav Kristoufek", "title": "Power-law cross-correlations: Issues, solutions and future challenges", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Analysis of long-range dependence in financial time series was one of the\ninitial steps of econophysics into the domain of mainstream finance and\nfinancial economics in the 1990s.
