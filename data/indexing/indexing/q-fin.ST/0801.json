In this paper, the bifurcation phenomenon\nin Hang-Seng index is carefully investigated. It is observed that the\nbifurcation phenomenon in financial index is not universal, but specific under\ncertain conditions. The phenomenon just emerges when the power-law exponent of\nabsolute increment distribution is between 1 and 2 with appropriate period.\nSimulations on a randomly generated time series suggest the bifurcation\nphenomenon itself is subject to the statistics of absolute increment, thus it\nmay not be able to reflect the essential financial behaviors. However, even\nunder the same distribution of absolute increment, the range where bifurcation\nphenomenon occurs is far different from real market to artificial data, which\nmay reflect certain market information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Dec 2007 07:33:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Shi-Mei", ""], ["Cai", "Shi-Min", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""], ["Zhou", "Pei-Ling", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0748", "submitter": "Ester Pantaleo Dr.", "authors": "N.
