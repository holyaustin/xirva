Earlier\nworks have suggested that the behavior of market returns can be well described\nwithin the framework of non-extensive Tsallis statistics or superstatistics.\nFor small time scales (delays), a good fit to the distributions of stock\nreturns is obtained with q-Gaussian distributions, which can be derived either\nfrom Tsallis statistics or superstatistics.

Each of\nthese two independent distributions are half q-Gaussians with different\nnon-extensivity parameter q and temperature parameter beta. Using this model,\nwe investigate the behavior of stock market returns over time scales from 1 to\n80 days. The data covers both the .com bubble and the 2008 crash periods.

For positive returns, q approaches a\nconstant value of 1 after a certain lag, indicating the distributions have\nreached equilibrium. On the other hand, for negative returns, the q values do\nnot reach a stationary value over the time scales studied. In the present\nmodel, the markets show a transition from normal to superdiffusive behavior (a\npossible phase transition) during the 2008 crash period.

However, because high-frequency trading data are not available during\nthe close-to-open period, the volatility models often ignore volatility\ninformation over the close-to-open period and thus may suffer from loss of\nimportant information relevant to market dynamics. In this paper, to account\nfor whole-day market dynamics, we propose an overnight volatility model based\non It\\^o diffusions to accommodate two different instantaneous volatility\nprocesses for the open-to-close and close-to-open periods. We develop a\nweighted least squares method to estimate model parameters for two different\nperiods and investigate its asymptotic properties. We conduct a simulation\nstudy to check the finite sample performance of the proposed model and method.\nFinally, we apply the proposed approaches to real trading data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 21:51:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Donggyu", ""], ["Wang", "Yazhen", ""]]}]
