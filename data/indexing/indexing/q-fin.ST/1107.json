Our recent analysis\nsuggests the possibility of one more substantial fluctuation before the final\ncollapse in July 2011. On the other hand, in early 2011 we detected a number of\nother commodity bubbles and forecasted the start of their collapse in May -\nJune 2011. We demonstrate that this collapse has actually begun, which in\nconjunction with the forthcoming burst of the gold bubble suggests that the\nWorld System is entering a bifurcation zone bearing rather high risks of the\nsecond wave of the global financial-economic crisis. Indeed, on the one hand,\nit is obvious that such a collapse may lead to huge losses or even bankruptcies\nof many of the major participants of exchange games and their dependent firms\nand banks. Therefore, the immediate market reaction is likely to be entirely\nnegative. Negative impact on the market could well be amplified by numerous\npublications in the media and business press, drawing analogies with the events\nof the early 1980s and earlier similar events, as well as by losses of\nshareholders of bankrupt companies. On the other hand, investments in gold also\nlead to the diversion of funds from stock market investments and to the\nreduction in the production of goods and services. If at the time of the\ncollapse some promising areas of investment appear in the developed and / or\ndeveloping countries, the investment can move to those markets, which, on the\ncontrary, could contribute to the production of new goods and services and\naccelerate the way out of the crisis. It is also obvious that the decline of\nthe oil (and other energy/mineral resources) prices may contribute to\nacceleration of world economic growth rates and world economic recovery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jul 2011 17:56:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Akaev", "Askar", ""], ["Fomin", "Alexei", ""], ["Korotayev", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1174", "submitter": "Josep Perello", "authors": "Josep Perell\\'o, Mario Guti\\'errez-Roig, Jaume Masoliver", "title": "Scaling properties and universality of first-passage time probabilities\n  in financial markets", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

One model posits that each event type has\na temporary impact (TIM). The \"history dependent impact\" model (HDIM), on the\nother hand, assumes that only price-changing events have a direct impact,\nitself modulated by the past history of all events through an \"influence\nmatrix\" that measures how much, on average, an event of a given type affects\nthe immediate impact of a price-changing event of the same sign in the future.\nWe find in particular that aggressive market orders tend to reduce the impact\nof further aggressive market orders of the same sign (and increase the impact\nof aggressive market orders of opposite sign). We discuss the relative merits\nof TIM and HDIM, in particular concerning their ability to reproduce accurately\nthe price diffusion pattern. We find that in spite of theoretical\ninconsistencies, TIM appears to fare better than HDIM when compared to\nempirical data. We ascribe this paradox to an uncontrolled approximation used\nto calibrate HDIMs, calling for further work on this issue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 06:47:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Eisler", "Zoltan", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Kockelkoren", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3456", "submitter": "Tomaso Aste", "authors": "Tomaso Aste, Ruggero Gramatica and T.

Remarkably, the study of topologically embedded graphs is\nnon-restrictive because any network can be embedded on a surface with\nsufficiently high genus. The local properties of the network are affected by\nthe surface genus which, for example, produces significant changes in the\ndegree distribution and in the clustering coefficient. The global properties of\nthe graph are also strongly affected by the surface genus which is constraining\nthe degree of interwoveness, changing the scaling properties from\nlarge-world-kind (small genus) to small- and ultra-small-world-kind (large\ngenus). Two elementary moves allow the exploration of all networks embeddable\non a given surface and naturally introduce a tool to develop a statistical\nmechanics description. Within such a framework, we study the properties of\ntopologically-embedded graphs at high and low `temperatures' observing the\nformation of increasingly regular structures by cooling the system. We show\nthat the cooling dynamics is strongly affected by the surface genus with the\nmanifestation of a glassy-like freezing transitions occurring when the amount\nof topological disorder is low.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 14:47:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2012 22:59:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Aste", "Tomaso", ""], ["Gramatica", "Ruggero", ""], ["Di Matteo", "T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4146", "submitter": "Leonidas Sandoval", "authors": "Leonidas Sandoval Junior", "title": "A Map of the Brazilian Stock Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Advances in Complex Systems 2, Vol. 15, No. 4 (2012) 1250042", "doi": "10.1142/S0219525912500427", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use the correlation matrix of stocks returns in order to create maps of\nthe S\\~ao Paulo Stock Exchange (BM&F-Bovespa), Brazil's main stock exchange.\nThe data reffer to the year 2010, and the correlations between stock returns\nlead to the construction of a minimum spanning tree and of asset graphs with a\nvariety of threshold values.
