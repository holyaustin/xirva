Intuitively, the failure of\nelliptical models can be traced to the inadequacy of the assumption of a single\nvolatility mode for all stocks. We suggest several ideas of methodological\ninterest to efficiently visualise and compare different copulas.

However, tick\nsize can also affect price properties at longer time scales, and relatively\nless is known about the effect of tick size on the statistical properties of\nprices. The present paper is divided in two parts. In the first we review the\neffect of tick size change on the market microstructure and the diffusion\nproperties of prices. The second part presents original results obtained by\ninvestigating the tick size changes occurring at the New York Stock Exchange\n(NYSE). We show that tick size change has three effects on price diffusion.\nFirst, as already shown in the literature, tick size affects price return\ndistribution at an aggregate time scale. Second, reducing the tick size\ntypically leads to an increase of volatility clustering. We give a possible\nmechanistic explanation for this effect, but clearly more investigation is\nneeded to understand the origin of this relation. Third, we explicitly show\nthat the ability of the subordination hypothesis in explaining fat tails of\nreturns and volatility clustering is strongly dependent on tick size. While for\nlarge tick sizes the subordination hypothesis has significant explanatory\npower, for small tick sizes we show that subordination is not the main driver\nof these two important stylized facts of financial market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 09:11:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Oct 2010 16:38:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["La Spada", "Gabriele", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
