In this paper we consider a recently\nintroduced market impact model (Bouchaud et al., 2004), which has the property\nof describing both the volume and the temporal dependence of price change due\nto trading. We show how this model can be used to describe price impact also in\naggregated trade time or in real time.

The standard ARCH or GARCH framework is recovered when the\nquadratic kernel is diagonal. The calibration of these models on US stock\nreturns reveals several unexpected features. The off-diagonal (non ARCH)\ncoefficients of the quadratic kernel are found to be highly significant both\nIn-Sample and Out-of-Sample, but all these coefficients turn out to be one\norder of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements. This confirms that daily\nreturns play a special role in the volatility feedback mechanism, as postulated\nby ARCH models. The feedback kernel exhibits a surprisingly complex structure,\nincompatible with models proposed so far in the literature. Its spectral\nproperties suggest the existence of volatility-neutral patterns of past\nreturns. The diagonal part of the quadratic kernel is found to decay as a\npower-law of the lag, in line with the long-memory of volatility. Finally,\nQARCH models suggest some violations of Time Reversal Symmetry in financial\ntime series, which are indeed observed empirically, although of much smaller\namplitude than predicted. We speculate that a faithful volatility model should\ninclude both ARCH feedback effects and a stochastic component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 10:24:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 12:16:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chicheportiche", "R\u00e9my", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4420", "submitter": "Thomas Bury J", "authors": "Thomas Bury", "title": "Statistical pairwise interaction model of stock market", "comments": "11 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Eur.

Here we show that the pairwise model is actually a statistically\nconsistent model with observed first and second moments of the stocks\norientation without making such restrictive assumptions. This is done with an\napproach based only on empirical data of price returns. Our data analysis of\nsix major indices suggests that the actual interaction structure may be thought\nas an Ising model on a complex network with interaction strengths scaling as\nthe inverse of the system size. This has potentially important implications\nsince many properties of such a model are already known and some techniques of\nthe spin glass theory can be straightforwardly applied.
