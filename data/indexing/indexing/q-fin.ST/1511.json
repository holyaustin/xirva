The reason is that\ntransaction costs and arbitrage opportunity are not included, as this does not\nsimulate the real financial markets. Analyses are not conducted on the non\nequidistant date but rather on the aggregate date, which is also not a real\nfinancial case. In this paper, we would like to show a new way how to analyze\nand, moreover, forecast financial market. We utilize the projections of the\nreal exchange rate dynamics onto the string-like topology in the OANDA market.\nThe latter approach allows us to build the stable prediction models in trading\nin the financial forex market. The real application of the multi-string\nstructures is provided to demonstrate our ideas for the solution of the problem\nof the robust portfolio selection.

First, the thesis focuses\non reviewing the CAPM and comparing popular statistical methods used to\nestimate it, and then, the thesis compares predictive power of the CAPM and the\nFama-French model, which is an important extension of the CAPM. Through an\nempirical study on the data set of large cap stocks, we have demonstrated that\nthere is no statistical method that would recover the expected relationship\nbetween systematic risk (represented by beta) and return from the CAPM, and\nthat the Fama-French model does not have a better predictive performance than\nthe CAPM on individual stocks. Therefore, the thesis provides more evidence to\nsupport the incorrectness of the CAPM and the limitation of the Fama-French\nmodel in explaining risk-return relationship.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 03:25:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Nghiem", "Linh", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07773", "submitter": "Olivier Gu\\'eant", "authors": "Jean-David Fermanian, Olivier Gu\\'eant, Jiang Pu", "title": "The behavior of dealers and clients on the European corporate bond\n  market: the case of Multi-Dealer-to-Client platforms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For the last two decades, most financial markets have undergone an evolution\ntoward electronification.
