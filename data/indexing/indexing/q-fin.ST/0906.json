The main objects of our interest in\nthe present paper are the density of time averages of the squared volatility\nprocess and the density of the stock price process in the Stein-Stein and the\nHeston model. We find explicit formulas for leading terms in asymptotic\nexpansions of these densities and give error estimates. As an application of\nour results, sharp asymptotic formulas for the implied volatility in the\nStein-Stein and the Heston model are obtained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2009 23:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gulisashvili", "A.", ""], ["Stein", "E.

We provide\nevidence that the return distribution for these stocks is non-Gaussian and\nsimilar in shape, and that the distribution appears stable over intraday time\nscales. We explain these results by assuming the volatility of returns is\nconstant intraday, but varies over longer periods such that its inverse square\nfollows a gamma distribution.
