A new distribution function, having its\nroots in the framework of k-generalized statistics, is derived that is\nparticularly suitable to describe the whole spectrum of incomes, from the\nlow-middle income region up to the high-income Pareto power-law regime.\nAnalytical expressions for the shape, moments and some other basic statistical\nproperties are given. Furthermore, several well-known econometric tools for\nmeasuring inequality, which all exist in a closed form, are considered. A\nmethod for parameter estimation is also discussed. The model is shown to fit\nremarkably well the data on personal income for the United States, and the\nanalysis of inequality performed in terms of its parameters reveals very\npowerful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2009 16:16:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2009 10:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Clementi", "F.", ""], ["Gallegati", "M.", ""], ["Kaniadakis", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0713", "submitter": "Amparo Baillo", "authors": "Amparo Baillo", "title": "Correction to \"Leverage and volatility feedback effects in\n  high-frequency data\" [J.

Accordingly the new emerging discipline requires one to replace\nthe production function, one of key ideas in the conventional economics, by an\nalternative which can take an explicit account of distribution of firms'\nproduction activities. In this paper we propose a new idea referred to as\nproduction copula; a copula is an analytic means for modeling dependence among\nvariables. Such a production copula predicts value added yielded by firms with\ngiven capital and labor in a probabilistic way. It is thereby in sharp contrast\nto the production function where the output of firms is completely\ndeterministic. We demonstrate empirical construction of a production copula\nusing financial data of listed firms in Japan. Analysis of the data shows that\nthere are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added\nand confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented\nby a production function. We employ four models for the production copula, that\nis, trivariate versions of Frank, Gumbel and survival Clayton and\nnon-exchangeable trivariate Gumbel; the last one works best.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 03:46:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2009 05:10:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Nov 2010 02:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Iyetomi", "H.", ""], ["Aoyama", "H.", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Y.", ""], ["Ikeda", "Y.", ""], ["Souma", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2735", "submitter": "Josep Perello", "authors": "Jaume Masoliver, Josep Perello", "title": "First-passage and risk evaluation under stochastic volatility", "comments": "36 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
