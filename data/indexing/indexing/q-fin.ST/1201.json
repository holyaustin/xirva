The\nprobability distributions and correlations of recurrence intervals for many\nsystems have been extensively investigated. However, the impacts of microscopic\nrules of a complex system on the macroscopic properties of its recurrence\nintervals are less studied. In this Letter, we adopt an order-driven stock\nmarket model to address this issue for stock returns. We find that the\ndistributions of the scaled recurrence intervals of simulated returns have a\npower law scaling with stretched exponential cutoff and the intervals possess\nmultifractal nature, which are consistent with empirical results. We further\ninvestigate the effects of long memory in the directions (or signs) and\nrelative prices of the order flow on the characteristic quantities of these\nproperties. It is found that the long memory in the order directions (Hurst\nindex $H_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and the\nmultifractal nature. In contrast, the power-law exponent of the interval\ndistribution increases linearly with respect to the Hurst index $H_x$ of the\nrelative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal nature\nfluctuates around a constant value when $H_x<0.7$ and then increases with\n$H_x$. No evident effects of $H_s$ and $H_x$ are found on the long memory of\nthe recurrence intervals. Our results indicate that the nontrivial properties\nof the recurrence intervals of returns are mainly caused by traders' behaviors\nof persistently placing new orders around the best bid and ask prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 18:04:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Meng", "Hao", "", "ECUST"], ["Ren", "Fei", "", "ECUST"], ["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Xiong", "Xiong", "", "TJU"], ["Zhang", "Yong-Jie", "", "TJU"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"], ["Zhang", "Wei", "", "TJU"]]}, {"id": "1201.3083", "submitter": "Aleksejus Kononovicius", "authors": "Vygintas Gontis, Aleksejus Kononovicius, Stefan Reimann", "title": "The class of nonlinear stochastic models as a background for the bursty\n  behavior in financial markets", "comments": "9 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Advances in Complex Systems 15 (1), 2012, 1250071", "doi": "10.1142/S0219525912500713", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate large changes, bursts, of the continuous stochastic signals,\nwhen the exponent of multiplicativity is higher than one.

For both models we present\napproximate maximum likelihood methods, and we apply these methods to estimate\nthe parameters for the spot prices in the Nordic electricity market. The\nmaximum likelihood estimates show that electricity spot prices are\ncharacterized by scaling exponents that are significantly different from the\ncorresponding exponents in stock markets, confirming the exceptional nature of\nthe electricity market. In order to compare the damped MRW model with the\nfractional MRW model we use ensemble simulations and wavelet-based variograms,\nand we observe that certain features of the spot prices are better described by\nthe damped MRW model. The characteristic correlation time is estimated to\napproximately half a year.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 09:25:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rypdal", "Martin", ""], ["L\u00f8vsletten", "Ola", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6535", "submitter": "Giacomo Livan", "authors": "Giacomo Livan, Luca Rebecchi", "title": "Asymmetric correlation matrices: an analysis of financial data", "comments": "Revised version; 11 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "Eur.

Namely, we employ\ndaily prices of stocks belonging to the American and British stock exchanges,\nand look for the emergence of correlations between two such markets in the\neigenvalue spectrum of their non symmetric correlation matrix. We find several\nnon trivial results, also when considering time-lagged correlations over short\nlags, and we corroborate our findings by additionally studying the asymmetric\ncorrelation matrix of the principal components of our datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 13:29:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 07:21:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Livan", "Giacomo", ""], ["Rebecchi", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.6544", "submitter": "Ma{\\l}gorzata Snarska", "authors": "Ma{\\l}gorzata Snarska", "title": "A Random Matrix Approach to Dynamic Factors in macroeconomic data", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:physics/0512090 by other\n  authors", "journal-ref": "ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA A Vol. 121 B (2012) 110-120", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.comp-ph physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how random matrix theory can be applied to develop new algorithms to\nextract dynamic factors from macroeconomic time series.
