Cristelli, A. Zaccaria and L. Pietronero, Phys.\nRev. E 85, 066108 (2012)}], Cristelli \\textit{et al.} analysed relation between\nskewness and kurtosis for complex dynamical systems and identified two\npower-law regimes of non-Gaussianity, one of which scales with an exponent of 2\nand the other is with $4/3$. Finally the authors concluded that the observed\nrelation is a universal fact in complex dynamical systems. Here, we test the\nproposed universal relation between skewness and kurtosis with large number of\nsynthetic data and show that in fact it is not universal and originates only\ndue to the small number of data points in the data sets considered. The\nproposed relation is tested using two different non-Gaussian distributions,\nnamely $q$-Gaussian and Levy distributions. We clearly show that this relation\ndisappears for sufficiently large data sets provided that the second moment of\nthe distribution is finite. We find that, contrary to the claims of Cristelli\n\\textit{et al.} regarding a power-law scaling regime, kurtosis saturates to a\nsingle value, which is of course different from the Gaussian case ($K=3$), as\nthe number of data is increased. On the other hand, if the second moment of the\ndistribution is infinite, then the kurtosis seems to never converge to a single\nvalue. The converged kurtosis value for the finite second moment distributions\nand the number of data points needed to reach this value depend on the\ndeviation of the original distribution from the Gaussian case. We also argue\nthat the use of kurtosis to compare distributions to decide which one deviates\nfrom the Gaussian more can lead to incorrect results even for finite second\nmoment distributions for small data sets, whereas it is totally misleading for\ninfinite second moment distributions where the difference depends on $N$ for\nall finite $N$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 12:20:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Celikoglu", "Ahmet", ""], ["Tirnakli", "Ugur", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.2124", "submitter": "Robert G\\k{e}barowski", "authors": "Robert G\\k{e}barowski (1), Stanis{\\l}aw Dro\\.zd\\.z (1 and 2), Andrzej\n  Z.
