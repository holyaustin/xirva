The correlation matrices are calculated and the\ncorresponding Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) graphs are constructed for each of\nthose currencies used as reference for the remaining ones. It is shown that\nmultiplicity of the MST graphs' nodes to a good approximation develops a power\nlike, scale free distribution with the scaling exponent similar as for several\nother complex systems studied so far. Furthermore, quantitative arguments in\nfavor of the hierarchical organization of the world currency exchange network\nare provided by relating the structure of the above MST graphs and their\nscaling exponents to those that are derived from an exactly solvable\nhierarchical network model. A special status of the USD during the period\nconsidered can be attributed to some departures of the MST features, when this\ncurrency (or some other tied to it) is used as reference, from characteristics\ntypical to such a hierarchical clustering of nodes towards those that\ncorrespond to the random graphs. Even though in general the basic structure of\nthe MST is robust with respect to changing the reference currency some trace of\na systematic transition from somewhat dispersed -- like the USD case -- towards\nmore compact MST topology can be observed when correlations increase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Oct 2008 15:30:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gorski", "A.
