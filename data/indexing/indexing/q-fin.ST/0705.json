We investigate the role of common economic\nfactors in the market in the formation of stock networks, using the arbitrage\npricing model reflecting essential properties of common economic factors. We\nfind that the degree of consistency between real and model stock networks\nincreases as additional common economic factors are incorporated into our\nmodel. Furthermore, we find that individual stocks with a large number of links\nto other stocks in a network are more highly correlated with common economic\nfactors than those with a small number of links. This suggests that common\neconomic factors in the stock market can be understood in terms of\ndeterministic factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 06:24:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eom", "Cheoljun", ""], ["Oh", "Gabjin", ""], ["Kim", "Seunghwan", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.0503", "submitter": "Stefano M.

In this\napproximation, we show that all models of stochastic volatility should exhibit\na scaling relation in the time lag of zero-drift modified log-returns.
