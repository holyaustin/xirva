Analyzing the\nkinetic equation for the wealth distribution P(w,t), general properties are\nderived for arbitrary return distributions pi(kappa). If the geometrical\naverage of the gain is larger than one, i.e. if <ln eta> >0, in the long time\nlimit a nontrivial equilibrium wealth distribution P(w) is attained. Whenever\n<ln eta> <0, on the other hand, Wealth Condensation occurs, meaning that a\nsingle agent gets the whole wealth in the long run. This concentration\nphenomenon happens even if the average return <kappa> of the poor agent is\npositive. In the stable phase, P(w) behaves as w^{(T-1)} for w -> 0, and we\nfind T exactly. This exponent is nonzero in the stable phase but goes to zero\non approach to the condensation interface. The exact wealth distribution can be\nobtained analytically for the particular case of Kelly betting, and it turns\nout to be exponential. We show, however, that our model is never reversible, no\nmatter what pi(kappa) is. In the condensing phase, the wealth of an agent with\nrelative rank x is found to be w(x,t) \\sim e^{x t <ln eta>} for finite times t.\nThe wealth distribution is consequently P(w) \\sim 1/w for finite times, while\nall wealth ends up in the hands of a single agent for large times. Numerical\nsimulations are carried out, and found to satisfactorily compare with the above\nmentioned analytic results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Aug 2011 18:42:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Moukarzel", "Cristian F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1632", "submitter": "Bence T\\'oth", "authors": "Bence Toth, Imon Palit, Fabrizio Lillo, J.

We investigate this using order flow data from\nthe London Stock Exchange for which we have membership identifiers. By\nformulating models for herding and order splitting, as well as models for\nbrokerage choice, we are able to overcome the distortion introduced by\nbrokerage. On timescales of less than a few hours the persistence of order flow\nis overwhelmingly due to splitting rather than herding.
