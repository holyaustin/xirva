This model may be seen\nas a reflection of the idea that continuous technological progress alters the\ntrading environment over time. With new methodologies and a new measure of the\ndegree of market efficiency, we examine whether the US stock market evolves\nover time. In particular, a time-varying autoregressive (TV-AR) model is\nemployed. Our main findings are: (i) the US stock market has evolved over time\nand the degree of market efficiency has cyclical fluctuations with a\nconsiderably long periodicity, from 30 to 40 years; and (ii) the US stock\nmarket has been efficient with the exception of four times in our sample\nperiod: during the long-recession of 1873-1879; the recession of 1902-1904; the\nNew Deal era; and the recession of 1957-1958 and soon after it.

In non-stationary situations\nanalysis becomes very difficult and noise is a severe problem. Following a\nnatural urge to search for order in the system, we endeavor to define states\nthrough which systems pass and in which they remain for short times. Success in\nthis respect would allow to get a better understanding of the system and might\neven lead to methods for controlling the system in more efficient ways.\n  We here concentrate on financial markets because of the easy access we have\nto good data and because of the strong non-stationary effects recently seen.
