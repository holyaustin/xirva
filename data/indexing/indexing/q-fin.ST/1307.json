However, risk-based investors should be aware of four things.\nFirst, theoretical considerations and empirical studies show that apparently\ndictinct risk-based investment strategies are manifestations of a single\neffect. Second, turnover and associated transaction costs can be a substantial\ndrag on return. Third, capital diversification benefits may be reduced. Fourth,\nthere is an apparent connection between performance and risk diversification.\nTo analyze risk diversification benefits in a consistent way, we introduce the\nRisk Diversification Index (RDI) which measures risk concentrations and\ncomplements the Herfindahl-Herschman Index (HHI) for capital concentrations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 15:21:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 16:44:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Goldberg", "Lisa R.", ""], ["Mahmoud", "Ola", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.2014", "submitter": "Dariusz Grech", "authors": "Dariusz Grech and Grzegorz Pamu{\\l}a", "title": "On the multifractal effects generated by monofractal signals", "comments": "36 pages, 41 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2013.07.045", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study quantitatively the level of false multifractal signal one may\nencounter while analyzing multifractal phenomena in time series within\nmultifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA).
