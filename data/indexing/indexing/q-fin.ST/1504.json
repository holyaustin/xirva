The organization is determined by \"communities\" of units\nwhose dynamics, represented by time series of activity, is more strongly\ncorrelated internally than with the rest of the system. Recent studies have\nshown that the binary projections of various financial and neural time series\nexhibit nontrivial dynamical features that resemble those of the original data.\nThis implies that a significant piece of information is encoded into the binary\nprojection (i.e. the sign) of such increments. Here, we explore whether the\nbinary signatures of multiple time series can replicate the same complex\ncommunity organization of the financial market, as the original weighted time\nseries. We adopt a method that has been specifically designed to detect\ncommunities from cross-correlation matrices of time series data. Our analysis\nshows that the simpler binary representation leads to a community structure\nthat is almost identical with that obtained using the full weighted\nrepresentation. These results confirm that binary projections of financial time\nseries contain significant structural information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 15:33:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Almog", "Assaf", ""], ["Besamusca", "Ferry", ""], ["MacMahon", "Mel", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01811", "submitter": "Jun-Jie Chen", "authors": "Jun-Jie Chen, Lei Tan, Bo Zheng", "title": "Agent-based model with multi-level herding for complex financial systems", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Sci.
