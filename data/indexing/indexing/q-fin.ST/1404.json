In this case rank of portfolio covariance matrix is less than\nfull, hence solution is not unique. It is typically known as the ``ill-posed\"\nproblem. In this paper we discuss a Bayesian approach to regularize the\nproblem. One of the additional advantages of this approach is to analyze the\nsource of risk by estimating the probability of positive `conditional\ncontribution to total risk' (CCTR). Each source's CCTR would sum up to the\nportfolio's total volatility risk. Existing methods only estimate CCTR of a\nsource, and does not estimate the probability of CCTR to be significantly\ngreater (or less) than zero. This paper presents Bayesian methodology to do so.\nWe use a parallelizable and easy to use Monte Carlo (MC) approach to achieve\nour objective.
