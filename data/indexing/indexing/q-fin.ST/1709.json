This paper tests for market efficiency by studying the impact of\nglobal financial crisis of 2008 and the recent Chinese crisis of 2015 on stock\nmarket efficiency in emerging stock markets of China and India. The data for\nlast 20 years was collected from both Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE200) and the\nShanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and divided into four sub-periods, i.e.\nbefore financial crisis period (period-I), during recession (period-II), after\nrecession and before Chinese Crisis (periodIII) and from the start of Chinese\ncrisis till date (period- IV). Daily returns for the SSE and BSE were examined\nand tested for randomness using a combination of auto correlation tests, runs\ntests and unit root tests (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) for the entire sample\nperiod and the four sub-periods. The evidence from all these tests supports\nthat both the Indian and Chinese stock markets do not exhibit weak form of\nmarket efficiency. They do not follow random walk overall and in the first\nthree periods (1996 till the 2015) implying that recession did not impact the\nmarkets to a great extent, although the efficiency in percentage terms seems to\nbe increasing after the global financial crisis of 2008.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 21:05:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Malafeyev", "Oleg", ""], ["Awasthi", "Achal", ""], ["Kambekar", "Kaustubh S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05823", "submitter": "Filippo Petroni", "authors": "Guglielmo D'Amico and Filippo Petroni", "title": "A new approach to the modeling of financial volumes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the high frequency dynamic of financial volumes of\ntraded stocks by using a semi-Markov approach.
