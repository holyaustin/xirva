In this sense, it challenges the analysis of the nature of\nfinancial markets proposed by Fama and his associates. For this, a geometric\napproach is proposed in order to define the patterns of change of the market\nand a measure of multivariate kurtosis is used in order to test deviations from\nmultinormality. The emergence of crises can be measured in this framework,\nusing all the available information about the returns of the stocks under\nconsideration and not only the index representing the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 09:34:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ara\u00fajo", "Tanya", ""], ["Dias", "Jo\u00e3o", ""], ["Eleut\u00e9rio", "Samuel", ""], ["Lou\u00e7\u00e3", "Francisco", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1842", "submitter": "Akihiko Noda", "authors": "Akihiko Noda", "title": "A Test of the Adaptive Market Hypothesis using a Time-Varying AR Model\n  in Japan", "comments": "10 pages, 2 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Finance Research Letters 17 (2016) 66-71", "doi": "10.1016/j.frl.2016.01.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This study examines the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) in Japanese stock\nmarkets (TOPIX and TSE2).

In\nempirical studies, it has been found that gaps between the orders in the order\nbook lead to large price shifts and thereby to these heavy tails. We set up an\nagent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the\norder book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a\ndouble-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In\nsituations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not\nobserve fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap\nstructure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails. We show\nthat return distributions with heavy tails are an order-book effect if the\navailable liquidity is constrained. This is largely independent of the specific\ntrading strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 13:05:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitt", "Thilo A.", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["M\u00fcnnix", "Michael C.", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.3300", "submitter": "Rosario N.

First, we characterize the division of roles\nbetween borrowers and lenders in long-run relations by providing evidence on\nnetwork formation at a yearly frequency. Second, we identify the 'key players'\nin the marketplace and study their behaviour. Key players are 'locally-central\nbanks' within a network that lend (or borrow) large volumes to (from) several\ncounterparties, while borrowing (or lending) small volumes from (to) a small\nnumber of institutions. Our results are twofold. We show that the aggregate\ntrading patterns in e-Mid are characterized by largely asymmetric relations.\nThis implies a clear division of roles between lenders and borrowers. Second,\nthe key players do not exploit their position of network leaders by imposing\nopportunistic pricing policies.
