The results indicate that, first, the\ntwo-regime MRS-GARCH model beats other three single-regime GARCH type models in\nin-sample data estimation under most evaluation criteria, although it appears\ninferior under a few of other evaluation criteria. Second, the two-regime\nMRS-GARCH model overall provides more accurate volatility forecast for daily\ndata but this superiority dies way for weekly and monthly data. Third, among\nthe three single-regime GARCH type models, the volatility forecast of the\nnonlinear GARCH models exhibit greater accuracy than the linear GARCH model for\ndaily data at longer time horizons. Finally, the linear single-regime GARCH\nmodel overall performs better than other three nonlinear GARCH type models in\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) forecast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Dec 2015 15:15:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yue-Jun", ""], ["Yao", "Ting", ""], ["He", "Ling-Yun", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01905", "submitter": "Bill Rea", "authors": "Hannah Cheng Juan Zhan, William Rea, Alethea Rea", "title": "A Comparision of Three Network Portfolio Selection Methods -- Evidence\n  from the Dow Jones", "comments": "39 pages, 13 tables, 19 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We compare three network portfolio selection methods; hierarchical clustering\ntrees, minimum spanning trees and neighbor-Nets, with random and industry group\nselection methods on twelve years of data from the 30 Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage stocks from 2001 to 2013 for very small private investor sized\nportfolios.
