We focus our attention on the\nfirst-order autoregressive process where the driven noise is also given by a\nfirst-order autoregressive process. We establish the almost sure convergence\nand the asymptotic normality for both the least squares estimator of the\nunknown parameter of the autoregressive process as well as for the serial\ncorrelation estimator associated to the driven noise. In addition, the almost\nsure rates of convergence of our estimates are also provided. It allows us to\nestablish the almost sure convergence and the asymptotic normality for the\nDurbin-Watson statistic. Finally, we propose a new bilateral statistical test\nfor residual autocorrelation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Apr 2011 17:53:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bercu", "Bernard", ""], ["Proia", "Frederic", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.3616", "submitter": "Wei-Xing Zhou", "authors": "Wei-Xing Zhou (ECUST), Guo-Hua Mu (ECUST), Wei Chen (SZSE), Didier\n  Sornette (ETH Zurich)", "title": "Strategies used as spectroscopy of financial markets reveal new stylized\n  facts", "comments": "13 pages including 5 figures and 1 table", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 6 (9), e24391 (2011)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0024391", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new set of stylized facts quantifying the structure of financial\nmarkets.

We study the detailed order\nflow on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of China for the whole year of 2003. This\nenormous dataset allows us to compare (i) a closed national market (A-shares)\nwith an international market (B-shares), (ii) individuals and institutions and\n(iii) real investors to random strategies with respect to timing that share\notherwise all other characteristics. We find that more trading results in\nsmaller net return due to trading frictions. We unveiled quantitative power\nlaws with non-trivial exponents, that quantify the deterioration of performance\nwith frequency and with holding period of the strategies used by investors.\nRandom strategies are found to perform much better than real ones, both for\nwinners and losers. Surprising large arbitrage opportunities exist, especially\nwhen using zero-intelligence strategies.

Our approach is inspired by the\ncontemporary movements in the string theory. The string map of data is defined\nhere by the boundary conditions, characteristic length, real valued and the\nmethod of redistribution of information. As a practical matter, this map\nrepresents the detrending and data standardization procedure. We introduced\nmaps onto 1-end-point and 2-end-point open strings that satisfy the Dirichlet\nand Neumann boundary conditions. The questions of the choice of\nextra-dimensions, symmetries, duality and ways to the partial compactification\nare discussed. Subsequently, we pass to higher dimensional and more complex\nobjects. The 2D-Brane was suggested which incorporated bid-ask spreads.\nPolarization by the spread was considered which admitted analyzing arbitrage\nopportunities on the market where transaction costs are taken into account. The\nmodel of the rotating string which naturally yields calculation of angular\nmomentum is suitable for tracking of several currency pairs. The systematic way\nwhich allows one suggest more structured maps suitable for a simultaneous study\nof several currency pairs was analyzed by means of the G\\^{a}teaux generalized\ndifferential calculus. The effect of the string and brane maps on test data was\nstudied by comparing their mean statistical characteristics. The study revealed\nnotable differences between topologies. We review the dependence on the\ncharacteristic string length, mean fluctuations and properties of the\nintra-string statistics.
