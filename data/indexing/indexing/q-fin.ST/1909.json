In this work, we concentrate on the prediction\nof individual stock prices in the Japanese Nikkei 225 market over a period of\nroughly 20 years. For the knowledge graph, we use the Nikkei Value Search data,\nwhich is a rich dataset showing mainly supplier relations among Japanese and\nforeign companies. Our preliminary results show a 29.5% increase and a 2.2-fold\nincrease in the return ratio and Sharpe ratio, respectively, when compared to\nthe market benchmark, as well as a 6.32% increase and 1.3-fold increase,\nrespectively, compared to the baseline LSTM model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 00:19:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Sep 2019 23:47:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2019 23:49:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Matsunaga", "Daiki", ""], ["Suzumura", "Toyotaro", ""], ["Takahashi", "Toshihiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.10679", "submitter": "Kok Haur Ng", "authors": "C.Y.Tan, Y.B.Koh, K.H.Ng and K.H.Ng", "title": "Structural Change Analysis of Active Cryptocurrency Market", "comments": "18 pages, 6 figures and 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST econ.EM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Structural Change Analysis of Active Cryptocurrency Market\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Sep 2019 02:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "C.

Non-deliverable-forwards (NDF), a derivatives contract used in\nforeign exchange (FX) trading, presents additional difficulty in the form of\nlong-term planning required for an effective selection of start and end date of\nthe contract. In this work, we focus on tackling the problem of NDF tenor\nselection by leveraging high-dimensional sequential data consisting of spot\nrates, technical indicators and expert tenor patterns. To this end, we\nconstruct a dataset from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) NDF\ndata that includes a comprehensive list of NDF volumes and daily spot rates for\n64 FX pairs. We introduce WaveATTentionNet (WATTNet), a novel temporal\nconvolution (TCN) model for spatio-temporal modeling of highly multivariate\ntime series, and validate it across NDF markets with varying degrees of\ndissimilarity between the training and test periods in terms of volatility and\ngeneral market regimes. The proposed method achieves a significant positive\nreturn on investment (ROI) in all NDF markets under analysis, outperforming\nrecurrent and classical baselines by a wide margin.

Financial institutions are the front line in the\nwar against financial crime and accordingly, must devote substantial human and\ntechnology resources to this effort. Current processes to detect financial\nmisconduct have limitations in their ability to effectively differentiate\nbetween malicious behavior and ordinary financial activity. These limitations\ntend to result in gross over-reporting of suspicious activity that necessitate\ntime-intensive and costly manual review. Advances in technology used in this\ndomain, including machine learning based approaches, can improve upon the\neffectiveness of financial institutions' existing processes, however, a key\nchallenge that most financial institutions continue to face is that they\naddress financial crimes in isolation without any insight from other firms.\nWhere financial institutions address financial crimes through the lens of their\nown firm, perpetrators may devise sophisticated strategies that may span across\ninstitutions and geographies. Financial institutions continue to work\nrelentlessly to advance their capabilities, forming partnerships across\ninstitutions to share insights, patterns and capabilities. These public-private\npartnerships are subject to stringent regulatory and data privacy requirements,\nthereby making it difficult to rely on traditional technology solutions. In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to share key information across\ninstitutions by using a federated graph learning platform that enables us to\nbuild more accurate machine learning models by leveraging federated learning\nand also graph learning approaches. We demonstrated that our federated model\noutperforms local model by 20% with the UK FCA TechSprint data set.
