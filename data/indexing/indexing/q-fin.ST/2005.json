Therefore, we take a novel, advanced approach to the problem. A\nprobabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is\nperformed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a\nrealistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch.\nA generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the\nassumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture\nof the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is\nestimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We\nmodel the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive\nand no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and\naccounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample\ncharacteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window\nforecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several\nbenchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and\nsignificance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the\nGerman Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 hours of trading, but the\napproach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in\nEurope. The results prove superiority of the mixture model over the benchmarks\ngaining the most from the modelling of the volatility. They also indicate that\nthe introduction of XBID reduced the market volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2020 10:21:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2020 11:46:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 29 Aug 2020 13:12:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Narajewski", "Micha\u0142", ""], ["Ziel", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.02351", "submitter": "Jorgen Vitting Andersen", "authors": "Naji Massad and J{\\o}rgen Vitting Andersen", "title": "Defining an intrinsic stickiness parameter of stock price returns", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Physica A (2020)", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2020.124464", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a non linear pricing model of individual stock returns that\ndefines a stickiness parameter of the returns.

However, its original formal definition is difficult to\napply. Our approach has been to define and test a much simpler measure of\nantifragility for complex systems. In this work we use our antifragility\nmeasure to analyze real data from the stock market and cryptocurrency prices.\nResults vary between different antifragility interpretations and for each\nsystem. Our results suggest that the stock market favors robustness rather than\nantifragility, as in most cases the highest and lowest antifragility values are\nreached either by young agents or constant ones. There are no clear\ncorrelations between antifragility and different good-performance measures,\nwhile the best performers seem to fall within a robust threshold. In the case\nof cryptocurrencies, there is an apparent correlation between high price and\nhigh antifragility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 20:49:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2020 04:55:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Alatorre", "Dar\u00edo", ""], ["Gershenson", "Carlos", ""], ["Mateos", "Jos\u00e9 L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13417", "submitter": "Tim Janke", "authors": "Tim Janke and Florian Steinke", "title": "Probabilistic multivariate electricity price forecasting using implicit\n  generative ensemble post-processing", "comments": "To be presented at the 16th International Conference on Probabilistic\n  Methods Applied to Power Systems 2020 (PMAPS 2020)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/PMAPS47429.2020.9183687", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP econ.EM q-fin.RM q-fin.ST stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The reliable estimation of forecast uncertainties is crucial for\nrisk-sensitive optimal decision making. In this paper, we propose implicit\ngenerative ensemble post-processing, a novel framework for multivariate\nprobabilistic electricity price forecasting. We use a likelihood-free implicit\ngenerative model based on an ensemble of point forecasting models to generate\nmultivariate electricity price scenarios with a coherent dependency structure\nas a representation of the joint predictive distribution. Our ensemble\npost-processing method outperforms well-established model combination\nbenchmarks. This is demonstrated on a data set from the German day-ahead\nmarket. As our method works on top of an ensemble of domain-specific expert\nmodels, it can readily be deployed to other forecasting tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 15:22:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Janke", "Tim", ""], ["Steinke", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13974", "submitter": "Can Yang", "authors": "Can Yang, Junjie Zhai, Helong Li", "title": "On the Bound of Cumulative Return in Trading Series and the Verification\n  Using Technical Trading Rules", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.CE stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although there is a wide use of technical trading rules in stock markets, the\nprofitability of them still remains controversial.
