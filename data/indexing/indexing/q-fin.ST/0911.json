We investigate the\ndynamics of order cancelation by studying the statistical properties of\ninter-cancelation durations defined as the waiting times between consecutive\norder cancelations of 22 liquid stocks traded on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange of\nChina in year 2003. Three types of cancelations are considered including\ncancelation of any limit orders, of buy limit orders and of sell limit orders.\nWe find that the distributions of the inter-cancelation durations of individual\nstocks can be well modeled by Weibulls for each type of cancelation and the\ndistributions of rescaled durations of each type of cancelations exhibit a\nscaling behavior for different stocks. Complex intraday patterns are also\nunveiled in the inter-cancelation durations. The detrended fluctuation analysis\n(DFA) and the multifractal DFA show that the inter-cancelation durations\npossess long-term memory and multifractal nature, which are not influenced by\nthe intraday patterns. No clear crossover phenomenon is observed in the\ndetrended fluctuation functions with respect to the time scale. These findings\nindicate that the cancelation of limit orders is a non-Poisson process, which\nhas potential worth in the construction of order-driven market models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2009 05:12:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Ni", "Xiao-Hui", "", "ECUST"], ["Jiang", "Zhi-Qiang", "", "ECUST"], ["Gu", "Gao-Feng", "", "ECUST"], ["Ren", "Fei", "", "ECUST"], ["Chen", "Wei", "", "SZSE"], ["Zhou", "Wei-Xing", "", "ECUST"]]}, {"id": "0911.0454", "submitter": "Ryan Woodard", "authors": "Didier Sornette, Ryan Woodard, Maxim Fedorovsky, Stefan Reimann,\n  Hilary Woodard, Wei-Xing Zhou (The Financial Crisis Observatory)", "title": "The Financial Bubble Experiment: advanced diagnostics and forecasts of\n  bubble terminations", "comments": "20100514: Added final analysis and summary, including names of\n  assets.", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  On 2 November 2009, the Financial Bubble Experiment was launched within the\nFinancial Crisis Observatory (FCO) at ETH Zurich\n(\\url{http://www.er.ethz.ch/fco/}).

Developed to evaluate the\nrisk of hedge funds, the SVaR appears to be applicable to a wide range of\ninvestments. Its principle is to use the fairly short and sparse history of the\nhedge fund returns to identify relevant risk factors among a very broad set of\npossible risk sources. This risk profile is obtained by calibrating a\ncollection of nonlinear single-factor models as opposed to a single\nmulti-factor model. We then use the risk profile and the very long and rich\nhistory of the factors to asses the possible impact of known past crises on the\nfunds, unveiling their hidden risks and so called \"black swans\".\n  In backtests using data of 1060 hedge funds we demonstrate that the SVaR has\nbetter or comparable properties than several common VaR measures - shows less\nVaR exceptions and, perhaps even more importantly, in case of an exception, by\nsmaller amounts.\n  The ultimate test of the StressVaR however, is in its usage as a fund\nallocating tool. By simulating a realistic investment in a portfolio of hedge\nfunds, we show that the portfolio constructed using the StressVaR on average\noutperforms both the market and the portfolios constructed using common VaR\nmeasures.\n  For the period from Feb. 2003 to June 2009, the StressVaR constructed\nportfolio outperforms the market by about 6% annually, and on average the\ncompeting VaR measures by around 3%. The performance numbers from Aug. 2007 to\nJune 2009 are even more impressive. The SVaR portfolio outperforms the market\nby 20%, and the best competing measure by 4%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2009 13:05:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Coste", "Cyril", ""], ["Douady", "Raphael", ""], ["Zovko", "Ilija I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.4207", "submitter": "Rafael S.

In addition, our analysis reveals evidences for complex\nsectorial structures, as well as nonlinear amplification in the propagating\nvolatility shocks. From a perspective relevant to public policy, our study\nsuggests an endogeneous sectorial dynamics during the mid-2003 economic\nrecovery, in contrast to strong exogeneous driving by Federal Reserve interest\nrate cuts during the mid-2007 onset.
