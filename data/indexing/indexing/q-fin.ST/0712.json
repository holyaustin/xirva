The Hurst\nexponent was used as the measurement of the degree of efficiency, and the hit\nrate calculated from the nearest-neighbor prediction method was used for the\nprediction of the directions of future price changes. We used 60 market indexes\nof various countries. We empirically discovered that the relationship between\nthe degree of efficiency (the Hurst exponent) and the predictability (the hit\nrate) is strongly positive. That is, a market index with a higher Hurst\nexponent tends to have a higher hit rate. These results suggested that the\nHurst exponent is useful for predicting future price changes. Furthermore, we\nalso discovered that the Hurst exponent and the hit rate are useful as\nstandards that can distinguish emerging capital markets from mature capital\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2007 01:03:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eom", "Cheoljun", ""], ["Choi", "Sunghoon", ""], ["Oh", "Gabjin", ""], ["Jung", "Woo-Sung", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.3537", "submitter": "Emmanuel Gobet", "authors": "Gr\\'egory Benmenzer (LJK), Emmanuel Gobet (LJK), C\\'eline J\\'erusalem\n  (LJK)", "title": "Arbitrage free cointegrated models in gas and oil future markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this article we present a continuous time model for natural gas and crude\noil future prices. Its main feature is the possibility to link both energies in\nthe long term and in the short term. For each energy, the future returns are\nrepresented as the sum of volatility functions driven by motions. Under the\nrisk neutral probability, the motions of both energies are correlated Brownian\nmotions while under the historical probability, they are cointegrated by a\nVectorial Error Correction Model. Our approach is equivalent to defining the\nmarket price of risk. This model is free of arbitrage: thus, it can be used for\nrisk management as well for option pricing issues.
