Both are complex markets where many internal and external\nfactors interact at each instant to determine the transaction price.

Our model repairs this deficit by\nassuming that the random shocks to volatility are heavy-tailed and correlated\ncross-sectionally, both with each other and with returns. The fundamental\nconclusion of our analysis is that great care is needed in modeling volatility\nif one wishes to characterize the relationship between volatility and contagion\nthat is predicted by economic theory.\n  In analyzing daily data, we find evidence for significant contagion effects\nduring the major EU crisis periods of May 2010 and August 2011, where contagion\nis defined as excess correlation in the residuals from a factor model\nincorporating global and regional market risk factors. Some of this excess\ncorrelation can be explained by quantifying the impact of shocks to aggregate\nvolatility in the cross-section of expected returns - but only, it turns out,\nif one is extremely careful in accounting for the explosive nature of these\nshocks. We show that global markets have time-varying cross-sectional\nsensitivities to these shocks, and that high sensitivities strongly predict\nperiods of financial crisis.
