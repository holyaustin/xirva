Our\nmain goal is to link performance and the stochastic process of the traded\nasset. Our study reports short, medium and long term effects by looking at the\nSharpe ratio (SR). We calculate the Sharpe ratio of our trading rule as a\nfunction of the probability distribution function of the underlying traded\nasset and compare it with data. We show that if the performance is mainly due\nto presence of autocorrelation in the returns of the traded assets, the SR as a\nfunction of the portfolio formation period (look-back) is very different from\nperformance due to the drift (average return). The SR shows that for look-back\nperiods of a few months the investor is more likely to tap into\nautocorrelation. However, for look-back larger than few months, the drift of\nthe asset becomes progressively more important. Finally, our empirical work\nreports a new long-term effect, namely oscillation of the SR and propose a\nnon-stationary model to account for such oscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2019 14:42:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ferreira", "Fernando F.", ""], ["Silva", "A.

The novelty of our\nwork is twofold. First, we take into account the difference between price and\ntotal returns (in other words, between market size and wealth processes).\nSecond, we work with actual market data. We study the long-term properties of\nthis system of equations, and reproduce observed linearity of the capital\ndistribution curve. Our model has two modifications: for price returns and for\nequity premium. Somewhat surprisingly, they exhibit the same fit, with very\nsimilar coefficients.
