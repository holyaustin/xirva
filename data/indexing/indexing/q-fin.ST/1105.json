In\nthis paper, we make two contributions to the learning literature. First, we\nintroduce a new filtering method, the state-observation sampling (SOS) filter,\nfor general state-space models with intractable observation densities. Second,\nwe develop an indirect inference-based estimator for a large class of\nincomplete-information economies. We demonstrate the good performance of these\ntechniques on an asset pricing model with investor learning applied to over 80\nyears of daily equity returns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 May 2011 14:49:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Calvet", "Laurent E.", ""], ["Czellar", "Veronika", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.4789", "submitter": "Alex Langnau", "authors": "Alex Langnau, Yanko Punchev", "title": "Stochastic Price Dynamics Implied By the Limit Order Book", "comments": "Limit order book, limit orders, volatility smile, jump process,\n  double-exponential jump process, impatience rate, jump diffusion", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we present a novel approach to the determination of fat tails\nin financial data by studying the information contained in the limit order\nbook.

We extend the multi-factor long-short model in Schwartz and Smith\n(2000) and Yan (2002) in two important aspects: firstly we allow for both the\nlong and short term dynamic factors to be mean reverting incorporating\nstochastic volatility factors and secondly we develop an additive structural\nseasonality model. Then a Milstein discretized non-linear stochastic volatility\nstate space representation for the model is developed which allows for futures\nand options contracts in the observation equation. We then develop numerical\nmethodology based on an advanced Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm utilising\nParticle Markov chain Monte Carlo to perform calibration of the model jointly\nwith the filtering of the latent processes for the long-short dynamics and\nvolatility factors. In this regard we explore and develop a novel methodology\nbased on an adaptive Rao-Blackwellised version of the Particle Markov chain\nMonte Carlo methodology. In doing this we deal accurately with the\nnon-linearities in the state-space model which are therefore introduced into\nthe filtering framework.
