With the advance of technology, however, markets have become more\nsophisticated. To determine whether this has resulted in an improved market\nefficiency, we investigate whether statistically significant lagged correlation\nrelationships exist in financial markets. We introduce a numerical method to\nstatistically validate links in correlation-based networks, and employ our\nmethod to study lagged correlation networks of equity returns in financial\nmarkets. Crucially, our statistical validation of lead-lag relationships\naccounts for multiple hypothesis testing over all stock pairs. In an analysis\nof intraday transaction data from the periods 2002--2003 and 2011--2012, we\nfind a striking growth in the networks as we increase the frequency with which\nwe sample returns. We compute how the number of validated links and the\nmagnitude of correlations change with increasing sampling frequency, and\ncompare the results between the two data sets. Finally, we compare topological\nproperties of the directed correlation-based networks from the two periods\nusing the in-degree and out-degree distributions and an analysis of three-node\nmotifs. Our analysis suggests a growth in both the efficiency and instability\nof financial markets over the past decade.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 16:04:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Curme", "Chester", ""], ["Tumminello", "Michele", ""], ["Mantegna", "Rosario N.", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

In fact it's common for\neconophysicists to estimate maximal Lyapunov exponent for log returns of a\ngiven financial asset to confirm that prices behave chaotically. Chaotic\nbehaviour is only displayed by dynamical systems which are either non-linear or\ninfinite-dimensional.

The origin of the macroeconomic\ndynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital\nof the wealthiest investors. - Economic cycles consist of a Schumpeter\n'creative destruction' pattern whereby the maxima are cusp-shaped while the\nminima are smooth. In between the cusps, the cycle consists of the sum of 2\n'crossing exponentials': one decaying and the other increasing.\n  This unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market\nfluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine\nconceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics. Joining another giant\nof contemporary science - Phil Anderson - Aoki emphasized the role of rare,\nlarge fluctuations in the emergence of macroeconomic phenomena out of\nmicroscopic interactions and in particular their non self-averaging, in the\nlanguage of statistical physics. In this light, we present a simple stochastic\nmulti-sector growth model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:49:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Solomon", "Sorin", ""], ["Golo", "Natasa", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8106", "submitter": "Stanislav Borysov S", "authors": "Stanislav S.

We consider the cross-correlation functions averaged over all\nstocks, using 71 stock prices from the Standard \\& Poor's 500 index for\n1994--2013. We focus on the behavior of the cross-correlations at the times of\nfinancial crises with significant jumps of market volatility. The observed\nhistorical dynamics showed that the dependence between the risks was almost\nlinear during the US stock market downturn of 2002 and after the US housing\nbubble in 2007, remaining on that level until 2013. Moreover, the averaged\ncross-correlation function often had an asymmetric shape with respect to zero\nlag in the periods of high correlation. We develop the analysis by the\napplication of the linear response formalism to study underlying causal\nrelations. The calculated response functions suggest the presence of\ncharacteristic regimes near financial crashes, when the volatility of an\nindividual stock follows the market volatility and vice versa.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 09:52:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2014 09:18:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Jul 2014 12:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Borysov", "Stanislav S.", ""], ["Balatsky", "Alexander V.", ""]]}]
