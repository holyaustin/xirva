With an\nincreasing number of companies making expansion overseas to capitalize on\nforeign resources, a multinational corporate bankruptcy can disrupt the world's\nfinancial ecosystem. Corporations do not fail instantaneously; objective\nmeasures and rigorous analysis of qualitative (e.g. brand) and quantitative\n(e.g. econometric factors) data can help identify a company's financial risk.\nGathering and storage of data about a corporation has become less difficult\nwith recent advancements in communication and information technologies. The\nremaining challenge lies in mining relevant information about a company's\nhealth hidden under the vast amounts of data, and using it to forecast\ninsolvency so that managers and stakeholders have time to react. In recent\nyears, machine learning has become a popular field in big data analytics\nbecause of its success in learning complicated models. Methods such as support\nvector machines, adaptive boosting, artificial neural networks, and Gaussian\nprocesses can be used for recognizing patterns in the data (with a high degree\nof accuracy) that may not be apparent to human analysts. This thesis studied\ncorporate bankruptcy of manufacturing companies in Korea and Poland using\nexperts' opinions and financial measures, respectively. Using publicly\navailable datasets, several machine learning methods were applied to learn the\nrelationship between the company's current state and its fate in the near\nfuture. Results showed that predictions with accuracy greater than 95% were\nachievable using any machine learning technique when informative features like\nexperts' assessment were used.

Among others,1) it helps assess the\nsample size needed to establish a comparative $n$ needed for statistical\nsignificance, 2) allows practical comparisons across classes of fat-tailed\ndistributions, 3) helps understand some inconsistent attributes of the\nlognormal, pending on the parametrization of its scale parameter. The\nliterature is rich for what concerns asymptotic behavior, but there is a large\nvoid for finite values of $n$, those needed for operational purposes.\nConventional measures of fat-tailedness, namely 1) the tail index for the power\nlaw class, and 2) Kurtosis for finite moment distributions fail to apply to\nsome distributions, and do not allow comparisons across classes and\nparametrization, that is between power laws outside the Levy-Stable basin, or\npower laws to distributions in other classes, or power laws for different\nnumber of summands. How can one compare a sum of 100 Student T distributed\nrandom variables with 3 degrees of freedom to one in a Levy-Stable or a\nLognormal class? How can one compare a sum of 100 Student T with 3 degrees of\nfreedom to a single Student T with 2 degrees of freedom? We propose an\noperational and heuristic measure that allow us to compare $n$-summed\nindependent variables under all distributions with finite first moment. The\nmethod is based on the rate of convergence of the Law of Large numbers for\nfinite sums, $n$-summands specifically. We get either explicit expressions or\nsimulation results and bounds for the lognormal, exponential, Pareto, and the\nStudent T distributions in their various calibrations --in addition to the\ngeneral Pearson classes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Feb 2018 11:57:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2018 15:24:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Nov 2018 15:21:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Taleb", "Nassim Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.06520", "submitter": "Jeonggyu Huh", "authors": "Jeonggyu Huh", "title": "Pricing Options with Exponential Levy Neural Network", "comments": "18 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose the exponential Levy neural network (ELNN) for\noption pricing, which is a new non-parametric exponential Levy model using\nartificial neural networks (ANN).
