This empirical observation, known as the Equity Premium Puzzle, has\nbeen defying mainstream economics ever since. The recent financial crisis\nrevealed an even deeper need for understanding financial products. We show how\nunderstanding the rational nature of product design resolves the Equity Premium\nPuzzle. In doing so we obtain an experimentally tested theory of product\ndesign.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 15:59:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:07:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:04:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 22:39:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 15:26:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 11 Dec 2016 23:05:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 28 May 2017 07:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sun, 18 Mar 2018 11:02:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Mon, 28 May 2018 14:16:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 11:25:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Soklakov", "Andrei N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07219", "submitter": "Andrei Soklakov N", "authors": "Andrei N.
