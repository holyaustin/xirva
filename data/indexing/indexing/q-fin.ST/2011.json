One particular question that often arises as a barrier to\nadopting deep learning for financial services is whether the developed\nfinancial deep learning models are fair in their predictions, particularly in\nlight of strong governance and regulatory compliance requirements in the\nfinancial services industry. A fundamental aspect of fairness that has not been\nexplored in financial deep learning is the concept of trust, whose variations\nmay point to an egocentric view of fairness and thus provide insights into the\nfairness of models. In this study we explore the feasibility and utility of a\nmulti-scale trust quantification strategy to gain insights into the fairness of\na financial deep learning model, particularly under different scenarios at\ndifferent scales.

As we move from\nhigh-frequency time scales, when individual trade and quote events occur, to\nthe mesoscales when correlations emerge in ways that can conform to various\nlatent models; it remains unclear what choice of time and sampling rates are\nappropriate to faithfully capture system dynamics and asset correlations for\ndecision making. The Epps effect is the key phenomenology that couples the\nemergence of correlations to the choice of sampling time scales. Here we\nconsider and compare the Epps effect under different sampling schemes in order\nto contrast three choices of time: calendar time, volume time and trade time.\nUsing a toy model based on a Hawkes process, we are able to achieve simulation\nresults that conform well with empirical dynamics. Concretely, we find that the\nEpps effect is present under all three definitions of time and that\ncorrelations emerge faster under trade time compared to calendar time, whereas\ncorrelations emerge linearly under volume time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:53:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Patrick", ""], ["Pienaar", "Etienne", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.12291", "submitter": "Matthew Tomlinson", "authors": "Matthew F.

While there is plenty of evidence indicating and\nquantifying the efficiency of stock markets, most studies assume this\nefficiency to be constant over time so that its dynamical and collective\naspects remain poorly understood. Here we define the time-varying efficiency of\nstock markets by calculating the permutation entropy within sliding\ntime-windows of log-returns of stock market indices. We show that major world\nstock markets can be hierarchically classified into several groups that display\nsimilar long-term efficiency profiles. However, we also show that efficiency\nranks and clusters of markets with similar trends are only stable for a few\nmonths at a time. We thus propose a network representation of stock markets\nthat aggregates their short-term efficiency patterns into a global and coherent\npicture. We find this financial network to be strongly entangled while also\nhaving a modular structure that consists of two distinct groups of stock\nmarkets. Our results suggest that stock market efficiency is a collective\nphenomenon that can drive its operation at a high level of informational\nefficiency, but also places the entire system under risk of failure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 14:06:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Alves", "Luiz G.
