It is well-known that\nmalignant tumors induce the formation of a lymphatic and a blood vascular\nnetwork around themselves. A similar but far less studied process occurs in\nrelation to the nervous system and is referred to as \\emph{neoneurogenesis}; in\nfact, recent studies have demonstrated that tumors initiate their own\ninnervation. However, the relationship between tumor progression and the\nnervous system is still poorly understood. This process is most likely\nregulated by a multitude of factors in the tumor-nerve microenvironment and it\nis therefore important to study the interactions between the nervous system and\ntumor cells through mathematical/computational modelling: this may reveal the\nmost significant factors of the plethora of interacting elements regulating\nneoneurogenesis. The present work is a first attempt to model the\nneurobiological aspect of cancer development through a (simple) system of\ndifferential equations. The model confirms the experimental observations that a\ntumor is able to promote nerve formation/elongation around itself, and that\nhigh levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and axon guidance molecules (AGMs) are\nrecorded in the presence of a tumor. Our results also reflect the observation\nthat high stress levels (represented by higher norepinephrine release by\nsympathetic nerves) contribute to tumor development and spread, indicating a\nmutually beneficial relationship between tumor cells and neurons.

There are three types of senile cataract:\ncortical cataract, nuclear cataract, and posterior/anterior sub-capsular\ncataract. The most common senile cataract is cortical cataract. For\nunderstanding cortical cataract, the pathology and the causing factors in\ncortical cataract are analyzed. The clouding change in senile cortical cataract\nbegins from the edge of the lens and develops progressively to lens centre. The\npathology of clouding change in cortical cataract is characterized by\ndisruption of some lens fibers, swelling of some other fibers, and deposition\nof water between fibers. Based on the property of a lens fiber, we propose here\na hypothesis on the mechanism of development of senile cortical cataract. I.\nCortical cataract is triggered by disruption of a cortical lens fiber as a\nresult of injury. The disrupted fiber will release water and crystallin\nproteins. II. Neighbor fibers can absorb this water due to high intracellular\nosmotic pressure (IOP) and become swollen. Swelling makes a fiber be stiff and\nhave increased risk to disrupt when it is curved during the accommodation of\nthe lens. These fibers will release water again when they disrupt, and the\nwater will make more local fibers swelling. In this way, the local fibers\nbecome swollen and then disrupt successively. III. The successive swellings and\ndisruptions of local fibers result in enlargement of a clouding change in lens.\nSince the fibers on the outer part of lens cortex have higher risk to be\ninjured than that in the inner part, a clouding change starts from the edge of\nthe lens. In conclusion, the progressive development of senile cortical\ncataract is a result of successive swellings and disruptions of local lens\nfibers, and this is driven by the high IOP in a lens fiber.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 09:23:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 11:07:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", ""], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.05495", "submitter": "Oliver Gould Mr", "authors": "Oliver Gould, Amy Smart, Norman Ratcliffe, Ben de Lacy Costello", "title": "Canine Olfactory Differentiation of Cancer: A Review of the Literature", "comments": "Total of 23 pages including citations, with 1 embedded table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Numerous studies have attempted to demonstrate the olfactory ability of\ncanines to detect several common cancer types from human bodily fluids, breath\nand tissue.
