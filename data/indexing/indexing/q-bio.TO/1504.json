The model was based on continuum theory\nfor fibre-reinforced composite materials. Here we simulated contractions for an\nidealized medial gastrocnemius muscle in man, using the model. Simulations were\nperformed to test the force-length relation of the whole muscle, to evaluate\nthe changes in internal fascicle geometry during contractions, and to assess\nthe importance of material formulations for the aponeurosis and tendon. The\nsimulation results were compared to previously published experimental values.\nThe force-length profile for the whole muscle showed a realistic profile. As\nthe muscle contracted the fascicles curved into S-shaped trajectories and\ncurled around 3D paths, both of which matched previous experimental findings.\nAs the fascicles shortened they increased in their cross-sectional area, but\nthis increase was asymmetric with the smaller increase occurring within the\nfascicle-plane: the Poisson's ratio in this plane matched that previously shown\nfrom ultrasound imaging. The distribution of strains in the aponeurosis and\ntendon was shown to be a function of their material properties. This study\ndemonstrated that the model could replicate realistic patterns of whole\nmuscle-force, and changes to the internal muscle geometry, and so will be\nuseful for testing mechanisms that affect the structural changes within\ncontracting muscle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 23:16:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Rahemi", "Hadi", ""], ["Nigam", "Nilima", ""], ["Wakeling", "James M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.00698", "submitter": "Richard McMurtrey", "authors": "Richard J.

These diagnoses have devastating consequences on millions of\npeople each year, and yet there are currently no therapies or interventions\nthat can repair the structure of neural circuits and restore neural tissue\nfunction in the brain and spinal cord. Despite the challenges of overcoming\nthese limitations, there are many new approaches under development that hold\nmuch promise. Neural tissue engineering aims to restore and influence the\nfunction of damaged or diseased neural tissue generally through the use of stem\ncells and biomaterials. In this paper, several new 3D tissue constructs and\ndesigns are described for functional reconstruction of neural architecture.\nWith the use of induced pluripotent stem cells or induced neuronal cells, these\n3D constructs could then be studied as regional models of the central nervous\nsystem or could one day be implemented as autologous grafts into damaged sites\nof the nervous system in order to restore neural function, particularly for\ndamaged sites of spinal cord, areas of stroke infarction, tumor resection\nsites, peripheral nerve injuries, or areas of neurodegeneration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 21:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["McMurtrey", "Richard J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.00888", "submitter": "Caterina La Porta AM", "authors": "Caterina A.M.

Besides the established two-stage model with clonal expansion, models\nwith three mutation stages as well as a model with two distinct pathways to\ncancer are studied. The results suggest that three-stage models offer an\nimproved description of the data. The best-fitting models point to a mechanism\nwhere radiation increases the rate of clonal expansion. This is interpreted in\nterms of changes in cell-cycle control mediated by bystander signaling or\nrepopulation following cell killing. No statistical evidence for a two-pathway\nmodel is found. To elucidate the implications of the different models for\nradiation risk, several exposure scenarios are studied. Models with a radiation\neffect at an early stage show a delayed response and a pronounced drop-off with\nolder ages at exposure. Moreover, the dose-response relationship is strongly\nnonlinear for all three-stage models, revealing a marked increase above a\ncritical dose.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 09:58:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Z\u00f6llner", "Sascha", ""], ["Sokolnikov", "Mikhail E.", ""], ["Eidem\u00fcller", "Markus", ""]]}]
