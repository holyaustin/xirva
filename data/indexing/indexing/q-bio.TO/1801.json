This spectrum can then serve as a signature of the spatial\ncomplexity [an index] within the polyp. By overlaying vertical lines that\nradiate from the bottom middle [like a fold-out fan] of an image of a polyp\nstained by hematoxylin and eosin, the image is segmented into sectors. Each\nvertical line also forms an angle with the horizontal axis of the image,\nranging from 0 degrees to 180 degrees rising counter clockwise. Each vertical\nline will intersect with various features of the polyp [border of lumens,\nborder of epithelial lining]. Each of these intersections is a point that can\nbe characterized by its distance from the origin [this distance is also a\nmagnitude of that point]. Thus, each intersection between radial line and polyp\nfeature can be mapped by polar coordinates [radius length, angle measure]. By\nsumming the distance of all points along the same radial line, each radial line\nthat divides the image becomes one value. Plotting these values [y variable]\nagainst the angle of each radial line from the horizontal axis [x variable]\nresults in a sinusoid wave consisting of discrete points.

How can one explain such a key discrepancy in treatment progress?\nA statistical comparison between TB and cancer will give some clues. However,\nTB and cancer also share several important features. Both TB and cancer can\naffect several organs, e.g. lungs, brain, bones, intestines, skin. What in\ncancer is called malignant neoplasm (tumor) is called granuloma in TB. By\nisolating malignant cells (versus bacteria) from the rest of the body, such\nclusters protect the host's organism but at the same time they are \"secure\nbeachheads\" from where malignant cells (versus infected macrophages) can wander\noff to new locations. Thus, metastatic tumors have a TB parallel in the form of\nsecondary granulomas. In order to investigate more closely this parallel we use\nthe age-specific response of organs. Called spectrometric analysis in a\nprevious paper (Berrut et al. 2017), this method provides information about how\nfast tumors develop and how serious they become. A convenient characterization\nof the response to TB of organ j is given by the following (age-dependent)\ndeath ratio: Tj(t)=(death by TB of type j)/(all TB deaths) The development of\ncancer tumors can be described by a similar function Cj(t). We compare the\norgans' responses in all cases for which specific death data are available. It\nappears that for the same organ Tj(t) is similar in shape to Cj(t).
