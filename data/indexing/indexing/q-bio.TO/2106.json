Reducing the spatial coverage to the DGM\nvicinity can substantially shorten the scan time or enhance the spatial\nresolution without increasing scan time; however, this may lead to significant\nDGM susceptibility underestimation. Method: A recently proposed deep\nlearning-based QSM method, namely xQSM, is investigated to assess the accuracy\nof dipole inversion on reduced brain coverages. Pre-processed magnetic field\nmaps are extended symmetrically from the centre of globus pallidus in the\ncoronal plane to simulate QSM acquisitions of difference spatial\ncoverages.Results: The proposed xQSM network led to the lowest DGM contrast\nlost with the smallest susceptibility variation range across all spatial\ncoverages. For the digital brain phantom simulation, xQSM improved the DGM\nsusceptibility underestimation more than 20% in small spatial coverages. For\nthe in vivo acquisition, less than 5% DGM susceptibility error was achieved in\n48 mm axial slabs using the xQSM network, while a minimum of 112 mm coverage\nwas required for conventional methods. It is also shown that the background\nfield removal process performed worse in reduced brain coverages, which further\ndeteriorated the subsequent dipole inversion. Conclusion: The recently proposed\ndeep learning-based xQSM method significantly improves the accuracy of DGM QSM\nfrom small spatial coverages as compared with conventional QSM algorithms,\nwhich can shorten DGM QSM acquisition time substantially.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:41:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Xuanyu", ""], ["Gao", "Yang", ""], ["Liu", "Feng", ""], ["Crozier", "Stuart", ""], ["Sun", "Hongfu", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.00652", "submitter": "Da Ma", "authors": "Da Ma, Vincent Chow, Karteek Popuri, Mirza Faisal Beg", "title": "Comprehensive Validation of Automated Whole Body Skeletal Muscle,\n  Adipose Tissue, and Bone Segmentation from 3D CT images for Body Composition\n  Analysis: Towards Extended Body Composition", "comments": "This paper is based on concepts presented at the NIH Body Composition\n  and Cancer Outcomes Research Webinar Series on December 17th, 2020 by Mirza\n  Faisal Beg titled \"Automating Body Composition from Routinely Acquired CT\n  images - towards 3D measurements\".

Body Composition is\nrecognized as an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of\ndiseases, as well as a predictor of individual patient-specific clinical\noutcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are\nroutinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering\nof internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the\namount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments.

Several studies have shown how vagus nerve is involved in\nmany vital processes during fetal, perinatal and postnatal life: from the\nregulation of inflammation through the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway,\nwhich may affect the functioning of each organ, to the production of hormones\ninvolved in bioenergetic metabolism. In addition, the vagus nerve has been\nrecognized as the primary afferent pathway capable of transmitting information\nto the brain from every organ of the body. Therefore, this hypothesis paper\naims to review the development of ANS during fetal and perinatal life, focusing\nparticularly on the vagus nerve, to identify possible \"critical windows\" that\ncould impact its maturation. These \"critical windows\" could help clinicians\nknow when to monitor fetuses to effectively assess the developmental status of\nboth ANS and specifically the vagus nerve. In addition, this paper will focus\non which factors (i.e. fetal characteristics and behaviors, maternal lifestyle\nand pathologies, placental health and dysfunction, labor, incubator conditions,\nand drug exposure) may have an impact on the development of the vagus during\nthe above-mentioned \"critical window\" and how. This analysis could help\nclinicians and stakeholders define precise guidelines for improving the\nmanagement of fetuses and newborns, particularly to reduce the potential\nadverse environmental impacts on ANS development that may lead to persistent\nlong-term consequences. Since the development of ANS and the vagus influence\nhave been shown to be reflected in cardiac variability, this paper will rely in\nparticular on studies using fetal heart rate variability (fHRV) to monitor the\ncontinued growth and health of both animal and human fetuses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2021 11:19:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Cerritelli", "Francesco", ""], ["Frasch", "Martin G.", ""], ["Antonelli", "Marta C.", ""], ["Viglione", "Chiara", ""], ["Vecchi", "Stefano", ""], ["Chiera", "Marco", ""], ["Manzotti", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.02246", "submitter": "Michelle Li", "authors": "Michelle M.
