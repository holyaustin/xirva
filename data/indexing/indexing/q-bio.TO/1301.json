However, so far the molecular components that would give rise\nto Turing patterns are elusive. We have recently shown that a particular type\nof receptor-ligand interaction can give rise to Schnakenberg-type Turing\npatterns, which reproduce patterning during lung and kidney branching\nmorphogenesis. Recent knock-out experiments have identified Smad4 as a key\nprotein in digit patterning. We show here that the BMP-receptor interaction\nmeets the conditions for a Schnakenberg-type Turing pattern, and that the\nresulting model reproduces available wildtype and mutant data on the expression\npatterns of BMP, its receptor, and Fgfs in the apical ectodermal ridge (AER)\nwhen solved on a realistic 2D domain that we extracted from limb bud images of\nE11.5 mouse embryos. We propose that receptor-ligand-based mechanisms serve as\na molecular basis for the emergence of Turing patterns in many developing\ntissues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2013 14:36:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Badugu", "Amarendra", ""], ["Kraemer", "Conradin", ""], ["Germann", "Philipp", ""], ["Menshykau", "Denis", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.1019", "submitter": "Danuta Makowiec", "authors": "Danuta Makowiec, Stanisaw Kryszewski, Joanna Wdowczyk-Szulc, Marta\n  Zarczynska-Buchowiecka, Marcin Gruchal, Andrzej Rynkiewicz", "title": "Multifractal age?

To\naddress this point, we have created a hybrid, discrete/continuous computational\ncellular automaton model of a generalised stem-cell driven tissue and explored\nthe phenotypic traits inherent in the inciting cell and the resultant tissue\ngrowth. We identify the regions in phenotype parameter space where these\ninitiating cells are able to cause a disruption in homeostasis, leading to\ntissue overgrowth and tumour formation. As our parameters and model are\nnon-specific, they could apply to any tissue cancer stem-cell and do not assume\nspecific genetic mutations.
