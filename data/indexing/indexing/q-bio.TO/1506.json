The\nreliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial\nmeasurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial\nacross-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible\nacross different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional\nregulation.

They originate\nfrom intestinal crypts, glands that descend from the intestinal lumen into the\nunderlying connective tissue. Normal crypts are thought to exist in a dynamic\nequilibrium where the rate of cell production at the base of a crypt is matched\nby that of loss at the top. Understanding how genetic alterations accumulate\nand proceed to disrupt this dynamic equilibrium is fundamental to understanding\nthe origins of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer emerges from the\ninteraction of biological processes that span several spatial scales, from\nmutations that cause inappropriate intracellular responses to changes at the\ncell/tissue level, such as uncontrolled proliferation and altered motility and\nadhesion. Multiscale mathematical modelling can provide insight into the\nspatiotemporal organisation of such a complex, highly regulated and dynamic\nsystem. Moreover, the aforementioned challenges are inherent to the multiscale\nmodelling of biological tissue more generally. In this review we describe the\nmathematical approaches that have been applied to investigate multiscale\naspects of crypt behaviour, highlighting a number of model predictions that\nhave since been validated experimentally. We also discuss some of the key\nmathematical and computational challenges associated with the multiscale\nmodelling approach. We conclude by discussing recent efforts to derive\ncoarse-grained descriptions of such models, which may offer one way of reducing\nthe computational cost of simulation by leveraging well-established tools of\nmathematical analysis to address key problems in multiscale modelling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 16:15:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fletcher", "Alexander G.", ""], ["Murray", "Philip J.", ""], ["Maini", "Philip K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.05052", "submitter": "Oliver Maclaren", "authors": "O.J.
