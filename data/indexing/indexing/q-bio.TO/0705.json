Thereby, we also employed 3% hydrogen\nperoxide(H2O2) for the inhibition of endogenous peroxidase activity and\nincubated the tissue sections with the biotinylated secondary antibody at room\ntemperature (RT). We now add the immunohistochemical details that had led us to\nthis optimized procedure as they also bear a more general relevance when\ndemonstrating intracellular tissue antigens. Our most important result is that\nendogenous peroxidase inhibition by 0.3% H2O2 coincided with an apparently\npositive IDE staining in an investigated breast cancer specimen whereas\ncombining a block by 3% H2O2 with an incubation of the biotinylated secondary\nantibody at RT, yet not at 37 degrees Celsius, revealed this specimen as almost\nentirely IDE-negative. Our present data caution against three different\nimmunohistochemical pitfalls that might cause falsely positive results and\nartifacts when using an LSAB- and peroxidase-based detection method: pressure\ncooking for AR, insufficient quenching of endogenous peroxidases and heating of\ntissue sections while incubating with biotinylated secondary antibodies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2007 20:56:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Radulescu", "Razvan T.", ""], ["Jahn", "Angelika", ""], ["Hellmann", "Daniela", ""], ["Weirich", "Gregor", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1057", "submitter": "Jos K\\\"afer", "authors": "Jos K\\\"afer, Takashi Hayashi, Athanasius F.M.

We find that this assumption is insufficient to model the\nexperimentally observed shapes and packing of the cells based on their cadherin\nexpression. We then consider a model in which adhesion leads to a surface\nincrease, balanced by cell cortex contraction. Using the experimentally\nobserved distributions of E- and N-cadherin, we simulate the packing and cell\nshapes in the wildtype eye. Furthermore, by changing only the corresponding\nparameters, this model can describe the mutants with different numbers of\ncells, or changes in cadherin expression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2007 09:51:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2007 12:01:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["K\u00e4fer", "Jos", ""], ["Hayashi", "Takashi", ""], ["Mar\u00e9e", "Athanasius F.

The exception is white matter, the metabolism of which\nseems to scale with a standard specific exponent -1/4.
