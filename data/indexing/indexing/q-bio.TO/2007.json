However, the\nsynergistic effect of simultaneous thermoradiotherapy is not well understood\nyet, while its mathematical modelling is essential for treatment planning. To\nbetter understand this synergy, we propose a theoretical model in which the\nthermal enhancement ratio (TER) is explained by the fraction of cells being\nradiosensitised by the infliction of sublethal damage through mild HT. Further\ndamage finally kills the cell or inhibits its proliferation in a non-reversible\nprocess. We suggest the TER to be proportional to the energy invested in the\nsensitisation, which is modelled as a simple rate process. Assuming protein\ndenaturation as the main driver of HT-induced sublethal damage and considering\nthe temperature dependence of the heat capacity of cellular proteins, the\nsensitisation rates were found to depend exponentially on temperature; in\nagreement with previous empirical observations.

One instance is represented by the model\ndescribing the generation of active force, coupled with the one of tissue\nmechanics. For the numerical solution of the coupled model, partitioned\nschemes, that foresee the sequential solution of the two subproblems, are often\nused. However, this approach may be unstable. For this reason, the coupled\nmodel is commonly solved as a unique system using Newton type algorithms, at\nthe price, however, of high computational costs. In light of this motivation,\nin this paper we propose a new numerical scheme, that is numerically stable and\naccurate, yet within a fully partitioned (i.e. segregated) framework.\nSpecifically, we introduce, with respect to standard segregated scheme, a\nnumerically consistent stabilization term, capable of removing the nonphysical\noscillations otherwise present in the numerical solution of the commonly used\nsegregated scheme. Our new method is derived moving from a physics-based\nanalysis on the microscale energetics of the force generation dynamics. By\nconsidering a model problem of active mechanics we prove that the proposed\nscheme is unconditionally absolutely stable (i.e. it is stable for any time\nstep size), unlike the standard segregated scheme, and we also provide an\ninterpretation of the scheme as a fractional step method. We show, by means of\nseveral numerical tests, that the proposed stabilization term successfully\nremoves the nonphysical numerical oscillations characterizing the non\nstabilized segregated scheme solution. Our numerical tests are carried out for\nseveral force generation models available in the literature, namely the\nNiederer-Hunter-Smith model, the model by Land and coworkers, and the\nmean-field force generation model that we have recently proposed.

Mathematical modeling\nand simulation is a promising approach to personalized cancer medicine. Yet,\nthe complexity, heterogeneity and multiscale nature of cancer present severe\nchallenges. One of the major barriers to use mathematical models to predict the\noutcome of therapeutic regimens in a particular patient lies in their\ninitialization and parameterization in order to reflect individual cancer\ncharacteristics accurately. Here we present a study where we used multitype\nmeasurements acquired routinely on a single breast tumor, including\nhistopathology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and molecular profiling, to\npersonalize a multiscale hybrid cellular automaton model of breast cancer\ntreated with chemotherapeutic and antiangiogenic agents. We model drug\npharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics at the tumor tissue level but with\ncellular and subcellular resolution. We simulate those spatio-temporal dynamics\nin 2D cross-sections of tumor portions over 12-week therapy regimes, resulting\nin complex and computationally intensive simulations. For such computationally\ndemanding systems, formal statistical inference methods to estimate individual\nparameters from data have not been feasible in practice to until most recently,\nafter the emergence of machine learning techniques applied to likelihood-free\ninference methods. Here we use the inference advances provided by Bayesian\noptimization to fit our model to simulated data of individual patients.
