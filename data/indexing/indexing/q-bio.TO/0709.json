Its symptoms are complex and widespread. It structurally and\nfunctionally affects cortical and subcortical regions involved in cognitive,\nemotional and motivational aspects of behavior. Its cause is unknown, its\ndiagnosis is based on statistical behavior and its treatment is elusive.\n  Our paradigm addresses the complexity of schizophrenic symptoms. Building\nupon recent neural vulnerability and limbic dysregulation hypotheses, it offers\na mathematical model for the evolution of the limbic system under perturbation.\nDependence on parameters and the concept of \"bifurcation\" could be the key to\nunderstanding the threshold between \"normality\" and \"disease\".\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2007 03:48:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Radulescu", "Anca R.", ""]]}]
