In this study, we use the DNA\nmethylation 450k data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate the efficacy of\nDNA methylation data on cancer classification for 30 cancer types. We propose a\nnew method for gene selection in high dimensional data(over 450 thousand).\nVariance filtering is first introduced for dimension reduction and Recursive\nfeature elimination (RFE) is then used for feature selection. We address the\nproblem of selecting a small subsets of genes from large number of methylated\nsites, and our parsimonious model is demonstrated to be efficient, achieving an\naccuracy over 91%, outperforming other studies which use DNA micro-arrays and\nRNA-seq Data . The performance of 20 models, which are based on 4 estimators\n(Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Tree and Support Vector Machine) and 5\nclassifiers (k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, XGboost, Light GBM\nand Multi-Layer Perceptron), is compared and robustness of the RFE algorithm is\nexamined.

As an\nextension of our previous work (arXiv:1812.07509), we have developed a tool for\nsegmentation of whole slide images (WSIs) with an easy to use graphical user\ninterface. Our tool runs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network for\nsegmentation of WSIs in the cloud. Our plugin is built on the open source tool\nHistomicsTK by Kitware Inc. (Clifton Park, NY), which provides remote data\nmanagement and viewing abilities for WSI datasets. The ability to access this\ntool over the internet will facilitate widespread use by computational\nnon-experts. Users can easily upload slides to a server where our plugin is\ninstalled and perform human in the loop segmentation analysis remotely. This\ntool is open source, and has the ability to be adapted to segment of any\npathological structure. For a proof of concept, we have trained it to segment\nglomeruli from renal tissue images, achieving an F-score > 0.97 on holdout\ntissue slides.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2021 18:21:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lutnick", "Brendon", ""], ["Manthey", "David", ""], ["Sarder", "Pinaki", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.07372", "submitter": "Jose Munoz", "authors": "Malik A Dawi and Jose J Munoz", "title": "Stability bounds of a delay visco-elastic rheological model with\n  substrate friction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math.DS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Cells and tissues exhibit oscillatory deformations during remodelling,\nmigration or embryogenesis.

We\nemploy continuum mixture theory with stochastic Cahn--Hilliard type phase-field\nmodels of tumor growth. The interstitial flow is governed by a mesoscale\nversion of Darcy's law. The flow in the blood vessels is controlled by\nPoiseuille flow, and Starling's law is applied to model the mass transfer in\nand out of blood vessels. The evolution of the network of blood vessels is\norchestrated by the concentration of the tumor angiogenesis factors (TAFs);\nblood vessels grow towards the increasing TAFs concentrations. This process is\nnot deterministic, allowing random growth of blood vessels and, therefore, due\nto the coupling of nutrients in tissue and vessels, makes the growth of tumors\nstochastic. We demonstrate the performance of the model by applying it to a\nvariety of scenarios. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility of the\nmodel and its ability to generate satellite tumors.
