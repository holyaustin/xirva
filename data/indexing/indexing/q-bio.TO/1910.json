Here, we show by a combination of experiment and theoretical analysis\nthat both the hydraulic permeability and the elastic properties of (bio)polymer\nnetworks can be determined with simple ramp compression experiments in a\ncommercial rheometer. In our approximate closed-form solution of the\nporoelastic equations of motion, we find the normal force response during\ncompression as a combination of network stress and fluid pressure. Choosing\nfibrin as a biopolymer model system with controllable pore size, measurements\nof the full time-dependent normal force during compression are found to be in\nexcellent agreement with the theoretical calculations. The inferred elastic\nresponse of large-pore ($\\mathrm{\\mu m}$) fibrin networks depends on the strain\nrate, suggesting a strong interplay between network elasticity and fluid flow.\nPhenomenologically extending the calculated normal force into the regime of\nnonlinear elasticity, we find strain-stiffening of small-pore (sub-$\\mathrm{\\mu\nm}$) fibrin networks to occur at an onset average tangential stress at the\ngel-plate interface that depends on the polymer concentration in a power-law\nfashion. The inferred permeability of small-pore fibrin networks scales\napproximately inverse squared with the fibrin concentration, implying with a\nmicroscopic cubic lattice model that the thickness of the fibrin fibers\ndecreases with protein concentration. Our theoretical model provides a new\nmethod to obtain the hydraulic permeability and the elastic properties of\nbiopolymer networks and hydrogels with simple compression experiments, and\npaves the way to study the relation between fluid flow and elasticity in\nbiopolymer networks during dynamical compression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 15:41:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Punter", "Melle T.

While changes in signaling processes and biochemistry\nplay an important role, we focus on changes in the mechanical properties by\nstudying the result of variation of growth force and adhesive\ncross-interactions between cell types. For independent mutations of growth\nforce and adhesion strength, the tissue evolves towards cell types with high\ngrowth force and low internal adhesion strength, as both increase the\nhomeostatic pressure.

This tradeoff controls\nthe evolution of the tissue, ranging from unidirectional evolution to very\nheterogeneous and dynamic populations. The special case of two competing cell\ntypes reveals three distinct parameter regimes: Two in which one cell type\noutcompetes the other, and one in which both cell types coexist in a highly\nmixed state. Interestingly, a single mutated cell alone suffices to reach the\nmixed state, while a finite mutation rate affects the results only weakly.\nFinally, the coupling between changes in growth force and adhesion strength\nreveals a mechanical explanation for the evolution towards intra-tumor\nheterogeneity, in which multiple species coexist even under a constant\nevolutianary pressure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Oct 2019 08:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00fcscher", "Tobias", ""], ["Ganai", "Nirmalendu", ""], ["Gompper", "Gerhard", ""], ["Elgeti", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.03658", "submitter": "David Smith", "authors": "Meurig T.
