Propagation of excitation waves in\nthis medium results in the formation of characteristic patterns such as\nrotating spiral waves. Instabilities in these structures may lead to\nspatiotemporal chaos through spiral turbulence, which has been linked to\nclinically diagnosed conditions such as cardiac fibrillation. Usual methods for\ncontrolling such phenomena involve very large amplitude perturbations and have\nseveral drawbacks. There have been several recent attempts to develop\nlow-amplitude control procedures for spatiotemporal chaos in excitable media\nwhich are reviewed in this paper. The control schemes have been broadly\nclassified by us into three types: (i) global, (ii) non-global\nspatially-extended and (iii) local, depending on the way the control signal is\napplied, and we discuss the merits and drawbacks for each.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2007 14:48:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Sitabhra", ""], ["Sridhar", "S.", ""]]}]
