Many experiments have investigated and observed such\nstructural adaptation. However, there is still much uncertainty about how to\ndefine the reference mechanical state at which bone structure is adapted and\nstable. Clinical and experimental observations show that this reference state\nvaries both in space and in time, over a wide range of timescales. We propose\nan osteocyte-based mechanostat theory that links various timescales of\nstructural adaptation with various dynamic features of the osteocyte network in\nbone. This theory assumes that osteocytes are formed adapted to their current\nlocal mechanical environment through modulation of morphological and genotypic\nosteocyte properties involved in mechanical sensitivity. We distinguish two\nmain types of physiological responses by which osteocytes subsequently modify\nthe reference mechanical state. One is the replacement of osteocytes during\nbone remodelling, which occurs over the long timescales of bone turnover. The\nother is cell desensitisation responses, which occur more rapidly and\nreversibly during an osteocyte's lifetime. The novelty of this theory is to\npropose that long-lasting morphological and genotypic osteocyte properties\nprovide a material basis for a long-term mechanical memory of bone that is\ngradually reset by bone remodelling. We test this theory by simulating\nlong-term mechanical disuse (modelling spinal cord injury), and short-term\nmechanical loadings (modelling daily exercises) with a mathematical model.

This work reflects the careful syntactical\ndefinition of major white matter fiber tracts in the human brain based on a\nneuroanatomist's expert knowledge. The framework is based on a novel query\nlanguage with a near-to-English textual syntax. This query language makes it\npossible to construct a dictionary of anatomical definitions that describe\nwhite matter tracts. The definitions include adjacent gray and white matter\nregions, and rules for spatial relations. This novel method makes it possible\nto automatically label white matter anatomy across subjects. After describing\nthis method, we provide an example of its implementation where we encode\nanatomical knowledge in human white matter for 10 association and 15 projection\ntracts per hemisphere, along with 7 commissural tracts. Importantly, this novel\nmethod is comparable in accuracy to manual labeling.

Modelling\nsynthesises tissue in some regions and removes tissue in others. Remodelling\noverwrites old tissue material properties with newly formed, immature tissue\nproperties. As a result, tissues are made up of different \"patches\", i.e.,\nadjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,\nwithin evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the\nspatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum\nmodel. These equations take into account nonconservative, discontinuous surface\nmass balance due to creation and destruction of material at moving interfaces,\nand bulk balance due to tissue maturation. These equations make it possible to\nmodel patchy tissue states and their evolution without explicitly maintaining a\nrecord of when/where resorption and formation processes occurred. The time\nevolution of spatially averaged tissue properties is derived systematically by\nintegration. These spatially-averaged equations cannot be written in closed\nform as they retain traces that tissue destruction is localised at tissue\nboundaries.\n  The formalism developed in this paper is applied to bone tissues, which\nexhibit strong material heterogeneities due to their slow mineralisation and\nremodelling processes. Evolution equations are proposed in particular for\nosteocyte density and bone mineral density. Effective average equations for\nbone mineral density (BMD) and tissue mineral density (TMD) are derived using a\nmean-field approximation. The error made by this approximation when remodelling\npatchy tissue is investigated. The specific time signatures of BMD or TMD\nduring remodelling events may provide a way to detect these events occurring at\nlower, unseen spatial resolutions from microCT scans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Dec 2015 21:43:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 13:51:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.08305", "submitter": "Junghyo Jo", "authors": "Danh-Tai Hoang and Manami Hara and Junghyo Jo", "title": "Design Principles of Pancreatic Islets: Glucose-dependent Coordination\n  of Hormone Pulses", "comments": "24 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 11(4):e0152446 (2016)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0152446", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pancreatic islets are functional units involved in glucose homeostasis. The\nmulticellular system comprises three main cell types; $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$\ncells reciprocally decrease and increase blood glucose by producing insulin and\nglucagon pulses, while the role of $\\delta$ cells is less clear. Although their\nspatial organization and the paracrine/autocrine interactions between them have\nbeen extensively studied, the functional implications of the design principles\nare still lacking. In this study, we formulated a mathematical model that\nintegrates the pulsatility of hormone secretion and the interactions and\norganization of islet cells and examined the effects of different cellular\ncompositions and organizations in mouse and human islets. A common feature of\nboth species was that islet cells produced synchronous hormone pulses under\nlow- and high- glucose conditions, while they produced asynchronous hormone\npulses under normal glucose conditions. However, the synchronous coordination\nof insulin and glucagon pulses at low glucose was more pronounced in human\nislets that had more $\\alpha$ cells. When $\\beta$ cells were selectively\nremoved to mimic diabetic conditions, the anti-synchronicity of insulin and\nglucagon pulses was deteriorated at high glucose, but it could be partially\nrecovered when the re-aggregation of remaining cells was considered. Finally,\nthe third cell type, $\\delta$ cells, which introduced additional complexity in\nthe multicellular system, prevented the excessive synchronization of hormone\npulses. Our computational study suggests that controllable synchronization is a\ndesign principle of pancreatic islets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 02:21:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Hoang", "Danh-Tai", ""], ["Hara", "Manami", ""], ["Jo", "Junghyo", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09160", "submitter": "Mark Catherall", "authors": "Mark Catherall", "title": "Modelling the Role of Nitric Oxide in Cerebral Autoregulation", "comments": "Thesis submitted for Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at the\n  University of Oxford, October 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.CB q-bio.QM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Malfunction of the system which regulates the bloodflow in the brain is a\nmajor cause of stroke and dementia, costing many lives and many billions of\npounds each year in the UK alone. This regulatory system, known as cerebral\nautoregulation, has been the subject of much experimental and mathematical\ninvestigation yet our understanding of it is still quite limited. One area in\nwhich our understanding is particularly lacking is that of the role of nitric\noxide, understood to be a potent vasodilator. The interactions of nitric oxide\nwith the better understood myogenic response remain un-modelled and poorly\nunderstood. In this thesis we present a novel model of the arteriolar control\nmechanism, comprising a mixture of well-established and new models of\nindividual processes, brought together for the first time. We show that this\nmodel is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely\nand go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the\nwhole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a\ncentral role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the\ndynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood\npressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to\nthe dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ within the muscle cell, and that self-sustaining\nCa$^{2+}$ waves are not necessary to cause whole-vessel radius oscillations\nconsistent with vasomotion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 21:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Catherall", "Mark", ""]]}]
