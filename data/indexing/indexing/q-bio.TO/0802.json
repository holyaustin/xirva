A\nquantitative understanding of the processes involved, which currently remains\nlacking, will be useful in determining the etiology and treatment of obesity\nand other conditions resulting from prolonged energy imbalance. Here, we show\nthat the long-term dynamics of human weight change can be captured by a\nmathematical model of the macronutrient flux balances and all previous models\nare special cases of this model. We show that the generic dynamical behavior of\nbody composition for a clamped diet can be divided into two classes. In the\nfirst class, the body composition and mass are determined uniquely. In the\nsecond class, the body composition can exist at an infinite number of possible\nstates. Surprisingly, perturbations of dietary energy intake or energy\nexpenditure can give identical responses in both model classes and existing\ndata are insufficient to distinguish between these two possibilities. However,\nthis distinction is important for the efficacy of clinical interventions that\nalter body composition and mass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Feb 2008 23:45:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chow", "Carson C.", ""], ["Hall", "Kevin D.", ""]]}]
