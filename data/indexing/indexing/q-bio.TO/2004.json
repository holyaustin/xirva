For instance, lissencephaly and\npolymicrogyria can lead to severe mental retardation, short life expectancy,\nepileptic seizures, and tetraplegia. The construction of a quantitative model\non how and why these folds appear is the first step in understanding the cause\nof these conditions. In recent years, there have been various attempts to\nunderstand and model the mechanisms of brain folding. Previous works have shown\nthat mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation of brain\nfolds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in\ndictating the folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding,\none of the main characteristics of the human brain, has not been fully tackled.\nThe effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis of the mammalian\nbrain are studied through finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs. The\nslabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the\ngray matter, and the inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential\ngrowth is introduced by only growing the top layer. The brain tissue is modeled\nas a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material. Simulations are performed with both,\nhomogeneous and inhomogeneous cortical thickness. The homogeneous cortex is\nshown to fold into a single wavelength, as common for bilayered materials,\nwhile the inhomogeneous cortex folds into more complex conformations: In their\nearly stages of development, structures reminiscent of the deep sulci in the\nbrain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary undulations,\nwhich are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier\ngyrification stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of\nhigher-order folding in the mammalian, and particularly the human, brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2020 14:24:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Campos", "Lucas da Costa", ""], ["Hornung", "Raphael", ""], ["Gompper", "Gerhard", ""], ["Elgeti", "Jens", ""], ["Caspers", "Svenja", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.01399", "submitter": "Irina Mizeva", "authors": "Andrey Shmyrov, Alexey Mizev, Irina Mizeva and Anastasia Shmyrova", "title": "Electrostatic precipitation of exhaled particles for tensiometric\n  examination of pulmonary surfactant", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures, submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Objective: Collecting exhaled particles that represent small droplets of the\nalveolar lining fluid shows great promise as a tool for pulmonary surfactant\n(PS) sampling.

The root cause of this cell loss\nin PD is still not decisively elucidated. A recent line of thinking traces the\ncause of PD neurodegeneration to metabolic deficiency. Due to exceptionally\nhigh energy demand, SNc neurons exhibit a higher basal metabolic rate and\nhigher oxygen consumption rate, which results in oxidative stress. Recently, we\nhave suggested that the excitotoxic loss of SNc cells might be due to energy\ndeficiency occurring at different levels of neural hierarchy. Levodopa (LDOPA),\na precursor of dopamine, which is used as a symptom-relieving treatment for PD,\nleads to outcomes that are both positive and negative. Several researchers\nsuggested that LDOPA might be harmful to SNc cells due to oxidative stress. The\nrole of LDOPA in the course of PD pathogenesis is still debatable. We\nhypothesize that energy deficiency can lead to LDOPA-induced toxicity (LIT) in\ntwo ways: by promoting dopamine-induced oxidative stress and by exacerbating\nexcitotoxicity in SNc. We present a multiscale computational model of\nSNc-striatum system, which will help us in understanding the mechanism behind\nneurodegeneration postulated above and provides insights for developing\ndisease-modifying therapeutics. It was observed that SNc terminals are more\nvulnerable to energy deficiency than SNc somas. During LDOPA therapy, it was\nobserved that higher LDOPA dosage results in increased loss of somas and\nterminals in SNc. It was also observed that co-administration of LDOPA and\nglutathione (antioxidant) evades LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc neurons. We show\nthat our proposed model was able to capture LDOPA-induced toxicity in SNc,\ncaused by energy deficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 11:04:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Muddapu", "Vignayanandam R.", ""], ["Vijayakumar", "Karthik", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "Keerthiga", ""], ["Chakravarthy", "V Srinivasa", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.08491", "submitter": "Saroj Jayasinghe", "authors": "Anuruddha Abeygunasekera and Saroj Jayasinghe", "title": "Is the anti-filarial drug diethylcarbamazine useful to treat COVID-19?", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The SARS-CoV-2 virus has resulted in a devastating pandemic of COVID-19.\nExploring compounds that could offer a breakthrough in treatment is the need of\nthe hour.

These results highlight the urgent need for prospective trials\ntesting whether prophylactic use of $\\alpha_1$-AR antagonists ameliorates lower\nrespiratory tract infection-associated cytokine storm syndrome, as observed in\nCOVID-19.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2020 15:52:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2020 17:56:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 15:25:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2020 14:39:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 12:27:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2020 16:40:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2020 02:41:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Koenecke", "Allison", ""], ["Powell", "Michael", ""], ["Xiong", "Ruoxuan", ""], ["Shen", "Zhu", ""], ["Fischer", "Nicole", ""], ["Huq", "Sakibul", ""], ["Khalafallah", "Adham M.", ""], ["Trevisan", "Marco", ""], ["Sparen", "P\u00e4r", ""], ["Carrero", "Juan J", ""], ["Nishimura", "Akihiko", ""], ["Caffo", "Brian", ""], ["Stuart", "Elizabeth A.", ""], ["Bai", "Renyuan", ""], ["Staedtke", "Verena", ""], ["Papadopoulos", "Nickolas", ""], ["Kinzler", "Kenneth W.", ""], ["Vogelstein", "Bert", ""], ["Zhou", "Shibin", ""], ["Bettegowda", "Chetan", ""], ["Konig", "Maximilian F.", ""], ["Mensh", "Brett", ""], ["Vogelstein", "Joshua T.", ""], ["Athey", "Susan", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.11325", "submitter": "Sahar Rahbar", "authors": "Sahar Rahbar", "title": "Mathematical and Preclinical Investigation of Respiratory Sinus\n  Arrhythmia Effects on Cardiac Output", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is heart rate variability in synchrony\nwith respiration although its functional significance not clear.

Yet, how precisely cells as individual\nmechanical entities can act to morph a tissue reliably and efficiently into\nthree dimensions during outgrowth is still puzzling especially when cells are\ntightly connected as in plant tissue. In plants, the mechanics of cells within\na tissue is particularly well defined as individual cell growth is essentially\nthe mechanical yielding of cell-wall in response to internal turgor pressure.\nCell wall stiffness is controlled by biological signalling and, hence, cell\ngrowth is observed to respond to mechanical stresses building up within a\ntissue. What is the role of the mechanical feedback during morphing of tissue\nin three dimensions? Here, we develop a three dimensional vertex model to\ninvestigate tissue mechanics at the onset of organ outgrowth at the tip of a\nplant shoot. We find that organ height is primarily governed by the ratio of\ngrowth rates of faster growing cells initiating the organ to slower growing\ncells surrounding them. Remarkably, the outgrowth rate is higher when cells\ngrowth responds to the tissue-wide mechanical stresses. Our quantitative\nanalysis of simulation data shows that tissue mechanical feedback on cell\ngrowth can act via twofold mechanism. First, the feedback guides patterns of\ncellular growth. Second, the feedback modifies the stress patterns on the\ncells, consequently amplifying and propagating growth anisotropies. This\nmechanism may allow plants to grow organs efficiently out of the meristem by\nreorganizing the cellular growth rather than inflating growth rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Apr 2020 19:47:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Khadka", "Jason", ""], ["Julien", "Jean-Daniel", ""], ["Alim", "Karen", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14290", "submitter": "Maria McGee", "authors": "Maria P McGee, Michael Morykwas, Mary Kerns, Anirudh Vashisht, Ashok N\n  Hegde and Louis Argenta", "title": "Interstitial cells and neurons respond to variations in hydration", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dehydration and brain interstitial fluid alterations associate to cognitive\ndysfunction.

Cancer immunotherapies use elements of the patient immune\nsystem to attack tumor cells. One of the most successful types of immunotherapy\nis CAR-T cells. This treatment works by extracting patient's T-cells and adding\nto them an antigen receptor allowing tumor cells to be recognized and targeted.\nThese new cells are called CAR-T cells and are re-infused back into the patient\nafter expansion in-vitro. This approach has been successfully used to treat\nB-cell malignancies (B-cell leukemias and lymphomas). However, its application\nto the treatment of T-cell leukemias faces several problems. One of these is\nfratricide, since the CAR-T cells target both tumor and other CAR-T cells. This\nleads to nonlinear dynamical phenomena amenable to mathematical modeling. In\nthis paper we construct a mathematical model describing the competition of\nCAR-T, tumor and normal T-cells and studied some basic properties of the model\nand its practical implications. Specifically, we found that the model\nreproduced the observed difficulties for in-vitro expansion of the therapeutic\ncells found in the laboratory. The mathematical model predicted that CAR-T cell\nexpansion in the patient would be possible due to the initial presence of a\nlarge number of targets. We also show that, in the context of our mathematical\napproach, CAR-T cells could control tumor growth but not eradicate the disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Apr 2020 15:57:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda", "V\u00edctor M.", ""], ["Le\u00f3n-Triana", "O.", ""], ["Rosa", "M.", ""], ["P\u00e9rez-Mart\u00ednez", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14296", "submitter": "Senthilkumar Kadirvelu Dr", "authors": "Senthilkumar.

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), is a near\nroom temperature ionized gas composed of reactive species, charged particles,\nneutral particles, and electrons.

Most of the previously reported biological effects of CAP have\nrelied on direct contact between bulk plasma and cells, resulting in the\nchemical effects generally seen after CAP treatment.
