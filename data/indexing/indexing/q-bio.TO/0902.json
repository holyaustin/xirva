We show that competition between surface and\nbulk effects leads to the existence of a critical size that must be overcome by\nmetastases to reach macroscopic sizes. This property can qualitatively explain\nthe observed size distributions of metastases, while size-independent growth\nrates cannot account for clinical and experimental data. In addition, it\npotentially explains the observed preferential growth of metastases on tissue\nsurfaces and membranes such as the pleural and peritoneal layers, suggests a\nmechanism underlying the seed and soil hypothesis introduced by Stephen Paget\nin 1889 and yields realistic values for metastatic inefficiency. We propose a\nnumber of key experiments to test these concepts. The homeostatic pressure as\nintroduced in this work could constitute a quantitative, experimentally\naccessible measure for the metastatic potential of early malignant growths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 19:46:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Basan", "Markus", ""], ["Risler", "Thomas", ""], ["Joanny", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Sastre-Garau", "Xavier", ""], ["Prost", "Jacques", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.3891", "submitter": "Sitabhra Sinha", "authors": "Alain Pumir, Sitabhra Sinha, S.

The wave-train frequency necessary for\nunpinning increases with the obstacle size and we present a geometric\nexplanation of this dependence.
