While information regarding\nthe location and transport of such particles is often crucial, it is not\nwell-understood how to quantify the information in such stochastic systems.\nUsing the framework of nonequilibrium statistical physics, we develop\ntheoretical tools to address this question. We observe that rotation in a\nflow-field does not explicitly appear in the generalized potential that governs\nthe rate of system entropy production. Specifically, in the neighborhood of a\nflow-field, rotation contributes to the information content only in the\npresence of strain -- and then with a comparatively weaker contribution than\nstrain and at higher orders in time. Indeed, strain and especially the flow\ndivergence, contribute most strongly to transport properties such as particle\nresidence time and the rate of information change. These results shed light on\nhow information can be analyzed and controlled in complex artificial and living\nflow-based systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2019 10:51:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 12:20:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Evelyn", ""], ["Golestanian", "Ramin", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.01321", "submitter": "Daniel Friedman", "authors": "Daniel A Friedman, Brian R Johnson, Timothy Linksvayer", "title": "Decentralized physiology and the molecular basis of social life in\n  eusocial insects", "comments": "32 pages, 1 Figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  The traditional focus of physiological and functional genomic research is on\nmolecular processes that play out within a single body.

This coordination is achieved through the function\nof the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a cellular \"fuel gauge\" that is\nexpressed in essentially all eukaryotic cells as heterotrimeric complexes\ncontaining catalytic $\\alpha$ subunits and regulatory $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$\nsubunits. When cellular energy status has been compromised, AMPK is activated\nby increases in AMP:ATP or ADP:ATP ratios and acts to restore energy\nhomeostasis by stimulating energy production via catabolic pathways while\ndecreasing non-essential energy-consuming pathways. Although the primary\nfunction of AMPK is to regulate energy homeostasis at a cell-autonomous level,\nin multicellular organisms, the AMPK system has evolved to interact with\nhormones to regulate energy intake and expenditure at the whole body level.\nThus, AMPK functions as a signaling hub, coordinating anabolic and catabolic\npathways to balance nutrient supply with energy demand at both the cellular and\nwhole-body levels. AMPK is activated by various metabolic stresses such as\nischemia or hypoxia or glucose deprivation and has both acute and long-term\neffects on metabolic pathways and key cellular functions. In addition, AMPK\nappears to be a major sensor of energy demand in exercising muscle and acts\nboth as a multitask gatekeeper and an energy regulator in skeletal muscle.\nAcute activation of AMPK has been shown to promote glucose transport and fatty\nacid oxidation while suppressing glycogen synthase activity and protein\nsynthesis. Chronic activation of AMPK induces a shift in muscle fiber type\ncomposition, reduces markers of muscle degeneration and enhances muscle\noxidative capacity potentially by stimulating mitochondrial biogenesis.\nFurthermore, recent evidence demonstrates that AMPK may not only regulate\nmetabolism during exercise but also in the recovery phase. AMPK acts as a\nmolecular transducer between exercise and insulin signaling and is necessary\nfor the ability of prior contraction/exercise to increase muscle insulin\nsensitivity. Based on these observations, drugs that activate AMPK might be\nexpected to be useful in the treatment of metabolic disorders and insulin\nresistance in various conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Nov 2019 12:44:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Viollet", "Benoit", "", "EMD"]]}, {"id": "1911.02864", "submitter": "Maximilian L\\\"offler", "authors": "Maximilian T.

Immunotherapy is more effective and, in general, the\nprognosis is better, when more immune cells infiltrate the tumor. We explore\nthe question of whether the spatial distribution rather than just the density\nof immune cells in the tumor is important in forecasting whether cancer recurs.\nAfter reviewing previous work on this issue, we introduce a novel application\nof maximum entropy to quantify the spatial distribution of discrete point-like\nobjects. We apply our approach to B and T cells in images of tumor tissue taken\nfrom triple negative breast cancer (TBNC) patients. We find that there is a\ndistinct difference in the spatial distribution of immune cells between good\nclinical outcome (no recurrence of cancer within at least 5 years of diagnosis)\nand poor clinical outcome (recurrence within 3 years of diagnosis). Our results\nhighlight the importance of spatial distribution of immune cells within tumors\nwith regard to clinical outcome, and raise new questions on their role in\ncancer recurrence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2019 21:45:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Clare C.", ""], ["Wortman", "Juliana C.", ""], ["He", "Ting-Fang", ""], ["Solomon", "Shawn", ""], ["Zhang", "Robert Z.", ""], ["Rosario", "Anthony", ""], ["Wang", "Roger", ""], ["Tu", "Travis Y.", ""], ["Schmolze", "Daniel", ""], ["Yuan", "Yuan", ""], ["Yost", "Susan E.", ""], ["Li", "Xuefei", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""], ["Atwal", "Gurinder", ""], ["Lee", "Peter P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.12876", "submitter": "Peter Kim", "authors": "Adrianne L.

One major\nlimitation of this treatment is that virus particles are rapidly cleared by the\nimmune system, preventing them from arriving at the tumour site. To improve\nvirus survival and infectivity modified virus particles with the polymer\npolyethylene glycol (PEG) and the monoclonal antibody herceptin. While PEG\nmodification appeared to improve plasma retention and initial infectivity it\nalso increased the virus particle arrival time. We derive a mathematical model\nthat describes the interaction between tumour cells and an oncolytic virus. We\ntune our model to represent the experimental data by Kim et al. (2011) and\nobtain optimised parameters. Our model provides a platform from which\npredictions may be made about the response of cancer growth to other treatment\nprotocols beyond those in the experiments. Through model simulations we find\nthat the treatment protocol affects the outcome dramatically. We quantify the\neffects of dosage strategy as a function of tumour cell replication and tumour\ncarrying capacity on the outcome of oncolytic virotherapy as a treatment. The\nrelative significance of the modification of the virus and the crucial role it\nplays in optimising treatment efficacy is explored.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 22:03:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jenner", "Adrianne L.", ""], ["Yun", "Chae-Ok", ""], ["Kim", "Peter S.", ""], ["Coster", "Adelle C.

In this\nprocess, the circulating tumor cells inside the blood vessels adhere to the\ncell monolayer of the blood vessel wall and passes through it, which allows\nthem to invade different organs and complete metastasis. In this process, it is\nrelevant to understand how the adhesions between cells that form the\nendothelial monolayer are broken, resulting in intra-cellular gaps through\nwhich tumor cells are able to extravasate the blood vessel wall.\n  Within this process, we focus on studying the dynamics of cell-cell junctions\nrupture produced in the endothelial monolayer by the effect of Calcium waves.\nThe regulation of this monolayer is of vital importance, not only in\nmetastasis, but also in diseases such as pulmonary edema or atherosclerosis.\n  In order to understand this rupture dynamics in greater depth, we propose a\nhybrid model that simulates endothelial cells as \\textcolor{black}{an} elastic\nmaterial and cell-cell adhesions of the monolayer by means of a catch bond law.\n  We study the effects that the cell contraction caused by a Calcium wave\npresents on the endothelial monolayer depending on the diameter of the blood\nvessel. For this purpose, we develop a three-dimensional model to study the\neffect of the different blood vessel diameters.\n  The results indicate that there are greater tractions on the joints located\nin vertices common to several cells. This led to the formation of openings in\nthe endothelial monolayer, through which extravasation of tumor cells could\noccur. For the different geometries studied, no significant effect of the blood\nvessel diameter on the rupture of the adhesions of monolayer is observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 10:24:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nieto", "A.", ""], ["Escribano", "J.", ""], ["Spill", "F.", ""], ["Garcia-Aznar", "J.
