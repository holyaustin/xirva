Compelling $\\textit{in vitro}$ data demonstrated that strontium\nhydroxyapatite nanoparticles exert a dual action, by promoting\nosteoblasts-driven matrix secretion and inhibiting osteoclasts-driven matrix\nresorption. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) is a\npowerful osteoinductive biologic, used for the treatment of vertebral fractures\nand critically-sized bone defects. Although effective, the use of rhBMP2 has\nlimitations due its recombinant morphogen nature. In this study, we examined\nthe comparison between two osteoinductive agents: rhBMP2 and the innovative\nstrontium-substituted hydroxyapatite nanoparticles. To test their\neffectiveness, we independently loaded Gelfoam sponges with the two\nosteoinductive agents and used the sponges as agent-carriers. Gelfoam are\nFDA-approved biodegradable medical devices used as delivery system for\nmusculoskeletal defects. Their porous structure and spongy morphology make them\nattractive in orthopedic field.

Some of these governing mechanisms include\ncell motion, and cell fate selection through inter cellular signalling.\nHowever, it is not yet clear how to link these two processes, or how they may\naffect one another across the tissue. In this paper, we present a\nmulticellular, multiscale model, which brings together the two phenomena of\ncell motility, and inter cellular signalling, to describe cell fate selection\non a dynamic tissue. We find that the affinity for cellular signalling to occur\ngreatly influences a cells ability to differentiate.

This poses a\nsignificant challenge since modern therapeutics such as chemotherapy regimen\nand immune checkpoint inhibitors are specific to the primary tumor. Recent work\nhas focused on using genomics and transcriptomics for identification of tumor\norigins. However, genomic testing is not conducted for every patient and lacks\nclinical penetration in low resource settings. Herein, to overcome these\nchallenges, we present a deep learning-based computational pathology\nalgorithm-TOAD-that can provide a differential diagnosis for CUP using\nroutinely acquired histology slides. We used 17,486 gigapixel whole slide\nimages with known primaries spread over 18 common origins to train a multi-task\ndeep model to simultaneously identify the tumor as primary or metastatic and\npredict its site of origin. We tested our model on an internal test set of\n4,932 cases with known primaries and achieved a top-1 accuracy of 0.84, a top-3\naccuracy of 0.94 while on our external test set of 662 cases from 202 different\nhospitals, it achieved a top-1 and top-3 accuracy of 0.79 and 0.93\nrespectively. We further curated a dataset of 717 CUP cases from 151 different\nmedical centers and identified a subset of 290 cases for which a differential\ndiagnosis was assigned. Our model predictions resulted in concordance for 50%\nof cases (\\k{appa}=0.4 when adjusted for agreement by chance) and a top-3\nagreement of 75%. Our proposed method can be used as an assistive tool to\nassign differential diagnosis to complicated metastatic and CUP cases and could\nbe used in conjunction with or in lieu of immunohistochemical analysis and\nextensive diagnostic work-ups to reduce the occurrence of CUP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:59:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 02:38:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Ming Y.", ""], ["Zhao", "Melissa", ""], ["Shady", "Maha", ""], ["Lipkova", "Jana", ""], ["Chen", "Tiffany Y.", ""], ["Williamson", "Drew F.

The emphasis has been made upon the erythema as being the\nbest-studied UV harm and the ability of UV irradiance to damage the\ndeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules, which leads to carcinogenesis. The\nerythemally weighted UV irradiance that determines the ultraviolet index (UVI),\nrepresents a common measure of the solar UV radiation level at the Earth's\nsurface and the current protective messages have been made by using UVI as a\nbasic parameter. However, such an approach seems insufficiently grounded to be\nused also in the messages against the skin cancer, bearing in mind the\ndifferent nature of the erythema and DNA lesions. In this context, an\nenlargement of the strategy basis by including additional biological effects of\nUV radiation studied during the past years has been discussed. For instance,\nthe weight of the spectral UV-A (315 - 400 nm) band that in practice had been\nneglected by UVI definition can be enhanced since it was found to play an\nimportant role in DNA damaging. In addition, features of the contemporaneous\nlife style can be taken into account together with some people habits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:57:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Petkov", "Boyan H", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.15777", "submitter": "Wagner F\\'avaro Dr.", "authors": "Nelson Duran and Wagner J.
