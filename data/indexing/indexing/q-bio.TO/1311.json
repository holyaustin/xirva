Here a quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D)\ncurvature elastica model is proposed to reveal the mechanism of these\nbehaviors. We find that the functions of internal stipes muscle and basal\ngaleal muscle which locate at the bottom of proboscis are to adjust the initial\nstates in the coiling and uncoiling processes, respectively. The function of\ninternal galeal muscle which exists along proboscis is to adjust the line\ntension. The knee bend shape is due to the local maximal spontaneous curvature\nand is an advantage for nectar-feeding butterfly. When there is no knee bend,\nthe proboscis of fruit-piercing butterfly is easy to achieve the piercing\nmovement which induced by the increase of internal hydraulic pressure. All of\nthe results are in good agreement with experiential observation.

Here we\nshow that the different follicular sizes can be explained with diffusion-based\nlimitations on the thickness of the hormone-secreting granulosa layer. By\nanalysing published data on human follicular growth and granulosa cell\nexpansion during follicular maturation we find that the 4-fold increase of the\nantral follicle diameter is entirely driven by an increase in the follicular\nfluid volume, while the thickness of the surrounding granulosa layer remains\nconstant at about 45+/-10 mkm. Based on the measured kinetic constants, the\nmodel reveals that the observed fall in the gonadotropin concentration from\nperipheral blood circulation to the follicular antrum is a result of\nsequestration in the granulosa. The model further shows that as a result of\nsequestration, an increased granulosa thickness cannot substantially increase\nestradiol production but rather deprives the oocyte from gonadotropins. Larger\nanimals (with a larger blood volume) require more estradiol as produced by the\novaries to downregulate FSH-secretion in the pituitary. Larger follicle\ndiameters result in larger follicle surface areas for constant granulosa layer\nthickness. The reported increase in follicular surface area in larger species\nindeed correlates linearly both with species mass and with the predicted\nincrease in estradiol output. In summary, we propose a structural role for the\nantrum in that it determines the volume of the granulosa layer and thus the\nlevel of estrogen production.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Nov 2013 18:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e4chler", "M.", ""], ["Menshykau", "D.", ""], ["De Geyter", "Ch.", ""], ["Iber", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.4190", "submitter": "Sylvain Louvet", "authors": "Sylvain Louvet (LMS)", "title": "Mod\\`ele th\\'eorique de la contraction musculaire squelettique :\n  ressorts entropiques, processus stochastiques et m\\'ecanique classique (A\n  theoretical model of skeletal muscular contraction : entropic springs,\n  stochastic processes and classical mechanics)", "comments": "163 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The model analyzes the muscle fiber as a deformable system for which\nexperimental data are determinated with the help of the laws of Newtonian\nmechanic.
