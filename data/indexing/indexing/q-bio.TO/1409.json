The second order nonlinear equation describing the glioblastoma\ngrowth through travelling waves can be reduced to a first order Abel type\nequation. By using the integrability conditions for the Abel equation several\nclasses of exact travelling wave solutions of the general reaction-diffusion\nequation that describes glioblastoma growth are obtained, corresponding to\ndifferent forms of the product of the diffusion and reaction functions. The\nsolutions are obtained by using the Chiellini lemma and the Lemke\ntransformation, respectively, and the corresponding equations represent\ngeneralizations of the classical Fisher--Kolmogorov equation. The biological\nimplications of two classes of solutions are also investigated by using both\nnumerical and semi-analytical methods for realistic values of the biological\nparameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 04:06:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Harko", "Tiberiu", ""], ["Mak", "M.

It is known, however, that the expression of gap\njunctions increases dramatically in the approach to parturition, which results\nin a significant increase in inter-cellular electrical coupling. In this paper,\nwe build upon previous studies of the activity of electrically excitable smooth\nmuscle cells (myocytes) and investigate the mechanism through which the\ncoupling of these cells to electrically passive cells results in the generation\nof spontaneous activity in the uterus. Using a recently developed, realistic\nmodel of uterine muscle cell dynamics, we investigate a system consisting of a\nmyocyte coupled to passive cells. We then extend our analysis to a simple\ntwo-dimensional lattice model of the tissue, with each myocyte being coupled to\nits neighbors, as well as to a random number of passive cells. We observe that\ndifferent dynamical regimes can be observed over a range of gap junction\nconductances: at low coupling strength, the activity is confined to cell\nclusters, while the activity for high coupling may spread across the entire\ntissue. Additionally, we find that the system supports the spontaneous\ngeneration of spiral wave activity. Our results are both qualitatively and\nquantitatively consistent with observations from in vitro experiments. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that an increase in inter-cellular electrical\ncoupling, for realistic parameter values, strongly facilitates the appearance\nof spontaneous action potentials that may eventually lead to parturition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Sep 2014 13:24:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Jinshan", ""], ["Menon", "Shakti N.", ""], ["Singh", "Rajeev", ""], ["Garnier", "Nicolas B.", ""], ["Sinha", "Sitabhra", ""], ["Pumir", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.5895", "submitter": "Roeland M.H.

During sprouting, a highly motile type of\nendothelial cell, called the tip cell, migrates from the blood vessels followed\nby stalk cells, an endothelial cell type that forms the body of the sprout. To\nget more insight into how tip cells contribute to angiogenesis, we extended an\nexisting computational model of vascular network formation based on the\ncellular Potts model with tip and stalk differentiation, without making a\npriori assumptions about the differences between tip cells and stalk cells. To\npredict potential differences, we looked for parameter values that make tip\ncells (a) move to the sprout tip, and (b) change the morphology of the\nangiogenic networks. The screening predicted that if tip cells respond less\neffectively to an endothelial chemoattractant than stalk cells, they move to\nthe tips of the sprouts, which impacts the morphology of the networks. A\ncomparison of this model prediction with genes expressed differentially in tip\nand stalk cells revealed that the endothelial chemoattractant Apelin and its\nreceptor APJ may match the model prediction. To test the model prediction we\ninhibited Apelin signaling in our model and in an \\emph{in vitro} model of\nangiogenic sprouting, and found that in both cases inhibition of Apelin or of\nits receptor APJ reduces sprouting. Based on the prediction of the\ncomputational model, we propose that the differential expression of Apelin and\nAPJ yields a \"self-generated\" gradient mechanisms that accelerates the\nextension of the sprout.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Sep 2014 15:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2015 15:46:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2016 13:49:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Palm", "Margriet M.", ""], ["Dallinga", "Marchien G.", ""], ["van Dijk", "Erik", ""], ["Klaassen", "Ingeborg", ""], ["Schlingemann", "Reinier O.", ""], ["Merks", "Roeland M.
