Methods: Mr. OS (Hong Kong)\nand Ms. OS (Hong Kong) represent the first large-scale cohort studies on bone\nhealth in elderly Chinese men and women. The current study compared Genant's SQ\nmethod and ABQ method in these two cohorts. Based on quantitative measurement,\nthe severity of ABQ method detected fractures was additionally classified into\ngrade-1, grad-2, and grade-3 according to SQ's deformity criteria. The\nradiographs of 1,954 elderly Chinese men (mean: 72.3 years) and 1,953 elderly\nChinese women (mean: 72.5 years) were evaluated. Results: according to ABQ,\ngrade-1,-2,-3 VFs accounted for 1.89%, 1.74%, 2.25% in men, and 3.33%, 3.07%,\nand 5.53% in women. In men and women, 15.7% (35/223) and 34.5% (48/139) of\nvertebrae with SQ grade-1 deformity were ABQ(+, with fracture) respectively. In\nmen and women, 89.7% (35/39) and 66.7% (48/72) of vertebrae with ABQ grade-1\nfracture had SQ grade-1 deformity. For grade-1 change, SQ (-, negative without\nfracture) & ABQ (+, positive with vertebral cortex line fracture) subjects tend\nto have a lower BMD than the SQ(+)& ABQ(-) subjects.
