It is thought\nthat the Drosophila wing disc grows to the right size because its cells respond\nto both signalling proteins (morphogens) and mechanical stress. We show that\nsize regulation can be achieved if cells respond exclusively to stress with an\nanisotropic growth response. To test this, we develop a continuum model which\nassumes the spatial uniformity of cell proliferation in the wing disc and\npredicts compression in the disc center, tension in its periphery, and a\nsigmoidal evolution of the disc size, all of which have been observed in\nexperiments. We further show that the addition of a basal growth term is\nnecessary for the wing disc to always reach the same size. Contrary to the\ncurrent paradigm, our results suggest that local mechanical feedback is the\nprimary mechanism in regulating the final disc size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Nov 2020 12:08:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Erlich", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00829", "submitter": "Christophe Bastien", "authors": "Christophe Bastien, Clive Neal-Sturgess, Huw Davies", "title": "A Generic Trauma Severity Computer Method Applied to Pedestrian\n  Collisions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the real world, the severity of traumatic injuries are measured using the\nAbbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). However the AIS scale cannot currently be\ncomputed by using finite element human computer models, which calculate a\nmaximum principal strains (MPS). Further, MPS only establishes a threshold\nabove which a serious or fatal injury occurs. In order to overcome these\nlimitations, a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able to calculate the threat to\nlife of any organ injury is proposed. The focus, in this case is on real world\npedestrian brain injuries. The OTM uses a power method, named Peak Virtual\nPower (PVP), and defines brain white and grey matters trauma responses as a\nfunction of impact location and impact speed extracted from the pedestrian\ncollision kinematics. This research has included ageing in the injury severity\ncomputation by including soft tissue material degradation, as well as brain\nvolume changes. Further, to account for the limitations of the Lagrangian\nformulation of the brain model in representing haemorrhage, an approach to\ninclude the effects of subdural hematoma is proposed and included as part of\nthe OTM predictions in this study. The OTM model was tested against three\nreal-life pedestrian accidents and has proven to reasonably predict the Post\nMortem (PM) outcome. Its AIS predictions are closer to the real world injury\nseverity than standard MPS methods currently recommended. This study suggests\nthat the OTM has the potential to improve forensic predictions as well as\ncontribute to the improvement in vehicle safety design through the ability to\nmeasure injury severity. This study concludes that future advances in trauma\ncomputing would require the development of a brain model which could predict\nhaemorrhaging.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2020 08:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bastien", "Christophe", ""], ["Neal-Sturgess", "Clive", ""], ["Davies", "Huw", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.01002", "submitter": "Alvason Zhenhua Li", "authors": "Alvason Zhenhua Li, Karsten Eichholz, Anton Sholukh, Daniel Stone,\n  Michelle A.

The air--mucus interaction plays an important role in\ncough and in chest physiotherapy (CP). The conditions under which it induces a\ndisplacement of the mucus are still unclear. Yet, the air--mucus interaction\njustifies common technics of CP used to help the draining of the mucus in\nprevalent diseases. Hence, the determination of the distribution of the shear\nstress in the lung is crucial for understanding the effects of these therapies\nand, potentially, improve their efficiency. We develop a mathematical model to\nstudy the distribution of the wall shear stress (WSS) induced by an air flow\nexiting an airway tree. This model accounts for the main physical processes\nthat determines the WSS, more particularly the compliance of the airways, the\nair inertia and the tree structure. We show that the WSS distribution in the\ntree depends on the dynamics of the airways deformation and on the air inertia.\nThe WSS distribution in the tree exhibits a maximum whose amplitude and\nlocation depend on the amount of air flow and on the \"tissue\" pressure\nsurrounding the airways. To characterize the behavior of the WSS at the tree\nbifurcations, we derive new analytical criteria related to the airway size\nreduction in the bifurcations. Our results suggest that a tuning of the airflow\nand of the tissue pressure during a CP maneuver might allow to control, at\nleast partially, the air--mucus interaction in the lung.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Nov 2020 09:37:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["St\u00e9phano", "Jonathan", ""], ["Mauroy", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.10372", "submitter": "Umar Ahmad Dr.", "authors": "Umar Ahmad, Buhari Ibrahim, Mustapha Mohammed, Ahmed Faris Aldoghachi,\n  Mahmood Usman, Abdulbasit Haliru Yakubu, Abubakar Sadiq Tanko, Khadijat\n  Abubakar Bobbo, Usman Adamu Garkuwa, Abdullahi Adamu Faggo, Sagir Mustapha,\n  Mahmoud Al-Masaeed, Syahril Abdullah, Yong Yoke Keong, Abhi Veerakumarasivam", "title": "Transcriptome profiling research in urothelial cell carcinoma", "comments": "47 pages, 2 figures, 2 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC) is the ninth most common cancer that accounts\nfor 4.7% of all the new cancer cases globally.
