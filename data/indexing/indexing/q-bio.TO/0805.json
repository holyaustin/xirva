Antitachycardia pacing is the\nonly low energy defibrillation approach to have gained clinical significance,\nbut it is still suboptimal. Low energy defibrillation would avoid adverse side\neffects associated with high voltage shocks and allow the application of ICD\ntherapy where it is not tolerated today. We present results of computer\nsimulations of a bidomain model of cardiac tissue with human atrial ionic\nkinetics. Re-entry was initiated and low energy shocks were applied with the\nsame period as the re-entry, using feedback to maintain resonance. We\ndemonstrate that such stimulation can move the core of re-entrant patterns, in\nthe direction depending on location of electrodes and a time delay in the\nfeedback. Termination of re-entry is achieved with shock strength one order of\nmagnitude weaker than in conventional single-shock defibrillation. We conclude\nthat resonant drift pacing can terminate re-entry at a fraction of the shock\nstrength currently used for defibrillation and can potentially work where\nantitachycardia pacing fails, due to the feedback mechanisms. Success depends\non a number of details which these numerical simulations have uncovered.\n\\emph{Keywords} Re-entry; Bidomain model; Resonant drift; ICD; Defibrillation;\nAntitachycardia pacing; Feedback.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2008 12:48:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2008 15:35:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Morgan", "S.

Yet, while complex\nnetworks have been comprehensively investigated along the last decade in terms\nof their topological measurements, relatively less attention has been focused\non the characterization of the respective dynamics. Introduced recently, the\ndiversity entropy of complex systems can provide valuable information about the\nrespective possible unfolding of dynamics. In the case of self-avoiding random\nwalks, the situation assumed here, the diversity measurement allows one to\nquantify in how many different places an agent may effectively arrive after a\ngiven number of steps from its initial activity. Because this measurement is\nhighly affected by border effects frequently found as a consequence of network\nsampling, it becomes critical to devise means for sound estimation of the\ndiversity without being affected by this type of artifacts. We describe such an\nalgorithm and illustrate its potential with respect to the characterization of\nthe self-avoiding random walk dynamics in two real-world networks, namely bone\ncanals and air transportation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 May 2008 13:14:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Viana", "Matheus P.", ""], ["Travencolo", "Bruno A.

This paper proposes a new coupled\nloading-rate hypothesis for the traumatic brain injury (TBI), which states that\nthe main cause of the TBI is an external Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an\nimpulsive loading that strikes the head in several coupled degrees-of-freedom\nsimultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force\nlaw, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of brain's micro-motions\nwithin the cerebrospinal fluid and derive from it the coupled SE(3)-jolt\ndynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is a cause of the TBI in two forms of brain's rapid\ndiscontinuous deformations: translational dislocations and rotational\ndisclinations. Brain's dislocations and disclinations, caused by the\nSE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum\nbrain model.\n  Keywords: Traumatic brain injuries, coupled loading-rate hypothesis,\nEuclidean jolt, coupled Newton-Euler dynamics, brain's dislocations and\ndisclinations\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2008 06:14:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Sep 2008 04:18:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2008 02:16:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3675", "submitter": "Michael Yampolsky", "authors": "Carolyn M.
