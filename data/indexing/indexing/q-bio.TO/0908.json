One important implication of this study is related to the cancer\nlesion border. In fact, the cancerous normal border line is characterized by\nthe presence of inflammation and its correct discrimination would increase the\naccuracy in delimiting the lesion frontier. Seventy spectra of IFH from 14\npatients were compared to 30 spectra of normal tissue from 6 patients. The\nstatistical analysis was performed with Principal Components Analysis and Soft\nIndependent Modeling Class Analogy methodologies. After studying several\nspectral ranges it was concluded that the best discrimination capability\n(sensibility of 95% and specificity of 100%) was found using the 530 to 580\ncm$^{-1}$ wavenumbers. The bands in this region are related to vibrational\nmodes of Collagen aminoacids Cistine, Cysteine, and Proline and their relevant\ncontribution to the classification probably relies on the extracellular matrix\ndegeneration process occurring in the inflammatory tissues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2009 00:59:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["de Carvalho", "Luis Felipe das Chagas e Silva", ""], ["Bitar", "Renata Andrade", ""], ["Arisawa", "Emilia Angela Loschiavo", ""], ["Brandao", "Adriana Aigotti Haberbeck", ""], ["Honorio", "Kathia Maria", ""], ["Cabral", "Luiz Antonio Guimaraes", ""], ["Martin", "Airton Abrahao", ""], ["Martinho", "Herculano da Silva", ""], ["Almeida", "Janete Dias", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2016", "submitter": "Yifang Fan", "authors": "Yifang Fan, Mushtaq Loan, Yubo Fan, Zongxiang Xu, and Zhiyu Li", "title": "Distribution Principle of Bone Tissue", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using the analytic and experimental techniques we present an exploratory\nstudy of the mass distribution features of the high coincidence of centre of\nmass of heterogeneous bone tissue in vivo and its centroid of geometry\nposition.

We find that networks that\nsolve this task exhibit a hierarchical structure of information processing and\nare of similar complexity as developmental circuits of living cells. Proportion\nregulation is scalable with system size and leads to sharp, precisely localized\nboundaries of gene expression domains, even for large numbers of cells. A\ndetailed analysis of noise-induced dynamics, using a mean-field approximation,\nshows that noise in gene expression states stabilizes (rather than disrupts)\nthe spatial pattern in the presence of cell movements, both for stationary as\nwell as growing systems.

Conduction velocity restitution is the simplest\nnontrivial spatially extended problem in excitable media, and in the case of\ncardiac tissue it is an important tool for prediction of cardiac arrhythmias\nand fibrillation. An idealized conduction velocity restitution curve requires\nsolving a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with periodic boundary conditions, which\nin the cardiac case is very stiff and calls for the use of asymptotic methods.\nWe compare asymptotics of restitution curves in four examples, two generic\nexcitable media models, and two ionic cardiac models. The generic models\ninclude the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo model and its variation by Barkley. They\nare treated with standard singular perturbation techniques. The ionic models\ninclude a simplified \"caricature\" of the Noble (1962) model and the Beeler and\nReuter (1977) model, which lead to non-Tikhonov problems where known asymptotic\nresults do not apply. The Caricature Noble model is considered with particular\ncare to demonstrate the well-posedness of the corresponding boundary-value\nproblem. The developed method for calculation of conduction velocity\nrestitution is then applied to the Beeler-Reuter model. We discuss new\nmathematical features appearing in cardiac ionic models and possible\napplications of the developed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2009 13:38:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2010 15:01:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Simitev", "R.
