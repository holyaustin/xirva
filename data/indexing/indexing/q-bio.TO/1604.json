New difficulties are\nencountered due to the higher polynomial growth, but for regular potentials, we\nretain the continuous dependence on initial and boundary data for the chemical\npotential and for the order parameter in strong norms as established in the\nprevious work. Furthermore, we deduce the well-posedness of a variant of the\nmodel with quasi-static nutrient by rigorously passing to the limit where the\nratio of the nutrient diffusion time-scale to the tumor doubling time-scale is\nsmall.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 15:34:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 14:53:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Garcke", "Harald", ""], ["Lam", "Kei Fong", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.03733", "submitter": "Hender Lopez", "authors": "Luke Coburn, Hender Lopez, Adrian Noppe, Benjamin J.

Pyriproxifen is an analog of\njuvenile hormone, which corresponds in mammals to regulatory molecules\nincluding retinoic acid, a vitamin A metabolite, with which it has\ncross-reactivity and whose application during development causes microcephaly.\nMethoprene, another juvenile hormone analog approved as an insecticide has\nmetabolites that bind to the retinoid X receptor, and causes developmental\ndisorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another example of a retinoid causing\nmicrocephaly in human babies via activation of the retinoid X receptor.\nMoreover, tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer, Sumitomo, widely quoted as\ngiving no evidence for developmental toxicity, actually found some evidence for\nsuch an effect, including low brain mass and arhinencephaly--incomplete\nformation of the anterior cerebral hemispheres--in rat pups. Finally, the\npyriproxyfen use in Brazil is unprecedented--it has never before been applied\nto a water supply on such a scale. Claims that it is not being used in Recife,\nthe epicenter of microcephaly cases, do not distinguish the metropolitan area\nof Recife, where it is widely used, and the municipality, where it is not.\nGiven this combination of information we strongly recommend that the use of\npyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended pending further investigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:35:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Dan", ""], ["Nijhout", "Fred", ""], ["Parens", "Raphael", ""], ["Morales", "Alfredo J.", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.04654", "submitter": "Arianna Bianchi", "authors": "Arianna Bianchi, Kevin J.

Two main hypotheses have been\nproposed: 1) lymphatic capillaries sprout from existing interrupted ones at the\nedge of the wound in analogy to the blood angiogenesis case; 2) lymphatic\nendothelial cells first pool in the wound region following the lymph flow and\nthen, once sufficiently populated, start to form a network.

Despite\nan initial response to therapy, drug resistance remains a problem for some CML\npatients. Recent studies have shown that resistance mutations that preexist\ntreatment can be detected in a substan- tial number of patients, and that this\nmay be associated with eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to\nextend treatment efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted\ntherapies. However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence,\netc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model the\ndynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the impact of\ncombination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in patients with\npreexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization problem to find the\nbest schedule of multiple therapies based on the evolution of CML according to\nour ordinary differential equation model. This resulting optimiza- tion problem\nis nontrivial due to the presence of ordinary different equation constraints\nand integer variables. Our model also incorporates realistic drug toxicity\nconstraints by tracking the dynamics of patient neutrophil counts in response\nto therapy. Using realis- tic parameter estimates, we determine optimal\ncombination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Apr 2016 19:16:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Qie", ""], ["Zhu", "Junfeng", ""], ["Dingli", "David", ""], ["Foo", "Jasmine", ""], ["Leder", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05082", "submitter": "Haralambos Hatzikirou", "authors": "J.

Prominent vasculature-targeting\ntherapies involve functional tumour-associated blood vessel deterioration and\nnormalisation. The former aims at tumour infarction and nutrient deprivation\nmedi- ated by vascular targeting agents that induce occlusion/collapse of\ntumour blood vessels. In contrast, the therapeutic intention of normalising the\nabnormal structure and function of tumour vascular net- works, e.g. via\nalleviating stress-induced vaso-occlusion, is to improve chemo-, immuno- and\nradiation therapy efficacy. Although both strategies have shown therapeutic\npotential, it remains unclear why they often fail to control glioma invasion\ninto the surrounding healthy brain tissue. To shed light on this issue, we\npropose a mathematical model of glioma invasion focusing on the interplay\nbetween the mi- gration/proliferation dichotomy (Go-or-Grow) of glioma cells\nand modulations of the functional tumour vasculature. Vaso-modulatory\ninterventions are modelled by varying the degree of vaso-occlusion. We\ndiscovered the existence of a critical cell proliferation/diffusion ratio that\nseparates glioma invasion re- sponses to vaso-modulatory interventions into two\ndistinct regimes. While for tumours, belonging to one regime, vascular\nmodulations reduce the tumour front speed and increase the infiltration width,\nfor those in the other regime the invasion speed increases and infiltration\nwidth decreases. We show how these in silico findings can be used to guide\nindividualised approaches of vaso-modulatory treatment strategies and thereby\nimprove success rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2016 10:56:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Alfonso", "J.

The ease of clean mucus extraction coupled with\nsimilarities to human mucus rheology also make Chaetopterus mucus a potential\nmodel system for elucidating human mucus mechanics. We use optically trapped\nmicrosphere probes of 2-10 microns, to induce oscillatory strains and measure\nmucus stress response. We show that viscoelastic properties are highly\ndependent on the strain scale (l) with three distinct regimes emerging:\nmicroscale: l_1<4 microns, mesoscale: l_2~4-10 microns, and macroscale: l_3>10\nmicrons. While mucus response is similar to water for l_1 indicating that\nprobes rarely contact the mucus mesh, for l_2 the response is distinctly more\nviscous and independent of probe size, demonstrating that the mucus behaves as\na continuum. However, this principally viscous mesoscale response is distinct\nfrom the largely elastic macroscopic mucus response. Only for l_3 does the\nresponse mimic macroscopic elasticity, with rigid constraints strongly\nresisting microsphere displacement. Our results demonstrate that a uniform mesh\nmodel for mucus with a single lengthscale modulating the crossover from\nwater-like to elastic is too simplistic. Rather, the mucus responds as a\nhierarchical network with a loose microscopic mesh controlling mechanics for\nl_2, coupled with a mesoscale rigid scaffold responsible for the macroscopic\ngel-like mechanics beyond l_3.

The model presents two regimes for tumor\ngrowth. In the first, cancer arises due to three reasons: a partial corruption\nof the functions that avoid the growth of mutated cells, an aggressive\nphenotype of tumor cells and exposure to external carcinogenic factors. In this\ncase, treatments may be effective if they drive the system to the basin of\nattraction of the cancer cure state. In the second regime, cancer arises\nbecause the repair system is intrinsically corrupted. In this case, the\ncomplete cure is not possible since the cancer cure state is no more stable,\nbut tumor recurrence may be delayed if treatment is prolongued. We review three\nindicators of the resilience of a stable equilibrium, related with size and\nshape of its basin of attraction: latitude, precariousness and resistance. A\nnovel method to calculate these indicators is proposed. This method is simpler\nand more efficient than those currently used, and may be easily applied to\nother population dynamics models. We apply this method to the model and\ninvestigate how these indicators behave with parameters changes.
