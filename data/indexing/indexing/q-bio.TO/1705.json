In this work, we describe a novel one-dimensional mathematical model\nof tissue remodelling based on the multiplicative decomposition of the\ndeformation gradient. We express the mechanical effects of remodelling as an\nevolution equation for the 'effective strain', a measure of the difference\nbetween the current state and a hypothetical mechanically-relaxed state of the\ntissue. This morphoelastic model combines the simplicity and interpretability\nof classical viscoelastic models with the versatility of plasticity theory. A\nnovel feature of our model is that while most models describe growth as a\ncontinuous quantity, here we begin with discrete cells and develop a continuum\nrepresentation of lattice remodelling based on an appropriate limit of the\nbehaviour of discrete cells. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we use\nthis framework to capture qualitative aspects of the continual remodelling\nobserved in fibroblast-populated collagen lattices, in particular its\ncontraction and its subsequent sudden re-expansion when remodelling is\ninterrupted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 11:33:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Menon", "Shakti N.", ""], ["Hall", "Cameron L.", ""], ["McCue", "Scott W.", ""], ["McElwain", "D.

One method for assessment involves\npartitioning delineated regions of interest and comparing the relative\ncontributions or importance to clinical outcomes. We show that an intuitive\nmethod for dividing organ contours, compound (sub-)segmentation, can\nunintentionally lead to sub-segments with inconsistent volumes, which will bias\nrelative importance assessment. An improved technique, nested segmentation, is\nintroduced and compared. Methods: Clinical radiotherapy planning parotid\ncontours from 510 patients were segmented. Counts of radiotherapy dose matrix\nvoxels interior to sub-segments were used to determine the equivalency of\nsub-segment volumes. The distribution of voxel counts within sub-segments were\ncompared using Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests and characterized by their dispersion.\nAnalytical solutions for 2D/3D analogues were derived and sub-segment\narea/volume were compared directly. Results: Both parotid and 2D/3D region of\ninterest analogue segmentation confirmed compound segmentation intrinsically\nproduces sub-segments with volumes that depend on the region of interest shape\nand selection location. Significant volume differences were observed when\nsub-segmenting parotid contours into 18ths, and vanishingly small sub-segments\nwere observed when sub-segmenting into 96ths. Central sub-segments were\nconsiderably smaller than sub-segments on the periphery. Nested segmentation\ndid not exhibit these shortcomings and produced sub-segments with equivalent\nvolumes when dose grid and contour collinearity was addressed, even when\ndividing the parotid into 96ths. Nested segmentation was always faster or\nequivalent in runtime to compound segmentation. Conclusions: Nested\nsegmentation is more suited than compound segmentation for analyses requiring\nequal weighting of sub-segments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 22:38:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Clark", "Haley D.", ""], ["Reinsberg", "Stefan A.", ""], ["Moiseenko", "Vitali", ""], ["Wu", "Jonn", ""], ["Thomas", "Steven D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.01856", "submitter": "Ricardo Ruiz Baier I", "authors": "Christian Cherubini, Simonetta Filippi, Alessio Gizzi, Ricardo\n  Ruiz-Baier", "title": "A note on stress-driven anisotropic diffusion and its role in active\n  deformable media", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology (2017)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.07.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a new model to describe diffusion processes within active\ndeformable media.

A custom biaxial mechanical testing\nsystem compatible with multiphoton microscopy (MPM) was used to directly\nmeasure the layer dependent collagen fiber recruitment in bladder tissue from 9\nmale Fischer rats (4 adult and 5 aged).

For\nelastic bladders, as the loading extended into the transition regime, a gradual\ncoordinated recruitment of collagen fibers between the lamina propria and\ndetrusor smooth muscle layers was found.

Two contrasting conceptual\naccounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles\nprovide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here\nthe basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both\nsituated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural\nelongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,\nwhich require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes\nto build.

Here the coordination of activity across extended parts\nof a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of\n(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest\nproto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were\ninitially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the\npatterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present\ncomputational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random\nneural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can\ngenerate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding\nelongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result\nsupports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very\nfirst full neurons and nervous systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 May 2017 09:08:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["de Wiljes", "Oltman O.", ""], ["van Elburg", "Ronald A.

We challenge this current view by means of\nbioinformatic data analysis and computational modelling approaches. Not all the\nmutations are equally important for the development of metastasis. The survival\nof cancer cells from the primary tumour site to the secondary seeding sites\ndepends on the occurrence of very few driver mutations promoting oncogenic cell\nbehaviours and on the order with which these mutations occur. We introduce a\nmodel in the framework of Cellular Automata to investigate the effects of\nmetabolic mutations and mutation order on cancer stemness and tumour cell\nmigration in bone metastasised breast cancers. The metabolism of the cancer\ncell is a key factor in its proliferation rate. Bioinformatics analysis on a\ncancer mutation database shows that metabolism-modifying alterations constitute\nan important class of key cancer mutations. Our approach models three types of\nmutations: drivers, the order of which is relevant for the dynamics, metabolic\nwhich support cancer growth and are estimated from existing databases, and\nnon--driver mutations. Our results provide a quantitative basis of how the\norder of driver mutations and the metabolic mutations in different cancer\nclones could impact proliferation of therapy-resistant clonal populations and\npatient survival. Further mathematical modelling of the order of mutations is\npresented in terms of operators. We believe our work is novel because it\nquantifies two important factors in cancer spreading models: the order of\ndriver mutations and the effects of metabolic mutations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 May 2017 20:41:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Jun 2017 19:38:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ascolani", "Gianluca", ""], ["Li\u00f3", "Pietro", ""]]}]
