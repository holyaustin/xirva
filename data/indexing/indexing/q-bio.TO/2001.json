Given the large size of these images and the increase\nin the number of potential cancer cases, an automated solution as an aid to\nhistopathologists is highly desirable. In the recent past, deep learning-based\ntechniques have provided state of the art results in a wide variety of image\nanalysis tasks, including analysis of digitized slides. However, the size of\nimages and variability in histopathology tasks makes it a challenge to develop\nan integrated framework for histopathology image analysis. We propose a deep\nlearning-based framework for histopathology tissue analysis. We demonstrate the\ngeneralizability of our framework, including training and inference, on several\nopen-source datasets, which include CAMELYON (breast cancer metastases),\nDigestPath (colon cancer), and PAIP (liver cancer) datasets. We discuss\nmultiple types of uncertainties pertaining to data and model, namely aleatoric\nand epistemic, respectively. Simultaneously, we demonstrate our model\ngeneralization across different data distribution by evaluating some samples on\nTCGA data. On CAMELYON16 test data (n=139) for the task of lesion detection,\nthe FROC score achieved was 0.86 and in the CAMELYON17 test-data (n=500) for\nthe task of pN-staging the Cohen's kappa score achieved was 0.9090 (third in\nthe open leaderboard). On DigestPath test data (n=212) for the task of tumor\nsegmentation, a Dice score of 0.782 was achieved (fourth in the challenge). On\nPAIP test data (n=40) for the task of viable tumor segmentation, a Jaccard\nIndex of 0.75 (third in the challenge) was achieved, and for viable tumor\nburden, a score of 0.633 was achieved (second in the challenge).

To aim for understanding\nthe mechanisms of the synergy of the combination therapy, simultaneous delivery\nof C. novyi-NT and chemotherapeutic agents in tumors is mathematically modeled\nfrom porous media approach.

The simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors by\nthe combination of Doxil and C. novyi-NT is over twice higher than that of\nDoxil alone, as observed in previous experimental literature. This enhanced\nconcentration is because of the degradation of extracellular matrix of collagen\nby bacterial proteolytic activity, which reduced interstitial fluid pressure in\ntumors by increasing hydraulic conductivity of interstitium, and thus increases\nconvection through vessel walls. Additionally, solid stress alleviation caused\nby collagen degradation increases vessel density by decompressing blood\nvessels. On the other hand, the simulated doxorubicin concentration in tumors\nfor non-liposomal doxorubicin is not enhanced by C. novyi-NT because vascular\npermeability of free-doxorubicin is larger than Doxil, and thus, increased but\nrelatively small convection across vessel walls is outweighed by the efflux due\nto increased interstitial flow.

Using TCSPC, e.g., for the purpose of\nfluorescence lifetime measurements, is often limited in speed due to dead-time\nlosses and pile-up. We show that this limitation can be lifted by reducing the\ndead-time of the timing electronics to the absolute minimum imposed by the\nspeed of the detector signals while maintaining high temporal resolution. A\ncomplementing approach to speedy data acquisition is parallelization by means\nof simultaneous readout of many detector channels. This puts high demands on\nthe data throughput of the TCSPC system, especially in time tagging of\nindividual photon arrivals. Here, we present a new design approach, supporting\nup to 16 input channels, an extremely short dead-time of 650 ps, very high time\ntagging throughput, and a timing resolution of 80 ps. In order to facilitate\nremote synchronization of multiple such instruments with highest precision, the\nnew TCSPC electronics provide an interface for White Rabbit fiber optic\nnetworks. Beside fundamental research in the field of astronomy, such remote\nsynchronization tasks arise routinely in quantum communication networks with\nnode to node distances on the order of tens of kilometers.

Drosophila embryogenesis, widely used as a\ndevelopmental paradigm, presents an example for such a challenge, especially\nwhere cell outlines need to imaged - a general challenge in other systems as\nwell. To deal with the current bottleneck in analyzing quantitatively the 3D+t\nlight-sheet microscopy images of Drosophila embryos, we developed a collection\nof semi-automatic open-source tools. The presented methods include a\nsemi-automatic masking procedure, automatic projection of non-convex 3D\nisosurfaces to 2D representations as well as cell segmentation and tracking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2020 17:36:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Bhide", "Sourabh", ""], ["Mikut", "Ralf", ""], ["Leptin", "Maria", ""], ["Stegmaier", "Johannes", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11589", "submitter": "Gurcan Comert", "authors": "Nurullah Arslan, Kazim Besirli, Gurcan Comert, Omer F Beyca", "title": "Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulations In a Model of a Carotid\n  Bifurcation Under Steady Flow Conditions", "comments": "4 Pages, 7 figures, 4th International Advanced Technologies Symposium\n  September 28 30, 2005, Konya, Turkey", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.flu-dyn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Strokes are still one of the leading causes for death after heart diseases\nand cancer in all over the world. Most strokes happen because an artery that\ncarries blood uphill from the heart to the head gets clogged. Most of the time,\nas with heart attacks, the problem is atherosclerosis, hardening of the\narteries, calcified buildup of fatty deposits on the vessel wall. The primary\ntroublemaker is the carotid artery, one on each side of the neck, the main\nthoroughfare for blood to the brain. Only within the last 25 years, though,\nhave researchers been able to put their finger on why the carotid is especially\nsusceptible to atherosclerosis. In this study, the fluid dynamic simulations\nwere done in a carotid bifurcation under the steady flow conditions\ncomputationally. In vivo geometry and boundary conditions were obtained from a\ndiseased who has both sides of stenosis located in his carotid artery patients.\nThe location of critical flow fields such as low wall shear stress (WSS),\nstagnation regions and separation regions were detected. Low WSS was found at\nthe downstream of the bifurcation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 15:00:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Arslan", "Nurullah", ""], ["Besirli", "Kazim", ""], ["Comert", "Gurcan", ""], ["Beyca", "Omer F", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.11663", "submitter": "Yanjun Yang", "authors": "Yanjun Yang and Herbert Levine", "title": "Leader-cell-driven epithelial sheet fingering", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collective cell migration is crucial in many biological processes such as\nwound healing, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor progression. The leading front\nof a collective migrating epithelial cell layer often destabilizes into\nmulticellular finger-like protrusions, each of which is guided by a leader cell\nat the fingertip. Here, we develop a subcellular-element-based model of this\nfingering instability, which incorporates leader cells and other related\nproperties of a monolayer of epithelial cells. Our model recovers multiple\naspects of the dynamics, especially the traction force patterns and velocity\nfields, observed in experiments on MDCK cells. Our model predicts the necessity\nof the leader cell and its minimal functions for the formation and maintenance\nof a stable finger pattern. Meanwhile, our model allows for an analysis of the\nrole of supra-cellular actin cable on the leading front, predicting that while\nthis observed structure helps maintain the shape of the finger, it is not\nrequired in order to form a finger. In addition, we also study the driving\ninstability in the context of continuum active fluid model, which justifies\nsome of our assumptions in the computational approach. In particular, we show\nthat in our model no finger protrusions would emerge in a phenotypically\nhomogenous active fluid and hence the role of the leader cell and its followers\nare often critical.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 05:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 02:39:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yanjun", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""]]}]
