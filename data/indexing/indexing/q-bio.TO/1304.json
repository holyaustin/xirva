However the generality of this response across T. gondii strains and the\nunderlying mechanism for this pathogen mediated behavioral change remain\nunknown. To begin exploring these questions, we evaluated the effects of\ninfection with two previously uninvestigated isolates from the three major\nNorth American clonal lineages of T. gondii, Type III and an attenuated strain\nof Type I. Using an hour-long open field activity assay optimized for this\npurpose, we measured mouse aversion toward predator and non-predator urines. We\nshow that loss of innate aversion of cat urine is a general trait caused by\ninfection with any of the three major clonal lineages of parasite.\nSurprisingly, we found that infection with the attenuated Type I parasite\nresults in sustained loss of aversion at times post infection when neither\nparasite nor ongoing brain inflammation were detectable. This suggests that T.\ngondii-mediated interruption of mouse innate aversion toward cat urine may\noccur during early acute infection in a permanent manner, not requiring\npersistence of parasitecysts or continuing brain inflammation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2013 20:53:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 21:08:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ingram", "Wendy Marie", ""], ["Goodrich", "Leeanne M", ""], ["Robey", "Ellen A", ""], ["Eisen", "Michael B", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.1054", "submitter": "Eunjung  Kim", "authors": "Eunjung Kim, Vito Rebecca, Inna V.

As such, the skin must maintain a homeostatic\nbalance in the face of many microenvironmental and genetic perturbations. At\nits simplest, skin homeostasis is maintained by the balance between skin cell\ngrowth and death such that skin architecture is preserved. This study presents\na hybrid multiscale mathematical model of normal skin (vSkin). The model\nfocuses on key cellular and microenvironmental variables that regulate\nhomeostatic interactions among keratinocytes, melanocytes and fibroblasts, key\ncomponents of the skin. The model recapitulates normal skin structure, and is\nrobust enough to withstand physical as well as biochemical perturbations.\nFurthermore, the vSkin model revealed the important role of the skin\nmicroenvironment in melanoma initiation and progression. Our experiments showed\nthat dermal fibroblasts, which are an important source of growth factors in the\nskin, adopt a phenotype that facilitates cancer cell growth and invasion when\nthey become senescent. Based on these experimental results, we incorporated\nsenescent fibroblasts into vSkin model and showed that senescent fibroblasts\ntransform the skin microenvironment and enhance the growth and invasion of\nnormal melanocytes as well as early stage melanoma cells. These predictions are\nconsistent with our experimental results as well as clinical observations. Our\nco-culture experiments show that the senescent fibroblasts promote the growth\nand invasion of non-tumorigenic melanoma cells. We also observed increased\nproteolytic activity in stromal fields adjacent to melanoma lesions in human\nhistology. Collectively, senescent fibroblasts create a pro-oncogenic\nenvironment that synergizes with mutations to drive melanoma initiation and\nprogression and should therefore be considered as a potential future\ntherapeutic target.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 18:55:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Eunjung", ""], ["Rebecca", "Vito", ""], ["Fedorenko", "Inna V.", ""], ["Messina", "Jane L.", ""], ["Mathew", "Rahel", ""], ["Maria-Engler", "Silvya S.", ""], ["Basanta", "David", ""], ["Smalley", "Keiran S.

We derive a differential equation governing this evolution and show,\nfor given assumptions about growth and invasion, that there is a unique\ndistribution which does not vary with time. Further, we show that any initial\ndistribution converges to this stationary distribution exponentially quickly.\nIt is therefore reasonable to assume that the stationary distribution is equal\nto the true DCIS size distribution, at least for human populations which are\nrelatively stable with respect to the determinants of breast cancer. Based on\nthis assumption and the size data of 110 DCIS lesions detected in a\nmammographic screening program between 1993 and 2000, we produce maximum\nlikelihood estimates for certain growth and invasion parameters. Assuming that\nDCIS size is proportional to a positive power $p$ of the time since tumour\ninitiation we estimate $p$ to be 0.50 with a 95% confidence interval of $(0.35,\n0.71)$.

The HM is conceptualized as an ecological organism that `colonizes' the\nresource zone of the plant cells driven by the potential supplied by the higher\nHM concentration in the substrate. The infinite occupation by the HM is limited\nby the eventual saturation of the cellular binding sites. The solution of the\ndifferential equation results in the logistic equation, the r-K model.

The model fitted the experimental Cp- Cs\nprofiles well. The r, K parameter values and secondary quantities derived from\nthem, allowed a quantification of the number of Cu binding sites per cell at\nsaturation, the sensitivities (affinities) of these sites for Cu in the 3\nexperimental systems as well as the extraction of information related to the\nsubstrate phyto-availability of the Cu.
