The foundational idea of the\nstudy is that growth of cells, organs, systems and whole organisms, besides\nbiomolecular machinery, is influenced by biophysical mechanisms acting at\ndifferent scale levels. In particular, the general growth law uniquely defines\ndistribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass\nsynthesis at each phase of growth and at each scale level. We exemplify the\napproach considering metabolic properties of growing human and dog livers and\nliver transplants. A procedure for verification of obtained results has been\nintroduced too. We found that two examined dogs have high metabolic rates\nconsuming about 0.62 and 1 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per\nday, and verified this using the proposed verification procedure. We also\nevaluated consumption rate of nutrients in human livers, determining it to be\nabout 0.088 gram of nutrients per cubic centimeter of liver per day for males,\nand about 0.098 for females. This noticeable difference can be explained by\nevolutionary development, which required females to have greater liver\nprocessing capacity to support pregnancy. We also found how much nutrients go\nto biomass synthesis and maintenance at each phase of liver and liver\ntransplant growth. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed approach can\nbe used for finding metabolic characteristics of cells, organs, and whole\norganisms, which can further serve as important inputs for many applications in\nbiology (protein expression), biotechnology (synthesis of substances), and\nmedicine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 01:02:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Shestopaloff", "Yuri K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.05640", "submitter": "Giuseppe Tronci", "authors": "M.

The bulk modulus,\n$B$, of the lung is also derived from these calculations.

These diseases are characterized by\nparticular alterations in the $P-V$ relationship. For example, in fibrotic\nlungs $B$ increases monotonically with disease progression, while in emphysema\nthe opposite occurs.
