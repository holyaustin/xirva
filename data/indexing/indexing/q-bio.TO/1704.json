While it is\nunlikely that in silico tests will replace actual physical tests in the\nforeseeable future, a judicious combination of both approaches can help making\nboth implant design and pre-clinical testing quicker and more cost-effective.\n  The challenge today for the design of simulation methods is to obtain results\nthat convey quantitative information, and to do so quickly and reliably.

As the ISO 14243-1 standard is\nprecisely defined and publicly available, it can serve as an excellent\nbenchmark for comparison of wear simulation methods. Our novel contact\nalgorithm works without Lagrange multipliers and penalty methods, achieving\nunparalleled stability and efficiency. We compare our simulation results with\nthe experimental data from physical tests using two different actual TKRs, each\ntest being performed three times.
