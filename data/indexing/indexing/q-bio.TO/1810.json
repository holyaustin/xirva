In order to gain a deeper\nunderstanding of the tumour invasion process, we pay special attention to the\ninteracting dynamics between the cancer cell population and various\nconstituents of the surrounding tumour microenvironment. To that end, we\nconsider the key role that ECM plays within the human body tissue, providing\nnot only structure and support to surrounding cells, but also acting as a\nplatform for cells communication and spatial movement. There are several other\nvital structures within the ECM, however we are going to focus primarily on\nfibrous proteins, such as fibronectin. These fibres play a crucial role in\ntumour progression, enabling the anchorage of tumour cells to the ECM. In this\nwork we consider the two-scale dynamic cross-talk between cancer cells and a\ntwo component ECM (consisting of both a fibre and a non-fibre phase). To that\nend, we incorporate the interlinked two-scale dynamics of cells-ECM\ninteractions within the tumour support that contributes simultaneously both to\ncell-adhesion and to the dynamic rearrangement and restructuring of the ECM\nfibres. Furthermore, this is embedded within a multiscale moving boundary\napproach for the invading cancer cell population, in the presence of\ncell-adhesion at the tissue scale and cell-scale fibre redistribution activity\nand leading edge matrix degrading enzyme molecular proteolytic processes.

Here, we targeted EGFR on the ovarian carcinoma\ncell line OVCAR-3 with AuNPs. In order to optimize membrane permeability and to\ndemonstrate molecule delivery into adherent OVCAR-3 cells, we systematically\ninvestigated different experimental conditions. Materials and methods: AuNPs\n(30 nm) were functionalized by conjugation of the antibody cetuximab against\nEGFR. Selective binding of the particles was demonstrated by silver staining,\nmultiphoton imaging, and fluorescence-lifetime imaging. After laser\nirradiation, membrane permeability of OVCAR-3 cells was studied under different\nconditions of AuNP concentration, cell-incubation medium, and cell - AuNP\nincubation time. Membrane permeability and cell viability were evaluated by\nflow cytometry, measuring propidium iodide and fluorescein isothiocyanate -\ndextran uptake. Results: Adherently growing OVCAR-3 cells can be effectively\ntargeted with EGFR-AuNP. Laser irradiation led to successful permeabilization,\nand 150 kDa dextran was successfully delivered into cells with about 70%\nefficiency.

However, quantification of body composition\nrequires an accurate segmentation of fat, muscle and other tissues from MR\nimages, which remains a challenging goal due to the intensity overlap between\nthem. In this study, we propose a fully automated, data-driven image\nsegmentation platform that addresses multiple difficulties in segmenting MR\nimages such as varying inhomogeneity, non-standardness, and noise, while\nproducing high-quality definition of different tissues. In contrast to most\napproaches in the literature, we perform segmentation operation by combining\nthree different MRI contrasts and a novel segmentation tool which takes into\naccount variability in the data. The proposed system, based on a novel affinity\ndefinition within the fuzzy connectivity (FC) image segmentation family,\nprevents the need for user intervention and reparametrization of the\nsegmentation algorithms. In order to make the whole system fully automated, we\nadapt an affinity propagation clustering algorithm to roughly identify tissue\nregions and image background. We perform a thorough evaluation of the proposed\nalgorithm's individual steps as well as comparison with several approaches from\nthe literature for the main application of muscle/fat separation. Furthermore,\nwhole-body tissue composition and brain tissue delineation were conducted to\nshow the generalization ability of the proposed system.

Mathematical models describing the auxin-related signalling\npathway, PIN and AUX1 dynamics, auxin transport, and cell growth in plant\ntissues are derived.

Changes\nin auxin-related signalling processes are shown to be able to trigger\ntransition between passage and spot type patterns in auxin distribution. The\nmodel was also shown to be able to generate isolated cells with oscillatory\ndynamics in levels of components of the auxin signalling pathway which could\nexplain oscillations in levels of ARF targets that have been observed\nexperimentally.

Cell-based models represent individual\ncells as single particles or as sets of interconnected particles, and predict\nthe collective cell behavior that follows from a set of interaction rules. In\nparticular, vertex-based models are a popular tool for studying the mechanics\nof confluent, epithelial cell layers.
