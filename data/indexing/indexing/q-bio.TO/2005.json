A growing leaf is an example of such a system: it increases its area by\norders of magnitude, maintaining a proper (usually flat) shape. How can this be\nachieved without a central control unit? One would think that a combination of\nuniform growth with viscoelastic rheology would allow that. Here we show that\nthat the exact opposite process is in action: the natural growth of the leaf\nsurface strongly fluctuates in time and position. By combining high resolution\nmeasurements and multi-scale statistical analysis, we suggest a paradigm-change\nin the way leaf growth is viewed. We measure the in-plane tissue growth of\nTobacco leaves in Lagrangian coordinates in 3D and study the statistics of\nthree scalar fields associated with the tensorial growth field: The growth\nrate, its isotropy and directionality. We identify the governing time and\nlength scales of the fluctuations in the growth rate, and capture abundant\nswitching between local area swelling and shrinking, when measured in high\nresolution. At lower spatio-temporal resolution the growth rate field becomes\nsmooth. In contrast, the anisotropy field increases over time. Finally, we find\nsignificant differences between growth measured during day and night. The\ngrowth at night is found to be more intermittent, with shorter correlation\nlengths and no global directionality. Despite its fluctuative nature, growth\nfields are not random, thus carry information about growth regulation. Indeed,\nmechanical analysis shows that a growing leaf can stay flat only if the\nmeasured fluctuations are regulated/correlated.

The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

We utilise simple simulations\nof a population of individual cells in space to examine how changes in\nmechanical properties of invasive cells and their surroundings can affect the\nspeed of cell migration. We also find that the growth rate of large lesions\ndepends weakly on the migration speed of escaping cells, and has stronger and\nmore complex dependencies on the rates of other stochastic processes in the\nmodel, namely the rate at which cells transition to being motile and the\nreverse rate at which cells cease to be motile.\n  To examine how the rates of growth and evolution of an ensemble of cancerous\nlesions depends on their geometry and underlying fitness landscape, we develop\nan analytical framework in which the spatial structure is coarse grained and\nthe cancer treated as a continuously growing system with stochastic migration\nevents. Both approaches conclude that the whole ensemble can undergo\nmigration-driven exponential growth regardless of the dependence of size on\ntime of individual lesions, and that the relationship between growth rate and\nrate of migration is determined by the geometrical constraints of individual\nlesions. We also find that linear fitness landscapes result in\nfaster-than-exponential growth of the ensemble, and we can determine the\nexpected number of driver mutations present in several important cases of the\nmodel.\n  Finally, we study data from a clinical study of the effectiveness of a new\nlow-dose combined chemotherapy. This enables us to test some important\nhypotheses about the growth rate of pancreatic cancers and the speed with which\nevolution occurs in reality. Despite this, we find that the frequency of\nresistant mutants is far too high to be explained without resorting to novel\nmechanisms of cross-resistance to multiple drugs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2020 17:15:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Paterson", "Chay", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.10055", "submitter": "Antonio Juli\\`a", "authors": "Antonio Juli\\`a, Irene Bonafonte, Antonio G\\'omez, Mar\\'ia\n  L\\'opez-Lasanta, Mireia L\\'opez-Corbeto, Sergio H.

This cytokine storm can cause\nmultiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to\nidentify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based\non previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell\nco-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy\nagainst progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this\nhypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we\ngenerated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a\nCD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated\nwith COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many\nof the biological processes that have been consistently associated with\nCOVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including\nthe downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous\ntranscriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the\nresponse to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by\nCOVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a\nsignificant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+\nantigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production.

This model suggests that the localization of the transition between a\nconvective and a diffusive transport of the respiratory gas determines how\nventilation should be controlled to minimize its energetic cost at any\nmetabolic regime. We generalized this model to any mammal, based on the core\nmorphometric characteristics shared by all mammals' lungs and on their\nallometric scaling from the literature. Since the main energetic costs of\nventilation are related to the convective transport, we prove that, for all\nmammals, the localization of the shift from a convective transport into a\ndiffusive transport plays a critical role on keeping that cost low while\nfulfilling the lung function. Our model predicts for the first time the\nlocalization of the transition in order to minimize the energetic cost of\nventilation, depending on the mammals' mass and on the metabolic regime. From\nthat optimal localization, we are able to predict allometric scaling laws for\nboth tidal volumes and breathing rates, at any metabolic regime. We ran our\nmodel for the three common metabolic rates -- basal, field and maximal -- and\nshowed that our predictions reproduce accurately the experimental data\navailable in the literature. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the\nmammals' allometric scaling laws of tidal volumes and breathing rates at a\ngiven metabolic rate are driven by a few core geometrical characteristics\nshared by the mammals' lungs and by the physical processes of the respiratory\ngas transport.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2020 22:17:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 12:16:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:26:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2021 14:50:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 09:41:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["No\u00ebl", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique", ""], ["Karamaoun", "Cyril", ""], ["Dempsey", "Jerome A.", ""], ["Mauroy", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12402", "submitter": "Eric Jones", "authors": "Eric W.

In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate\nand adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model.\nThis model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a\nshape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and\nexhibits three steady states -- health, septic death, and chronic inflammation\n-- qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model,\nthe immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence\nof pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a\nproxy for the \"age\" of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen\nencounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen\nwill cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic\ninflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of \"inflammaging\", a\ncondition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade\ninflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the\nonset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered\npathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of\ninfections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate\nand adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen\nclearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2020 01:10:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Aug 2020 21:28:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Eric W.", ""], ["Sheng", "Jiming", ""], ["Carlson", "Jean M.", ""], ["Wang", "Shenshen", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13112", "submitter": "Cristian Tomasetti", "authors": "Haley Grant Yifan Zhang, Lu Li, Yan Wang, Satomi Kawamoto, Sophie\n  P\\'enisson, Daniel F.
