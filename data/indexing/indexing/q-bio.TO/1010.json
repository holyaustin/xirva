In this work, we apply the method of generalized\nmodelling to systematically analyse a large class of models of bone remodeling.\nOur analysis shows that osteoblast precursors can play an important role in the\nregulation of bone remodeling. Further, we find that the parameter regime most\nlikely realized in nature lies very close to bifurcation lines, marking\nqualitative changes in the dynamics. Although proximity to a bifurcation\nfacilitates adaptive responses to changing external conditions, it entails the\ndanger of losing dynamical stability. Some evidence implicates such dynamical\ntransitions as a potential mechanism leading to forms of Paget's disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Oct 2010 19:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 16:58:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zumsande", "Martin", ""], ["Stiefs", "Dirk", ""], ["Siegmund", "Stefan", ""], ["Gross", "Thilo", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1965", "submitter": "Edoardo Milotti", "authors": "Edoardo Milotti and Roberto Chignola", "title": "Emergent Properties of Tumor Microenvironment in a Real-life Model of\n  Multicell Tumor Spheroids", "comments": "20 pages, 10 figures.

It simulates tree growth plasticity in response to changes of their\ninternal level of trophic competition, especially topological development and\ncambial growth. The model includes a simplified representation of tree\narchitecture, based on a species-specific description of branching patterns. We\nstudy whether those simplifications allow enough flexibility to reproduce with\nthe same set of parameters the growth of two observed understorey beech trees\n(Fagus sylvatica L.) of different ages in different environmental conditions.\nThe parametric identification of the model is global, i.e. all parameters are\nestimated simultaneously, potentially providing a better description of\ninteractions between sub-processes. As a result, the source-sink dynamics\nthroughout tree development is retrieved. Simulated and measured trees were\ncompared for their trunk profiles (fresh masses and dimensions of every growth\nunits, ring diameters at different heights) and compartment masses of their\norder 2 branches. Possible improvements of this method by including topological\ncriteria are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Oct 2010 14:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Letort", "Veronique", "", "MAS"], ["Courn\u00e8de", "Paul-Henry", "", "MAS"], ["Mathieu", "Am\u00e9lie", "", "MAS, EGC"], ["De Reffye", "Philippe", "", "CIRAD"], ["Constant", "Thi\u00e9ry", "", "LERFOB"]]}]
