In this paper we present an algorithm for\ncalculating the exact concentration of resource at any point in space or time,\ngiven that the resource in the network is lost or delivered out of the network\nat a given rate, while being subject to advection and diffusion. We consider\nthe implications of advection, diffusion and delivery for simple models of\nglucose delivery through a vascular network, and conclude that in certain\ncircumstances, increasing the volume of blood and the number of glucose\ntransporters can actually decrease the total rate of glucose delivery. We also\nconsider the case of empirically determined fungal networks, and analyze the\ndistribution of resource that emerges as such networks grow over time. Fungal\ngrowth involves the expansion of fluid filled vessels, which necessarily\ninvolves the movement of fluid. In three empirically determined fungal networks\nwe found that the minimum currents consistent with the observed growth would\neffectively transport resource throughout the network over the time-scale of\ngrowth. This suggests that in foraging fungi, the active transport mechanisms\nobserved in the growing tips may not be required for long range transport.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 12:01:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2011 11:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Heaton", "Luke L.

Holographic optical tweezers and\nsingle-cell force spectroscopy were used to study potential cell-cell adhesion\nbetween RBCs. Irreversible intercellular adhesion of RBCs could be induced by\nstimulation with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a compound known to be released\nby activated platelets. We identified Ca2+ as an essential player in the\nsignaling cascade by directly inducing Ca2+ influx using A23187. Elevation of\nthe internal Ca2+ concentration leads to an intercellular adhesion of RBCs\nsimilar to that induced by LPA stimulation. Using single-cell force\nspectroscopy, the adhesion of the RBCs was identified to be approximately 100\npN, a value large enough to be of significance inside a blood clot or in\npathological situations like the vasco-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease\npatients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2011 20:38:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Steffen", "Patrick", ""], ["Jung", "Achim", ""], ["Nguyen", "Duc Bach", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Torsten", ""], ["Bernhardt", "Ingolf", ""], ["Kaestner", "Lars", ""], ["Wagner", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5061", "submitter": "Peter Lunkenheimer", "authors": "M.

The dielectric properties of human blood are\nstudied using broadband dielectric spectroscopy, systematically investigating\nthe dependence on temperature and hematocrit value. By covering a frequency\nrange from 1 Hz to 40 GHz, information on all the typical dispersion regions of\nbiological matter is obtained. We find no evidence for a low-frequency\nrelaxation (alpha-relaxation) caused, e.g., by counterion diffusion effects as\nreported for some types of biological matter. The analysis of a strong\nMaxwell-Wagner relaxation arising from the polarization of the cell membranes\nin the 1-100 MHz region (beta-relaxation) allows for the test of model\npredictions and the determination of various intrinsic cell properties. In the\nmicrowave region beyond 1 GHz, the reorientational motion of water molecules in\nthe blood plasma leads to another relaxation feature (gamma-relaxation).\nBetween beta- and gamma-relaxation, significant dispersion is observed, which,\nhowever, can be explained by a superposition of these relaxation processes and\nis not due to an additional delta-relaxation often found in biological matter.\nOur measurements provide dielectric data on human blood of so far unsurpassed\nprecision for a broad parameter range. All data are provided in electronic form\nto serve as basis for the calculation of the absorption rate of electromagnetic\nradiation and other medical purposes. Moreover, by investigating an\nexceptionally broad frequency range, valuable new information on the dynamic\nprocesses in blood is obtained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 15:18:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wolf", "M.", ""], ["Gulich", "R.", ""], ["Lunkenheimer", "P.", ""], ["Loidl", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5093", "submitter": "Pascal Buenzli", "authors": "P.
