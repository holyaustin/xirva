In this study, acoustic emissions were\nrecorded during severe dehydration in lavender plants and compared to the\ndynamics of embolism development and cell lysis. The timing and characteristics\nof acoustic signals from two independent recording systems were compared by\nprincipal component analysis. In parallel, changes in water potential, branch\ndiameter, loss of hydraulic conductance and electrolyte leakage were measured\nto quantify drought-induced damages. Two distinct phases of acoustic emissions\nwere observed during dehydration: the first one associated with a rapid loss of\ndiameter and a significant increase in loss of xylem conductance (90%) and the\nsecond one with a significant increase in electrolyte leakage and slower\ndiameter changes. This second phase corresponds to a complete loss of recovery\ncapacity. The acoustic signals of both phases were discriminated by the third\nand fourth principal components. The loss of hydraulic conductance during the\nfirst acoustic phase suggests the hydraulic origin of these signals (i.e.\ncavitation events). For the second phase, the signals showed much higher\nvariability between plants and acoustic systems suggesting that the sources of\nthese signals may be plural, although likely including cellular damage. A\nsimple algorithm was developed to discriminate hydraulic-related acoustic\nsignals from other sources, allowing the reconstruction of dynamic hydraulic\nvulnerability curves. However, hydraulic failure precedes cellular damage and\nlack of whole plant recovery is associated to these latter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 May 2021 08:00:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lamacque", "Lia", ""], ["Sabin", "Florian", ""], ["Am\u00e9glio", "Thierry", ""], ["Herbette", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Charrier", "Guillaume", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.04730", "submitter": "Matthew Simpson", "authors": "Maud El-Hachem, Scott W McCue, Matthew J Simpson", "title": "Travelling wave analysis of cellular invasion into surrounding tissues", "comments": "30 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO nlin.PS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Single-species reaction-diffusion equations, such as the Fisher-KPP and\nPorous-Fisher equations, support travelling wave solutions that are often\ninterpreted as simple mathematical models of biological invasion.

It is widely accepted\nthat a decreased HRV is associated to several risk factors and cardiovascular\ndiseases. However, a possible association between HRV and altered cerebral\nhemodynamics is still debated, suffering from HRV short-term measures and the\npaucity of high-resolution deep cerebral data. We propose a computational\napproach to evaluate the deep cerebral and central hemodynamics subject to\nphysiological alterations of HRV in an ideal young healthy patient at rest. The\ncardiovascular-cerebral model was validated and recently exploited to\nunderstand the hemodynamic mechanisms between cardiac arrythmia and cognitive\ndeficit. Three configurations (baseline, increased HRV, and decreased HRV) are\nbuilt based on the standard deviation (SDNN) of RR beats. In the cerebral\ncirculation, our results show that HRV has overall a stronger impact on\npressure than flow rate mean values but similarly alters pressure and flow rate\nin terms of extreme events. By comparing reduced and increased HRV, this latter\ninduces a higher probability of altered mean and extreme values, and is\ntherefore more detrimental at distal cerebral level. On the contrary, at\ncentral level a decreased HRV induces a higher cardiac effort without improving\nthe mechano-contractile performance, thus overall reducing the heart\nefficiency. Present results suggest that: (i) the increase of HRV per se does\nnot seem to be sufficient to trigger a better cerebral hemodynamic response;\n(ii) by accounting for both central and cerebral circulations, the optimal HRV\nconfiguration is found at baseline. Given the relation inversely linking HRV\nand HR, the presence of this optimal condition can contribute to explain why\nthe mean HR of the general population settles around the baseline value (70\nbpm).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 May 2021 09:15:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Scarsoglio", "Stefania", ""], ["Ridolfi", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.09010", "submitter": "Mar\\'ia Vallet-Regi", "authors": "Carlotta Pontremoli, Isabel Izquierdo-Barba, Giorgia Montalbano, Maria\n  Vallet-Regi, Chiara Vitale-Brovarone, Sonia Fiorilli", "title": "Strontium-releasing mesoporous bioactive glasses with anti-adhesive\n  zwitterionic surface as advanced biomaterials for bone tissue regeneration", "comments": "26 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Colloid and Interface Science 563, 92-103 (2020)", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcis.2019.12.047", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Hypothesis The treatment of bone fractures still represents a challenging\nclinical issue when complications due to impaired bone remodelling (i.e.\nosteoporosis) or infections occur.

There\nhas been an intense debate on the mechanistic origin of the LQ model. An\ninteresting approach is that of obtaining LQ-like behavior from kinetic models,\nsystems of differential equations that model the induction and repair of\ndamage. Development of such kinetic models is particularly interesting for\napplication to continuous dose rate therapies, such as molecular radiotherapy\nor brachytherapy. In this work, we present a simple kinetic model that\ndescribes the kinetics of populations of tumor cells, rather than\nlethal/sub-lethal lesions, which may be especially useful for application to\ncontinuous dose rate therapies, as in molecular radiotherapy. The\nmulti-compartment model consists of a set of three differential equations. The\nmodel incorporates in an easy way different cross-interacting compartments of\ncells forming a tumor, and may be of especial interest for studying dynamics of\ntreated tumors. In the fast dose delivery limit, the model can be analytically\nsolved, obtaining a simple closed-form expression. Fitting of several surviving\ncurves with both this solution and the LQ model shows that they produce similar\nfits, despite being functionally different. We have also investigated the\noperation of the model in the continuous dose rate scenario, firstly by fitting\npre-clinical data of tumor response to 131I-CLR1404 therapy, and secondly by\nshowing how damage repair and proliferation rates can cause a treatment to\nachieve control or not. Kinetic models like the one presented in this work may\nbe of special interest when modeling response to molecular radiotherapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2021 12:14:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Neira", "Sara", ""], ["Gago-Arias", "Araceli", ""], ["Guiu-Souto", "Jacobo", ""], ["Pardo-Montero", "Juan", ""]]}]
