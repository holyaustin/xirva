Objectives: To examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells.\nMethods: Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of\n0.025-5 microTesla, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6\ndays. Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF\nincreases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions\n(KCs). Our data suggest that the KCs are caused by MF interference with\nmitochondria's adenosine triphosphate synthase (ATPS), compensated by the\naction of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The effects\nof MFs are similar to those of the ATPS inhibitor, oligomycin. They are\namplified by metformin, an AMPK stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK\ninhibitor. Over environmental MFs, KCs of various cancer cell lines show\nexceptionally wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythroleukemia\ncells, which display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microTesla.\nConclusions: The biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in\nthe structure of water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These\nresults may be environment ally important, in view of the central roles played\nin human physiology by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes,\ncancer and longevity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 14:58:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.4116", "submitter": "Caterina La Porta AM", "authors": "Alessandro Taloni, Alexander A.

Diagnostic and prognostic tools are then mostly based on dermoscopic\nexamination and morphological analysis of histological tissues. To investigate\nthe role of mechanics and geometry in the morpholgical dynamics of melanocytic\nnevi, we study a computation model for cell proliferation in a layered\nnon-linear elastic tissue. Numerical simulations suggest that the morphology of\nthe nevus is correlated to the initial location of the proliferating cell\nstarting the growth process and to the mechanical properties of the tissue. Our\nresults also support that melanocytes are subject to compressive stresses that\nfluctuate widely in the nevus and depend on the growth stage. Numerical\nsimulations of cells in the epidermis releasing matrix metalloproteinases\ndisplay an accelerated invasion of the dermis by destroying the basal membrane.\nMoreover, we suggest experimentally that osmotic stress and collagen inhibit\ngrowth in primary melanoma cells while the effect is much weaker in metastatic\ncells. Knowing that morphological features of nevi might also reflect geometry\nand mechanics rather than malignancy could be relevant for diagnostic purposes\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 00:27:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Taloni", "Alessandro", ""], ["Alemi", "Alexander A.", ""], ["Ciusani", "Emilio", ""], ["Sethna", "James P.", ""], ["Zapperi", "Stefano", ""], ["La Porta", "Caterina A.

Robustness, thus, is an essential\ncharacteristic that GRNs need to fulfill in order to maintain viability and\nreproducibility in a species. In the present work we analyze the robustness of\nthe patterning for the ocellar complex formation in Drosophila melanogaster\nfly. We have systematically pruned the GRN that drives the development of this\nvisual system to obtain the minimum pathway able to satisfy this pattern. We\nfound that the mechanism underlying the patterning obeys to the dynamics of a\n3-nodes network motif with a double negative feedback loop fed by a\nmorphogenetic gradient that triggers the inhibition in a French flag problem\nfashion. A Boolean modeling of the GRN confirms robustness in the patterning\nmechanism showing the same result for different network complexity levels.\nInterestingly, the network provides a steady state solution in the interocellar\npart of the patterning and an oscillatory regime in the ocelli. This\ntheoretical result predicts that the ocellar pattern may underlie oscillatory\ndynamics in its genetic regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 15:20:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Jul 2014 15:45:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 10:04:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2014 11:02:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 15:49:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aguilar-Hidalgo", "Daniel", ""], ["Lemos", "M.

Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving\nsystem subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these\nprocesses to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple\nbiological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the\nmicroenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the\ncell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways\nthat are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a\nmassive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e.\ngenotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the\nsurface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as\na means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to\neasily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this\nheterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More\nspecifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different\naspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the\nimpact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from\ngenotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway\nactivity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Apr 2014 19:37:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gerlee", "Philip", ""], ["Kim", "Eunjung", ""], ["Anderson", "Alexander R.
