To illustrate our theory, we apply it to a\nsimple continuum model for osteocyte network formation within bones, with a\nview to understanding changes that may take place during cancer.

While the extracellular matrix structure of bone is extensively studied\non ultrastructural and macroscopic scales, there is a lack of quantitative\nknowledge on how the cellular network is organized. Using a recently introduced\nimaging and quantification approach, we analyze the OLCN in different bone\ntypes from mouse and sheep that exhibit different degrees of structural\norganization not only of the cell network but also of the fibrous matrix\ndeposited by the cells. We define a number of robust, quantitative measures\nthat are derived from the theory of complex networks. These measures enable us\nto gain insights into how efficient the network is organized with regard to\nintercellular transport and communication. Our analysis shows that the cell\nnetwork in regularly organized, slow-growing bone tissue from sheep is less\nconnected, but more efficiently organized compared to irregular and\nfast-growing bone tissue from mice. On the level of statistical topological\nproperties (edges per node, edge length and degree distribution), both network\ntypes are indistinguishable, highlighting that despite pronounced differences\nat the tissue level, the topological architecture of the osteocyte canalicular\nnetwork at the subcellular level may be independent of species and bone type.\nOur results suggest a universal mechanism underlying the self-organization of\nindividual cells into a large, interconnected network during bone formation and\nmineralization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2017 08:59:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kollmannsberger", "Philip", ""], ["Kerschnitzki", "Michael", ""], ["Repp", "Felix", ""], ["Wagermaier", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Weinkamer", "Richard", ""], ["Fratzl", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.04627", "submitter": "Ivan Rudskiy V", "authors": "I.V.

The EFMC model combines the\nelectrical activity of lymphangions (action potentials) with fluid-mechanical\nfeedback (stretch of the lymphatic wall and wall shear stress) and the\nmechanical variation of the lymphatic wall properties (contractions). The EFMC\nmodel is governed by four Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) and\nphenomenologically relies on: (1) environmental calcium influx, (2)\nstretch-activated calcium influx, and (3) contraction inhibitions induced by\nwall shear stresses. We carried out a complete mathematical analysis of the\nstability of the stationary state of the EFMC model.

In the competition for nutrients and growth space within the tumors\nthe phenotype of each cell determines its success. Selection in this process is\nimposed by both the microenvironment (neighboring cells, extracellular matrix,\nand diffusing substances), and the whole of the organism through for example\nthe blood supply. In this view, the development of tumor cells is in close\ninteraction with their increasingly changing environment: the more cells can\nchange, the more their environment will change. Furthermore, instabilities are\nalso introduced on the organism level: blood supply can be blocked by increased\ntissue pressure or the tortuosity of the tumor-neovascular vessels. This\ncoupling between cell, microenvironment, and organism results in behavior that\nis hard to predict. Here we introduce a cell-based computational model to study\nthe effect of blood flow obstruction on the micro-evolution of cells within a\ncancerous tissue. We demonstrate that stages of tumor development emerge\nnaturally, without the need for sequential mutation of specific genes.\nSecondly, we show that instabilities in blood supply can impact the overall\ndevelopment of tumors and lead to the extinction of the dominant aggressive\nphenotype, showing a clear distinction between the fitness at the cell level\nand survival of the population.

We capture two-way coupling between cell\ngrowth and fluid flow by allowing cells to block pores, and by allowing the\nshear stress of the fluid to affect cell growth and death. We explore a range\nof parameters for both models, and demonstrate quantitative and qualitative\ndifferences between predictions from each of these approaches, including\nspatial pattern formation and local oscillations in cell density present only\nin the lattice model.
