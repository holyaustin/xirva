Methods: Surgeons performing LCs at an academic centre were\ninvited to perform a 5-second long time out to verify CVS before dividing the\ncystic duct (5-second rule).

The\nsurface functionalization with organic groups did not damage the mesoporous\nnetwork and their structural and textural properties were also preserved\ndespite the high solubility of MBG matrices. The incorporation of Lys confers a\nzwitterionic nature to these MBG materials due to the presence of adjacent\namine and carboxylic groups in the external surface. At physiologic pH, this\ncoexistence of basic amine and carboxilic acid groups from anchored Lys\nprovided zero surface charge named zwitterionic effect. This behaviour could\ngive rise to potential applications of antibacterial adhesion. Therefore, in\norder to assess the influence of zwitterionic nature in in vitro bacterial\nadhesion, studies were carried out with Staphylococcus aureus. It was\ndemonstrated that the efficient interaction of these zwitterionic pairs onto\nthe MBG surfaces reduced bacterial adhesion up to 99.9% compared to bare MBGs.\nIn order to test the suitability of zwitterionic MBGs materials as bone grafts,\ntheir cytocompatibility was investigated in vitro with MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts.\nThese findings suggested that the proposed surface functionalization strategy\nprovided MBG materials with notable antibacterial adhesion properties, hence\nmaking these materials promising candidates for local bone infection therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 10:04:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sanchez-Salcedo", "S", ""], ["Garcia", "A", ""], ["Vallet-Regi", "M", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11082", "submitter": "Dixon Vimalajeewa", "authors": "Dixon Vimalajeewa, Sasitharan Balasubramaniam", "title": "Digestive System Dynamics in Molecular Communication Perspectives", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Consumption of food in excess of the required optimal nutritional\nrequirements has already resulted in a global crisis and this is from the\nperspective of human health, such as obesity, as well as food waste and\nsustainability.

At the same time, the enzyme activity on the hydrolyzed starch\ndirectly impacts the path loss, as higher reaction rates and lower half\nsaturation concentration of starch results in lower path loss.

The inconsistencies reflect contradictory\nconclusions from independent clinical-based studies that took roughly similar\napproaches, in terms of experimental design (retrospective, cohort-based, etc.)\nand statistical analyses (propensity-score matching and stratification, etc.).\nThe confusion has significant ramifications in choosing therapeutic\ninterventions: e.g., do potential benefits of famotidine indicate its use in a\nparticular COVID-19 case? Beyond this pressing therapeutic issue, conflicting\ninformation on famotidine must be resolved before its integration in\nontological and knowledge graph-based frameworks, which in turn are useful in\ndrug repurposing efforts. To begin systematically structuring the rapidly\naccumulating information, in the hopes of clarifying and reconciling the\ndiscrepancies, we consider the contradictory information along three proposed\n'axes': (1) a context-of-disease axis, (2) a degree-of-[therapeutic]-benefit\naxis, and (3) a mechanism-of-action axis. We suspect that incongruencies in how\nthese axes have been (implicitly) treated in past studies has led to the\ncontradictory indications for famotidine and COVID-19. We also trace the\nevolution of information on acid-suppression agents as regards the\ntransmission, severity, and mortality of COVID-19, given the many literature\nreports that have accumulated. By grouping the studies conceptually and\nthematically, we identify three eras in the progression of our understanding of\nfamotidine and COVID-19.

Unfortunately, analytical results\nare restricted to a few cells due to the algebraic complexity of nonlinear\ndynamical systems. Motivated by concentric patterning of Notch expression\nobserved in the mammary gland, we combine concepts from graph and control\ntheory to represent cellular connectivity. The resulting theoretical framework\nallows us to exploit the symmetry of multicellular bilayer structures in 2D and\n3D, thereby deriving analytical conditions that drive the dynamical system to\nform laminar patterns consistent with the formulation of cell polarity.\nCritically, the conditions are independent of the precise dynamical details,\nthus the framework allows for the utmost generality in understanding the\ninfluence of cellular geometry on patterning in lateral-inhibition systems.\nApplying the analytic conditions to mammary organoids suggests that intense\ncell signalling polarity is required for the maintenance of stratified\ncell-types within a static bilayer using a lateral-inhibition mechanism.\nFurthermore, by employing 2D and 3D cell-based models, we highlight that the\ncellular polarity conditions derived from static domains have the capacity to\ngenerate laminar patterning in dynamic environments. However, they are\ninsufficient for the maintenance of patterning when subjected to substantial\nmorphological perturbations. In agreement with the mathematical implications of\nstrict signalling polarity induced on the cells, we propose an adhesion\ndependent Notch-Delta biological process which has the potential to initiate\nbilayer stratification in a developing mammary organoid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Apr 2021 12:30:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 May 2021 09:26:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "Joshua W.", ""], ["Dale", "Trevor C.", ""], ["Woolley", "Thomas E.", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.12708", "submitter": "Juan Jim\\'enez-S\\'anchez", "authors": "V\\'ictor M.
