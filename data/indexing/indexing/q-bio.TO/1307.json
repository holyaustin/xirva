Here we obtained a\n2D movie of kidney branching morphogenesis in culture to test different models\nof branching morphogenesis with physiological growth dynamics. We carried out\nimage segmentation and calculated the displacement fields between the frames.\nThe models were subsequently solved on the 2D domain, that was extracted from\nthe movie. We find that Turing patterns are sensitive to the initial conditions\nwhen solved on the epithelial shapes. A previously proposed diffusion-dependent\ngeometry effect allowed us to reproduce the growth fields reasonably well, both\nfor an inhibitor of branching that was produced in the epithelium, and for an\ninducer of branching that was produced in the mesenchyme. The latter could be\nrepresented by Glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which is expressed in\nthe mesenchyme and induces outgrowth of ureteric branches. Considering that the\nTuring model represents the interaction between the GDNF and its receptor RET\nvery well and that the model reproduces the relevant expression patterns in\ndeveloping wildtype and mutant kidneys, it is well possible that a combination\nof the Turing mechanism and the geometry effect control branching\nmorphogenesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 09:00:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Adivarahan", "Srivathsan", ""], ["Menshykau", "Denis", ""], ["Michos", "Odysse", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.2548", "submitter": "Yohan Payan", "authors": "Ian Stavness (UBC), Mohammad Ali Nazari (GIPSA-lab), Pascal Perrier\n  (GIPSA-lab), Didier Demolin (GIPSA-lab), Yohan Payan (TIMC-IMAG)", "title": "A biomechanical modeling study of the effects of the orbicularis oris\n  muscle and jaw posture on lip shape", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research 56, 3 (2013)\n  878-890", "doi": "10.1044/1092-4388(2012/12-0200)", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Purpose: The authors' general aim is to use biomechanical models of speech\narticulators to explore how possible variations in anatomical structure\ncontribute to differences in articulatory strategies and phone systems across\nhuman populations. Specifically, they investigated 2 issues: (a) the link\nbetween lip muscle anatomy and variability in lip gestures and (b) the\nconstraints of coupled lip/jaw biomechanics on jaw posture in labial sounds.\nMethod: The authors used a model coupling the jaw, tongue, and face. First, the\ninfluence of the orbicularis oris (OO) anatomical implementation was analyzed\nby assessing how changes in depth (from epidermis to the skull) and\nperipheralness (proximity to the lip horn center) affected lip shaping. Second,\nthe capability of the lip/jaw system to generate protrusion and rounding, or\nlabial closure, was evaluated for different jaw heights. Results: Results\nshowed that a peripheral and moderately deep OO implementation is most\nappropriate for protrusion and rounding; a superficial implementation\nfacilitates closure; protrusion and rounding require a high jaw position; and\nclosure is achievable for various jaw heights. Conclusions: Models provide\nobjective information regarding possible links between anatomical and speech\nproduction variability across humans. Comparisons with experimental data will\nillustrate how motor control and cultural factors cope with these constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2013 19:26:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Stavness", "Ian", "", "UBC"], ["Nazari", "Mohammad Ali", "", "GIPSA-lab"], ["Perrier", "Pascal", "", "GIPSA-lab"], ["Demolin", "Didier", "", "GIPSA-lab"], ["Payan", "Yohan", "", "TIMC-IMAG"]]}, {"id": "1307.2809", "submitter": "Yohan Payan", "authors": "Mohammad Ali Nazari (GIPSA-lab), Pascal Perrier (GIPSA-lab), Yohan\n  Payan (TIMC-IMAG)", "title": "A Muscle Model Based on Feldman's Lambda Model: 3D Finite Element\n  Implementation", "comments": "CMBBE'2013, Salt Lake City : United States (2013)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents the introduction of Feldman's muscle model in a three\ndimensional continuum finite element model of the human face.

In this paper, we\npresent an iterative multi-class learning method to segment the femoral, tibial\nand patellar cartilage simultaneously, which effectively exploits the spatial\ncontextual constraints between bone and cartilage, and also between different\ncartilages. First, based on the fact that the cartilage grows in only certain\narea of the corresponding bone surface, we extract the distance features of not\nonly to the surface of the bone, but more informatively, to the densely\nregistered anatomical landmarks on the bone surface. Second, we introduce a set\nof iterative discriminative classifiers that at each iteration, probability\ncomparison features are constructed from the class confidence maps derived by\npreviously learned classifiers. These features automatically embed the semantic\ncontext information between different cartilages of interest.

Although, all GRBs observed so far are extragalactic in origin,\nthere is a high probability of a GRB of galactic origin beaming towards the\nEarth in the past ~ 0.5 Gyr. Such an intense burst of gamma rays would ionize\nthe atmosphere and deplete the ozone layer. With depleted ozone, there will be\nan increased flux of solar UVB on the Earth's surface with harmful biological\neffects. In addition to the atmospheric damage, secondary particles produced by\ngamma ray-induced showers will reach the surface. Amongst all secondary\nparticles, muons dominate the ground-level secondary particle flux (99% of the\ntotal number of particles) and are potentially of biological significance.\nUsing the Monte Carlo simulation code CORSIKA, we modeled the air showers\nproduced by gamma ray primaries up to 100 GeV. We found that the number of\nmuons produced by hypothetical galactic GRBs significantly increases the total\nmuon flux. However, since the muon production efficiency is extremely low for\nphoton energy below 100 GeV, and because GRBs radiate strongly for only a very\nshort time, we find that the biological radiation dose from secondary muons is\nnegligible. The main mechanism of biological damage from GRBs is through solar\nUVB irradiation from the loss of ozone in the upper atmosphere.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jul 2013 12:07:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 05:35:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Sep 2013 19:19:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 04:16:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 03:47:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Atri", "Dimitra", "", "Tata Inst."], ["Melott", "Adrian L.", "", "Kansas U."], ["Karam", "Andrew", "", "NTA"]]}, {"id": "1307.4454", "submitter": "Mary Lisa Manning", "authors": "Eva-Maria Schoetz, Marcos Lanio, Jared A.
