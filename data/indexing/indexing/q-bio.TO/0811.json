Somehow, the microscopic handedness of\nbiological molecules must be brought up to macroscopic scales. Basic symmetry\nprinciples suggest that the usual \"biological\" mechanisms -- diffusion and gene\nregulation -- are insufficient to implement the \"right-hand rule\" defining a\nthird body axis from the other two. Instead, on the cellular level, \"physical\"\nmechanisms (forces and collective dynamic states) are needed involving the long\nstiff fibers of the cytoskeleton. I discuss some possible scenarios; only in\nthe case of vertebrate internal organs is the answer currently known (and even\nthat is in dispute).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Nov 2008 02:52:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Nov 2008 19:40:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Henley", "Christopher L.", "", "Cornell Univ."]]}, {"id": "0811.0581", "submitter": "Paul-Henry Cournede", "authors": "S\\'ebastien Lemaire (ITB), Fabienne Maupas (ITB), Paul-Henry\n  Courn\\`ede (MAS, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), Philippe De Reffye (INRIA\n  Saclay - Ile de France, AMAP)", "title": "A morphogenetic crop model for sugar-beet (Beta vulgaris L.)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ISCMDS (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is the instructions for the proceeding of the International\nSymposium on Crop. Sugar beet crop models have rarely taken into account the\nmorphogenetic process generating plant architecture despite the fact that plant\narchitectural plasticity plays a key role during growth, especially under\nstress conditions. The objective of this paper is to develop this approach by\napplying the GreenLab model of plant growth to sugar beet and to study the\npotential advantages for applicative purposes. Experiments were conducted with\nhusbandry practices in 2006. The study of sugar beet development, mostly\nphytomer appearance, organ expansion and leaf senescence, allowed us to define\na morphogenetic model of sugar beet growth based on GreenLab. It simulates\norganogenesis, biomass production and biomass partitioning. The functional\nparameters controlling source-sink relationships during plant growth were\nestimated from organ and compartment dry masses, measured at seven different\ntimes, for samples of plants. The fitting results are good, which shows that\nthe introduced framework is adapted to analyse source-sink dynamics and\nshoot-root allocation throughout the season. However, this approach still needs\nto be fully validated, particularly among seasons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 19:35:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2008 21:11:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Feb 2009 15:25:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lemaire", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "ITB"], ["Maupas", "Fabienne", "", "ITB"], ["Courn\u00e8de", "Paul-Henry", "", "MAS, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"], ["De Reffye", "Philippe", "", "INRIA\n  Saclay - Ile de France, AMAP"]]}, {"id": "0811.1520", "submitter": "Tad Hogg", "authors": "Tad Hogg", "title": "Modeling Microscopic Chemical Sensors in Capillaries", "comments": "14 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "The Open Nanomedicine Journal 2:1-9 (2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.RO physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nanotechnology-based microscopic robots could provide accurate in vivo\nmeasurement of chemicals in the bloodstream for detailed biological research\nand as an aid to medical treatment.
