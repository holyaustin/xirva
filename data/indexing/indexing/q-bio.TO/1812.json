Alternative, image-based\ninference schemes aim to estimate stress from snapshots of cellular geometry\nbut are challenged by sensitivity to fluctuations and measurement noise as well\nas the dependence on boundary conditions. Here we overcome these difficulties\nby introducing a new variational approach - the Geometrical Variation Method\n(GVM) - which exploits the fundamental duality between stress and cellular\ngeometry that exists in the state of mechanical equilibrium of discrete\nmechanical networks that approximate cellular tissues. In the Geometrical\nVariation Method, the two dimensional apical geometry of an epithelial tissue\nis approximated by a 2D tiling with Circular Arc Polygons (CAP) in which the\narcs represent intercellular interfaces defined by the balance of local line\ntension and pressure differentials between adjacent cells.

The aortic valve plays a critical\nrole in heart failure and its treatment with LVAD. The cardiovascular-LVAD\nmodel is often used to investigate the physiological demands required by\npatients and predict the hemodynamic of the native heart supported with a LVAD.\nAs a bridge to recovery treatment, it is important to maintain appropriate and\nactive dynamics of the aortic valve and the cardiac output of the native heart,\nwhich requires that the LVAD pump must be adjusted so that a proper balance\nbetween the blood contributed through the aortic valve and the pump is\nmaintained.
