Neuroinflammation is associated with increased BBB\nbreakdown and brain injury. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is involved in BBB\ninjury and edema formation through a mechanism involving matrix\nmetalloproteinase (MMP) upregulation. There is emerging evidence indicating\nthat cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition limits BBB disruption following ischemic\nstroke and bacterial meningitis, but the mechanisms involved are not known. We\nused intracerebral injection of TNF-a to study the effect of COX inhibition on\nTNF-a-induced BBB breakdown, MMP expression/activity and oxidative stress. BBB\ndisruption was evaluated by the uptake of 14C-sucrose into the brain and by\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) utilizing Gd-DTPA as a paramagnetic contrast\nagent. Using selective inhibitors of each COX isoform, we found that COX-1\nactivity is more important than COX-2 in BBB opening. TNF-a induced a\nsignificant upregulation of gelatinase B (MMP-9), stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) and\nCOX-2. In addition, TNF-a significantly depleted glutathione as compared to\nsaline. Indomethacin (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2, reduced\nBBB damage at 24 h. Indomethacin significantly attenuated MMP-9 and MMP-3\nexpression and activation, and prevented the loss of endogenous radical\nscavenging capacity following intracerebral injection of TNF-a. Our results\nshow for the first time that BBB disruption during neuroinflammation can be\nsignificantly reduced by administration of COX inhibitors. Modulation of COX in\nbrain injury by COX inhibitors or agents modulating prostaglandin E2\nformation/signaling may be useful in clinical settings associated with BBB\ndisruption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2007 23:54:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Candelario-Jalil", "Eduardo", ""], ["Taheri", "Saeid", ""], ["Yang", "Yi", ""], ["Sood", "Rohit", ""], ["Grossetete", "Mark", ""], ["Estrada", "Eduardo Y.", ""], ["Fiebich", "Bernd L.", ""], ["Rosenberg", "Gary A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.2945", "submitter": "Vadim N.

In route to this\ngoal, we studied the behavior of a heterogeneous myocyte network in which a\nsharp coupling gradient was placed under conditions of increasing network\nautomaticity. Experiments were conducted in monolayers of neonatal rat\ncardiomyocytes using heptanol and isoproterenol as means of altering\ncell-to-cell coupling and automaticity respectively. Experimental findings were\nexplained and expanded using a modified Beeler-Reuter numerical model. The data\nsuggests that the combination of a heterogeneous substrate, a gradient of\ncoupling and an increase in oscillatory activity of individual cells creates a\nrich set of behaviors associated with self-generated spiral waves and ectopic\nsources. Spiral waves feature a flattened shape and a pin-unpin drift type of\ntip motion. These intercellular waves are action-potential based and can be\nvisualized with either voltage or calcium transient measurements. A source/load\nmismatch on the interface between the boundary and well-coupled layers can lock\nwavefronts emanating from both ectopic sources and rotating waves within the\ninner layers of the coupling gradient. A numerical approach allowed us to\nexplore how: i) the spatial distribution of cells, ii) the amplitude and\ndispersion of cell automaticity, iii) and the speed at which the coupling\ngradient moves in space, affects wave behavior, including its escape into\nwell-coupled tissue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2007 08:06:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Biktashev", "V.
