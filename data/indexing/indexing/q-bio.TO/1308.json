A diaspora is the scattering of people away from an established\nhomeland. To date, diaspora has been a uniquely human term utilized by social\nscientists, however, the application of the diaspora concept to metastasis may\nyield new biological insights as well as therapeutic paradigms. The diaspora\nparadigm takes into account and models several variables: the quality of the\nprimary tumor microenvironment, the fitness of individual cancer cell migrants\nas well as migrant populations, the rate of bidirectional migration of cancer\nand host cells between cancer sites, and the quality of the target\nmicroenvironments to establish metastatic sites. Ecological scientific\nprinciples can be applied to the cancer diaspora to develop new therapeutic\nstrategies. For example, ecological traps, habitats that lead to the extinction\nof a species, can be developed to attract cancer cells to a place where they\ncan be better exposed to treatments or to cells of the immune system for\nimproved antigen presentation. Merging the social science concept of diaspora\nwith ecological and population sciences concepts can inform the cancer field to\nunderstand the biology of tumorigenesis and metastasis and inspire new ideas\nfor therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 19:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pienta", "Kenneth J.", ""], ["Robertson", "Bruce", ""], ["Coffey", "Donald S.", ""], ["Taichman", "Russell S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2123", "submitter": "Denis Menshykau", "authors": "Dagmar Iber and Denis Menshykau", "title": "The Control of Branching Morphogenesis", "comments": "The Control of Branching Morphogenesis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many organs of higher organisms are heavily branched structures and arise by\nan at first sight similar process of branching morphogenesis.

Recent investigations of a variety of tumor types have shown that\nphenotypically identifiable and isolable subfractions of cells possess the\ntumor-forming ability. In the present paper, using two lineage-related human\nmelanoma cell lines, primary melanoma line IGR39 and its metastatic derivative\nline IGR37, two main observations are reported. The first one is the first\nphenotypic evidence to support the origin of melanoma cancer stem cells (CSCs)\nfrom mutated tissue-specific stem cells; and the second one is the\nidentification of a more aggressive subpopulation of CSCs in melanoma that are\nCXCR6+. Conclusions/Significance: The association of a more aggressive tumor\nphenotype with asymmetric self-renewal phenotype reveals a previously\nunrecognized aspect of tumor cell physiology. Namely, the retention of some\ntissue-specific stem cell attributes, like the ability to asymmetrically\nself-renew, impacts the natural history of human tumor development.
