The resultant dynamical appearance\nof the tongue has striking similarities with well known phenomena observed in\nexcitable media, such as forest fires, cardiac dynamics and chemically-driven\nreaction-diffusion systems. Here we explore the dynamics associated with GT\nfrom a dynamical systems perspective, utilizing cellular automata simulations.\nWe emphasize similarities with other excitable systems as well as unique\nfeatures observed in GT.

For this\npurpose, the ultra-structure of the kidney was characterized to identify normal\nstructure of this organ, and histological changes previously described in the\nkidney of breeding male bullheads were quantified using the kidney epithelium\nheight (KEH) assay previously developed and validated for the stickleback. In\nthe next step, the effect of trenbolone acetate (TbA), a model androgen, was\nassessed to identify potential androgenic regulation of bullhead kidney\nhypertrophy. Measurement of KEH performed on adult non-breeding male and female\nbullheads exposed for 14 and 21 days to 0, 1.26 and 6.50 mu g/L showed that\nkidney hypertrophy is induced in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the\nhypothesis that the European bullhead possesses a potential biomarker of\nandrogen exposure. Combined with the wide distribution of the European bullhead\nin European countries and the potential of this fish species for environmental\ntoxicology studies in field and laboratory conditions, the hypothesis of a\npotential biomarker of androgen exposure offers interesting perspectives for\nthe use of the bullhead as a relevant sentinel fish species in monitoring\nstudies. Inducibility was observed with high exposure concentrations of TbA.\nFurther studies are needed to identify molecular signals that could be more\nsensitive than KEH\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2014 15:37:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Villeret", "M\u00e9lanie", "", "ISA"], ["Jolly", "Sabrina", "", "ISA"], ["Wiest", "Laure", "", "ISA"], ["Vulliet", "Emmanuelle", "", "ISA"], ["Bado-Nilles", "Anne", ""], ["Porcher", "Jean-Marc", ""], ["Betoulle", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Minier", "Christophe", ""], ["Sanchez", "Wilfried", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.4319", "submitter": "Philippe Marcq", "authors": "K.

Quantification of force and stress is therefore\nnecessary to analyze the mechanisms controlling tissue morphogenesis. Recently,\na mechanical measurement method based on force inference from cell shapes and\nconnectivity has been developed. It is non-invasive, and can provide space-time\nmaps of force and stress within an epithelial tissue, up to prefactors. We\npreviously performed a comparative study of three force-inference methods,\nwhich differ in their approach of treating indefiniteness in an inverse problem\nbetween cell shapes and forces. In the present study, to further validate and\ncompare the three force inference methods, we tested their robustness by\nmeasuring temporal fluctuation of estimated forces. Quantitative data of\ncell-level dynamics in a developing tissue suggests that variation of forces\nand stress will remain small within a short period of time ($\\sim$minutes).\nHere, we showed that cell-junction tensions and global stress inferred by the\nBayesian force inference method varied less with time than those inferred by\nthe method that estimates only tension. In contrast, the amplitude of temporal\nfluctuations of estimated cell pressures differs less between different\nmethods. Altogether, the present study strengthens the validity and robustness\nof the Bayesian force-inference method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 12:59:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Sugimura", "K.", ""], ["Bella\u00efche", "Y.", ""], ["Graner", "F.", ""], ["Marcq", "P.", ""], ["Ishihara", "S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.5258", "submitter": "Pedro F.

In this work, we investigate how oscillations in the\nactomyosin cytoskeleton drive cell shape changes during the process of Dorsal\nClosure, a morphogenetic event in Drosophila embryo development whereby\nepidermal continuity is generated through the pulsatile apical area reduction\nof cells constituting the amnioserosa (AS) tissue. We present a theoretical\nmodel of AS cell dynamics by which the oscillatory behaviour arises due to a\ncoupling between active Myosin-driven forces, actin turnover and cell\ndeformation. Oscillations in our model are cell-autonomous and are modulated by\nneighbour coupling, and our model accurately reproduces the oscillatory\ndynamics of AS cells and their amplitude and frequency evolution. A key\nprediction arising from our model is that the rate of actin turnover and Myosin\ncontractile force must increase during DC in order to reproduce the decrease in\namplitude and period of cell area oscillations observed in vivo. This\nprediction opens up new ways to think about the molecular underpinnings of AS\ncell oscillations and their link to net tissue contraction and suggests the\nform of future experimental measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 11:23:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 17:13:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Machado", "Pedro F.", ""], ["Blanchard", "Guy B.", ""], ["Duque", "Julia", ""], ["Gorfinkiel", "Nicole", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6465", "submitter": "Sylvie Costrel De Corainville", "authors": "St\\'ephane Mottin (LHC), Bruno Montcel (CREATIS), Hugues Guillet De\n  Chatellus (LIPhy), St\\'ephane Ramstein (LHC), Cl\\'ementine Vignal (ENES)", "title": "Time-resolved and spectral-resolved optical imaging to study brain\n  hemodynamics in songbirds", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Diffuse Optical Imaging III.

In zebra finches, picosecond optical\ntomography (POT) with a white laser and a streak camera can measure in vivo\noxy-hemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxy-hemoglobin (Hb) concentration changes following\nphysiological stimulation (familiar calls and songs). POT demonstrated\nsufficient sub-micromolar sensitivity to resolve the fast changes in\nhippocampus and auditory forebrain areas with 250 \\mu m resolution.
