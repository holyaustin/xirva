Nature features transport networks that are adaptive\nover a vast range of parameters, thus providing an impressive level of\nrobustness in supply. Theoretical and experimental studies have found that\nreal-world transport networks exhibit both tree-like motifs and cycles. When\nthe network is subject to load fluctuations, the presence of cyclic motifs may\nhelp to reduce flow fluctuations and, thus, render supply in the network more\nrobust. While previous studies considered network topology via optimization\nprinciples, here, we take a dynamical systems approach and study a simple model\nof a flow network with dynamically adapting weights (conductances). We assume a\nspatially non-uniform distribution of rapidly fluctuating loads in the sinks\nand investigate what network configurations are dynamically stable. The network\nconverges to a spatially non-uniform stable configuration composed of both\ncyclic and tree-like structures. Cyclic structures emerge locally in a\ntranscritical bifurcation as the amplitude of the load fluctuations is\nincreased. The resulting adaptive dynamics thus partitions the network into two\ndistinct regions with cyclic and tree-like structures. The location of the\nboundary between these two regions is determined by the amplitude of the\nfluctuations. These findings may explain why natural transport networks display\ncyclic structures in the micro-vascular regions near terminal nodes, but\ntree-like features in the regions with larger veins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Nov 2017 15:40:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Martens", "Erik Andreas", ""], ["Klemm", "Konstantin", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.02021", "submitter": "Daniel Aguilar-Hidalgo", "authors": "Daniel Aguilar Hidalgo, Steffen Werner, Ortrud Wartlick, Marcos\n  Gonz\\'alez-Gait\\'an, Benjamin Friedrich, Frank J\\\"ulicher", "title": "Critical Point in Self-Organized Tissue Growth", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The difference in the local concentration\nof diffusion factors is translated into the degree of activation of\ntranscription factors.

Objective: The\npurpose of this study was to assess and compare the seed germination response\nof six Acacia species under different NaCl concentrations in order to explore\nopportunities for selection and breeding salt tolerant genotypes. Methods: The\nsalinity effect was examined by measuring some agro-morphological parameters in\ncontrolled growth environment using five treatment levels: 0, 100, 200, 300 and\n400 mM of NaCl. Results: The analyzed data revealed significant variability in\nsalt response within and between species. All growth parameters were\nprogressively reduced by increased NaCl concentrations. Growth in height, leaf\nnumber and total plant dry weight were considered as the most sensitive\nparameters. However, the growth reduction varied among species in accordance\nwith their tolerance level. It is important to note that all species survived\nat the highest salinity (400 mM).

Geometry modulates cell populations collectively through the evolving\nspace available to the cells, but it may also modulate the individual\nbehaviours of cells. To factor out the collective influence of geometry and\ngain access to the geometric regulation of individual cell behaviours, we\ndevelop a mathematical model of the infilling of cortical bone pores and use it\nwith available experimental data on cortical infilling rates. Testing different\npossible modes of geometric controls of individual cell behaviours consistent\nwith the experimental data, we find that efficient smoothing of irregular pores\nonly occurs when cell secretory rate is controlled by porosity rather than\ncurvature. This porosity control suggests the convergence of a large scale of\nintercellular signalling to single bone-forming cells, consistent with that\nprovided by the osteocyte network in response to mechanical stimulus. After\nvalidating the mathematical model with the histological record of a real\ncortical pore infilling, we explore the infilling of a population of randomly\ngenerated initial pore shapes. We find that amongst all the geometric\nregulations considered, the collective influence of curvature on cell crowding\nis a dominant factor for how fast cortical bone pores infill, and we suggest\nthat the irregularity of cement lines thereby explains some of the variability\nin double labelling data as well as the overall speed of osteon infilling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Nov 2017 01:15:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2018 14:40:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Alias", "Mohd Almie", ""], ["Buenzli", "Pascal R", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.08941", "submitter": "Marta Diaz Ms", "authors": "Marta Diaz-delCastillo, David P.D.
