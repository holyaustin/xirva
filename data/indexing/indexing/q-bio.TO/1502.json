Here,\nwe separate the effects of standing stem cell number (i.e., organ or tissue\nsize) and per stem cell lifetime replication rate. We show that each has a\nstatistically significant and independent effect on explaining variation in\ncancer incidence over the 31 cases considered by Tomasetti and Vogelstein. When\nconsidering the total number of stem cell divisions and when removing cases\nassociated with disease or carcinogens, we find that cancer incidence attains a\nplateau of approximately 0.6% incidence for the cases considered by these\nauthors. We further demonstrate that grouping by anatomical site explains most\nof the remaining variation in risk between cancer types. This new analysis\nsuggests that cancer risk depends not only on the number of stem cell divisions\nbut varies enormously ($\\sim$10,000 times) depending on the stem cell's\nenvironment. Future research should investigate how tissue characteristics\n(anatomical site, type, size, stem cell divisions) explain cancer incidence\nover a wider range of cancers, to what extent different tissues express\nspecific protective mechanisms, and whether any differential protection can be\nattributed to natural selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 22:58:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Noble", "Robert", ""], ["Kaltz", "Oliver", ""], ["Hochberg", "Michael E", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04372", "submitter": "Benjamin Mauroy", "authors": "Benjamin Mauroy, Patrice Flaud, Dominique Pelca, Christian Fausser,\n  Jacques Merckx, Barrett R.

Although commonly used, little is\nknown about the inner mechanisms of chest physiotherapy and controversies about\nits use are coming out regularly. Thus, a scientific validation of chest\nphysiotherapy is needed to evaluate its effects on secretions.\n  We setup a quasi-static numerical model of chest physiotherapy based on\nthorax and lung physiology and on their respective biophysics. We modeled the\nlung with an idealized deformable symmetric bifurcating tree. Bronchi and their\ninner fluids mechanics are assumed axisymmetric. Static data from the\nliterature is used to build a model for the lung's mechanics. Secretions motion\nis the consequence of the shear constraints apply by the air flow. The input of\nthe model is the pressure on the chest wall at each time, and the output is the\nbronchi geometry and air and secretions properties.\n  In the limit of our model, we mimicked manual and mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy techniques. We show that for secretions to move, air flow has to\nbe high enough to overcome secretion resistance to motion. Moreover, the higher\nthe pressure or the quicker it is applied, the higher is the air flow and thus\nthe mobilization of secretions. However, pressures too high are efficient up to\na point where airways compressions prevents air flow to increases any further.\nGenerally, the first effects of manipulations is a decrease of the airway tree\nhydrodynamic resistance, thus improving ventilation even if secretions do not\nget out of the lungs. Also, some secretions might be pushed deeper into the\nlungs; this effect is stronger for high pressures and for mechanical chest\nphysiotherapy. Finally, we propose and tested two adimensional numbers that\ndepend on lung properties and that allow to measure the efficiency and comfort\nof a manipulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 22:19:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Mauroy", "Benjamin", ""], ["Flaud", "Patrice", ""], ["Pelca", "Dominique", ""], ["Fausser", "Christian", ""], ["Merckx", "Jacques", ""], ["Mitchell", "Barrett R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04991", "submitter": "Ali Bakhshinejad", "authors": "Ali Bakhshinejad and Roshan M D'Souza", "title": "A Brief Comparison Between Available Bio-printing Methods", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/GLBC.2015.7158294", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The scarcity of organs for transplant has led to large waiting lists of very\nsick patients.
