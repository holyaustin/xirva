Altered\nchorionic surface shape is associated with lowered placental functional\nefficiency. We hypothesize that placentas with deformed chorionic surface\nvascular trees and reduced functional efficiency also have irregular vascular\narborization that will be reflected in increased variability of placental\nthickness and a lower mean thickness.\n  We find that non-centrality of the umbilical cord insertion is strongly and\nsignificantly correlated with disk thickness (Spearman's rho=0.128, p=0.002).\nDeformed shape is strongly and significantly associated with lower overall\nthickness and higher variability of thickness with beta between -0.173 and\n-0.254 (p<0.001) . Both lower mean thickness and high variability of thickness\nare strongly correlated with higher beta (reduced placental efficiency)\n(p<0.001 and p=0.038 respectively). Greater thickness variability is correlated\nwith higher beta independent of the other placental shape variables p=0.004.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Jan 2011 17:21:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yampolsky", "Michael", ""], ["Salafia", "Carolyn M.", ""], ["Shlakhter", "Oleksandr", ""], ["Haas", "Danielle", ""], ["Eucker", "Barbara", ""], ["Thorp", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5263", "submitter": "Lukas Jelinek", "authors": "J.

In sum, 232 herds with 3412 individuals were evaluated. Two\nindependent groups participated in our study and came to the same conclusion\nthat, in contradiction to the recent findings of other researchers, no\nalignment of the animals and of their herds along geomagnetic field lines could\nbe found. Several possible reasons for this discrepancy should be taken into\naccount: poor quality of Google satellite photographs, difficulties in\ndetermining the body axis, selection of herds or animals within herds, lack of\nblinding in the evaluation, possible subconscious bias, and, most importantly,\nhigh sensitivity of the calculated main directions of the Rayleigh vectors to\nsome kind of bias or to some overlooked or ignored confounder. This factor\ncould easily have led to an unsubstantiated positive conclusion about the\nexistence of magnetoreception.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jan 2011 12:10:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Feb 2011 08:56:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Hert", "J.", ""], ["Jelinek", "L.", ""], ["Pekarek", "L.", ""], ["Pavlicek", "A.", ""]]}]
