The model consists of four coupled reaction-diffusion equations\nand its steady localized solutions therefore obey an eight-dimensional spatial\ndynamical system in one dimension (1D). Stationary localized structures within\nthe model are found to be associated with a subcritical Turing instability and\norganized within a distinct type of foliated snaking bifurcation structure.\nThis behavior is in turn associated with the presence of an exchange point in\nparameter space at which the complex leading spatial eigenvalues of the uniform\nconcentration state are overtaken by a pair of real eigenvalues; this point\nplays the role of a Belyakov-Devaney point in this system. The primary foliated\nsnaking structure consists of periodic spike or peak trains with $N$ identical\nequidistant peaks, $N=1,2,\\dots \\,$, together with cross-links consisting of\nnonidentical, nonequidistant peaks. The structure is complicated by a multitude\nof multipulse states, some of which are also computed, and spans the parameter\nrange from the primary Turing bifurcation all the way to the fold of the $N=1$\nstate. These states form a complex template from which localized physical\nstructures develop in the transverse direction in 2D.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 21:39:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2020 05:59:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 06:52:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 22 Apr 2021 06:11:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Knobloch", "Edgar", ""], ["Yochelis", "Arik", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00662", "submitter": "Matthew Simpson", "authors": "Maud El-Hachem, Scott W McCue, Matthew J Simpson", "title": "Invading and receding sharp-fronted travelling waves", "comments": "47 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biological invasion, whereby populations of motile and proliferative\nindividuals lead to moving fronts that invade into vacant regions, are\nroutinely studied using partial differential equation (PDE) models based upon\nthe classical Fisher--KPP model. While the Fisher--KPP model and extensions\nhave been successfully used to model a range of invasive phenomena, including\necological and cellular invasion, an often--overlooked limitation of the\nFisher--KPP model is that it cannot be used to model biological recession where\nthe spatial extent of the population decreases with time. In this work we study\nthe \\textit{Fisher--Stefan} model, which is a generalisation of the Fisher--KPP\nmodel obtained by reformulating the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary\nproblem. The nondimensional Fisher--Stefan model involves just one single\nparameter, $\\kappa$, which relates the shape of the density front at the moving\nboundary to the speed of the associated travelling wave, $c$. Using numerical\nsimulation, phase plane and perturbation analysis, we construct approximate\nsolutions of the Fisher--Stefan model for both slowly invading and slowly\nreceding travelling waves, as well as for rapidly receding travelling waves.\nThese approximations allow us to determine the relationship between $c$ and\n$\\kappa$ so that commonly--reported experimental estimates of $c$ can be used\nto provide estimates of the unknown parameter $\\kappa$. Interestingly, when we\nreinterpret the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary problem, many\ndisregarded features of the classical Fisher--KPP phase plane take on a new\ninterpretation since travelling waves solutions with $c < 2$ are not normally\nconsidered.

There are many\nplaces in arterioles with lower shear stress as the decrease of blood velocity,\nwhile the thickening of arterioles is not as obvious as that of the\nmedium-sized arteries.

The immune system is\ncomposed of resting cells that are converted to hunting cells to combat the\ncancer. In this work, we consider drug sensitive and resistant cancer cells. We\nshow that the tumour growth can be controlled not only by means of different\nchemotherapy protocols, but also by the immune system that attacks both\nsensitive and resistant cancer cells. Furthermore, for all considered\nprotocols, we demonstrate that the time delay from resting to hunting cells\nplays a crucial role in the combat against cancer cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2020 03:59:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Trobia", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Gabrick", "Enrique C", ""], ["Seifert", "Evandro G", ""], ["Borges", "Fernando S", ""], ["Protachevicz", "Paulo R", ""], ["Szezech", "Jos\u00e9 D", "Jr"], ["Iarosz", "Kelly C", ""], ["Santos", "Moises S", ""], ["Caldas", "Iber\u00ea L", ""], ["Tian", "Kun", ""], ["Ren", "Hai-Peng", ""], ["Grebogi", "Celso", ""], ["Batista", "Antonio M", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.09704", "submitter": "Marcos Edel Martinez-Montero Dr.", "authors": "M.E.

Methods: A retrospective case-control study was\nconducted by reviewing charts and slides of placentas between April 1 to July\n24, 2020.

Individual and group, pathological features\nwere extracted from placental pathology reports. Results: Twenty-one\n3rd-trimester, placentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women were identified and\ncompared to 20 placentas from SARS-CoV-2-negative women. There were no\nsignificant differences in individual or group gross or microscopic\npathological features between the groups. Within the SARS-CoV-2+ group, there\nare no differences between symptomatic and asymptomatic women. Conclusion:\nPlacentas from SARS-CoV-2-positive women do not demonstrate a specific\npathological pattern.
