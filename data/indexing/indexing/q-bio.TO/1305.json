Recent advances in inducible genetic\nlabeling provided ample evidence that symmetric stem cell divisions play an\nimportant role in adult mammalian homeostasis. It is well understood that the\ntwo types of cell divisions differ in terms of the stem cells' flexibility to\nexpand when needed. On the contrary, the implications of symmetric and\nasymmetric divisions for mutation accumulation are still poorly understood. In\nthis paper we study a stochastic model of a renewing tissue, and address the\noptimization problem of tissue architecture in the context of mutant\nproduction. Specifically, we study the process of tumor suppressor gene\ninactivation which usually takes place as a sequence of two consecutive \"hits\",\nand which is one of the most common patterns in carcinogenesis. We compare and\ncontrast symmetric and asymmetric (and mixed) stem cell divisions, and focus on\nthe rate at which double-hit mutants are generated. It turns out that\nsymmetrically-dividing cells generate such mutants at a rate which is\nsignificantly lower than that of asymmetrically-dividing cells. This result\nholds whether single-hit (intermediate) mutants are disadvantageous, neutral,\nor advantageous. It is also independent on whether the carcinogenic double-hit\nmutants are produced only among the stem cells or also among more\ndifferentiated cells. We argue that symmetric stem cell divisions in mammals\ncould be an adaptation which helps delay the onset of cancers. We further\ninvestigate the question of the optimal fraction of stem cells in the tissue,\nand quantify the contribution of non-stem cells in mutant production. Our work\nprovides a hypothesis to explain the observation that in mammalian cells,\nsymmetric patterns of stem cell division seem to be very common.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 06:17:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shahriyari", "Leili", ""], ["Komarova", "Natalia L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.0727", "submitter": "Daniel Beard", "authors": "Klas H.
