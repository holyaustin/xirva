Results: Using logistic\nregression adjusting for gender, smoking status, age, body mass index, family\nhistory of asthma, and income level, revealed that the odds ratio (OR) of\nasthma for a participant with severe periodontitis was 0.44 (95% confidence\ninterval: 0.27, 0.70) that of a participant with none/mild periodontitis .

The relationship between\nthe total oxygen transfer rate and the pressure drop through the capillary is\nshown to be captured across a wide range of pressure drops by physical scaling\nlaws and an upper bound on the oxygen transfer rate. A regression equation is\nintroduced that can be used to estimate the oxygen transfer in a capillary\nusing the vascular resistance. Two techniques for quantifying the effects of\nstatistical variability, experimental uncertainty and pathological placental\nstructure on the calculated properties are then introduced. First, scaling\narguments are used to quantify the sensitivity of the model to uncertainties in\nthe geometry and the parameters. Second, the effects of localized dilations in\nfetal capillaries are investigated using an idealized axisymmetric model, to\nquantify the possible effect of pathological placental structure on oxygen\ntransfer. The model predicts how, for a fixed pressure drop through a\ncapillary, oxygen transfer is maximized by an optimal width of the dilation.\nThe results could explain the prevalence of fetal hypoxia in cases of delayed\nvillous maturation, a pathology characterized by a lack of the\nvasculo-syncytial membranes often seen in conjunction with localized capillary\ndilations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 16:00:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 08:47:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 16:49:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 18:15:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pearce", "Philip", ""], ["Brownbill", "Paul", ""], ["Janacek", "Jiri", ""], ["Jirkovska", "Marie", ""], ["Kubinova", "Lucie", ""], ["Chernyavsky", "Igor L.", ""], ["Jensen", "Oliver E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.03910", "submitter": "Kishan Manani", "authors": "Kishan A.

An inability to understand and predict\nvariation in AF progression has resulted in less patient-specific therapy.\nLikewise, it has been a challenge to relate the microstructural features of\nheart muscle tissue (myocardial architecture) with the emergent temporal\nclinical patterns of AF. We use a simple model of activation wavefront\npropagation on an anisotropic structure, mimicking heart muscle tissue, to show\nhow variation in AF behaviour arises naturally from microstructural differences\nbetween individuals. We show that the stochastic nature of progressive\ntransversal uncoupling of muscle strands (e.g., due to fibrosis or gap\njunctional remodelling), as occurs with age, results in variability in AF\nepisode onset time, frequency, duration, burden and progression between\nindividuals. This is consistent with clinical observations. The uncoupling of\nmuscle strands can cause critical architectural patterns in the myocardium.\nThese critical patterns anchor micro-re-entrant wavefronts and thereby trigger\nAF. It is the number of local critical patterns of uncoupling as opposed to\nglobal uncoupling that determines AF progression.
