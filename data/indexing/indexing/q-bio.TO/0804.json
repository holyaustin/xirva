Cell diversity that observed during the differentiation\nthrough the different epidermal cell layers included the consisted changes of\ncell shape, intercellular contacts and proliferation. However, the most\ndramatically these changes appeared at the molecular level through gene\nexpression, catalysis and intraprotein interactions. The proposed review\nexplains these changes by switching systemic transcription factors that unlike\ntheir counterparts those role is limited to a contribution to gene expression\nalso prepare cells to the next step of differentiation via modification of the\nchromatin pattern . Since primary epidermal keratinocytes are one of the most\neasy available type of the stem cells, a better understanding of the epidermal\ndifferentiation will benefit the research in the other areas by a discovery of\nbasic coordinating mechanisms that stand behind such distinct molecular events\nas cell signaling and gene expression, and formulate basic principles for a\nsmart therapeutic correction of the metabolism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Apr 2008 21:32:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mezentsev", "A.", ""]]}]
