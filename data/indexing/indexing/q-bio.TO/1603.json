In\nchemoradiotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents are administered along with\nradiation to increase damage to the primary tumor and control systemic disease\nsuch as metastasis. This work introduces a mathematical model to obtain optimal\ndrug and radiation protocols in a chemoradiotherapy scheduling problem with the\nobjective of minimizing metastatic cancer cell populations at multiple\npotential sites while maintaining a minimum level of damage to the primary\ntumor site. We derive closed-form expressions for an optimal chemotherapy\nfractionation regimen. A dynamic programming framework is used to determine the\noptimal radiotherapy fractionation regimen. Results show that chemotherapeutic\nagents do not change the optimal radiation fractionation regimens, and\nvice-versa. Interestingly, we observe that regardless of radio-sensitivity\nparameters, hypo-fractionated schedules are optimal solutions for the\nradiotherapy fractionation problem. Furthermore, it is optimal to immediately\nstart radiotherapy. However, for chemotherapy, we find that the structure of\nthe optimal schedule depends on model parameters such as chemotherapy-induced\ncell-kill at primary and metastatic sites, as well as the ability of primary\ntumor cells to initiate successful metastasis at different body sites. We\nquantify the trade-off between the new and traditional objectives of minimizing\nthe metastatic population size and maximizing the tumor control probability,\nrespectively, for a cervical cancer case. The trade-off information indicates\nthe potential for significant reduction in the metastatic population with\nminimal loss in primary tumor control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 03:30:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:54:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Badri", "Hamidreza", ""], ["Salari", "Ehsan", ""], ["Watanabe", "Yoichi", ""], ["Leder", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00459", "submitter": "Renaud Bastien", "authors": "Renaud Bastien, Yasmine Meroz", "title": "The Kinematics of Plant Nutation Reveals a Simple Relation Between\n  Curvature and the Orientation of Differential Growth", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005238", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Nutation is an oscillatory movement that plants display during their\ndevelopment.

As the heterogeneous\ndeposition of inhaled radon progeny results in high local doses at the peak of\nthe bronchial bifurcations, it was proposed earlier that hyperplasia occurs in\nthese deposition hot spots upon chronic radon exposure. The objective of the\npresent study is to quantify how the induction of basal cell hyperplasia\nmodulates the microdosimetric consequences of a given radon exposure. For this\npurpose, numerical epithelium models were generated with spherical cell nuclei\nof six different cell types based on histological data. Basal cell hyperplasia\nwas modelled by epithelium models with additional basal cells and increased\nepithelium thickness. Microdosimetry for alpha-particles was performed by an\nown-developed Monte-Carlo code. Results show that the average tissue dose, and\nthe average hit number and dose of basal cells decrease by the increase of the\nmeasure of hyperplasia. Hit and dose distribution reveal that the induction of\nhyperplasia may result in a basal cell pool which is shielded from alpha\nradiation. It highlights that the exposure history affects the microdosimetric\nconsequences of a present exposure, while the biological and health effects may\nalso depend on previous exposures. The induction of hyperplasia can be\nconsidered as a radioadaptive response at the tissue level. Such an adaptation\nof the tissue challenges the validity of the application of the dose dose rate\neffectiveness factor from a mechanistic point of view.

This process explores and takes advantage of the reciprocal relation\nthat solid tumours establish with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and\nother multiple distinct cell types from the surrounding microenvironment.\nThrough the secretion of various proteolytic enzymes such as matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMP) or the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), the\ncancer cell population alters the configuration of the surrounding ECM\ncomposition and overcomes the physical barriers to ultimately achieve local\ncancer spread into the surrounding tissue. The active interplay between the\ntissue-scale tumour dynamics and the molecular mechanics of the involved\nproteolytic enzymes at the cell-scale underlines the biologically multiscale\ncharacter of invasion, and raises the challenge of modelling this process with\nan appropriate multiscale approach. In this paper, we present a new two-scale\nmoving boundary model of cancer invasion that explores the tissue scale tumour\ndynamics in conjunction with the molecular dynamics of the urokinase\nplasminogen activation system.
