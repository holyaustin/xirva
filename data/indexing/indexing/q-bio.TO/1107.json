It is demonstrated that\ninevitable stochastic forces existing in all three cell species are able to\nsuppress tumor cell growth completely. Whereas the deterministic model does not\nreveal a stable tumor-free state, the auto-correlated noise combined with\ncross-correlation functions can either lead to tumor dormant states, tumor\nprogression as well as to an elimination of tumor cells. The auto-correlation\nfunction exhibits a finite correlation time $\\tau$ while the cross-correlation\nfunctions shows a white noise behavior. The evolution of each of the three\nkinds of cells leads to a multiplicative noise coupling. The model is\ninvestigated by means of a multivariate Fokker-Planck equation for small\n$\\tau$. The different behavior of the system is above all determined by the\nvariation of the correlation time and the strength of the cross-correlation\nbetween tumor and tumor detecting cells. The theoretical model is based on a\nbiological background discussed in detail and the results are tested using\nrealistic parameters from experimental observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2011 14:39:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bose", "Thomas", ""], ["Trimper", "Steffen", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1027", "submitter": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui", "authors": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui (Prisme), Awad Bettamer (Prisme), Ridha Hambli\n  (Prisme)", "title": "Failure of Mineralized Collagen Microfibrils Using Finite Element\n  Simulation Coupled to Mechanical Quasi-brittle Damage", "comments": "6; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811007144", "journal-ref": "Procedia engineering 10 (2011) 3193-3198", "doi": "10.1016/j.proeng.2011.04.526", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.med-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bone is a multiscale heterogeneous materiel of which principal function is to\nsupport the body structure and to resist mechanical loading and fractures. Bone\nstrength does not depend only on the quantity and quality of bone which is\ncharacterized by the geometry and the shape of bones but also on the mechanical\nproprieties of its compounds, which have a significant influence on its\ndeformation and failure. This work aim to use a 3D nano-scale finite element\nmodel coupled to the concept of quasi-brittle damage with the behaviour law\nisotropic elasticity to investigate the fracture behaviour of composite\nmateriel collagen-mineral (mineralized collagen microfibril). Fracture\nstress-number of cross-links and damping capacity-number of cross-links curves\nwere obtained under tensile loading conditions at different densities of the\nmineral phase. The obtained results show that number of cross-links as well as\nthe density of mineral has an important influence on the strength of\nmicrofibrils which in turn clarify the bone fracture at macro-scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2011 05:45:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Barkaoui", "Abdelwahed", "", "Prisme"], ["Bettamer", "Awad", "", "Prisme"], ["Hambli", "Ridha", "", "Prisme"]]}, {"id": "1107.2223", "submitter": "Marc de Lussanet H.E.", "authors": "Marc H.

Although larval\nechinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the\nlarval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different\nsymmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and\nthe variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous\ndifficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the\nexcellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place\nechinoderms outside the other deuterostomes. Here I propose that the\npredominant five-ray structure is derived from a hexamer structure that is\ngrounded directly in the structure of the bilaterally symmetric larva. This\nhypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from\nthe larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms\namong the bilaterians. In order to test the hypothesis rigorously, a model is\ndeveloped in which one ray is missing between rays IV-V (Loven's schema) or\nrays C-D (Carpenter's schema). The model is used to make predictions, which are\ntested and verified for the process of metamorphosis and for the morphology of\nrecent and fossil forms. The theory provides fundamental insight into the\nM-plane and the Ubisch', Loven's and Carpenter's planes and generalizes them\nfor all echinoderms. The theory also makes robust predictions about the\nevolution of the pentamer structure and its developmental basis. *** including\ncorrections (see footnotes) ***\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2011 09:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2013 19:45:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["de Lussanet", "Marc H.

The bone mechanical properties are updated at macroscopic\nscale depending on the morphological organization at the mesoscopic computed by\nthe trained neural network. The digital image-based modeling technique using\nm-CT and voxel finite element mesh is used to capture 2 mm3 Representative\nVolume Elements at mesoscale level in a femur head. The input data for the\nartificial neural network are a set of bone material parameters, boundary\nconditions and the applied stress.
