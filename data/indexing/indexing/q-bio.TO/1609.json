Building on a minimal model of\nthe Henle loop - the central part of the kidney filtration - we investigate\ntheoretically the detailed out-of-equilibrium fluxes in this separation process\nin order to obtain absolute theoretical bounds for its efficiency in terms of\nseparation ability and energy consumption. We demonstrate that this separation\nprocess operates at a remarkably small energy cost as compared to traditional\nsieving processes while working at much smaller pressures. This unique\nenergetic efficiency originates in the double-loop geometry of the nephron,\nwhich operates as an active osmotic exchanger. The principles for an\nartificial-kidney-inspired filtration device could be readily mimicked based on\nexisting soft technologies to build compact and low-energy artificial dialytic\ndevices.

This paper outlines a theoretical and\ncomputational framework for establishing quarter power scaling in-vitro,\nstarting where fractal distribution ends. Allometric scaling in non-vascular\nspherical tissue constructs was assessed using models of Michaelis Menten\noxygen consumption and diffusion.

Consequently there has been significant interest\nin understanding how cardiac activity is influenced by the circadian clock,\ni.e., temporal oscillations in physiological activity with a period close to 24\nhours and synchronized with the day-night cycle. Although studies have\nidentified the genetic basis of circadian rhythms at the intracellular level,\nthe mechanisms by which they influence cardiac pathologies are not yet fully\nunderstood. Evidence has suggested that diurnal variations in the conductance\nproperties of ion channel proteins that govern the excitation dynamics of\ncardiac cells may provide the crucial link. In this paper, we investigate the\nrelationship between the circadian rhythm as manifested in modulations of ion\nchannel properties and the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmias by using a\nmathematical model that describes electrical activity in ventricular tissue. We\nshow that changes in the channel conductance that lead to extreme values for\nthe duration of action potentials in cardiac cells can result either in\nabnormally high-frequency reentrant activity or spontaneous conduction block of\nexcitation waves. Both phenomena increase the likelihood of wavebreaks that are\nknown to initiate potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Thus, disruptive\ncardiac excitation dynamics are most likely to occur in time-intervals of the\nday-night cycle during which the channel properties are closest to these\nextreme values, providing an intriguing relation between circadian rhythms and\ncardiac pathologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 13:30:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Seenivasan", "Pavithraa", ""], ["Menon", "Shakti N.", ""], ["Sridhar", "S.", ""], ["Sinha", "Sitabhra", ""]]}]
