However, due to the complex internal structure of\nthe scaffolds, whole scaffold calculations of the local shear forces are\ncomputationally-intensive. Instead, representative volume elements (RVEs),\nwhich are obtained by extracting smaller portions of the scaffold, are commonly\nused in literature without a numerical accuracy standard. Hence, the goal of\nthis study is to examine how closely the whole scaffold simulations are\napproximated by the two types of boundary conditions used to enable the RVEs:\n\"wall boundary condition\" (WBC) and \"periodic boundary condition\" (PBC). To\nthat end, Lattice-Boltzmann Method fluid dynamics simulations were used to\nmodel the surface shear stresses in 3D scaffold reconstructions, obtained from\nhigh resolution microcomputed tomography images. It was found that despite the\nRVEs being sufficiently larger than 6 times the scaffold pore size (which is\nthe only accuracy guideline found in literature), the stresses were still\nsignificantly under-predicted by both types of boundary conditions: between 20\nand 80% average error, depending on the scaffold's porosity. Moreover, it was\nfound that the error grew with higher porosity. This is likely due to the small\npores dominating the flow field, and thereby negating the effects of the\nunrealistic boundary conditions, when the scaffold porosity is small. Finally,\nit was found that the PBC was always more accurate and computationally\nefficient than the WBC. Therefore, it is the recommended type of RVE. Overall,\nthis work provides a previously-unavailable guidance to researchers regarding\nthe best choice of boundary conditions for RVE simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 21:19:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kadri", "Olufemi E.", ""], ["Williams", "Cortes", "III"], ["Sikavitsas", "Vassilios", ""], ["Voronov", "Roman S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.01974", "submitter": "Jun-Seop Song", "authors": "Jun-Seop Song, Jaehyeok Kim, Byounghyun Lim, Young-Seon Lee, Minki\n  Hwang, Boyoung Joung, Eun Bo Shim, Hui-Nam Pak", "title": "Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of heterogeneous tissue curvature: A\n  suggestion for role of left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation", "comments": "Accepted for publication in Circulation Journal", "journal-ref": "Circulation Journal 83.1 (2019) 32-40 [PMID: 30429429]", "doi": "10.1253/circj.CJ-18-0615", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: The arrhythmogenic role of atrial complex morphology has not yet\nbeen clearly elucidated.

Ideally, such quality would be affirmed at\nearly stages before the commitment of extensive parental resources. A case is\nhere made that, along the lines of a previously proposed lymphocyte quality\ncontrol mechanism, gamete quality can be registered indirectly through\ndetection of incompatibilities between proteins encoded by the grandparental\nDNA sequences within the parent from which haploid gametes are meiotically\nderived. This 'stress test' is achieved in the same way that thymic screening\nfor potential immunological incompatibilities is achieved - by 'promiscuous'\nexpression, under the influence of the AIRE protein, of the products of genes\nthat are not normally specific for that organ. Consistent with this, the Aire\ngene is expressed in both thymus and gonads, and AIRE deficiency impedes\nfunction in both organs. While not excluding the subsequent emergence of hybrid\nincompatibilities due to the intermixing of genomic sequences from parents\n(rather than grandparents), many observations, such as the number of proteins\nthat are aberrantly expressed during gametogenesis, can be explained on this\nbasis. Indeed, promiscuous expression could have first evolved in\ngamete-forming cells where incompatible proteins would be manifest as aberrant\nprotein aggregates that cause apoptosis.

The cycling cell concentration was significantly higher in\nBSs located inside (10 $\\pm$ 12 cell/mm$^2$) compared to outside (0.5 $\\pm$ 0.9\ncell/mm$^2$) MRI-defined abnormalities (p=0.0001).\n  Conclusions : We show that the margins of T2-weighted signal changes are\nmainly correlated with the edema fraction. In 62.5% of patients, the cycling\ntumor cell fraction (defined as the ratio of the cycling tumor cell\nconcentration to the total number of tumor cells) was higher at the limits of\nthe MRI-defined abnormalities than closer to the center of the tumor. In the\nremaining patients, the cycling tumor cell fraction increased towards the\ncenter of the tumor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Mar 2018 22:49:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gerin", "Chlo\u00e9", ""], ["Pallud", "Johan", ""], ["Deroulers", "Christophe", ""], ["Varlet", "Pascale", ""], ["Oppenheim", "Catherine", ""], ["Roux", "Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier", ""], ["Chr\u00e9tien", "Fabrice", ""], ["Thomas", "Stephen Randy", ""], ["Grammaticos", "Basile", ""], ["Badoual", "Mathilde", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.09837", "submitter": "Govind Kaigala", "authors": "Ali Oskooei and Govind Kaigala", "title": "Analyte-localization device for point-of-use processing of\n  sub-millimetre areas on surfaces", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": "Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical (Volume 258, 1 April 2018, Pages\n  961-969)", "doi": "10.1016/j.snb.2017.11.130", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.ins-det q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  We present a portable, simple-to-operate, point-of-use analyte surface\nlocalization device.

While it is\nmanifest that cells utilize both intracellular and intercellular mechanisms,\nhow the two produce the collective polarization remains an active area of\ninvestigation. We study the role of intracellular interactions in the\nlarge-scale spatial coherence of cell polarities, and scrutinize the role of\nintracellular interactions in the emergence of tissue-wide polarization. We\ndemonstrate that nonlocal cytoplasmic interactions are necessary and sufficient\nfor the robust long-range polarization, and are essential to the faithful\ndetection of weak directional signals. In the presence of nonlocal\ninteractions, signatures of geometrical information in tissue polarity become\nmanifest. We investigate the deleterious effects of geometric disorder, and\ndetermine conditions on the cytoplasmic interactions that guarantee the\nstability of polarization. These conditions get progressively more stringent\nupon increasing the geometric disorder. Another situation where the role of\ngeometrical information might be evident is elongated tissues. Strikingly, our\nmodel recapitulates an observed influence of tissue elongation on the\norientation of polarity. Eventually, we introduce three classes of mutants:\nlack of membrane proteins, cytoplasmic proteins, and local geometrical\nirregularities. We adopt core-PCP as a model pathway, and interpret the model\nparameters accordingly, through comparing the in silico and in vivo phenotypes.\nThis comparison helps us shed light on the roles of the cytoplasmic proteins in\ncell-cell communication, and make predictions regarding the cooperation of\ncytoplasmic and membrane proteins in long-range polarization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Mar 2018 06:33:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Mar 2019 00:56:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shadkhoo", "Shahriar", ""], ["Mani", "Madhav", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.11253", "submitter": "Nivethika Sivakumaran", "authors": "Adoni Fernando, Nivethika Sivakumaran", "title": "A comprehensive review of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This review was written to provide a comprehensive summary of the suggested\netiologies of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) in Sri Lanka.\nIn this review, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is explained in detail and its\nknown etiologies are discussed.
