Such lesions are associated with\narticular cartilage degeneration and osteoarthritis. The typical injury\nresponse often causes collateral damage, primarily an effect of inflammation,\nwhich results in the spread of lesions beyond the region where the initial\ninjury occurs. We present a minimal mathematical model based on known\nmechanisms to investigate the spread and abatement of such lesions. In\nparticular we represent the \"balancing act\" between pro-inflammatory and\nanti-inflammatory cytokines that is hypothesized to be a principal mechanism in\nthe expansion properties of cartilage damage during the typical injury\nresponse. We present preliminary results of in vitro studies that confirm the\nanti-inflammatory activities of the cytokine erythropoietin (EPO). We assume\nthat the diffusion of cytokines determine the spatial behaviour of injury\nresponse and lesion expansion so that a reaction-diffusion system involving\nchemical species and chondrocyte cell state population densities is a natural\nway to represent cartilage injury response. We present computational results\nusing the mathematical model showing that our representation is successful in\ncapturing much of the interesting spatial behaviour of injury associated lesion\ndevelopment and abatement in articular cartilage. Further, we discuss the use\nof this model to study the possibility of using EPO as a therapy for reducing\nthe amount of inflammation induced collateral damage to cartilage during the\ntypical injury response. The mathematical model presented herein suggests that\nnot only are anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as EPO necessary to prevent\nchondrocytes signaled by pro-inflammatory cytokines from entering apoptosis,\nthey may also influence how chondrocytes respond to signaling by\npro-inflammatory cytokines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 20:36:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Graham", "Jason M.", ""], ["Ayati", "Bruce P.", ""], ["Ding", "Lei", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "Prem S.", ""], ["Martin", "James A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1368", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Pietro Li\\`o (Computer Laboratory.

The implementation of a new model of bone remodeling in PRISM has\nled to an interesting characterization of osteoporosis as a defective bone\nremodeling dynamics with respect to other bone pathologies. Our approach allows\nto derive three types of model checking-based diagnostic estimators. The first\ndiagnostic measure focuses on the level of bone mineral density, which is\ncurrently used in medical practice. In addition, we have introduced a novel\ndiagnostic estimator which uses the full patient clinical record, here\nsimulated using the modeling framework. This estimator detects rapid (months)\nnegative changes in bone mineral density. Independently of the actual bone\nmineral density, when the decrease occurs rapidly it is important to alarm the\npatient and monitor him/her more closely to detect insurgence of other bone\nco-morbidities. A third estimator takes into account the variance of the bone\ndensity, which could address the investigation of metabolic syndromes, diabetes\nand cancer. Our implementation could make use of different logical combinations\nof these statistical estimators and could incorporate other biomarkers for\nother systemic co-morbidities (for example diabetes and thalassemia). We are\ndelighted to report that the combination of stochastic modeling with formal\nmethods motivate new diagnostic framework for complex pathologies. In\nparticular our approach takes into consideration important properties of\nbiosystems such as multiscale and self-adaptiveness. The multi-diagnosis could\nbe further expanded, inching towards the complexity of human diseases. Finally,\nwe briefly introduce self-adaptiveness in formal methods which is a key\nproperty in the regulative mechanisms of biological systems and well known in\nother mathematical and engineering areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 06:27:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Li\u00f2", "Pietro", "", "Computer Laboratory.
