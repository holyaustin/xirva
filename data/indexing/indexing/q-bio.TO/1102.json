This is valid also for numerical investigations. In fact,\nmany computational studies either neglect the existence of discrete cells or\nresolve relatively few cells very accurately. The authors recently developed a\nsimple and highly efficient yet still particulate model with the aim to bridge\nthe gap between currently applied methods. The present work focuses on its\napplicability to confined flows in vessels of diameters up to 100 micrometres.\nFor hematocrit values below 30 percent, a dependence of the apparent viscosity\non the vessel diameter in agreement with experimental literature data is found.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 10:08:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 16:01:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Janoschek", "Florian", ""], ["Toschi", "Federico", ""], ["Harting", "Jens", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2359", "submitter": "Jean-Francois Sadoc", "authors": "Jean Charvolin and Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Sadoc", "title": "A Phyllotactic Approach to the Structure of Collagen Fibrils", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collagen fibrils, cable-like assemblies of long biological molecules, are\ndominant components of connective tissues. Their determinant morphological and\nfunctional roles motivated a large number of studies concerning their formation\nand structure. However, these two points are still open questions and,\nparticularly, that of their organization which is certainly dense but not\nstrictly that of a crystal. We examine here how the algorithm of phyllotaxis\ncould contribute to the analysis of the structure of collagen fibrils. Such an\nalgorithm indeed leads to organizations giving to each element of the assembly\nthe most homogeneous and isotropic dense environment in a situation of\ncylindrical symmetry. The scattered intensity expected from a phyllotactic\ndistribution of triple helices in collagen fibrils well agrees with the major\nfeatures observed along the equatorial direction of their X ray patterns.\nFollowing this approach, the aggregation of triple helices in fibrils should be\nconsidered within the frame of soft condensed matter studies rather than that\nof molecular crystal studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Feb 2011 14:36:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2011 12:16:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Charvolin", "Jean", ""], ["Sadoc", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}]
