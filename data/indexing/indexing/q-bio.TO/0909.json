This explanation was reached after we realized that\nBAK1 has two edited copies in human genome. These copies are probably BAK1\npseudogenes. One copy belongs to chromosome 11 (NG_005599.3) and the other to\nchromosome 20 (NC_000850.5). The first copy has frameshifts which means that\nprobably it does not express any functional protein; by other hand, the\nchromosome 20 copy has no frameshifts and what is more important contains all\nthe reported polymorphisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 12 Sep 2009 10:40:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Yamagishi", "Michel Eduardo Beleza", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4398", "submitter": "Sridhar S", "authors": "S.

Recently, in a series of papers, I have proposed a new coupled\nloading-rate hypothesis as a unique cause of all above injuries. This new\nhypothesis states that the main cause of all mechanical injuries is a Euclidean\nJolt, which is an impulsive loading that strikes any part of the human body\n(head, spine or any bone/joint) - in several coupled degrees-of-freedom\nsimultaneously. It never goes in a single direction only. Also, it is never a\nstatic force. It is always an impulsive translational and/or rotational force,\ncoupled to some human mass eccentricity.\n  Keywords: traumatic brain injury, spinal injury, musculo-skeletal injury,\ncoupled loading-rate hypothesis, Euclidean jolt\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2009 03:43:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2009 02:55:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir G.", ""]]}]
