Although many of the\nmolecular genetic factors are now known, the system level regulation of growth\nis still poorly understood. A simple form of inhibition of cell proliferation\nis encountered in vitro in normally differentiating epithelial cell cultures\nand is known as \"contact inhibition\". The study presented here provides a\nquantitative characterization of contact inhibition dynamics on tissue-wide and\nsingle cell levels. Using long-term tracking of cultured MDCK cells we\ndemonstrate that inhibition of cell division in a confluent monolayer follows\ninhibition of cell motility and sets in when mechanical constraint on local\nexpansion causes divisions to reduce cell area. We quantify cell motility and\ncell cycle statistics in the low density confluent regime and their change\nacross the transition to epithelial morphology which occurs with increasing\ncell density. We then study the dynamics of cell area distribution arising\nthrough reductive division, determine the average mitotic rate as a function of\ncell size and demonstrate that complete arrest of mitosis occurs when cell area\nfalls below a critical value. We also present a simple computational model of\ngrowth mechanics which captures all aspects of the observed behavior. Our\nmeasurements and analysis show that contact inhibition is a consequence of\nmechanical interaction and constraint rather than interfacial contact alone,\nand define quantitative phenotypes that can guide future studies of molecular\nmechanisms underlying contact inhibition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2011 14:04:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Puliafito", "Alberto", ""], ["Hufnagel", "Lars", ""], ["Neveu", "Pierre", ""], ["Streichan", "Sebastian", ""], ["Sigal", "Alex", ""], ["Fygenson", "Deborah K.", ""], ["Shraiman", "Boris I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.0984", "submitter": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui", "authors": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui (Prisme), Ridha Hambli (Prisme)", "title": "Finite element 3D modeling of mechanical behavior of mineralized\n  collagen microfibrils", "comments": "Journal of Applied Biomaterials and Biomechanics 9, 3 (2011) xxx", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5301/JABB.2011.8876", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this work is to develop a 3D finite elements model to study the\nnanomechanical behaviour of mineralized collagen microfibrils, which consists\nof three phases, (i) collagen phase formed by five tropocollagen (TC) molecules\nlinked together with cross links, (ii) a mineral phase (Hydroxyapatite) and\n(iii) impure mineral phase, and to investigate the important role of individual\nproperties of every constituent.

In zebrafish embryos, Nodal and Lefty expression can only\noccur along 3 narrow stripes that express the co-receptor \\emph{one-eyed\npinhead} (oep): Nodal along stripes in the left and right LPM, and Lefty along\nthe midline. In wild-type embryos, Nodal is only expressed in the left LPM but\nnot the right, because of inhibition by Lefty from the midline; however,\nbilateral Nodal expression occurs in loss-of-handedness mutants. A\ntwo-dimensional model of the zebrafish embryo predicts this loss of L/R\nasymmetry in oep mutants \\cite{henley-xu-burdine}. In this paper, we simplify\nthis two-dimensional picture to a one-dimensional model of Nodal and Lefty\nfront propagation along the oep-expressing stripes. We represent Nodal and\nLefty production by step functions that turn on when a linear function of Nodal\nand Lefty densities crosses a threshold. We do a parameter exploration of front\npropagation behavior, and find the existence of \\emph{pinned} intervals, along\nwhich the linear function underlying production is pinned to the threshold.\nFinally, we find parameter regimes for which spatially uniform oscillating\nsolutions are possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Dec 2011 20:29:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Hanrong", ""], ["Henley", "C.

Here, we use the\nmulti-resolution properties of the wavelet transform to analyze the optical\nchanges. For this, we have used a novel laser imagery technique which provides\nus with a composite image of the absorption by the different cellular\norganelles. As the disease progresses, due to the growth of new cells, the\nratio of the organelle to cellular volume changes manifesting in the laser\nimagery of such tissues. In order to develop a metric that can quantify the\nchanges in such systems, we make use of the wavelet-based fluctuation analysis.\nThe changing self- similarity during disease progression can be well\ncharacterized by the Hurst exponent and the scaling exponent. Due to the use of\nthe Daubechies' family of wavelet kernels, we can extract polynomial trends of\ndifferent orders, which help us characterize the underlying processes\neffectively. In this study, we observe that the Hurst exponent decreases as the\ncancer progresses.

This coordination is achieved by a network\nof autocrine and paracrine signalling molecules between cells of the osteoclast\nlineage and cells of the osteoblastic lineage. Mathematical modelling of\nsignalling between cells of both lineages can assist in the interpretation of\nexperimental data, clarify signalling interactions and help develop a deeper\nunderstanding of complex bone diseases. In this paper, we further develop a\nmathematical model of bone cell interactions by Pivonka et al. (2008) to\ninclude the proliferation of precursor osteoblasts into the model. This\ninclusion is important to be able to account for Wnt signalling, believed to\nplay an important role in anabolic responses of bone. We show that an increased\nrate of differentiation to precursor cells or an increased rate of\nproliferation of precursor osteoblasts themselves both result in increased bone\nmass. However, modelling these different processes separately enables the new\nmodel to represent recent experimental discoveries such as the role of Wnt\nsignalling in bone biology and the recruitment of osteoblast progenitor cells\nby transforming growth factor \\beta. Finally, we illustrate the power of the\nnew model's capabilities by applying the model to prostate cancer metastasis to\nbone. In the bone microenvironment, prostate cancer cells are believed to\nrelease some of the same signalling molecules used to coordinate bone\nremodelling (i.e. Wnt and PTHrP), enabling the cancer cells to disrupt normal\nsignalling and coordination between bone cells. This disruption can lead to\neither bone gain or bone loss. We demonstrate that the new computational model\ndeveloped here is capable of capturing some key observations made on the\nevolution of the bone mass due to metastasis of prostate cancer to the bone\nmicroenvironment\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Dec 2011 01:56:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 14:49:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""], ["Pivonka", "Peter", ""], ["Gardiner", "Bruce S.", ""], ["Smith", "David W.", ""]]}]
