This method provides an estimation of the facial shape\nassociated with unidentified skeletal remains. Current computer-assisted\nmethods using a statistical framework rely on a common set of extracted points\nlocated on the bone and soft-tissue surfaces. Most of the facial reconstruction\nmethods then consist of predicting the position of the soft-tissue surface\npoints, when the positions of the bone surface points are known. We propose to\nuse Latent Root Regression for prediction. The results obtained are then\ncompared to those given by Principal Components Analysis linear models. In\nconjunction, we have evaluated the influence of the number of skull landmarks\nused. Anatomical skull landmarks are completed iteratively by points located\nupon geodesics which link these anatomical landmarks, thus enabling us to\nartificially increase the number of skull points. Facial points are obtained\nusing a mesh-matching algorithm between a common reference mesh and individual\nsoft-tissue surface meshes. The proposed method is validated in term of\naccuracy, based on a leave-one-out cross-validation test applied to a\nhomogeneous database. Accuracy measures are obtained by computing the distance\nbetween the original face surface and its reconstruction.
