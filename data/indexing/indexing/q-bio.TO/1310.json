Based\non biophysical derivations, it describes organism-scale population dynamics\nunder the influence of three processes: birth (dissemination of secondary\ntumors), growth and inhibition (through angiogenesis). The resulting model is a\nnonlinear partial differential transport equation with nonlocal boundary\ncondition. The nonlinearity stands in the velocity through a nonlocal quantity\nof the model (the total metastatic volume). The asymptotic behavior of the\nmodel is numerically investigated and reveals interesting dynamics ranging from\nconvergence to a steady state to bounded non-periodic or periodic behaviors,\npossibly with complex repeated patterns. Numerical simulations are performed\nwith the intent to theoretically study the relative impact of potentiation or\nimpairment of each process of the birth/growth/inhibition balance.

We simulate the crucial\nprocesses involved in tumor growth, such as oxygen diffusion, carcinogen\npenetration, and angiogenesis, within the framework of the urothelial cell\ndynamics. The cell dynamics are modeled using the discrete technique of\nCellular Automata, while the continuous processes of carcinogen penetration and\noxygen diffusion are described by nonlinear diffusion-absorption equations. As\nthe availability of oxygen is necessary for tumor progression, processes of\noxygen transport to the tumor growth site seem most important. Our model yields\na theoretical insight into the main stages of development and growth of urinary\nbladder carcinoma with emphasis on two most common types: bladder polyps and\ncarcinoma {\\it in situ}. Analysis of histological structure of bladder tumor is\nimportant to avoid misdiagnosis and wrong treatment and we expect our model to\nbe a valuable tool in the prediction of tumor grade and progression patterns,\nbased on the exposure to carcinogens and an oxygen dependent expression of\ngenes promoting tumor growth.

The model is based on a three-component nonlinear system of\ntwo-dimensional partial differential equations for fluid, glucose and albumin\ntransport with the relevant boundary and initial conditions. Its aim is to\nmodel ultrafiltration of water combined with inflow of glucose to the tissue\nand removal of albumin from the body during dialysis, and it does this by\nfinding the spatial distributions of glucose and albumin concentrations and\nhydrostatic pressure. The model is developed in one spatial dimension\napproximation and a governing equation for each of the variables is derived\nfrom physical principles. Under certain assumptions the model are simplified\nwith the aim of obtaining exact formulae for spatially non-uniform steady-state\nsolutions.\n  As the result, the exact formulae for the fluid fluxes from blood to tissue\nand across the tissue are constructed together with two linear autonomous ODEs\nfor glucose and albumin concentrations in the tissue.
