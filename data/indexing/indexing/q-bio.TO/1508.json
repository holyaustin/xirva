Theoretical\nmodels can help by focusing experimental studies and by providing the framework\nfor interpreting measurements. To that end, \"vertex models\" have introduced an\napproximation of epithelial cell mechanics based on a polygonal tiling\nrepresentation of planar tissue. Here we formulate and analyze an Active\nTension Network (ATN) model, which is based on the same polygonal\nrepresentation of epithelial tissue geometry, but in addition i) assumes that\nmechanical balance is dominated by cortical tension and ii) introduces tension\ndependent local remodeling of the cortex, representing the active nature of\ncytoskeletal mechanics. The tension-dominance assumption has immediate\nimplications for the geometry of cells, which we demonstrate to hold in certain\ntypes of Drosophila epithelial tissues. We demonstrate that stationary\nconfigurations of an ATN form a manifold with one degree of freedom per cell,\ncorresponding to \"isogonal\" - i.e. angle preserving - deformations of cells,\nwhich dominate the dynamic response to perturbations. We show that isogonal\nmodes account for approximately 90% of experimentally observed deformation of\ncells during the process of ventral furrow formation in Drosophila.

Our general aim is to\ndescribe and quantify the apparent \"latticelike\" microarchitecture of the\ntrabecular bone network.\n  Methods: Similar in some ways to the topological node-strut analysis\nintroduced by Garrahan et al. [J. Microsc. 142, 341-349 (1986)], our method is\ndistinguished by an emphasis on long-range trabecular connectivity. Thus, while\nthe topological classification of a pixel (after skeletonization) as a node,\nstrut, or terminus, can be determined from the 3x3 neighborhood of that pixel,\nour method, which does not involve skeletonization, takes into account a much\nlarger neighborhood. In addition, rather than giving a discrete classification\nof each pixel as a node, strut, or terminus, our method produces a continuous\nvariable, node strength. The node strength is averaged over a region of\ninterest to produce the mean node strength of the region.\n  Results: We have applied our long range node-strut analysis to a set of 26\nhigh-resolution ... The Nd/Tm ratios were computed using traditional\nhistomorphometry performed on bone biopsies obtained at the same location as\nthe pQCT scans.\n  Conclusions: The newly introduced morphometric measure allows a quantitative\nassessment of the long-range connectivity of trabecular bone. One advantage of\nthis method is that it is based on pQCT images that can be obtained\nnoninvasively from patients, i.e., without having to obtain a bone biopsy from\nthe patient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 20:50:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Schmah", "T.", ""], ["Marwan", "N.", ""], ["Thomsen", "J.
