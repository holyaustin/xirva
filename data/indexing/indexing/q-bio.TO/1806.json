Numerous models have been\nused to characterize the arterial tissue delamination. Few has investigated the\neffect of Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) shapes on predicting the delamination\nbehavior of the arterial wall. In this study, four types of cohesive zone\nmodels (triangular, trapezoidal, linear-exponential and exponential-linear)\nwere investigated to compare their predictability of the arterial wall failure.\nThe Holzapfel-Gasser-Ogden (HGO) model was adopted for modelling the mechanical\nbehavior of the aortic bulk material. The simulation results using CZM on the\naortic media delamination were also compared with the results on mouse plaque\ndelamination and human fibrous cap delamination. The results show that: 1) the\nsimulation results based on the four shapes of CZMs match well with the\nexperimental results, 2) the triangular and exponential-linear CZMs are in good\nagreement with the experimental force-displacement curves of mouse plaque\ndelamination, 3) considering the viscoelastic effect of the arterial tissue,\nthe triangular and exponential-linear CZMs match well with the experimental\nforce-displacement curves of human fibrous cap delamination. Thus, triangular\nand exponential-linear CZMs can capture the arterial tissue failure response\nwell.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2018 02:06:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Miao", "Ting", ""], ["Tian", "Liqiong", ""], ["Leng", "Xiaochang", ""], ["Miao", "Zhamgmu", ""], ["Xu", "Chengjun", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.05790", "submitter": "Diego Rodrigues", "authors": "Diego Samuel Rodrigues, Paulo Fernando de Arruda Mancera, Tiago de\n  Carvalho, Luiz Fernando Gon\\c{c}alves", "title": "A mathematical model for chemoimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic\n  leukemia", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Immunotherapy is currently regarded as the most promising treatment to fight\nagainst cancer.
