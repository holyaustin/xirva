Osteocytes derive from bone-synthesising cells (osteoblasts) that\nbecome buried in bone matrix during bone deposition. The generation of\nosteocytes is a complex process that remains incompletely understood. Whilst\nosteoblast burial determines the density of osteocytes, the expanding network\nof osteocytes regulates in turn osteoblast activity and osteoblast burial. In\nthis paper, a spatiotemporal continuous model is proposed to investigate the\nosteoblast-to-osteocyte transition. The aims of the model are (i) to link\ndynamic properties of osteocyte generation with properties of the osteocyte\nnetwork imprinted in bone, and (ii) to investigate Marotti's hypothesis that\nosteocytes prompt the burial of osteoblasts when they become covered with\nsufficient bone matrix. Osteocyte density is assumed in the model to be\ngenerated at the moving bone surface by a combination of osteoblast density,\nmatrix secretory rate, rate of entrapment, and curvature of the bone substrate,\nbut is found to be determined solely by the ratio of the instantaneous burial\nrate and matrix secretory rate. Osteocyte density does not explicitly depend on\nosteoblast density nor curvature. Osteocyte apoptosis is also included to\ndistinguish between the density of osteocyte lacuna and the density of live\nosteocytes. Experimental measurements of osteocyte lacuna densities are used to\nestimate the rate of burial of osteoblasts in bone matrix. These results\nsuggest that: (i) burial rate decreases during osteonal infilling, and (ii) the\ncontrol of osteoblast burial by osteocytes is likely to emanate as a collective\nsignal from a large group of osteocytes, rather than from the osteocytes\nclosest to the bone deposition front.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Mar 2014 10:19:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 May 2014 12:50:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3015", "submitter": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui", "authors": "Abdelwahed Barkaoui (SYMME), Abdessalem Chamekh (PRISME), Merzouki\n  Tarek (PRISME), Ridha Hambli (PRISME), Mkaddem Ali (LMPF)", "title": "Multiscale approach including microfibril scale to assess elastic\n  constants of cortical bone based on neural network computation and\n  homogenization method", "comments": "20", "journal-ref": "Int.

In this paper, a novel multiscale hierarchical approach including\nmicrofibril scale based on hybrid neural network computation and homogenisation\nequations was developed to link nanoscopic and macroscopic scales to estimate\nthe elastic properties of human cortical bone. The multiscale model is divided\ninto three main phases: (i) in step 0, the elastic constants of collagen-water\nand mineral-water composites are calculated by averaging the upper and lower\nHill bounds; (ii) in step 1, the elastic properties of the collagen microfibril\nare computed using a trained neural network simulation. Finite element (FE)\ncalculation is performed at nanoscopic levels to provide a database to train an\nin-house neural network program; (iii) in steps 2 to 10 from fibril to\ncontinuum cortical bone tissue, homogenisation equations are used to perform\nthe computation at the higher scales. The neural network outputs (elastic\nproperties of the microfibril) are used as inputs for the homogenisation\ncomputation to determine the properties of mineralised collagen fibril.

The concept of niche construction can be\nutilized to describe the process by which cancer cells terraform their\nenvironment, thereby engineering an ecosystem that promotes the genetic fitness\nof the species. Ecological dispersion theory can then be utilized to describe\nand model the steps and barriers involved in a successful diaspora as the\ncancer cells leave the original host organ and migrate to new host organs to\nsuccessfully establish a new metastatic community. These ecological concepts\ncan be further utilized to define new diagnostic and therapeutic areas for\nlethal cancers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Mar 2014 15:17:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Kimberline R.", ""], ["Mooney", "Steven", ""], ["Zarif", "Jelani C.", ""], ["Coffey", "Donald S.", ""], ["Taichman", "Russell S.", ""], ["Pienta", "Kenneth J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7660", "submitter": "Ion Udroiu", "authors": "Ion Udroiu", "title": "Estimation of erythrocyte surface area in mammals", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Measures of erythrocytes volume and surface are helpful in several\nphysiological studies, both for zoologists and veterinarians. Whilst diameter\nand volume are assessed with ease from observations of blood smears and\ncomplete blood count, respectively, thickness and surface area, instead, are\nmuch more difficult to be obtained. The accurate description of the erythrocyte\ngeometry is given by the equation of the oval of Cassini, but the formulas\nderiving from it are very complex, comprising elliptic integrals. In this\narticle three solids are proposed as models approximating the erythrocyte:\nsphere, cylinder and a spheroid with concave caps. Volumes and Surface Areas\nobtained with these models are compared to those effectively measured.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Mar 2014 18:40:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Udroiu", "Ion", ""]]}]
