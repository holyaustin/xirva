The valve is composed of leaflets, the\nfree edges of which are supported by a system of chordae, which themselves are\nanchored to the papillary muscles inside the left ventricle. First, we examine\nvalve anatomy and present the results of original dissections. These display\nthe gross anatomy and information on fiber structure of the mitral valve. Next,\nwe build a model valve following a design-based methodology, meaning that we\nderive the model geometry and the forces that are needed to support a given\nload, and construct the model accordingly. We incorporate information from the\ndissections to specify the fiber topology of this model. We assume the valve\nachieves mechanical equilibrium while supporting a static pressure load. The\nsolution to the resulting differential equations determines the pressurized\nconfiguration of the valve model. To complete the model we then specify a\nconstitutive law based on a stress-strain relation consistent with experimental\ndata that achieves the necessary forces computed in previous steps. Finally,\nusing the immersed boundary method, we simulate the model valve in fluid in a\ncomputer test chamber. The model opens easily and closes without leak when\ndriven by physiological pressures over multiple beats. Further, its closure is\nrobust to driving pressures that lack atrial systole or are much lower or\nhigher than normal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 18:40:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2019 20:24:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kaiser", "Alexander D.", ""], ["McQueen", "David M.", ""], ["Peskin", "Charles S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00728", "submitter": "Juan Mar\\'in", "authors": "Jorge A.

They flow out of kino veins,\nschizolysigenous ducts composing an anatomically distinct continuous system of\ntangentially anastomosing lacunae produced by the vascular cambium, which\nencircle the plant. Kino is secreted holocrinously into the vein lumen by a\ncambiform epithelium lined by suberized cells that separate kino veins from the\nsurrounding axial parenchyma. A model describing kino flow in eucalypts is\npresented to investigate how vein distribution and structure, as well as kino\nholocrine loading, crystallization, and viscosity affect flow. Considering\nviscosity, vein anatomy, and a time-dependent holocrine loading of kino, the\nunsteady Stokes equation was applied. Qualitatively, kino flow is similar to\nresin flow. There is an increase in flow towards the vein open end, and both\npressure and flow depend on vein dimensions, kino properties and holocrine\nloading. However, kino veins present a much smaller specific resistance to flow\ncompared to resin ducts. Also, unlike resin loading in conifers, holocrine kino\nloading is not pressure-driven. The pressure and pressure gradient required to\ndrive an equally fast flow are smaller than what is observed on the resin ducts\nof conifers. These results agree with previous observations on some angiosperms\nand suggest that holocrinous gum flow may have lower metabolic energy costs;\nthus presenting physiological advantages and possibly constituting an\nevolutionary step of angiosperms in using internal secretory systems in plant\ndefence mechanisms compared to resin flow in conifers.
