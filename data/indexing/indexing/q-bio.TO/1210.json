We are developing mechanistic models for the\nmorphogenesis of limbs, lungs, and kidneys with a view to integrate available\nknowledge and to better understand the underlying regulatory logic. In our\nprevious paper on simulating organogenesis in COMSOL (German et al COMSOL Conf\nProcedings 2011) we discussed methods to efficiently solve such models,\npredominantly on a static domain. Organ size, however, changes dramatically\nduring development, and tissues are composed of several layers that may expand\nboth together or independently. Moreover, the developing organ are typically\nembedded in an environment, and diffusional exchange with this environment can\naffect the patterning process. Here we discuss methods to build and efficiently\nsolve models involving large deformation of composite domains in COMSOL\nMultiphysics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2012 15:33:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Menshykau", "Denis", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3087", "submitter": "Grace Chiu", "authors": "Shahedul A Khan, Grace S Chiu, Joel A Dubin", "title": "Therapeutic hypothermia: quantification of the transition of core body\n  temperature using the flexible mixture bent-cable model for longitudinal data", "comments": "On 2013-04-14, a revised version of this manuscript was accepted for\n  publication in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1111/anzs.12047", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By reducing core body temperature, T_c, induced hypothermia is a therapeutic\ntool to prevent brain damage resulting from physical trauma. However, all\nphysiological systems begin to slow down due to hypothermia that in turn can\nresult in increased risk of mortality. Therefore, quantification of the\ntransition of T_c to early hypothermia is of great clinical interest.\nConceptually, T_c may exhibit an either gradual or abrupt transition.\nBent-cable regression is an appealing statistical tool to model such data due\nto the model's flexibility and greatly interpretable regression coefficients.\nIt handles more flexibly models that traditionally have been handled by\nlow-order polynomial models (for gradual transition) or piecewise linear\nchangepoint models (for abrupt change). We consider a rat model for humans to\nquantify the temporal trend of T_c to primarily address the question: What is\nthe critical time point associated with a breakdown in the compensatory\nmechanisms following the start of hypothermia therapy? To this end, we develop\na Bayesian modelling framework for bent-cable regression of longitudinal data\nto simultaneously account for gradual and abrupt transitions. Our analysis\nreveals that: (a) about 39% of rats exhibit a gradual transition in T_c; (b)\nthe critical time point is approximately the same regardless of transition\ntype; (c) both transition types show a significant increase of T_c followed by\na significant decrease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Oct 2012 23:21:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 01:50:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Shahedul A", ""], ["Chiu", "Grace S", ""], ["Dubin", "Joel A", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3480", "submitter": "Tomas Bohr", "authors": "Renaud Bastien, Bruno Moulia, St\\'ephane Douady and Tomas Bohr", "title": "Analytical Solution of the Proprio-Graviceptive equation for shoot\n  gravitropism of plants", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math-ph math.MP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive the analytical solutions to the second order generalised\ngravi-proprioceptive equation given in our recent paper [Bastien et al. 2012].\nThese equations show how plants adjust to the surrounding gravitation field and\nhighlight the fact that the plant must be able to not only sense its local\nposture with respect to the gravitational field, but also to sense its own\nlocal curvature.

In\naddition, studies have shown that excessive noise in general can cause rapid\nphysiological changes of constituents of the auditory within the cochlea.
