Following investigation on molecular organization and macroscopic\nproperties, material functionalities, i.e. degradability and bioactivity, were\naddressed, aiming at elucidating the potential of this collagen system as\nmineralization template. Functionalised collagen hydrogels demonstrated a\npreserved triple helix conformation. Decreased swelling ratio and increased\nthermo-mechanical properties were observed in comparison to state-of-the-art\ncarbodiimide (EDC)-crosslinked collagen controls. Ph-crosslinked samples\ndisplayed no optical damage and only a slight mass decrease (~ 4 wt.-%)\nfollowing 1-week incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF), while nearly 50\nwt.-% degradation was observed in EDC-crosslinked collagen. SEM/EDS revealed\namorphous mineral deposition, whereby increased calcium phosphate ratio was\nsuggested in hydrogels with increased Ph content. This investigation provides\nvaluable insights for the synthesis of triple helical collagen materials with\nenhanced macroscopic properties and controlled degradation. In light of these\nfeatures, this system will be applied for the design of tissue-like scaffolds\nfor mineralized tissue formation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2012 15:50:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Jan 2013 14:40:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Tronci", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Doyle", "Amanda", ""], ["Russell", "Stephen J.", ""], ["Wood", "David J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.3081", "submitter": "Atsuko Takamatsu", "authors": "Atsuko Takamatsu, Takuji Ishikawa, Kyosuke Shinohara, Hiroshi Hamada", "title": "Asymmetric Rotational Stroke in Mouse Node Cilia during Left-Right\n  Determination", "comments": "5pages, 6 figures, Figs.4-6 are modified, results unchanged", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.87.050701", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Clockwise rotational movement of isolated single cilia in mice embryo was\ninvestigated in vivo. The movement generates leftward fluid flow in the node\ncavity and plays an important role in left-right determination. The leftward\nunidirectional flow results from tilting of the rotational axis of the cilium\nto posterior side. Because of the no-slip boundary condition at the cell\nsurface, the upper stroke away from the boundary generates leftward flow, and\nthe lower stroke close to the boundary generates slower rightward flow. By\ncombining computational fluid dynamics with experimental observations, we\ndemonstrate that the leftward stroke can be more effective than expected for\ncases in which cilia tilting alone is considered with the no-slip condition\nunder constant driving force. Our results suggest that the driving force is\nasymmetric and that it is determined by the tilting angle and open angle of the\nrotating cilia. Specifically, it is maximized in the leftward stroke when the\ncilia moves comparatively far from the boundary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2012 08:06:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 03:44:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Takamatsu", "Atsuko", ""], ["Ishikawa", "Takuji", ""], ["Shinohara", "Kyosuke", ""], ["Hamada", "Hiroshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.3112", "submitter": "Takuya Okabe", "authors": "Takuya Okabe", "title": "Geometric interpretation of phyllotaxis transition", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  The original problem of phyllotaxis was focused on the regular arrangements\nof leaves on mature stems represented by common fractions such as 1/2, 1/3,\n2/5, 3/8, 5/13, etc. The phyllotaxis fraction is not fixed for each plant but\nit may undergo stepwise transitions during ontogeny, despite contrasting\nobservation that the arrangement of leaf primordia at shoot apical meristems\nchanges continuously.

Molecular and genomic techniques have revolutionized our knowledge of\nthe molecular ingredients behind this transition but not yet provided a clear\npicture of the morphological and tissue changes involved. Here we focus on a\nbehavioural perspective that centres on movement by muscle contraction.\nBuilding on the finding that molecules for chemical neural signalling predate\nmulticellular animals, we investigate a gradual evolutionary scenario for\nnervous systems that consists of two stages: A) Chemically transmission of\nelectrical activity between adjacent cells provided a primitive form of muscle\ncoordination in a contractile epithelial tissue. B) This primitive form of\ncoordination was subsequently improved upon by evolving the axodendritic\nprocesses of modern neurons. We use computer simulations to investigate the\nfirst stage. The simulations show that chemical transmission across a\ncontractile sheet can indeed produce useful body scale patterns, but only for\nsmall-sized animals. For larger animals the noise in chemical neural signalling\ninterferes. Our results imply that a two-stage scenario is a viable approach to\nnervous system evolution. The first stage could provide an initial behavioural\nadvantage, as well as a clear scaffold for subsequent improvements in\nbehavioural coordination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 13:40:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["van Elburg", "Ronald A.

Our three main findings are 1) the wound healing rate peaks at a\nvalue determined by {\\gamma} alone, suggesting a concept of wound acceleration\nto monitor the status of a wound. 2) We find that the time-scale for wound\nhealing is a factor 1/(1 -{\\gamma}) longer than the average internal timescale\nfor producing new material filling the wound cavity in corresondence with that\nit usually takes weeks rather than days to heal a wound. 3) The model gives a\nprediction for the maximum wound mass which can be generated in terms of\nmeasurable quantities related to wound status.
