We propose that the arterial network evolved while being constrained\nby its function as an organ. To support this hypothesis, we focus our study on\none of the main function of blood network: oxygen supply to the organs. We\nconsider an idealized organ with a given oxygen need and we optimize blood\nnetwork geometry and hematocrit with the constraint that it must fulfill the\norgan oxygen need. Our model accounts for the non-Newtonian behavior of blood,\nits maintenance cost and F\\aa hr\\ae us effects (decrease in average\nconcentration of red blood cells as the vessel diameters decrease). We show\nthat the mean shear rates (relative velocities of fluid layers) in the tree\nvessels follow a scaling law related to the multi-scale property of the tree\nnetwork, and we show that this scaling law drives the behavior of the optimal\nhematocrit in the tree. We apply our scenario to physiological data and reach\nresults fully compatible with the physiology: we found an optimal hematocrit of\n0.43 and an optimal ratio for diameter decrease of about 0.79. Moreover our\nresults show that pressure drops in the arterial network should be regulated in\norder for oxygen supply to remain optimal, suggesting that the amplitude of the\narterial pressure drop may have co-evolved with oxygen needs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 May 2014 14:24:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 May 2014 13:38:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 21 May 2014 10:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Moreau", "Baptiste", ""], ["Mauroy", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2635", "submitter": "Xiaodong Zhang", "authors": "Xiao-Dong Zhang, Zhentao Luo, Jie Chen, Xiu Shen, Shasha Song,\n  Yuanming Sun, Saijun Fan, Feiyue Fan, David Tai Leong and Jianping Xie", "title": "Ultrasmall Au10-12(SG)10-12 Nanomolecules for High Tumor Specificity and\n  Cancer Radiotherapy", "comments": "21 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": "Advanced Materials 2014", "doi": "10.1002/adma.201400866", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Radiosensitizers can increase the local treatment efficacy under a relatively\nlow and safe radiation dose, thereby facilitating tumor eradication and\nminimizing side effects.

Here, we address how the mechanical\nenvironment influences tumor growth, in particular, the shape of solid tumors.\nIn an in vitro tumor model, which isolates mechanical interactions between\ntumor cells and a hydrogel, we find that tumors grow as ellipsoids, resembling\nthe same, oft-reported observation of in vivo tumors. Specifically, an oblate\nellipsoidal tumor shape robustly occurs when the tumors grow in hydrogels that\nare stiffer than the tumors, but when they grow in more compliant hydrogels\nthey remain closer to spherical in shape. Using large scale, nonlinear\nelasticity computations we show that the oblate ellipsoidal shape minimizes the\nelastic free energy of the tumor-hydrogel system. Having eliminated a number of\nother candidate explanations, we hypothesize that minimization of the elastic\nfree energy is the reason for predominance of the experimentally observed\nellipsoidal shape. This result may hold significance for explaining the shape\nprogression of early solid tumors in vivo and is an important step in\nunderstanding the processes underlying solid tumor growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 May 2014 20:04:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mills", "Kristen L.", ""], ["Kemkemer", "Ralf", ""], ["Rudraraju", "Shiva", ""], ["Garikipati", "Krishna", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.3839", "submitter": "Yukitaka Ishimoto", "authors": "Yukitaka Ishimoto, Yoshihiro Morishita", "title": "Bubbly vertex dynamics: a dynamical and geometrical model for epithelial\n  tissues with curved cell shapes", "comments": "REVTex4.1, 25 pages in double column, 15 figures; revised\n  explanations in Sec 2 with 3 figures (1 added, 2 revised), results unchanged,\n  corrected typos, added references", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The\naim of this study was to test probable correlation between solar activities and\nGMD with long-term variations of MS incidence.\n  Methods: After a systematic review, we studied the association between\nalterations in solar wind velocity (Vsw) and planetary A index (Ap, a GMD\nindex) with MS incidence in Tehran and western Greece, during the 23rd solar\ncycle (1996-2008), by an ecological-correlational study.\n  Results: We found moderate to strong correlations among MS incidence of\nTehran with Vsw (Rs=0.665, p=0.013), with one year delay, and also with Ap\n(Rs=0.864, p=0.001) with 2 year delay. There were very strong correlations\namong MS incidence data of Greece with Vsw (R=0.906, p<0.001) and with Ap\n(R=0.844, p=0.001), both with one year lag.\n  Conclusion: It is the first time that a hypothesis has introduced an\nenvironmental factor that may describe MS incidence alterations; however, it\nshould be reminded that correlation does not mean necessarily the existence of\na causal relationship. Important message of these findings for researchers is\nto provide MS incidence reports with higher resolution for consecutive years,\nbased on the time of disease onset and relapses, not just the time of\ndiagnosis.
