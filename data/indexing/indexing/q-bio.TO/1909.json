The fate behaviour of these\ncells is reflected in the time evolution their progeny, termed clones, which\nserve as a key experimental observable. In adult tissues, where cell dynamics\nis constrained by the condition of homeostasis, clonal tracing studies based on\ntransgenic animal models have advanced our understanding of cell fate behaviour\nand its dysregulation in disease. But what can be learned from clonal dynamics\nin development, where the spatial cohesiveness of clones is impaired by tissue\ndeformations during tissue growth? Drawing on the results of clonal tracing\nstudies, we show that, despite the complexity of organ development, clonal\ndynamics may converge to a critical state characterized by universal scaling\nbehaviour of clone sizes. By mapping clonal dynamics onto a generalization of\nthe classical theory of aerosols, we elucidate the origin and range of scaling\nbehaviours and show how the identification of universal scaling dependences may\nallow lineage-specific information to be distilled from experiments.
