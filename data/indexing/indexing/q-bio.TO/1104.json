These physiological processes are modeled using pump-leak\nmodels, a system of differential algebraic equations that describes the balance\nof ions and water flowing across the cell membrane. Despite their widespread\nuse, very little is known about their mathematical properties. Here, we\nestablish analytical results on the existence and stability of steady states\nfor a general class of pump-leak models. We treat two cases. When the ion\nchannel currents have a linear current-voltage relationship, we show that there\nis at most one steady state, and that the steady state is globally\nasymptotically stable. If there are no steady states, the cell volume tends to\ninfinity with time. When minimal assumptions are placed on the properties of\nion channel currents, we show that there is an asymptotically stable steady\nstate so long as the pump current is not too large. The key analytical tool is\na free energy relation satisfied by a general class of pump-leak models, which\ncan be used as a Lyapunov function to study stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Apr 2011 18:50:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Oct 2011 06:25:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Mori", "Yoichiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5088", "submitter": "Oscar Sotolongo", "authors": "O.

However, the fractionated\nradiotherapy requires to account for a new magnitude: time. In this paper we\nexplore the biological consequences posed by the mathematical prolongation of a\nmodel to fractionated treatment. Nonextensive composition rules are introduced\nto obtain the survival fraction and equivalent physical dose in terms of a time\ndependent factor describing the tissue trend towards recovering its\nradioresistance (a kind of repair coefficient). Interesting (known and new)\nbehaviors are described regarding the effectiveness of the treatment which is\nshown to be fundamentally bound to this factor. The continuous limit,\napplicable to brachytherapy, is also analyzed in the framework of nonextensive\ncalculus. Also here a coefficient arises that rules the time behavior. All the\nresults are discussed in terms of the clinical evidence and their major\nimplications are highlighted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 08:32:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Sep 2011 11:24:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Jul 2012 10:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 09:52:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 9 Jan 2013 13:16:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sotolongo-Grau", "O.", ""], ["Rodriguez-Perez", "Daniel", ""], ["Sotolongo-Costa", "Oscar", ""], ["Antoranz", "J.
