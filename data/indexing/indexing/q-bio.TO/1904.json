New human computer models use stresses and\nstrains to evaluate whether serious or fatal injuries are reached,\nunfortunately these tensors bear no direct relation to AIS. This paper proposes\nto overcome this deficiency and suggests a unique Organ Trauma Model (OTM) able\nto calculate the risk to life based on the severity on any organ injury,\nfocussing on real-life pedestrian accidents. The OTM uses a power method, named\nPeak Virtual Power (PVP), and calculates the risk to life of brain white and\ngrey matters as a function of impact direction and impact speed. The OTM\nfirstly calibrates PVP against the medical critical AIS threshold observed in\neach part of the head as a function of speed. This base PVP critical trauma\nfunction is then scaled and banded across all AIS levels using the confirmed\nproperty that AIS and the probability of death is statistically and numerically\na cubic one. The OTM model has been tested against four real-life pedestrian\naccidents and proven to be able to predict pedestrian head trauma severity. In\nsome cases, the method did however under-estimate the head trauma by 1 AIS\nlevel, because of post-impact haemorrhage which cannot be captured with the\nemployed Lagrangian Finite Element (FE) solver. It is also shown that the\nlocation of the injury predictions using PVP coincide with the post mortem\nreports and are different to the predictions made using maximum principal\nstrain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2019 15:49:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bastien", "C.", ""], ["Neal-Sturgess", "C.", ""], ["Christensen", "J.", ""], ["Wen", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.00997", "submitter": "Natan T.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to relate atrial\nfibrillation (AF) and coronary flow impairment, even in absence of relevant\ncoronary artery disease (CAD). However, the underlying hemodynamics remains\nunclear. Aim of the present work is to computationally explore whether and to\nwhat extent ventricular rate during AF affects the coronary perfusion.\n  Methods. AF is simulated at different ventricular rates (50, 70, 90, 110, 130\nbpm) through a 0D-1D multiscale validated model, which combines the left\nheart-arterial tree together with the coronary circulation. Artificially-built\nRR stochastic extraction mimics the \\emph{in vivo} beating features. All the\nhemodynamic parameters computed are based on the left anterior descending (LAD)\nartery and account for the waveform, amplitude and perfusion of the coronary\nblood flow.\n  Results. Alterations of the coronary hemodynamics are found to be associated\neither to the heart rate increase, which strongly modifies waveform and\namplitude of the LAD flow rate, and to the beat-to-beat variability. The latter\nis overall amplified in the coronary circulation as HR grows, even though the\ninput RR variability is kept constant at all HRs.\n  Conclusions. Higher ventricular rate during AF exerts an overall coronary\nblood flow impairment and imbalance of the myocardial oxygen supply-demand\nratio. The combined increase of heart rate and higher AF-induced hemodynamic\nvariability lead to a coronary perfusion impairment exceeding 90-110 bpm in AF.\nMoreover, it is found that coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) is no longer a\ngood measure of the myocardial perfusion for HR higher than 90 bpm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Apr 2019 12:31:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Scarsoglio", "Stefania", ""], ["Gallo", "Caterina", ""], ["Saglietto", "Andrea", ""], ["Ridolfi", "Luca", ""], ["Anselmino", "Matteo", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.08886", "submitter": "Benjamin M.

We propose a\nconceptual and algorithmic framework to characterize complex patterns of\npolarity proteins on the surface of a cell in terms of a multipole expansion.\nTo rigorously quantify previously observed tissue-level patterns of nematic\ncell polarity (Morales-Navarette et al., eLife 8:e44860, 2019), we introduce\nthe concept of co-orientational order parameters, which generalize the known\nbiaxial order parameters of the theory of liquid crystals. Applying these\nconcepts to three-dimensional reconstructions of single cells from\nhigh-resolution imaging data of mouse liver tissue, we show that the axes of\nnematic cell polarity of hepatocytes exhibit local coordination and are aligned\nwith the biaxially anisotropic sinusoidal network for blood transport.

These motors rely on energy derived from ATP,\nsupplied, in part, by diffusion from the sarcoplasm to the interior of the\nlattice of actin and myosin filaments. The radial spacing of filaments in this\nlattice may change or remain constant during contraction. If the lattice is\nisovolumetric, it must expand when the muscle shortens. If, however, the\nspacing is constant or has a different pattern of axial and radial motion, then\nthe lattice changes volume during contraction, driving fluid motion and\nassisting in the transport of molecules between the contractile lattice and the\nsurrounding intracellular space. We first create an\nadvective-diffusive-reaction flow model and show that the flow into and out of\nthe sarcomere lattice would be significant in the absence of lattice expansion.\nAdvective transport coupled to diffusion has the potential to substantially\nenhance metabolite exchange within the crowded sarcomere. Using time-resolved\nx-ray diffraction of contracting muscle, we next show that the contractile\nlattice is neither isovolumetric nor constant in spacing. Instead, lattice\nspacing is time-varying, depends on activation, and can manifest as an\neffective time-varying Poisson ratio. The resulting fluid flow in the sarcomere\nlattice of synchronous insect flight muscles is greater than expected for\nconstant lattice spacing conditions. Lattice spacing depends on a variety of\nfactors that produce radial force, including crossbridges, titin-like\nmolecules, and other structural proteins. Volume change and advective transport\nvaries with the phase of muscle stimulation but remains significant at all\nconditions. Akin to \"breathing,\" advective-diffusive transport in sarcomeres is\nsufficient to promote metabolite exchange and may play a role in the regulation\nof contraction itself.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 02:08:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:13:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Jun 2021 19:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cass", "Julie A", ""], ["Williams", "C.
