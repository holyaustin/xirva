How this\ncollective period is established is a key question in understanding biological\nclocks. We explore this question in the segmentation clock, a population of\ncoupled cellular oscillators in the vertebrate embryo that sets the rhythm of\nsomitogenesis, the morphological segmentation of the body axis. The oscillating\ncells of the zebrafish segmentation clock are thought to possess noisy\nautonomous periods, which are synchronized by intercellular coupling through\nthe Delta-Notch pathway. Here we ask whether Delta-Notch coupling additionally\ninfluences the collective period of the segmentation clock. Using\nmultiple-embryo time-lapse microscopy, we show that disruption of Delta-Notch\nintercellular coupling increases the period of zebrafish somitogenesis.\nEmbryonic segment length and the spatial wavelength of oscillating gene\nexpression also increase correspondingly, indicating an increase in the\nsegmentation clock's period. Using a theory based on phase oscillators in which\nthe collective period self-organizes because of time delays in coupling, we\nestimate the cell-autonomous period, the coupling strength, and the coupling\ndelay from our data. Further supporting the role of coupling delays in the\nclock, we predict and experimentally confirm an instability resulting from\ndecreased coupling delay time. Synchronization of cells by Delta-Notch coupling\nregulates the collective period of the segmentation clock. Our identification\nof the first segmentation clock period mutants is a critical step toward a\nmolecular understanding of temporal control in this system. We propose that\ncollective control of period via delayed coupling may be a general feature of\nbiological clocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Sep 2010 15:56:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Herrgen", "Leah", ""], ["Ares", "Saul", ""], ["Morelli", "Luis G.", ""], ["Schroeter", "Christian", ""], ["Julicher", "Frank", ""], ["Oates", "Andrew C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2034", "submitter": "Tobias Reichenbach", "authors": "Tobias Reichenbach and A.

Understanding the\nemergence of such structured units out of the complex network of biochemical\ninteractions between bone cells is essential to extend our fundamental\nknowledge of normal bone physiology and its disorders. To this end, we propose\na spatio-temporal continuum model that integrates some of the most important\ninteraction pathways currently known to exist between cells of the osteoblastic\nand osteoclastic lineage. This mathematical model allows us to test the\nsignificance and completeness of these pathways based on their ability to\nreproduce the spatio-temporal dynamics of individual BMUs. We show that under\nsuitable conditions, the experimentally-observed structured cell distribution\nof cortical BMUs is retrieved. The proposed model admits travelling-wave-like\nsolutions for the cell densities with tightly organised profiles, corresponding\nto the progression of a single remodelling BMU. The shapes of these spatial\nprofiles within the travelling structure can be linked to the intrinsic\nparameters of the model such as differentiation and apoptosis rates for bone\ncells. In addition to the cell distribution, the spatial distribution of\nregulatory factors can also be calculated. This provides new insights on how\ndifferent regulatory factors exert their action on bone cells leading to\ncellular spatial and temporal segregation, and functional coordination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Sep 2010 07:56:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Dec 2010 08:18:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R", ""], ["Pivonka", "Peter", ""], ["Smith", "David W", ""]]}]
