These data are then generalised to all\ntemperatures and humidities by invoking the property of multiplicative\nseparability, as well as by converting established relationships in terms of\nconstant humidity at fixed temperature, to alternatives in terms of a\ncalculated water loss. In this way a formulation which is a series of very\nsimple, first order, ordinary differential equations is devised. The model is\nextended to include a variety of Glossina species using their relative surface\nareas, their relative pupal and puparial loss rates and their different 4th\ninstar excretions. The resulting computational model calculates total, pupal\nwater loss, consequent mortality and emergence. Remaining fat reserves are a\nmore tenuous result.\n  The model suggests that, while conventional wisdom is often correct in\ndismissing variability in transpiration-related pupal mortality as\ninsignificant, the effects of transpiration can be profound under adverse\nconditions and for some species, in general. The model demonstrates how two\ngender effects, the more significant one at the drier extremes of tsetse fly\nhabitat, might arise. The agreement between calculated and measured critical\nwater losses suggests very little difference in the behaviour of the different\nspecies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Jan 2009 12:39:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2009 15:55:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2009 12:04:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 11:42:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Childs", "S.

Although intercellular communications between these endocrine\ncells have recently been observed, their roles in glucose homeostasis have not\nbeen clearly understood. In this study, we construct a mathematical model for\nan islet consisting of two-state alpha-, beta-, and delta-cells, and analyze\neffects of known chemical interactions between them with emphasis on the\ncombined effects of those interactions. In particular, such features as\nparacrine signals of neighboring cells and cell-to-cell variations in response\nto external glucose concentrations as well as glucose dynamics, depending on\ninsulin and glucagon hormone, are considered explicitly. Our model predicts\nthree possible benefits of the cell-to-cell interactions: First, the asymmetric\ninteraction between alpha- and beta-cells contributes to the dynamic stability\nwhile the perturbed glucose level recovers to the normal level. Second, the\ninhibitory interactions of delta-cells for glucagon and insulin secretion\nprevent the wasteful co-secretion of them at the normal glucose level. Finally,\nthe glucose dose-responses of insulin secretion is modified to become more\npronounced at high glucose levels due to the inhibition by delta-cells. It is\nthus concluded that the intercellular communications in islets of Langerhans\nshould contribute to the effective control of glucose homeostasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2009 21:24:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Jo", "Junghyo", ""], ["Choi", "Moo Young", ""], ["Koh", "Duk-Su", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.4295", "submitter": "Nikitas Papasimakis", "authors": "Nikitas Papasimakis, Fotini Pallikari", "title": "Breakdown of Long-Range Correlations in Heart Rate Fluctuations During\n  Meditation", "comments": "6 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.data-an q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The average wavelet coefficient method is applied to investigate the scaling\nfeatures of heart rate variability during meditation, a state of induced mental\nrelaxation.
