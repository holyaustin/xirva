These strains originate from the\ndifferential growth of tissues or forces due to muscle contraction or gravity.\nHere we show using a computational model that by amplifying local strain cues,\nactive cell contractility can facilitate and accelerate the reorientation of\nsingle cells to static strains. At the collective cell level, the model\nsimulations show that active cell contractility can facilitate the formation of\nstrings along the orientation of stretch. The computational model is based on a\nhybrid cellular Potts and finite-element simulation framework describing a\nmechanical cell-substrate feedback, where: 1) cells apply forces on the ECM,\nsuch that 2) local strains are generated in the ECM, and 3) cells\npreferentially extend protrusions along the strain orientation. In accordance\nwith experimental observations, simulated cells align and form string-like\nstructures parallel to static uniaxial stretch. Our model simulations predict\nthat the magnitude of the uniaxial stretch and the strength of the contractile\nforces regulate a gradual transition between string-like patterns and vascular\nnetwork-like patterns. Our simulations also suggest that at high population\ndensities, less cell cohesion promotes string formation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2016 21:06:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 13:28:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Rens", "Elisabeth G.", ""], ["Merks", "Roeland M.

Although\nrecent findings appear to support their role in cancer prevention and\ntreatment, this issue is still controversial. Anti-cancer activity of\nphytochemicals mainly depends on their multi-target mechanism of action,\nincluding antimutagenic, antioxidant and antiproliferative activities.\nFurthermore, they may modulate the host immune response to cancer, reducing\ninflammatory microenvironment and enhancing lymphocyte onco-surveillance. Since\ncarcinogenesis is multi-factorial and involves several signaling pathways,\nmulti-targeted agents as phytochemicals may represent promising anticancer\ncompounds.

For this purpose, we developed a model of dynamic\ntransport of the contrast fluid through the hierarchies of the perfusion trees.\nConceptually, computed time-space distributions of the so-called tissue density\ncan be compared with the measured data obtained from CT; such a modeling\nfeedback can be used for model parameter identification. The blood flow is\ncharacterized at several scales for which different models are used. Flows in\nupper hierarchies represented by larger branching vessels are described using\nsimple 1D models based on the Bernoulli equation extended by correction terms\nto respect the local pressure losses. To describe flows in smaller vessels and\nin the tissue parenchyma, we propose a 3D continuum model of porous medium\ndefined in terms of hierarchically matched compartments characterized by\nhydraulic permeabilities. The 1D models corresponding to the portal and hepatic\nveins are coupled with the 3D model through point sources, or sinks. The\ncontrast fluid saturation is governed by transport equations adapted for the 1D\nand 3D flow models. The complex perfusion model has been implemented using the\nfinite element and finite volume methods. We report numerical examples computed\nfor anatomically relevant geometries of the liver organ and of the principal\nvascular trees. The simulated tissue density corresponding to the CT\nexamination output reflects a pathology modeled as a localized permeability\ndeficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2016 10:12:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rohan", "Eduard", ""], ["Luke\u0161", "Vladim\u00edr", ""], ["Jon\u00e1\u0161ov\u00e1", "Alena", ""]]}]
