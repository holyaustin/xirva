The new model of pathogenesis\n- skin reaction to systemic psoriatic process SPP is formulated. ... Psoriatic\ninflammation is regarded as a reaction of the skin immune system to activity of\nMo-R and DC-R involved in derma from blood flow. They contain Y-antigen and,\ngetting to derma, can be transformed in mature maDC-Y and present this antigen\nto Y-specific T-lymphocytes as well as activate them.

Therefore, the skin immune system can incorrectly\ninterpret Y-antigen presentation as a sign of external PsB-infection and switch\none of mechanisms of protection against bacterial infection - epidermal\nhyperproliferation. Psoriatic plaque can be initiated only during action of\nlocal inflammatory process LP2 in derma causing not only innate, but also\nadaptive response. In particular, it is possible at LP2(IN) - open trauma of\nderma or at LP2(HPV) - HPV-carriage of keratinocytes. The level of Y-priming\n(presence and concentration of Y-specific T-lymphocytes in prepsoriatic derma\nand in lymph nodes) also determines possibility of psoriatic plaque initiation.\nExistence and severity of psoriatic plaque is determined by intensity of\nY-antigen income into derma (inside Mo-R and DC-R). ...

The renewal process is\nknown as bone remodelling and is operated by bone-resorbing cells (osteoclasts)\nand bone-forming cells (osteoblasts). Both biochemical and biomechanical\nregulatory mechanisms have been identified in the interaction between\nosteoclasts and osteoblasts. Here we focus on an additional and poorly\nunderstood potential regulatory mechanism of bone cells, that involves the\nmorphology of the microstructure of bone. Bone cells can only remove and\nreplace bone at a bone surface. However, the microscopic availability of bone\nsurface depends in turn on the ever-changing bone microstructure. The\nimportance of this geometrical dependence is unknown and difficult to quantify\nexperimentally. Therefore, we develop a sophisticated mathematical model of\nbone cell interactions that takes into account biochemical, biomechanical and\ngeometrical regulations. We then investigate numerically the influence of bone\nsurface availability in bone remodelling within a representative bone tissue\nsample. The interdependence between the bone cells' activity, which modifies\nthe bone microstructure, and changes in the microscopic bone surface\navailability, which in turn influences bone cell development and activity, is\nimplemented using a remarkable experimental relationship between bone specific\nsurface and bone porosity. Our model suggests that geometrical regulation of\nthe activation of new remodelling events could have a significant effect on\nbone porosity and bone stiffness. On the other hand, geometrical regulation of\nlate stages of osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation seems less\nsignificant. We conclude that the development of osteoporosis is probably\naccelerated by this geometrical regulation in cortical bone, but probably\nslowed down in trabecular bone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 07:45:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 07:16:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Pivonka", "Peter", ""], ["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""], ["Scheiner", "Stefan", ""], ["Hellmich", "Christian", ""], ["Dunstan", "Colin R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.3232", "submitter": "Mustafa Barasa", "authors": "Barasa Mustafa, Maamun Jenneby, Kagasi Ambogo Esther, Ozwara Suba\n  Hastings and Gicheru Muita Michael", "title": "Immunity to Plasmodium knowlesi H strain malaria in olive baboons", "comments": "6 Pages, 8 Figures; This study was funded by the research capability\n  strengthening World Health Organisation (WHO) grant (Grant Number: A 50075)\n  for malaria research in Africa under the Multilateral Initiative on\n  Malaria/Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases\n  (WHO-MIM/TDR).
