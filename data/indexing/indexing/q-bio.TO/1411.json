In this work, a novel evolutionary\nstochastic model is introduced that couples short-term formalism (during\nradiotherapy) and long-term formalism (post treatment). This framework is used\nto estimate the risks of second cancer as a function of spontaneous background\nand radiation-induced mutation rates of normal and pre-malignant cells. By\nfitting the model to available clinical data for spontaneous background risk\ntogether with data of Hodgkins lymphoma survivors (for various organs), the\nsecond cancer mutation rate is estimated. The model predicts a significant\nincrease in mutation rate for some cancer types, which may be a sign of genomic\ninstability. Finally, it is shown that the model results are in agreement with\nthe measured results for excess relative risk (ERR) as a function of exposure\nage, and that the model predicts a negative correlation of ERR with increase in\nattained age. This novel approach can be used to analyze several radiotherapy\nprotocols in current clinical practice, and to forecast the second cancer risks\nover time for individual patients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 23:29:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kaveh", "Kamran", ""], ["Manem", "Venkata S.

The development of resistance is commonly attributed to genetic\nheterogeneity. However, heterogeneity of drug penetration of the tumor\nmicroenvironment both on the microscopic level within solid tumors as well as\non the macroscopic level across metastases may also contribute to acquired drug\nresistance. Here we use mathematical models to investigate the effect of drug\nheterogeneity on the probability of escape from treatment and time to\nresistance. Specifically we address scenarios with sufficiently efficient\ntherapies that suppress growth of all preexisting genetic variants in the\ncompartment with highest drug concentration. To study the joint effect of drug\nheterogeneity, growth rate, and evolution of resistance we analyze a multitype\nstochastic branching process describing growth of cancer cells in two\ncompartments with different drug concentration and limited migration between\ncompartments. We show that resistance is more likely to arise first in the low\ndrug compartment and from there populate the high drug compartment. Moreover,\nwe show that only below a threshold rate of cell migration does spatial\nheterogeneity accelerate resistance evolution, otherwise deterring drug\nresistance with excessively high migration rates. Our results provide new\ninsights into understanding why cancers tend to quickly become resistant, and\nthat cell migration and the presence of sanctuary sites with little drug\nexposure are essential to this end.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 23:19:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Feng", ""], ["Nowak", "Martin A.", ""], ["Bonhoeffer", "Sebastian", ""]]}]
