This is particularly true with respect to the\nmathematical modeling of bone remodeling. However, there is increasing evidence\nthat osteocytes play important roles in the cycle of targeted bone remodeling,\nin serving as a significant source of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis, and\nin secreting the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin. Moreover, there is also\nincreasing interest in sclerostin, an osteocyte-secreted bone formation\ninhibitor, and its role in regulating local response to changes in the bone\nmicroenvironment. Here we develop a cell population model of bone remodeling\nthat includes the role of osteocytes, sclerostin, and allows for the\npossibility of RANKL expression by osteocyte cell populations. This model\nextends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone\nremodeling but can be used to explore aspects of the process of bone remodeling\nthat were previously beyond the scope of prior modeling work. Through numerical\nsimulations we demonstrate that our model can be used to theoretically explore\nmany of the most recent experimental results for bone remodeling, and can be\nutilized to assess the effects of novel bone-targeting agents on the bone\nremodeling process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2012 19:30:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Nov 2012 22:10:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2013 18:42:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Graham", "Jason M.", ""], ["Ayati", "Bruce P.", ""], ["Holstein", "Sarah A.", ""], ["Martin", "James A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7025", "submitter": "Masoomeh Taghipoor", "authors": "Masoomeh Taghipoor (SRA, LMPT), Guy Barles (LMPT), Christine Georgelin\n  (LMPT), Jean-Ren\\'e Licois (LMPT), Philippe Lescoat (SRA)", "title": "Digestion Modelling in the Small Intestine : Impact of Dietary Fibre", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS physics.bio-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we continue the modelling of the digestion in the small\nintestine, started in a previous article, by investigating the effects of\ndietary fibre. We recall that this model aims at taking into account the three\nmain phenomena of the digestion, namely the transit of the bolus, the\ndegradation of feedstuffs and the absorption through the intestinal wall. In\norder to study the role of dietary fibre on digestion, we model their two\nprincipal physiochemical characteristics which interact with the function of\nthe small intestine, i.e. viscosity and water holding capacity. This leads us\nto consider some features of digestion which have not been taken into account\npreviously, in particular the interrelationship between the evolution of dry\nmatter and water in the bolus. The numerical results are in agreement with the\npositive effect of insoluble dietary fibre on the velocity of bolus along the\nsmall intestine and on its degradation. These results highlight the negative\neffect of soluble dietary fibre on digestion. Although, this model is generic\nand contains a large number of parameters, to our knowledge, it is among the\nfirst qualitative dynamical modelling of fibre influence on intestinal\ndigestion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2012 19:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 17:52:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 14:38:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Taghipoor", "Masoomeh", "", "SRA, LMPT"], ["Barles", "Guy", "", "LMPT"], ["Georgelin", "Christine", "", "LMPT"], ["Licois", "Jean-Ren\u00e9", "", "LMPT"], ["Lescoat", "Philippe", "", "SRA"]]}]
