The mechanisms\nleading to the emergence of coordinated motion remain however largely\nunexplored. Although biomolecular signalling is known to be involved in most\noccurrences of collective migration, the role of physical and mechanical\ninteractions has only been recently investigated. In this paper, a versatile\nframework for cell motility is implemented in-silico in order to study the\nminimal requirements for the coordination of a group of epithelial cells. We\nfind that cell motility and cell-cell mechanical interactions are sufficient to\ngenerate a broad array of behaviours commonly observed in vitro and in vivo.\nCell streaming, sheet migration and susceptibility to leader cells are examples\nof behaviours spontaneously emerging from these simple assumptions, which might\nexplain why collective effects are so ubiquitous in nature. This analysis\nprovides also new insights into cancer metastasis and cell sorting, suggesting\nin particular that collective invasion might result from an emerging\ncoordination in a system where single cells are mechanically unable to invade.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Aug 2011 12:14:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kabla", "Alexandre J", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5746", "submitter": "Miroslaw Rewekant PhD MD", "authors": "Slawomir Piekarski and Miroslaw Rewekant", "title": "On drug transport after intravenous administration", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A mathematical model of a drug transport after rapid injection is given.
