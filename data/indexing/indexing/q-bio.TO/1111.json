This\nvalue is significantly higher than the more common exponent 3/4 relating whole\nbody resting metabolism with body mass and several other physiological\nvariables in animals and plants. This article investigates the reasons for\nbrain allometric distinction on a level of its microvessels. Based on collected\nempirical data it is found that regional cerebral blood flow CBF across gray\nmatter scales with cortical volume $V$ as $CBF \\sim V^{-1/6}$, brain capillary\ndiameter increases as $V^{1/12}$, and density of capillary length decreases as\n$V^{-1/6}$. It is predicted that velocity of capillary blood is almost\ninvariant ($\\sim V^{\\epsilon}$), capillary transit time scales as $V^{1/6}$,\ncapillary length increases as $V^{1/6+\\epsilon}$, and capillary number as\n$V^{2/3-\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon$ is typically a small correction for medium\nand large brains, due to blood viscosity dependence on capillary radius. It is\nshown that the amount of capillary length and blood flow per cortical neuron\nare essentially conserved across mammals. These results indicate that geometry\nand dynamics of global neuro-vascular coupling have a proportionate character.\nMoreover, cerebral metabolic, hemodynamic, and microvascular variables scale\nwith allometric exponents that are simple multiples of 1/6, rather than 1/4,\nwhich suggests that brain metabolism is more similar to the metabolism of\naerobic than resting body. Relation of these findings to brain functional\nimaging studies involving the link between cerebral metabolism and blood flow\nis also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Nov 2011 19:01:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Karbowski", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5814", "submitter": "Thomas Risler", "authors": "Fabien Montel (1), Morgan Delarue (1), Jens Elgeti (1), Laurent\n  Malaquin (1), Markus Basan (1), Thomas Risler (1), Bernard Cabane (3),\n  Danijela Vignjevic (2), Jacques Prost (1 and 3), Giovanni Cappello (1) and\n  Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Joanny (1)", "title": "Stress Clamp Experiments on Multicellular Tumor Spheroids", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

To investigate the BMU dynamics in silico, we\ndevelop a novel mathematical model resulting in a system of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations with time delays.
