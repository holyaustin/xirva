To resolve\nthis further, quantitative and discriminant analyses were performed for the\npurpose of comparing alternative models for their abilities to describe and\npredict tumor growth. For this we used two in vivo experimental systems, an\nectopic syngeneic tumor (Lewis lung carcinoma) and an orthotopically\nxenografted human breast carcinoma. The goals were threefold: to 1) determine a\nstatistical model for description of the volume measurement error, 2) establish\nthe descriptive power of each model, using several goodness-of-fit metrics and\na study of parametric identifiability, and 3) assess the models ability to\nforecast future tumor growth.\n  Nine models were compared that included the exponential, power law, Gompertz\nand (generalized) logistic formalisms. The Gompertz and power law provided the\nmost parsimonious and parametrically identifiable description of the lung data,\nwhereas the breast data were best captured by the Gompertz and\nexponential-linear models. The latter also exhibited the highest predictive\npower for the breast tumor growth curves, with excellent prediction scores\n(greater than 80$\\%$) extending out as far as 12 days. In contrast, for the\nlung data, none of the models were able to achieve substantial prediction rates\n(greater than 70$\\%$) further than the next day data point. In this context,\nadjunction of a priori information on the parameter distribution led to\nconsiderable improvement of predictions.\n  These results not only have important implications for biological theories of\ntumor growth and the use of mathematical modeling in preclinical anti-cancer\ndrug investigations, but also may assist in defining how mathematical models\ncould serve as potential prognostic tools in the clinical setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 17:13:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 09:21:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Benzekry", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Lamont", "Clare", ""], ["Beheshti", "Afshin", ""], ["Tracz", "Amanda", ""], ["Ebos", "John M.

This suggests that, for\nmost individuals, cancer will become dormant and not progress, while only in\nsome will it become symptomatic disease. Meanwhile, it was recently shown in\nanimal models that a tumor can produce both stimulators and inhibitors of its\nown blood supply. To explain the autopsy findings in light of the preclinical\nresearch data, we propose a mathematical model of cancer development at the\norganism scale describing a growing population of metastases, which, together\nwith the primary tumor, can exert a progressively greater level of systemic\nangiogenesis-inhibitory influence that eventually overcomes local angiogenesis\nstimulation to suppress the growth of all lesions. As a departure from modeling\nefforts to date, we look not just at signaling from and effects on the primary\ntumor, but integrate over this increasingly negative global signaling from all\nsources to track the development of total tumor burden. This in silico study of\nthe dynamics of the tumor/metastasis system identifies ranges of parameter\nvalues where mutual angio-inhibitory interactions within a population of tumor\nlesions could yield global dormancy, i.e., an organism-level homeostatic steady\nstate in total tumor burden. Given that mortality arises most often from\nmetastatic disease rather than growth of the primary per se, this finding may\nhave important therapeutic implications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 17:28:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Benzekry", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Gandolfi", "Alberto", ""], ["Hahnfeldt", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1701", "submitter": "Matthew Hubbard", "authors": "Nathan Kirk, Alan Benson, Christopher Goodyer, Matthew Hubbard", "title": "A computational study of the effects of remodelled electrophysiology and\n  mechanics on initiation of ventricular fibrillation in human heart failure", "comments": "20 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NA math.NA q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The study of pathological cardiac conditions such as arrhythmias, a major\ncause of mortality in heart failure, is becoming increasingly informed by\ncomputational simulation, numerically modelling the governing equations.

The best known approach is to take a mathematical model of the\nfibered structure, insert it into a more-or-less complex model of cardiac\narchitecture, and then study the resulting fibers of activation that propagate\nthrough the myocardium. In our paper, we have attempted to create a novel\nsoftware capable of demonstrate left ventricular (LV) model in normal hearts.\n  Method: Echocardiography was performed on 70 healthy volunteers. Data\nevaluated included: velocity (radial, longitudinal, rotational and vector\npoint), displacement (longitudinal and rotational), strain rate (longitudinal\nand circumferential) and strain (radial, longitudinal and circumferential) of\nall 16 LV myocardial segments. Using these data, force vectors of myocardial\nsamples were estimated by MATLAB software, interfaced in the echocardiograph\nsystem. Dynamic orientation contraction (through the cardiac cycle) of every\nindividual myocardial fiber could be created by adding together the sequential\nsteps of the multiple fragmented sectors of that fiber. This way we attempted\nto mechanically illustrate the global LV model.\n  Result: Our study shows that in normal cases myocardial fibers initiate from\nthe posterior basal region of the heart, continues through the LV free wall,\nreaches the septum, loops around the apex, ascends, and ends at the\nsuperior-anterior edge of LV.\n  Conclusion: We were able to define the whole LV myocardial model\nmathematically, by MATLAB software in normal subjects. This will enable\nphysicians to diagnose and follow up many cardiac diseases when this software\nis interfaced within echocardiographic machines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jun 2014 06:41:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ranjbar", "Saeed", ""], ["Karvandi", "Mersedeh", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.6206", "submitter": "Anatolij Gelimson", "authors": "Anatolij Gelimson, Ramin Golestanian", "title": "Collective Dynamics of Dividing Chemotactic Cells", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.
