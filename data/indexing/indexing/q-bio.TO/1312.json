A novel three-dimensional multiscale model is introduced\nand used in this paper to simulate receptor-mediated adhesion of deformable\nplatelets at the site of vascular injury under different shear rates of blood\nflow. The novelty of the model is based on a new approach of coupling submodels\nat three biological scales crucial for the early clot formation: novel hybrid\ncell membrane submodel to represent physiological elastic properties of a\nplatelet, stochastic receptor-ligand binding submodel to describe cell adhesion\nkinetics and Lattice Boltzmann submodel for simulating blood flow. The model\nimplementation on the GPUs cluster significantly improved simulation\nperformance. Predictive model simulations revealed that platelet deformation,\ninteractions between platelets in the vicinity of the vessel wall as well as\nthe number of functional GPIb{\\alpha} platelet receptors played significant\nroles in the platelet adhesion to the injury site. Variation of the number of\nfunctional GPIb{\\alpha} platelet receptors as well as changes of platelet\nstiffness can represent effects of specific drugs reducing or enhancing\nplatelet activity.

In the traditional view of cancer, all cells share the ability to\ndivide without limit and thus have the potential to generate a malignant\ntumour. However, an emerging notion is that only a sub-population of cells, the\nso-called cancer stem cells (CSCs), are responsible for the initiation and\nmaintenance of the tumour. A key implication of the CSC hypothesis is that\nthese cells must be eradicated to achieve cures, thus we define TCP_S as the\nprobability of eradicating CSCs for a given dose of radiation. A cell surface\nprotein expression profile, such as CD44high/CD24low for breast cancer, is\noften used as a biomarker to monitor CSCs enrichment. However, it is\nincreasingly recognized that not all cells bearing this expression profile are\nnecessarily CSCs, and in particular early generations of progenitor cells may\nshare the same phenotype. Thus, due to the lack of a perfect biomarker for\nCSCs, we also define a novel measurable TCP_CD+, that is the probability of\neliminating or controlling biomarker positive cells. Based on these\ndefinitions, we use stochastic methods and numerical simulations to compare the\ntheoretical TCP_S and the measurable TCP_CD+. We also use the measurable TCP to\ncompare the effect of various radiation protocols.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 15:24:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 19:54:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Dhawan", "A.", ""], ["Kohandel", "M.", ""], ["Hill", "R.

Random collagen\ndeposition at a single site is modeled by increasing the elastic constant of\nthe spring at that site by a factor of 100.\n  By contrast, correlated collagen deposition is represented by stiffening the\nsprings encountered along a random walk starting from some initial spring, the\nrationale being that excess collagen deposition is more likely in the vicinity\nof an already stiff region. A combination of random and correlated deposition\nis modeled by performing random walks of length $N$ from randomly selected\ninitial sites, the balance between the two processes being determined by $N$.\nWe found that the dependence of bulk modulus, $B(N,c)$, on both $N$ and the\nfraction of stiff springs, $c$, can be described by a strikingly simple set of\nempirical equations.\n  Our results suggest that the spatial correlation of collagen deposition in\nthe fibrotic lung has a strong effect on the rate of lung function decline and\non the mechanical environment in which the cells responsible for remodeling\nfind themselves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 23:39:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Cl\u00e1udio L.
