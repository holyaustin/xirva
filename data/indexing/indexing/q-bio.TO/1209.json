These models are usually formulated in terms of\ndifferential equations that relate the growth rate of the tumour to its current\nstate, and range from the simple one-parameter exponential growth model, to\nmore advanced models that contain a large number of parameters. Understanding\nthe assumptions and consequences of such models is important, since they often\nunderpin more complex models of tumour growth. The conclusion of this brief\nsurvey is that although much improvement has occurred over the last century,\nmore effort and new models are required if we are to understand the intricacies\nof tumour growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 12:48:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 09:25:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Gerlee", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.3189", "submitter": "J\\\"org Ackermann", "authors": "Alexander Schmitz, Tim Sch\\\"afer, Hendrik Sch\\\"afer, Claudia D\\\"oring,\n  J\\\"org Ackermann, Norbert Dichter, Sylvia Hartmann, Martin-Leo Hansmann, and\n  Ina Koch", "title": "Automated Image Analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma", "comments": "12 papes, 5 figures, Dagstuhl seminar, Dagstuhl Seminar 12291\n  \"Structure Discovery in Biology: Motifs, Networks & Phylogenies\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO physics.med-ph q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Hodgkin lymphoma is an unusual type of lymphoma, arising from malignant\nB-cells. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of malignant cells and\ntheir distribution differ from other cancer types. Based on systematic tissue\nimage analysis, computer-aided exploration can provide new insights into\nHodgkin lymphoma pathology. In this paper, we report results from an image\nanalysis of CD30 immunostained Hodgkin lymphoma tissue section images. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first systematic application of image\nanalysis to a set of tissue sections of Hodgkin lymphoma. We have implemented\nan automatic procedure to handle and explore image data in Aperio's SVS format.\nWe use pre-processing approaches on a down-scaled image to separate the image\nobjects from the background. Then, we apply a supervised classification method\nto assign pixels to predefined classes. Our pre-processing method is able to\nseparate the tissue content of images from the image background. We analyzed\nthree immunohistologically defined groups, non-lymphoma and the two most common\nforms of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity type. We\nfound that nodular sclerosis and non-lymphoma images exhibit different amounts\nof CD30 stain, whereas mixed cellularity type exhibits a large variance and\noverlaps with the other groups. The results can be seen as a first step to\ncomputationally identify tumor regions in the images. This allows us to focus\non these regions when performing computationally expensive tasks like object\ndetection in the high-resolution image.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 13:42:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Schmitz", "Alexander", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Tim", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Hendrik", ""], ["D\u00f6ring", "Claudia", ""], ["Ackermann", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["Dichter", "Norbert", ""], ["Hartmann", "Sylvia", ""], ["Hansmann", "Martin-Leo", ""], ["Koch", "Ina", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.3945", "submitter": "Denis Menshykau", "authors": "G\\'eraldine Celli\\`ere, Denis Menshykau and Dagmar Iber", "title": "Simulations demonstrate a simple network to be sufficient to control\n  branch point selection, smooth muscle and vasculature formation during lung\n  branching morphogenesis", "comments": "Initially published at Biology Open", "journal-ref": "G.

Relevant features of sauropod cervical\nvertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in\na mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of\nvarying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. Other\nlong-necked tetrapods lacked important features of sauropods, preventing the\nevolution of longer necks: for example, giraffes have relatively small torsos\nand large, heavy heads, share the usual mammalian constraint of only seven\ncervical vertebrae, and lack an air-sac system and pneumatic bones. Among\nnon-sauropods, their saurischian relatives the theropod dinosaurs seem to have\nbeen best placed to evolve long necks, and indeed they probably surpassed those\nof giraffes.
