During the course of\ndisease, the evaluation of tumor volume is an essential part of the clinical\nfollow-up. However, manual segmentation for acquisition of tumor volume is a\ntime-consuming process. In this paper, a new approach for the automatic\nsegmentation and volume determination of glioblastomas (glioblastoma\nmultiforme) is presented and evaluated. The approach uses a user-defined seed\npoint inside the glioma to set up a directed 3D graph. The nodes of the graph\nare obtained by sampling along rays that are sent through the surface points of\na polyhedron. After the graph has been constructed, the minimal s-t cut is\ncalculated to separate the glioblastoma from the background. For evaluation, 12\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data sets were manually segmented slice by\nslice, by neurosurgeons with several years of experience in the resection of\ngliomas. Afterwards, the manual segmentations were compared with the results of\nthe presented approach via the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). For a better\nassessment of the DSC results, the manual segmentations of the experts were\nalso compared with each other and evaluated via the DSC. In addition, the 12\ndata sets were segmented once again by one of the neurosurgeons after a period\nof two weeks, to also measure the intra-physician deviation of the DSC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 09:31:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Egger", "Jan", ""], ["Bauer", "Miriam H.

Volumetric assessment of tumor volume with manual\nsegmentation of its outlines is a time-consuming process that can be overcome\nwith the help of segmentation methods. In this paper, a flexible semi-automatic\napproach for grade IV glioma segmentation is presented. The approach uses a\nnovel segmentation scheme for spherical objects that creates a directed 3D\ngraph. Thereafter, the minimal cost closed set on the graph is computed via a\npolynomial time s-t cut, creating an optimal segmentation of the tumor. The\nuser can improve the results by specifying an arbitrary number of additional\nseed points to support the algorithm with grey value information and\ngeometrical constraints. The presented method is tested on 12 magnetic\nresonance imaging datasets. The ground truth of the tumor boundaries are\nmanually extracted by neurosurgeons. The segmented gliomas are compared with a\none click method, and the semi-automatic approach yields an average Dice\nSimilarity Coefficient (DSC) of 77.72% and 83.91%, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Mar 2011 13:27:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Egger", "Jan", ""], ["Bauer", "Miriam H.
