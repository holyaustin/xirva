(PloS Comput Biol 2009 5(10) e1000539) outlined a\nsystem of reaction-diffusion equations that were used to describe induction of\natherosclerotic disease. These were solved by considering an equilibrium\nsolution and small perturbations around this equilibrium. Here we consider\nslight variant sets of assumptions that could be used to derive equilibrium\nsolutions. In general they do not imply any change in the numerical results\nrelating to monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1) presented in that\npaper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2009 16:59:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Little", "Mark P", ""], ["Gola", "Anna", ""], ["Tzoulaki", "Ioanna", ""], ["Vandoolaeghe", "Wendy", ""]]}]
