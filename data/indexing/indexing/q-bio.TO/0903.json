Whereas biologists have proposed models where the shape is\ncontrolled on a molecular level [1], physicists, following Turing [2] and\nd'Arcy Thomson [3], have developed theories where patterns arise spontaneously\n[4]. Here, we propose a volume constraint that restricts the possible shapes of\nleaves. Focusing on palmate leaves, the central observation is that developing\nleaves first grow folded inside a bud, limited by the previous and subsequent\nleaves. We show that growing folded in this small volume controls globally the\nleaf development. This induces a direct relationship between the way it was\nfolded and the final unfolded shape of the leaf. These dependencies can be\napproximated as simple geometrical relationships that we confirm on both folded\nembryonic and unfolded mature leaves. We find that independently of their\nposition in the phylogenetic tree, these relationships work for folded species,\nbut do not work for non-folded species. This steric constraint is a simple way\nto impose a global regulation for the leaf growth. Such steric regulation\nshould be more general and considered as a new simple means of global\nregulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 13:42:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Couturier", "Etienne", ""], ["Pont", "Sylvain Courrech du", ""], ["Douady", "Stephane", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1698", "submitter": "Alexandre Vidal", "authors": "Alexandre Vidal, Claire M\\'edigue, Benoit Malpaux, Fr\\'ed\\'erique\n  Cl\\'ement", "title": "Endogenous circannual rhythm in LH secretion: insight from signal\n  analysis coupled with mathematical modelling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, Series A 367,\n  1908 (2009) 4759-4777", "doi": "10.1098/rsta.2009.0136", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In sheep as in many vertebrates, the seasonal pattern of reproduction is\ntimed by the annual photoperiodic cycle, characterized by seasonal changes in\nthe daylength. The photoperiodic information is translated into a circadian\nprofile of melatonin secretion. After multiple neuronal relays (within the\nhypothalamus), melatonin impacts GnRH (gonadotrophin releasing hormone)\nsecretion that in turn controls ovarian cyclicity. The pattern of GnRH\nsecretion is mirrored into that of LH (luteinizing hormone) secretion, whose\nplasmatic level can be easily measured. We addressed the question of whether\nthere exists an endogenous circannual rhythm in a tropical sheep population\nthat exhibits clear seasonal ovarian activity when ewes are subjected to\ntemperate latitudes. We based our analysis on LH time series collected in the\ncourse of 3 years from ewes subjected to a constant photoperiodic regime. Due\nto intra- and inter- animal variability and unequal sampling times, the\nexistence of an endogenous rhythm is not straightforward. We have used\ntime-frequency signal processing methods to extract hidden rhythms from the\ndata. To further investigate the LF (low frequency) and HF (high frequency)\ncomponents of the signals, we have designed a mathematical model of LH\nplasmatic level accounting for the effect of experimental sampling times. The\nmodel enables us to confirm the existence of an endogenous circannual rhythm,\nto investigate the action mechanism of photoperiod on the pulsatile pattern of\nLH secretion (control of the interpulse interval) and to conclude that the HF\ncomponent is mainly due to the experimental sampling protocol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2009 07:15:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Vidal", "Alexandre", ""], ["M\u00e9digue", "Claire", ""], ["Malpaux", "Benoit", ""], ["Cl\u00e9ment", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique", ""]]}]
