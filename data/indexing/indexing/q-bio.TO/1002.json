Levitov\nshowed that a cylindrical lattice of repulsive particles can reproduce\nphyllotaxis under the (unproved) assumption that minimum of energy would be\nachieved by 2-D Bravais lattices. Here we provide experimental and numerical\nevidence that the Phyllotactic lattice is actually a ground state. When\nmechanically annealed, our experimental \"magnetic cactus\" precisely reproduces\nbotanical phyllotaxis, along with domain boundaries (called transitions in\nBotany) between different phyllotactic patterns. We employ a structural genetic\nalgorithm to explore the more general axially unconstrained case, which reveals\nmultijugate (multiple spirals) as well as monojugate (single spiral)\nphyllotaxis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2010 01:44:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Nisoli", "Cristiano", ""], ["Gabor", "Nathaniel M.", ""], ["Lammert", "Paul E.", ""], ["Maynard", "J.

These\nobservations have inspired attempts to create artificial superhydrophobic\nsurfaces, given such surfaces have multitudinous applications [6-13].\nSuperhydrophobicity is an enhanced effect of surface roughness and there are\nknown relationships that correlate surface roughness and superhydrophobicity,\nbased on the underlying physics. However, while these recognize the level of\nroughness they tell us little about the independent effect of its scale. Thus,\nthey are not capable of explaining why naturally occurring such surfaces\ncommonly have micron-submicron sizes. Here we report on the discovery of a new\nrelation, its physical basis and its experimental verification. The results\nreveal that scaling-down roughness into the micro-submicron range is a unique\nand elegant strategy to not only achieve superhydrophobicity but also to\nincrease its stability against environmental disturbances. This new relation\ntakes into account the previously overlooked but key fact that the accumulated\nline energy arising from the numerous solid-water-air intersections that can be\ndistributed in the apparent contact area when air packets are trapped at small\nscales on the surface can dramatically increase as the roughness scale shrinks.\nThis term can in fact become the dominant contributor to the surface energy and\nso becomes crucial for accomplishing superhydrophobicity. These findings guide\nfabrication of stable super water-repellant surfaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 02:20:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Quanshui", ""], ["Lv", "Cunjing", ""], ["Hao", "Pengfei", ""], ["Sheridan", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1512", "submitter": "Jingshan Zhang", "authors": "Jingshan Zhang and Eugene I.

To\nresolve these conflicts, we present a coarse-grained model to calculate the B\ncell population development in affinity maturation, which allows a\ncomprehensive analysis of its parameter space to look for optimal values of\nmutation rate, selection strength, and initial antibody-antigen binding level\nthat maximize the affinity improvement. With these optimized parameters, the\nmodel is compatible with the experimental observations such as the ~100-fold\naffinity improvements, the number of mutations, the hypermutation rate, and the\n\"all or none\" phenomenon. Moreover, we study the reasons behind the optimal\nparameters. The optimal mutation rate, in agreement with the hypermutation rate\nin vivo, results from a tradeoff between accumulating enough beneficial\nmutations and avoiding too many deleterious or lethal mutations. The optimal\nselection strength evolves as a balance between the need for affinity\nimprovement and the requirement to pass the population bottleneck. These\nfindings point to the conclusion that germinal centers have been optimized by\nevolution to generate strong affinity antibodies effectively and rapidly. In\naddition, we study the enhancement of affinity improvement due to B cell\nmigration between germinal centers. These results could enhance our\nunderstandings to the functions of germinal centers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Feb 2010 02:57:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jingshan", ""], ["Shakhnovich", "Eugene I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1569", "submitter": "Andrea Veglio", "authors": "A.

These responses\nare controlled by the synthesis of the hormone auxin, which is regulated by two\nsignals, an environmental one and an internal one. Considering that the auxin\nsignal induces plant growth after a time lag, this work shows that plant growth\ncan be modelled in terms of an energy-like function extremization, provided\nthat the Markov property is not applied. The simulated height distributions are\nbimodal and right skewed, as in real community of plants. In the case of\nisolated plants, the theoretical expressions for the growth dynamics and the\ngrowth speed excellently fit experimental data for Arabidopsis thaliana.\nMoreover, the growth dynamics of this model is shown to be consistent with the\nbiomass production function of an independent model.
