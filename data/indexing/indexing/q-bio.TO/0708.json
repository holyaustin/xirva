Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide\nmarkedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex\n24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to\nvehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide\nsignificantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte\ninfiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at\n48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first\nexperimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit\nBBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral\nischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the\ntreatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide\ntherapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,\nselective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the\nevaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1\nactivity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and\nthat the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are\nprobably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2007 15:47:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Candelario-Jalil", "E", ""], ["Gonzalez-Falcon", "A", ""], ["Garcia-Cabrera", "M", ""], ["Leon", "OS", ""], ["Fiebich", "BL", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0186", "submitter": "Eduardo Candelario-Jalil", "authors": "E.
