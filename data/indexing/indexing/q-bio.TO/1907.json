This process creates space in which the cells can\ninvade and thus enlarge the tumour. As a tumour increases in malignancy, the\ncancer cells adopt the ability to mutate into secondary cell subpopulations\ngiving rise to a heterogeneous tumour. This new cell subpopulation often\ncarries higher invasive qualities and permits a quicker spread of the tumour.\nBuilding upon the recent multiscale modelling framework for cancer invasion\nwithin a fibrous ECM introduced in Shuttleworth and Trucu (2019), in this paper\nwe consider the process of local invasion by a heterotypic tumour consisting of\ntwo cancer cell populations mixed with a two-phase ECM. To that end, we address\nthe double feedback link between the tissue-scale cancer dynamics and the\ncell-scale molecular processes through the development of a two-part modelling\nframework that crucially incorporates the multiscale dynamic redistribution of\noriented fibres occurring within a two-phase extra-cellular matrix and combines\nthis with the multiscale leading edge dynamics exploring key matrix-degrading\nenzymes molecular processes along the tumour interface that drive the movement\nof the cancer boundary.

We compared the laser biospeckle activityof endophyte infected and\nuninfected J. curcas leaves. The differences between blade and veins (including\nmidrib) of the studied leaves was validated and growth parameters of the\nstudied plants were also analyzed using the normalized weigthed generalized\ndifferencescoefficient (nWGD). The obtained results showeda relationship\nbetween the endophytic burden of leaves and the LBS, suggesting that LSBA is a\nuseful tools to detect endophytic colonization in situ.Also, the increasedwater\nmovements inside leaves promoted by endophytic colonizationcould be explainby\nthe obtained data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Jul 2019 16:38:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["DJonsiles", "Maria Fernanda", ""], ["Galizzi", "Gustavo Ernesto", ""], ["Dolinko", "Andres Ezequiel", ""], ["Novas", "Mar\u00eda Victoria", ""], ["Nakamurakare", "Esteban Ceriani", ""], ["Carmar\u00e1n", "Cecilia Cristina", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.11618", "submitter": "Guillermo Lorenzo", "authors": "Pierluigi Colli, Hector Gomez, Guillermo Lorenzo, Gabriela Marinoschi,\n  Alessandro Reali, and Elisabetta Rocca", "title": "Mathematical analysis and simulation study of a phase-field model of\n  prostate cancer growth with chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy effects", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP cs.CE q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cytotoxic chemotherapy is a common treatment for advanced prostate cancer.\nThese tumors are also known to rely on angiogenesis, i.e., the growth of local\nmicrovasculature via chemical signaling produced by the tumor. Thus, several\nclinical studies have been investigating antiangiogenic therapy for advanced\nprostate cancer, either as monotherapy or combined with standard cytotoxic\nprotocols. However, the complex genetic alterations promoting prostate cancer\ngrowth complicate the selection of the best chemotherapeutic approach for each\npatient's tumor. Here, we present a mathematical model of prostate cancer\ngrowth and chemotherapy that may enable physicians to test and design\npersonalized chemotherapeutic protocols in silico. We use the phase-field\nmethod to describe tumor growth, which we assume to be driven by a generic\nnutrient following reaction-diffusion dynamics. Tumor proliferation and\napoptosis (i.e., programmed cell death) can be parameterized with\nexperimentally-determined values. Cytotoxic chemotherapy is included as a term\ndownregulating tumor net proliferation, while antiangiogenic therapy is modeled\nas a reduction in intratumoral nutrient supply. Another equation couples the\ntumor phase field with the production of prostate-specific antigen, which is an\nextensively used prostate cancer biomarker. We prove the well-posedness of our\nmodel and we run a series of representative simulations using an isogeometric\nmethod to explore untreated tumor growth as well as the effects of cytotoxic\nchemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy, both alone and combined. Our\nsimulations show that our model captures the growth morphologies of prostate\ncancer as well as common outcomes of cytotoxic and antiangiogenic mono and\ncombined therapy. Our model also reproduces the usual temporal trends in tumor\nvolume and prostate-specific antigen evolution observed in previous studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jul 2019 15:20:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Colli", "Pierluigi", ""], ["Gomez", "Hector", ""], ["Lorenzo", "Guillermo", ""], ["Marinoschi", "Gabriela", ""], ["Reali", "Alessandro", ""], ["Rocca", "Elisabetta", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12975", "submitter": "Florian Kromp Dipl.

Deep Neural Networks can learn the implicit\ntransformation of a nuclear image into a probability map indicating the class\nmembership of each pixel (nucleus or background), but the use of\npost-processing steps to turn the probability map into a labeled object mask is\nerror-prone. This especially accounts for nuclear images of tissue sections and\nnuclear images across varying tissue preparations. In this work, we aim to\nevaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures to\nsegment nuclei in fluorescence images of various tissue origins and sample\npreparation types without post-processing. We compare architectures that\noperate on pixel to pixel translation and an architecture that operates on\nobject detection and subsequent locally applied segmentation. In addition, we\npropose a novel strategy to create artificial images to extend the training\nset. We evaluate the influence of ground truth annotation quality, image scale\nand segmentation complexity on segmentation performance. Results show that\nthree out of four deep learning architectures (U-Net, U-Net with ResNet34\nbackbone, Mask R-CNN) can segment fluorescent nuclear images on most of the\nsample preparation types and tissue origins with satisfactory segmentation\nperformance. Mask R-CNN, an architecture designed to address instance aware\nsegmentation tasks, outperforms other architectures. Equal nuclear mean size,\nconsistent nuclear annotations and the use of artificially generated images\nresult in overall acceptable precision and recall across different tissues and\nsample preparation types.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2019 14:23:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kromp", "Florian", ""], ["Fischer", "Lukas", ""], ["Bozsaky", "Eva", ""], ["Ambros", "Inge", ""], ["Doerr", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Taschner-Mandl", "Sabine", ""], ["Ambros", "Peter", ""], ["Hanbury", "Allan", ""]]}]
