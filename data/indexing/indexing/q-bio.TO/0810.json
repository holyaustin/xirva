We show that depending on STDP's polarity,\nfunctional loops are formed or eliminated in networks driven to normal spiking\nconditions by random, partially correlated inputs, where functional loops\ncomprise weights that exceed a non-zero threshold. We further prove that STDP\nis a form of loop-regulating plasticity for the case of a linear network\ncomprising random weights drawn from certain distributions. Thus a notable\nlocal synaptic learning rule makes a specific prediction about synapses in the\nbrain in which standard STDP is present: that under normal spiking conditions,\nthey should participate in predominantly feed-forward connections at all\nscales. Our model implies that any deviations from this prediction would\nrequire a substantial modification to the hypothesized role for standard STDP.\nGiven its widespread occurrence in the brain, we predict that STDP could also\nregulate long range synaptic loops among individual neurons across all brain\nscales, up to, and including, the scale of global brain network topology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 21:16:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2009 18:24:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 Mar 2010 23:12:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kozloski", "James R.", ""], ["Cecchi", "Guillermo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1024", "submitter": "Peter Hinow", "authors": "Peter Hinow, Philip Gerlee, Lisa J.

When no treatment\nis applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The\ninitially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of\nmillimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the\ntumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and\nestablishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model\nwe apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces\nthe proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the\ncapability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to\ndetermine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more\nimportant of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we\nconsidered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor\ncells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from\nthe blood vessels. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of\nthe drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact\naccelerate the growth rate of the tumor. This result seems to be due to\ncomplicated interplay between the stromal and tumor cell types and highlights\nthe importance of considering chemotherapy in a spatial context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Oct 2008 17:38:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Feb 2009 16:36:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2009 16:30:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Hinow", "Peter", ""], ["Gerlee", "Philip", ""], ["McCawley", "Lisa J.", ""], ["Quaranta", "Vito", ""], ["Ciobanu", "Madalina", ""], ["Wang", "Shizhen", ""], ["Graham", "Jason M.", ""], ["Ayati", "Bruce P.", ""], ["Claridge", "Jonathan", ""], ["Swanson", "Kristin R.", ""], ["Loveless", "Mary", ""], ["Anderson", "Alexander R.
