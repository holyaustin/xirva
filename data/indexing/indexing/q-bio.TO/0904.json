However, this theory fails to explain some aging phenotypes such as\nfibrosis and premature aging, since terms such as 'damage' and 'fault' are not\nspecified. Therefore we introduce some crucial modifications of this theory and\narrive at a novel theory: aging of the body is the result of accumulation of\nMisrepair of tissue. It emphasizes: a) it is Misrepair, not the original\ndamage, that accumulates and leads to aging; and b) aging can occur at\ndifferent levels, however aging of the body takes place necessarily on the\ntissue level, but not requiring the aging of cells/molecules. The\nMisrepair-accumulation theory introduced in the present paper unifies the\nunderstanding of the roles of environmental damage, repair, gene regulation,\nand multicellular structure in the aging process. This theory gives\nexplanations for the aging phenotypes, premature aging, the difference of\nlongevity in different species, and it is consistent with the physical view on\ncomplex systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Apr 2009 13:49:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2009 12:45:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2011 08:00:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Jicun", "", "CUH"], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas", "", "IJLRA"], ["Wunderlin", "Arne", "", "CUH"], ["Mahadeva", "Ravi", "", "CUH"]]}, {"id": "0904.2491", "submitter": "Fabien Crauste", "authors": "Mostafa Adimy (LMA-PAU, INRIA Futurs), Fabien Crauste, Shigui Ruan", "title": "Stability and Hopf bifurcation in a mathematical model of pluripotent\n  stem cell dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Nonlinear Analysis Real World Applications 6, 4 (2005) 651-670", "doi": "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2004.12.010", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP q-bio.CB q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a mathematical model describing the dynamics of a pluripotent stem\ncell population involved in the blood production process in the bone marrow.\nThis model is a differential equation with a time delay.
