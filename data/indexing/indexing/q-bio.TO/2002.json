Although epithelial monolayers are\noften modeled as two-dimensional (2D) elastic surfaces, they distinguish\nthemselves from conventional thin elastic plates in three important ways - the\npresence of an apical-basal polarity, spatial variability of cellular\nthickness, and their nonequilibrium active nature. Here, we develop a minimal\ncontinuum model of a planar epithelial tissue as an active elastic material\nthat incorporates all these features. We start from a full three-dimensional\n(3D)description of the tissue and derive an effective 2D model that captures,\nthrough the curvature of the apical surface, both the apical-basal asymmetry\nand the spatial geometry of the tissue. Crucially, variations of active\nstresses across the apical-basal axis lead to active torques that can drive\ncurvature transitions. By identifying four distinct sources of activity, we\nfind that bulk active stresses arising from actomyosin contractility and growth\ncompete with boundary active tensions due to localized actomyosin cables and\nlamellipodial activity to generate the various states spanning the morphospace\nof a planar epithelium. Our treatment hence unifies 3D shape deformations\nthrough the coupled mechanics of apical curvature change and in-plane\nexpansion/contraction of substrate-adhered tissues.

We evaluated the\nVNS effect on the systemic inflammatory response induced by a high dose of LPS\nin neonatal piglets to mimic late-onset neonatal sepsis. Next, we tested if our\nHRV inflammatory index tracks inflammation in piglets. Following anesthesia,\nelectrodes were attached to the left vagal nerve; ECG and blood pressure (BP)\nwere recorded throughout the experiment. Following baseline, the piglets were\nadministered LPS as 2mg/kg IV bolus. In the VNS treated piglet, the vagus nerve\nwas stimulated for 10 minutes prior to and 10 min after the injection of LPS.\nIn both groups, every 15 min post LPS, the arterial blood sample was drawn for\nblood gas, metabolites, and inflammatory cytokines.
