We treat 1D and 2D tissues as\ncontinuous, deformable, growing geometries for sizes larger than 1mm. The\ndynamics of the growing tissue are described by a set of coupled tensor\nequations in non-Euclidean (curved) space. These coupled equations represent a\nnovel feedback mechanism between growth and curvature dynamics.\n  For 1D growth, numerical simulations are compared to two measures of root\ngrowth. First, modular growth along the simulated root shows an elongation zone\ncommon to many species of plant roots. Second, the relative elemental growth\nrate (REGR) calculated in silico exhibits temporal dynamics recently\ncharacterized in high-resolution root growth studies but which thus far lack a\nbiological hypothesis to explain them. Namely, the REGR can evolve from a\nsingle peak localized near the root tip to a double-peak structure. In our\nmodel, this is a direct consequence of considering growth as both a geometric\nreaction-diffusion process and expansion due to a distributed source of new\nmaterials.\n  In 2D, we study a circularly symmetric growing disk with emergent negative\ncurvatures. These results are compared against thin disk experiments, which are\na proxy model for plant leaves. These results also apply to the curvature\nevolution and the inhomogeneous growth pattern of the Acetabularia cap. Lastly,\nwe extend the model to anisotropic disks and predict the growth dynamics for a\n2D curved surface which develops an elongated shape with localized ruffling.\n  Our model also provides several measures of the dynamics of tissue growth.\nThese include the time evolution of the metric and velocity field, which are\ndynamical variables in the model, as well as expansion, shear and rotation\nwhich are deformation tensors characterizing the growth of the tissue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:25:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pulwicki", "Julia", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.02077", "submitter": "Mersini Makropoulou I.", "authors": "Mersini Makropoulou", "title": "Cancer and electromagnetic radiation therapy: Quo Vadis?", "comments": "22 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In oncology, treating cancer with a beam of photons is a well established\ntherapeutic technique, developed over 100 years, and today over 50% of cancer\npatients will undergo traditional X-ray radiotherapy. However, ionizing\nradiation therapy is not the only option, as the high-energy photons delivering\ntheir cell-killing radiation energy into cancerous tumor can lead to\nsignificant damage to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor, located throughout\nthe beam's path. Therefore, in nowadays, advances in ionizing radiation therapy\nare competitive to non-ionizing ones, as for example the laser light based\ntherapy, resulting in a synergism that has revolutionized medicine. The use of\nnon-invasive or minimally invasive (e.g. through flexible endoscopes)\ntherapeutic procedures in the management of patients represents a very\ninteresting treatment option. Moreover, as the major breakthrough in cancer\nmanagement is the individualized patient treatment, new biophotonic techniques,\ne.g. photo-activated drug carriers, help the improvement of treatment efficacy\nand/or normal tissue toxicity. Additionally, recent studies support that laser\ntechnology progresses could revolutionize cancer proton therapy, by reducing\nthe cost of the needed installations. The aim of this review is to present some\nlaser-based future objectives for cancer radiation therapy, aiming to address\nthe relevant advances in the ionizing and non-ionizing radiation therapy, i.e.\nprotons and heavy ions therapy, as well as photodynamic targeted and molecular\ntherapies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 16:03:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Makropoulou", "Mersini", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.02490", "submitter": "Jan Egger", "authors": "Jan Egger, Stefan Gro{\\ss}kopf, Bernd Freisleben", "title": "Simulation of bifurcated stent grafts to treat abdominal aortic\n  aneurysms (AAA)", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures, 5 equations, 9 references in Proc.

A scientific\nunderstanding of the reason for this increase would provide guidance as to the\ncontexts in which SOF can be used to their best effect. Ashby's law of\nrequisite variety provides a scientific framework for understanding and\nanalyzing a system's ability to survive and prosper in the face of\nenvironmental challenges. We have developed a generalization of this law to\nextend the analysis to systems that must respond to disturbances at multiple\nscales. This analysis identifies a necessary tradeoff between scale and\ncomplexity in a multiscale control system. As with Ashby's law, the framework\napplies to the characterization of successful biological and social systems in\nthe context of complex environmental challenges. Here we apply this multiscale\nframework to provide a control theoretic understanding of the historical and\nincreasing need for SOF, as well as conventional military forces. We propose\nthat the essential role distinction is in the separation between high\ncomplexity fine scale challenges as opposed to large scale challenges. This\nleads to a correspondence between the role SOF can best serve and that of the\nimmune system in complex organisms--namely, the ability to respond to\nfine-grained, high-complexity disruptors and preserve tissue health. Much like\na multicellular organism, human civilization is composed of a set of distinct\nand heterogeneous social tissues. Responding to disruption and restoring health\nin a system with highly diverse local social conditions is an essentially\ncomplex task.
