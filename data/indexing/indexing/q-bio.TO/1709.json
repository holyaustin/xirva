The hypothesis behind this feature is that non-invasive and\ninvasive tumors may have different morphologic patterns in the tumor periphery,\nin turn reflecting the differences in radiological presentations in the PET\nimages. The utility of the shell was evaluated by the support vector machine\n(SVM) classifier in comparison with intensity, geometry, gray level\nco-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture, neighborhood gray tone difference\nmatrix (NGTDM) based texture, and a combination of these four features. The\nresults were assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the\narea under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Results For NSCLC, the AUC\nachieved by the shell feature was 0.82 while the highest AUC achieved by the\nother features was 0.76. Similarly, for CC, the AUC achieved by the shell\nfeature was 0.83 while the highest AUC achieved by the other features was 0.76.\nAlso, the difference in performance between shell and the other features was\nsignificant (P < 0.005) in all cases. Conclusions We propose a boundary-based\nshell feature that correlates with tumor metastasis. The shell feature showed\nbetter predictive performance than all the other features for distant failure\nprediction in both NSCLC and CC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 16:06:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hao", "Hongxia", ""], ["Zhou", "Zhiguo", ""], ["Li", "Shulong", ""], ["Maquilan", "Genevieve", ""], ["Folkert", "Michael R.", ""], ["Iyengar", "Puneeth", ""], ["Westover", "Kenneth D.", ""], ["Albuquerque", "Kevin", ""], ["Liu", "Fang", ""], ["Choy", "Hak", ""], ["Timmerman", "Robert", ""], ["Yang", "Lin", ""], ["Wang", "Jing", ""]]}]
