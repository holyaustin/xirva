The objective of this study is to propose\nand analyze a two-dimensional probabilistic cellular automata model to describe\navascular solid tumor growth, taking into account both the competition between\ncancer cells and normal cells for nutrients and/or space and a time-dependent\nproliferation of cancer cells. Gompertzian growth, characteristic of some\ntumors, is described and some of the features of the time-spatial pattern of\nsolid tumors, such as compact morphology with irregular borders, are captured.\nThe parameter space is studied in order to analyze the occurrence of necrosis\nand the response to therapy. Our findings suggest that transitions exist\nbetween necrotic and non-necrotic phases (no-therapy cases), and between the\nstates of cure and non-cure (therapy cases). To analyze cure, the control and\norder parameters are, respectively, the highest probability of cancer cell\nproliferation and the probability of the therapeutic effect on cancer cells.\nWith respect to patterns, it is possible to observe the inner necrotic core and\nthe effect of the therapy destroying the tumor from its outer borders inwards.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2008 21:48:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Reis", "E.

To show this, based on the\npreviously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler\ndynamics of the local spinal motions and derive from it the corresponding\ncoupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics.

Model scalability becomes of paramount interest. In an effort to start\naddressing this critical issue, here, we present a novel multi-scale and\nmulti-resolution agent-based in silico glioma model. While \"multi-scale\" refers\nto employing an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-driven molecular\nnetwork to process cellular phenotypic decisions within the micro-macroscopic\nenvironment, \"multi-resolution\" is achieved through algorithms that classify\ncells to either active or inactive spatial clusters, which determine the\nresolution they are simulated at. The aim is to assign computational resources\nwhere and when they matter most for maintaining or improving the predictive\npower of the algorithm, onto specific tumor areas and at particular times.\nUsing a previously described 2D brain tumor model, we have developed four\ndifferent computational methods for achieving the multi-resolution scheme,\nthree of which are designed to dynamically train on the high-resolution\nsimulation that serves as control. To quantify the algorithms' performance, we\nrank them by weighing the distinct computational time savings of the simulation\nruns versus the methods' ability to accurately reproduce the high-resolution\nresults of the control. Finally, to demonstrate the flexibility of the\nunderlying concept, we show the added value of combining the two highest-ranked\nmethods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jun 2008 20:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Le", ""], ["Chen", "L.

Reflecting distinct cell-specific\nintracellular machinery, the cancer cells are modelled as processing a variety\nof spatial search strategies that respond to these three influencing factors\nwith differential weights attached to each. While responding exclusively to\nchemoattraction optimizes cell displacement effectiveness, incorporating\npermission and resistance components becomes increasingly important with\ngreater distance to the chemoattractant source and/or after reducing the\nligand's effective diffusion coefficient. Extending this to a heterogeneous\npopulation of cells shows that displacement effectiveness increases with clonal\ndiversity as characterized by the Shannon index. However, the resulting data\ncan be fit best to an exponential function, suggesting that there is a level of\npopulation heterogeneity beyond which its added value to the cancer system\nbecomes minimal as directionality ceases to increase.
