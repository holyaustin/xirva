I could list the following\nreasons to address that question: (a) Leaves are natural composite structures,\nduring millions of years of evolution, they have adapted themselves to their\nsurrounding environment and their design is optimized, one can apply the\nknowledge gained from studying the fracture mechanism of leaves to the\ndevelopment of new composite materials; (b) Other soft tissues like skin and\nblood vessel have similar structure at some scales and may possess the same\nfracture mechanism. The gained knowledge can also be applied to these\nmaterials; (c) Global need for food is skyrocketing. There are few countries,\nincluding the United States, that have all the potentials (i.e. water, soil,\nsunlight, and manpower) to play a major role in the future world food supplying\nmarket. If we can increase the output of our farms and forests, by means of\nprotecting them against herbivores [Beck 1965], pathogens [Campbell et al.\n1980], and other physical damages, our share of the future market will be\nhigher. It will also enforce our national food security because we will not be\ndependent on food import. We do not yet know how much of our farms and forests\noutput can be saved if we can genetically design tougher materials, but the\nwhole idea does worth to be studied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 20:40:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 04:40:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Meidani", "Mehrashk", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01288", "submitter": "Georgi Kapitanov", "authors": "Georgi I.

Recently both in vivo\nand in silico studies have tried to better understand hemodynamics at varying\nstages of vertebrate cardiogenesis. In particular, the intracardial\nhemodynamics during the onset of trabeculation is notably complex - the\ninertial and viscous fluid forces are approximately equal at this stage and\nsmall perturbations in morphology, scale, and steadiness of the flow can lead\nto significant changes in bulk flow structures, shear stress distributions, and\nchemical morphogen gradients. The immersed boundary method was used to solve\nthe computational fluid dynamics problem involving fluid flow moving through\nthe trabeculated ventricles of 72, 80, and 120 hours post fertilization wild\ntype zebrafish embryos and ErbB2-inhibited embryos at 7 days post\nfertilization. An idealized trabeculated ventricular model was explored to map\nthe bifurcations in flow structure that occur as a result of the unsteadiness\nof flow, trabeculae height, and fluid scale ($Re$). Vortex formation occurred\nin intertrabecular regions for biologically relevant parameter spaces, wherein\nflow velocities increased. This indicates that trabecular morphology may alter\nintracardial flow patterns and hence ventricular shear stresses and morphogen\ngradients. A potential implication of this work is that the onset of vortical\n(disturbed) flows can upregulate Notch1 expression in endothelial cells in\nvitro and hence impacts chamber morphogensis, valvulogenesis, and the formation\nof the trabeculae themselves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2015 19:07:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2018 00:47:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Battista", "Nicholas A.", ""], ["Douglas", "Dylan R.", ""], ["Lane", "Andrea N.", ""], ["Samsa", "Leigh Ann", ""], ["Liu", "Jiandong", ""], ["Miller", "Laura A.", ""]]}]
