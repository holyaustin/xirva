Transport\nnetworks optimized for efficiency have been shown to be trees, i.e. loopless.\nHowever, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which\nare functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein,\nincluding the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible\nreasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks:\nresilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the\noptimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over\ndamage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes\ntransport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks\nare closed. We find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the\noptimum state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 20:05:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Katifori", "Eleni", ""], ["Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si", "Gergely J.", ""], ["Magnasco", "Marcelo O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.5028", "submitter": "Mari Watanabe", "authors": "Tomofumi Kimotsuki (Saint Louis University), Noriko Niwa (Washington\n  Univ.

Previous studies have shown\nthat beta-adrenergic stimulation increases QT/RR slope, but the effects of\nbeta-adrenergic stimulation on QT/RR slope in heart failure are unknown.\nMethods: New Zealand White rabbits underwent coronary ligation (n=15) or sham\nsurgery (n=11), and implantation of a pediatric pacemaker lead in the right\nventricle for chronic ECG recording. Eight weeks after surgery, unsedated\nrabbits were given intravenous administrations of 0.25 to 2.0 ml of 1\nmicromol/l isoprenaline, while peak QRS to QRS (RR) and Q to T peak (QT)\nintervals were measured. Results: Ligated rabbits (n=6) had lower LVEF than\nsham rabbits (n=7, p<.0001), but similar baseline RR (269 +/- 15 vs 292 +/- 23\nms, p=.07), QT (104 +/- 17 vs 91 +/- 9 ms, p=.1) and minimum RR (204 +/- 11 vs\n208 +/- 6 ms, p=.4) intervals induced by isoprenaline (0.79 +/- 0.18 vs 0.73\n+/- 0.14 ml, p=.6). Hysteresis in QT vs TQ interval plots displayed biphasic\nrestitution and regions of negative slope. The slope of the positive slope\nregion was >1 in ligated rabbits (1.27 +/- 0.66) and <1 in sham rabbits (0.35\n+/- 0.14, p=.004). Absolute value of the negative slope was greater in ligated\nrabbits (-0.81 +/- 0.52 vs -0.35 +/- 0.14, p=.04). Conclusion: Ischaemic heart\nfailure produces steeper restitution slopes during beta-adrenergically induced\nQT/TQ hysteresis. This could underlie the propensity of failing hearts to\narrhythmias.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 02:31:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kimotsuki", "Tomofumi", "", "Saint Louis University"], ["Niwa", "Noriko", "", "Washington\n  Univ.

Tumor is modeled as a\nsaturated mixture of proliferating cells, extracellular fluid and extracellular\nmatrix, that occupies a spatial region close to a blood vessel whence cells get\nthe nutrient needed for their vital functions. Growth of tumor cells takes\nplace within a healthy host tissue, which is in turn modeled as a saturated\nmixture of non-proliferating cells. Interactions between these two regions are\naccounted for as an essential mechanism for the growth of the tumor mass. By\nweakening the role of the extracellular matrix, which is regarded as a rigid\nnon-remodeling scaffold, a system of two partial differential equations is\nderived, describing the evolution of the cell volume ratio coupled to the\ndynamics of the nutrient, whose higher and lower concentration levels determine\nproliferation or death of tumor cells, respectively. Numerical simulations of a\nreference two-dimensional problem are shown and commented, and a qualitative\nmathematical analysis of some of its key issues is proposed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 13:12:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Tosin", "Andrea", ""]]}]
