We discuss ways to bypass computational limitations\nand discuss our incremental approach, where each step is validated by\nexperimental observations on a quantitative basis. We present a few results on\nthe growth of tumor cells in closed and open environments and of tumor\nspheroids.

In this paper, the functional-structural model GreenLab is\ncalibrated by using poplar data of 3, 4, 5, 6 years old. The data was acquired\nby simplifying measurement. The architecture was also simplified by classifying\nthe branches into several types (physiological age) using clustering analysis,\nwhich decrease the number of parameters.

In this paper we investigated the effects of\nbranches on the sourcesink interaction for the cotton plant (Gossypium hirsutum\nL.) based on a two-treatment experiment conducted on cotton grown in the field:\nthe singlestem plants and the plants with only two vegetative branches. It was\nobserved that the branched cotton had more organs for the whole plant but the\norgans on the trunk were smaller than those on the single-stem cotton. The\nphytomer production of the branches was four or five growth cycles delayed\ncompared with the main stem. The organs on the trunk had similar dynamics of\nexpansion for both treatments. Effects of branches were evaluated by using the\nfunctionalstructural model GREENLAB. It allowed estimating the coefficients of\nsink strength to differentiate the biomass acquisition abilities of organs\nbetween different physiological ages. We found that the presence of the two\nvegetative branches increased the ground projection area of plant leaves and\nhad led to slight changes on the directly measured parameters; the potential\nrelative sink strengths of organs were found similar for the two treatments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Dec 2010 10:58:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Dong", "", "CAU"], ["Letort", "V\u00e9ronique", "", "MAS, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France"], ["Guo", "Yan", "", "LIAMA"], ["De Reffye", "P.", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, AMAP"], ["Zhan", "Zhigang", "", "LIAMA"]]}, {"id": "1012.4403", "submitter": "Christoph Haselwandter", "authors": "M.
