Why some viruses establish\nchronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is\nthat the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is\nunable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently\nproposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T\ncells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes\na chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing\nefficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of\nthe infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector\nCD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus\n(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the\nchronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T\ncells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the\nkilling efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing\nefficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the\nmemory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in\nthe chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a\ntarget cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that\npersistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an\nefficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient\nCD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent\ninfection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2009 17:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ganusov", "Vitaly V.", ""], ["Lukacher", "Aron E.", ""], ["Byers", "Anthony M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4042", "submitter": "Radostin Simitev", "authors": "R.

While many different formulations of\nthis problem have been considered, it is recurrently found that optimal\nnetworks are trees. It is shown here that this result is contingent on the\nassumption of a stationary flow through the network. When time variations or\nfluctuations are allowed for, a different class of optimal structures is found,\nwhich share the hierarchical organization of trees yet contain loops. The\ntransitions between different network topologies as the parameters of the\nproblem vary are examined.
