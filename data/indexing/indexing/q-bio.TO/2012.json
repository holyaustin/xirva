By exploiting a duality\nbetween ecological dynamics and constrained optimization, we show that Tregs\ntile the potential antigen space while simultaneously minimizing the overlap\nbetween Treg activation profiles. We find that for sufficiently high Treg\ndiversity, Treg mediated self-tolerance is robust to fluctuations in\nself-antigen concentrations but lowering the Treg diversity results in a sharp\ntransition -- related to the Gardner transition in perceptrons -- to a regime\nwhere changes in self-antigen concentrations can result in an auto-immune\nresponse.

The inhaled droplets are deposited in\nthe upper respiratory tract mucus layer, where the virus infects and replicates\nin the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells leading to rapid progression of the\ninfection. Some patients may develop severe pneumonia and acute respiratory\ndistress syndrome when the distal alveolar region is involved by progressive\ndisease.

This work demonstrates a plausible and\nclinically supported pathway for deep lung infection that involves inhalation\nof self-aerosolized droplets from the pharyngeal or upper respiratory tract\nmucus. A coupled mathematical model of droplet and virus transport, within a\nWeibel-like lung geometry, is solved computationally to identify conditions for\nthe transport of virus-laden droplets from the pharyngeal region to the deep\nlungs. Specifically, the model predicts, in agreement with clinical\nobservations, that the infection can develop in the alveoli in 1 to 18 days.\nHowever, this requires continuous inhalation of virus-laden droplets, from the\nupper airways, for that duration. Continuous exposure to airborne virus-laden\ndroplets from the environment is unlikely for such a long duration. This leads\nto inhalation of self-aerosolized droplets as one of the most likely pathways\nfor the upper respiratory infection to transmit to the deep lungs.

The model is\ncomplemented with partition and diffusion properties computed from established\nquantitative structure-property relationships.

Physiologically, brain\nstrain is often considered the key parameter of brain injury. To evaluate the\nBIC's risk estimation accuracy across five datasets comprising different head\nimpact types, linear regression was used to model 95% maximum principal strain,\n95% maximum principal strain at the corpus callosum, and cumulative strain\ndamage (15%) on each of 18 BIC respectively. The results show a significant\ndifference in the relationship between BIC and brain strain across datasets,\nindicating the same BIC value may suggest different brain strain in different\nhead impact types. The accuracy of brain strain regression is generally\ndecreasing if the BIC regression models are fit on a dataset with a different\ntype of head impact rather than on the dataset with the same type. Given this\nfinding, this study raises concerns for applying BIC to estimate the brain\ninjury risks for head impacts different from the head impacts on which the BIC\nwas developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2020 01:41:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 19:51:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:51:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zhan", "Xianghao", ""], ["Li", "Yiheng", ""], ["Liu", "Yuzhe", ""], ["Domel", "August G.", ""], ["Alizadeh", "Hossein Vahid", ""], ["Raymond", "Samuel J.", ""], ["Ruan", "Jesse", ""], ["Barbat", "Saeed", ""], ["Tiernan", "Stephen", ""], ["Gevaert", "Olivier", ""], ["Zeineh", "Michael", ""], ["Grant", "Gerald", ""], ["Camarillo", "David B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.12127", "submitter": "Dagmar Iber", "authors": "Dagmar Iber", "title": "The Control of Lung Branching Morphogenesis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.CB q-bio.MN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Branching morphogenesis generates epithelial trees which facilitate gas\nexchange, filtering, as well as secretion processes with their large surface to\nvolume ratio.

We have open sourced this model and corresponding\nsegmentations. Methods: We trained a neural network to segment femoral\ncartilage from MESE MRIs. Cartilage was divided into 12 subregions along\nmedial-lateral, superficial-deep, and anterior-central-posterior boundaries.\nSubregional T2 values and four-year changes were calculated using a\nmusculoskeletal radiologist's segmentations (Reader 1) and the model's\nsegmentations. These were compared using 28 held out images. A subset of 14\nimages were also evaluated by a second expert (Reader 2) for comparison.\nResults: Model segmentations agreed with Reader 1 segmentations with a Dice\nscore of 0.85 +/- 0.03. The model's estimated T2 values for individual\nsubregions agreed with those of Reader 1 with an average Spearman correlation\nof 0.89 and average mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.34 ms. The model's estimated\nfour-year change in T2 for individual regions agreed with Reader 1 with an\naverage correlation of 0.80 and average MAE of 1.72 ms. The model agreed with\nReader 1 at least as closely as Reader 2 agreed with Reader 1 in terms of Dice\nscore (0.85 vs 0.75) and subregional T2 values. Conclusions: We present a fast,\nfully-automated model for segmentation of MESE MRIs. Assessments of cartilage\nhealth using its segmentations agree with those of an expert as closely as\nexperts agree with one another. This has the potential to accelerate\nosteoarthritis research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2020 23:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Thomas", "Kevin A.", ""], ["Krzemi\u0144ski", "Dominik", ""], ["Kidzi\u0144ski", "\u0141ukasz", ""], ["Paul", "Rohan", ""], ["Rubin", "Elka B.", ""], ["Halilaj", "Eni", ""], ["Black", "Marianne S.", ""], ["Chaudhari", "Akshay", ""], ["Gold", "Garry E.", ""], ["Delp", "Scott L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.13593", "submitter": "Hongyi Li Dr.", "authors": "Li Hongyi, Yin Yajun, Hu Jun, Li Hua, Wang Fang, Ji Fusui, Ma Chao", "title": "An insight into acupoints and meridians in human body based on\n  interstitial fluid circulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The atlas of human acupoints and meridians has been utilized in clinical\npractice for almost a millennium although the anatomical structures and\nfunctions remain to be clarified. It has recently been reported that a\nlong-distance interstitial fluid (ISF) circulatory pathway may originate from\nthe acupoints in the extremities. As observed in living human subjects,\ncadavers and animals using magnetic resonance imaging and fluorescent tracers,\nthe ISF flow pathways include at least 4 types of anatomical structures: the\ncutaneous-, perivenous-, periarterial-, and neural-pathways. Unlike the blood\nor lymphatic vessels, these ISF flow pathways are composed of highly ordered\nand topologically connected interstitial fibrous connective tissues that may\nwork as guiderails for the ISF to flow actively over long distance under\ncertain driving forces. Our experimental results demonstrated that most\nacupoints in the extremity endings connect with one or more ISF flow pathways\nand comprise a complex network of acupoint-ISF-pathways. We also found that\nthis acupoint-ISF-pathway network can connect to visceral organs or tissues\nsuch as the pericardium and epicardium, even though the topographical geometry\nin human extremities does not totally match the meridian lines on the atlas\nthat is currently used in traditional Chinese medicine. Based on our\nexperimental data, the following working hypotheses are proposed. A\ncomprehensive atlas will be constructed to systemically reveal the detailed\nanatomical structures of the acupoints-originated ISF circulation. Such an\natlas may shed light on the mysteries shrouding the visceral correlations of\nacupoints and meridians, and inaugurate a new frontier for innovative medical\napplications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Dec 2020 15:24:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hongyi", "Li", ""], ["Yajun", "Yin", ""], ["Jun", "Hu", ""], ["Hua", "Li", ""], ["Fang", "Wang", ""], ["Fusui", "Ji", ""], ["Chao", "Ma", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15750", "submitter": "Samiya Alkhairy", "authors": "Samiya A Alkhairy, Christopher A Shera", "title": "An analytic physically motivated model of the mammalian cochlea", "comments": "17 pages, 12 figures.
