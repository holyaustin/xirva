We developed a theoretical framework to quantify\nelectrical communication using information theory metrics in 2-dimensional cell\nlattice models of cardiac excitation propagation. The time series generated by\neach cell was coarse-grained to 1 when excited or 0 when resting. The Shannon\nentropy for each cell was calculated from the time series during four\nclinically important heart rhythms: normal heartbeat, anatomical reentry,\nspiral reentry, and multiple reentry. We also used mutual information to\nperform spatial profiling of communication during these cardiac arrhythmias. We\nfound that information sharing between cells was spatially heterogeneous. In\naddition, cardiac arrhythmia significantly impacted information sharing within\nthe heart. Entropy localized the path of the drifting core of spiral reentry,\nwhich could be an optimal target of therapeutic ablation. We conclude that\ninformation theory metrics can quantitatively assess electrical communication\namong cardiomyocytes. The traditional concept of the heart as a functional\nsyncytium sharing electrical information cannot predict altered entropy and\ninformation sharing during complex arrhythmia. Information theory metrics may\nfind clinical application in the identification of rhythm-specific treatments\nwhich are currently unmet by traditional electrocardiographic techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 15:36:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 19:55:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ashikaga", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Aguilar-Rodr\u00edguez", "Jos\u00e9", ""], ["Gorsky", "Shai", ""], ["Lusczek", "Elizabeth", ""], ["Marquitti", "Fl\u00e1via Maria Darcie", ""], ["Thompson", "Brian", ""], ["Wu", "Degang", ""], ["Garland", "Joshua", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.3768", "submitter": "Rodrigo Rosas-Burgos", "authors": "Arnulfo Castellanos-Moreno, Alejandro Castellanos-Jaramillo, Adalberto\n  Corella-Madue\\~no, Sergio Guti\\'errez-L\\'opez, Rodrigo Rosas-Burgos", "title": "Stochastic model for computer simulation of the number of cancer cells\n  and lymphocytes in homogeneous sections of cancer tumors", "comments": "37 pages, 21 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We deal with a small enough tumor section to consider it homogeneous, such\nthat populations of lymphocytes and cancer cells are independent of spatial\ncoordinates.

Although individual mechanisms such as cellular\ndormancy, angiogenic dormancy and immunosurveillance have been proposed, a\ncomprehensive understanding of cancer dormancy and the \"switch\" from a dormant\nto a proliferative state still needs to be strengthened from both a basic and\nclinical point of view. Computational modeling enables one to explore a variety\nof scenarios for possible but realistic microscopic dormancy mechanisms and\ntheir predicted outcomes. The aim of this paper is to devise such a predictive\ncomputational model of dormancy with an emergent \"switch\" behavior.\nSpecifically, we generalize a previous cellular automaton (CA) model for\nproliferative growth of solid tumor that now incorporates a variety of\ncell-level tumor-host interactions and different mechanisms for tumor dormancy,\nfor example the effects of the immune system. Our new CA rules induce a natural\n\"competition\" between the tumor and tumor suppression factors in the\nmicroenvironment. This competition either results in a \"stalemate\" for a period\nof time in which the tumor either eventually wins (spontaneously emerges) or is\neradicated; or it leads to a situation in which the tumor is eradicated before\nsuch a \"stalemate\" could ever develop. We also predict that if the number of\nactively dividing cells within the proliferative rim of the tumor reaches a\ncritical, yet low level, the dormant tumor has a high probability to resume\nrapid growth. Our findings may shed light on the fundamental understanding of\ncancer dormancy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 17:34:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Duyu", ""], ["Jiao", "Yang", ""], ["Torquato", "Salvatore", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8391", "submitter": "Yoichiro Mori", "authors": "Yoichiro Mori", "title": "A Multidomain Model for Ionic Electrodiffusion and Osmosis with an\n  Application to Cortical Spreading Depression", "comments": "submitted for publication, Aug. 28, 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ionic electrodiffusion and osmotic water flow are central processes in many\nphysiological systems.
