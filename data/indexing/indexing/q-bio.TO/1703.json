Due to its spiral phyllotaxy, older outer stems on the plant\ninterlace and envelope the younger inner stems forming the plant centre. Stem\ncurling is a morphological mechanism that limits photoinhibitory and thermal\ndamages the plant might experience in arid environments. Here, we investigate\nthe distinct conformational changes of outer and inner stems of S. lepidophylla\ntriggered by dehydration. Outer stems bend into circular rings in a relatively\nshort period of desiccation, whereas inner stems curl slowly into spirals due\nto hydro-actuated strain gradient along their length. This arrangement eases\nboth the tight packing of the plant during desiccation and its fast opening\nupon rehydration. The insights gained from this work shed light on the\nhydro-responsive movements in plants and might contribute to the development of\ndeployable structures with remarkable shape transformations in response to\nenvironmental stimuli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 06:30:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Rafsanjani", "Ahmad", ""], ["Brul\u00e9", "V\u00e9ronique", ""], ["Western", "Tamara L.", ""], ["Pasini", "Damiano", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.01107", "submitter": "Weiwei Ai Weiwei Ai", "authors": "Weiwei Ai, Nitish Patel, Partha Roop, Avinash Malik, Nathan Allen and\n  Mark L.

To communicate with a virtual\nheart, devices have been driven by cardiac signals at specific sites. As a\nresult, only the action potentials of these sites are sensed. However, the real\ndevice implanted in the heart will sense a complex combination of near and\nfar-field extracellular potential signals. Therefore many device functions,\nsuch as blanking periods and refractory periods, are designed to handle these\nunexpected signals. To represent these signals, we develop an intracardiac\nelectrogram (IEGM) model as an interface between the virtual heart and the\ndevice. The model can capture not only the local excitation but also far-field\nsignals and pacing afterpotentials. Moreover, the sensing controller can\nspecify unipolar or bipolar electrogram (EGM) sensing configurations and\nintroduce various oversensing and undersensing modes. The simulation results\nshow that the model is able to reproduce clinically observed sensing problems,\nwhich significantly extends the capabilities of the virtual heart model in the\ncontext of device validation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 10:46:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ai", "Weiwei", ""], ["Patel", "Nitish", ""], ["Roop", "Partha", ""], ["Malik", "Avinash", ""], ["Allen", "Nathan", ""], ["Trew", "Mark L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.03127", "submitter": "Yasser A.

After 7 days in culture, paralysed\nchondrocytes with similar morphology to those described in the rabbit growth\ncartilage could be identified in pellets in each serum type, however, the\nproportion of the cells was different. In pellet cultured with 10% fetal calf\nserum, more than 50% of the cells were paralysed chondrocytes but in 10% horse\nserum, less than 10% of cells were of paralysed type. At day 14, about 50% of\nthe cells in pellets cultured in either serum type differentiated into\nhypertrophic dark chondrocytes and the proportion of paralysed cells was\nmarkedly decreased. After 21 days in each culture, more than 70% of the cells\nwere hypertrophic dark chondrocytes and no paralysed chondrocytes could be\nobserved. The paralysed chondrocytes may be not dying and they likely to be an\nimmature form of hypertrophic dark chondrocytes. It is better to use the term\nimmature dark chondrocytes instead of paralysed cells.

Indeed, disparities between the incidence of Zika and microcephaly\nacross geographic locations has led to questions about the virus's role. Here\nwe consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking\nwater might be the primary cause or a cofactor. Pyriproxifen is a juvenile\nhormone analog which has been shown to correspond in mammals to a number of fat\nsoluble regulatory molecules including retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin\nA, with which it has cross-reactivity and whose application during development\nhas been shown to cause microcephaly. Methoprene, another juvenile hormone\nanalog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause\ndevelopmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing\nmicrocephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.\nWe review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually\nfound some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and\narhinencephaly in exposed rat pups. Pyriproxyfen use in Brazil is\nunprecedented, never having been applied to a water supply on a large scale.\nClaims that its geographical pattern of use rule it out as a cause have not\nbeen documented or confirmed. On the other hand, the very few microcephaly\ncases reported in Colombia and the wide discrepancies of incidence in different\nstates across Brazil despite large numbers of Zika cases undermine the claim\nthat Zika is the cause. Given this combination of potential molecular\nmechanism, toxicological and epidemiological evidence we strongly recommend\nthat the use of pyriproxyfen in Brazil be suspended until the potential causal\nlink to microcephaly is investigated further.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 19:37:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""], ["Nijhout", "H.

This construct is predicated on the notion that systemic\nlevel of angiogenesis inhibitors is regulated by the systemic level of\nangiogenesis stimulators, as the host is trying to maintain the homeostatic\nbalance of stimulators to inhibitors in the body.

Our numerical analysis reveals that\nextracellular matrix structure and presence of a chemotactic gradient are key\ndeterminants of the model behavior. Only in complex microenvironments, if the\nextracellular matrix is highly heterogeneous and a chemotactic gradient directs\nmigration, the amoeboid-mesenchymal migration plasticity allows a more\nwidespread invasion compared to the non-switching amoeboid and mesenchymal\nmodes. Importantly, these specific conditions are characteristic for in vivo\ntumor invasion.
