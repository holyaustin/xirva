The\ncenter of the basic unit of the muscle, the sarcomeric M-band, is perfectly\nplaced to sense the different types of load to which the muscle is subjected.\nIn particular, the kinase domain (TK) of titin located at the M-band is a known\ncandidate for mechanical signaling. Here, we develop the quantitative\nmathematical model that describes the kinetics of TK-based mechanosensitive\nsignaling, and predicts trophic changes in response to exercise and\nrehabilitation regimes. First, we build the kinetic model for TK conformational\nchanges under force: opening, phosphorylation, signaling and autoinhibition. We\nfind that TK opens as a metastable mechanosensitive switch, which naturally\nproduces a much greater signal after high-load resistance exercise than an\nequally energetically costly endurance effort. Next, in order for the model to\nbe stable, give coherent predictions, in particular the lag following the onset\nof an exercise regime, we have to account for the associated kinetics of\nphosphate (carried by ATP), and for the non-linear dependence of protein\nsynthesis rates on muscle fibre size.

CTEPH treatment aims to reduce pulmonary\narterial pressure and reestablish adequate lung perfusion, yet patients with\ndistal lesions are inoperable by standard surgical intervention. Instead, these\npatients undergo balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), a multi-session,\nminimally invasive surgery that disrupts the thromboembolic material within the\nvessel lumen using a catheter balloon. However, there still lacks an\nintegrative, holistic tool for identifying optimal target lesions for\ntreatment. To address this insufficiency, we simulate CTEPH hemodynamics and\nBPA therapy using a multiscale fluid dynamics model. The large pulmonary\narterial geometry is derived from a computed tomography (CT) image, whereas a\nfractal tree represents the small vessels. We model ring- and web-like lesions,\ncommon in CTEPH, and simulate normotensive conditions and four CTEPH disease\nscenarios; the latter includes both large artery lesions and vascular\nremodeling. BPA therapy is simulated by simultaneously reducing lesion severity\nin three locations. Our predictions mimic severe CTEPH, manifested by an\nincrease in mean proximal pulmonary arterial pressure above 20 mmHg and\nprominent wave reflections.

The simplest rearrangement in\nconfluent cellular monolayers involves neighbor exchanges among four cells,\ncalled a T1 transition, in analogy to foams. But unlike foams, cells must\nexecute a sequence of molecular processes, such as endocytosis of adhesion\nmolecules, to complete a T1 transition. Such processes could take a long time\ncompared to other timescales in the tissue. In this work, we incorporate this\nidea by augmenting vertex models to require a fixed, finite time for T1\ntransitions, which we call the \"T1 delay time\". We study how variations in T1\ndelay time affect tissue mechanics, by quantifying the relaxation time of\ntissues in the presence of T1 delays and comparing that to the cell-shape based\ntimescale that characterizes fluidity in the absence of any T1 delays. We show\nthat the molecular-scale T1 delay timescale dominates over the cell shape-scale\ncollective response timescale when the T1 delay time is the larger of the two.\nWe extend this analysis to tissues that become anisotropic under convergent\nextension, finding similar results. Moreover, we find that increasing the T1\ndelay time increases the percentage of higher-fold coordinated vertices and\nrosettes, and decreases the overall number of successful T1s, contributing to a\nmore elastic-like -- and less fluid-like -- tissue response. Our work suggests\nthat molecular mechanisms that act as a brake on T1 transitions could stiffen\nglobal tissue mechanics and enhance rosette formation during morphogenesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:25:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 Apr 2021 02:39:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Erdemci-Tandogan", "Gonca", ""], ["Manning", "M.

Several theories have been proposed to explain these facts. In particular,\nit was proposed that the lower expression of the viral receptor ACE2 in\nchildren protects them from severe Covid. However, other works suggested an\ninverse relationship between ACE2 expression and disease severity. Here we try\nto reconcile seemingly contradicting observations noting that ACE2 is not\nmonotonically related with age but it reaches a maximum at a young age that\ndepends on the cell type and then decreases. This pattern is consistent with\nmost existing data from humans and rodents and it is expected to be more marked\nfor ACE2 cell protein than for mRNA because of the increase with age of the\nprotease TACE/ADAM17 that sheds ACE2 from the cell membrane to the serum. The\nnegative relation between ACE2 level and Covid-19 severity at old age is not\nparadoxical but it is consistent with a mathematical model of virus propagation\nthat predicts that higher viral receptor does not necessarily favour virus\npropagation and it can even slow it down. More importantly, ACE2 is known to\nprotect organs from chronic and acute inflammation, which are worsened by low\nACE2 levels. Here we propose that ACE2 contributes essentially to reverse the\ninflammatory process by downregulating the pro-inflammatory peptides of the\nangiotensin and bradykinin system, and that failure to revert the inflammation\ntriggered by SARS-COV-2 may underlie both severe CoViD-19 infection and its\nmany post-infection manifestations, including the multi-inflammatory syndrome\nof children (MIS-C). Within this view, lower severity in children despite lower\nACE2 expression may be consistent with their higher expression of the\nalternative angiotensin II receptor ATR2 and in general of the\nanti-inflammatory arm of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) at young age.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 11:11:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bastolla", "Ugo", ""], ["Chambers", "Patrick", ""], ["Abia", "David", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Bermejo", "Maria-Laura", ""], ["Fresno", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13615", "submitter": "Erica Ipocoana", "authors": "Erica Ipocoana", "title": "On a non-isothermal Cahn-Hilliard model for tumor growth", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce here a new diffuse interface thermodynamically consistent\nnon-isothermal model for tumor growth in presence of a nutrient in a domain\n$\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$.
