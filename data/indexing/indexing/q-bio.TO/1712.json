The objective of this paper is to determine the incidence of ophthalmic\ndisease potentially leading to optic nerve disease in Middle Tennessee.\nMethods. We use a retrospective population-based incidence study design\nfocusing on the population of middle Tennessee and its nearby suburbs (N=3 397\n515). The electronic medical records for all patients evaluated or treated at a\nlarge tertiary care hospital and clinics with an initial diagnosis of a disease\neither affecting the optic nerve, or potentially associated with optic nerve\ndisease, between 2007 and 2014 were retrieved and analyzed. Results. 18 291\npatients (10 808 F) with 18 779 incidence events were identified with an age\nrange of 0-101 years from the query of the Vanderbilt BioVU. Estimated\nage-adjusted incidence per 100 000 population per year was 198.4/145.1\n(glaucoma F/M), 14.4/11.4 (intrinsic optic nerve disease F/M), 10.6/5.8 (optic\nnerve edema F/M), 6.1/6.6 (orbital inflammation F/M), and 23.7/6.7 (thyroid\ndisease F/M). Glaucoma incidence was strongly correlated with age with the\nincidence sharply increasing after age 40. Optic nerve edema incidence peaked\nin the 25-34 old females. African American population has increased likelihood\nof glaucoma, orbital inflammation, and thyroid disease. Conclusions. Mapping\nthe incidence of pathologies of the optic nerve is essential to the\nunderstanding of the relative likelihood of these conditions and impacts upon\npublic health. We find incidence of optic nerve diseases strongly varies by\ngender, age, and race which have not been previously studied using a unified\nframework or within a single metropolitan population\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Dec 2017 05:23:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Chaganti", "Shikha", ""], ["Nelson", "Katrina M.", ""], ["Harrigan", "Robert", ""], ["Nabar", "Kunal P.", ""], ["Nandakumar", "Naresh", ""], ["Goecks", "Tara", ""], ["Smith", "Seth A.", ""], ["Landman", "Bennett A.", ""], ["Mawn", "Louise A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.01699", "submitter": "M.

This elementary process initiates with a\nsudden mode I fracture of a group of musculo-elastic units, followed by an\nelastic recoil of these units, causing mode II separation of these, hence a\ndelamination plane.

AC and BSC can help to\ndiscriminate pathology from normal tissue during in-vivo imaging. In this\npaper, we propose a new RPM model to simultaneously compute AC and BSC for\nharmonic imaging and a normalized score that combines the two parameters as a\nmeasure of disease progression. The model utilizes the spectral difference\nbetween two regions of interest, the first, a proximal, close to the probe and\nsecond, a distal, away from the probe. We have implemented an algorithm based\non the model and shown that it provides accurate and stable estimates to within\n5% of AC and BSC for simulated received echo from post-focal depths of a\nhomogeneous liver-like medium. For practical applications with time gain and\ntime frequency compensated in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data from ultrasound\nscanner, the method has been approximated and generalized to estimate AC and\nBSC for tissue layer underlying a more attenuative subcutaneous layer. The\nangular spectrum approach for ultrasound propagation in biological tissue is\nemployed as a virtual Reference Phantom (VRP). The VRP is calibrated with a\nfixed probe and scanning protocol for application to liver tissue. In a\nfeasibility study with 16 subjects, the method is able to separate 9/11 cases\nof progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from 5 normal. In particular,\nit is able to separate 4/5 cases of non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis and early\nfibrosis (F<=2) from normal tissue.

We thus test computationally different hypotheses on late\nstages of bone mineralisation by simulating BMDDs in low turnover conditions.\nMaterials and Methods: An established computational model of the BMDD that\naccounts for mineralisation and remodelling processes was extended to limit\nmineralisation to various maximum calcium capacities of bone. Simulated BMDDs\nobtained by reducing turnover rate from the reference trabecular BMDD under\ndifferent assumptions on late stage mineralisation kinetics were compared with\nexperimental BMDDs of low-turnover bone. Results: Simulations show that an\nabrupt stopping of mineralisation near a maximum calcium capacity induces a\npile-up of minerals in the BMDD statistics that is not observed experimentally.\nWith a smooth decrease of mineralisation rate, imposing low maximum calcium\ncapacities helps to match peak location and width of simulated low turnover\nBMDDs with peak location and width of experimental BMDDs, but results in a\ndistinctive asymmetric peak shape. No tuning of turnover rate and maximum\ncalcium capacity was able to explain the differences found in experimental\nBMDDs between trabecular bone (high turnover) and femoral cortical bone (low\nturnover). Conclusions: Secondary mineralisation in human bone does not stop\nabruptly, but continues slowly up to a calcium content greater than 30 wt% Ca.\nThe similar mineral heterogeneity seen in trabecular and femoral cortical bones\nat different peak locations was unexplained by turnover differences tested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Dec 2017 14:12:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""], ["Lerebours", "Chlo\u00e9", ""], ["Roschger", "Andreas", ""], ["Roschger", "Paul", ""], ["Weinkamer", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.08785", "submitter": "Prabhakar Pradhan", "authors": "Shiva Bhandari, Pradeep Shukla, Huda Almabadi, Peeyush Sahay,\n  Radhakrishna Rao, Prabhakar Pradhan", "title": "Optical study of stress hormone-induced nanoscale structural alteration\n  in brain using partial wave spectroscopic (PWS) microscopy", "comments": "10 Pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Chronic stress affects nano to microscale structures of the brain\ncells/tissues due the suppression of neural growths and reconnections, hence\nthe neuronal activities.
