However, the recent significant technological breakthroughs\nhave inevitably led to technical \"bottlenecks\" for the application of the new\nprocedures to other tasks. We have developed a protocol for the 3D\nreconstruction of plant organelles and tissues from stacks of two-dimensional\nimages obtained by means of a wide range of electron transmission and light\nmicroscopy. This protocol can be applied to a large set of primary data: live,\nfixed or even paleobotanical material. For tissue reconstruction, we have also\ndeveloped a protocol of cell lineage tracing based on the geometrical\nproperties of plant cells. For the tissue sample consisting of $n$ cells, this\napproach allows the reconstruction of up to $n-1$ cell divisions from the\nprevious cell generations. Our protocol complements the limitations of clonal\nanalysis and recent real-time approaches of lineage tracing. It works well in\nthe case of tissues with directed and non-directed growth. Using these\nprotocols, the subcellular relations between the complex surface of plastids\nwith stromules and mitochondria in the tuber parenchyma cells in\n\\textit{Corydalis bracteata} have been revealed. Moreover, for the embryo\n($n=17$) and the seedling shoot apex ($n=208$) of \\textit{Calla palustris}, the\ncellular architecture and full cell genealogy of up to 15 cell generations have\nbeen reconstructed. Three relatively independent cell lineages with stem cells\nlocated at the surface of the shoot apex have been found. The possibility of\nusing a wide range of software, including open-source projects, is discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 17:40:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rudskiy", "Ivan V.", ""], ["Khodorova", "Nadejda V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.2012", "submitter": "Mohammadkarim Saeedghalati", "authors": "Mohammadkarim Saeedghalati, Abdolhossein Abbassian", "title": "The effect of temporal pattern of injury on disability in learning\n  networks", "comments": "Latex, 17 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3389/fncom.2015.00130", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How networks endure damage is a central issue in neural network research.\nThis includes temporal as well as spatial pattern of damage.

The in vitro experiments revealed\nthe high stability of the labelled HSAMMS in saline and human serum after 72 h.\nFollowing the intravenous administration of the 90^Y-HSAMMS in rats, 88.81% of\nthe activity localizes in the lungs after 1 h, with 82.67% remaining after 72\nh.
