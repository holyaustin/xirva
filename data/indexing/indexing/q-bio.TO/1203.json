The branching\nprocess during lung development has been studied in great detail and is\nremarkably stereotyped. The branched tree is generated by the sequential,\nnon-random use of three geometrically simple modes of branching (domain\nbranching, planar and orthogonal bifurcation). While many regulatory components\nand local interactions have been defined an integrated understanding of the\nregulatory network that controls the branching process is lacking. We have\ndeveloped a deterministic, spatio-temporal differential-equation based model of\nthe core signaling network that governs lung branching morphogenesis. The model\nfocuses on the two key signaling factors that have been identified in\nexperiments, fibroblast growth factor (FGF10) and sonic hedgehog (SHH) as well\nas the SHH receptor patched (Ptc). We show that the reported biochemical\ninteractions give rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing patterning mechanisms that\nallows us to reproduce experimental observations in wildtype and mutant mice.\nThe kinetic parameters as well as the domain shape are based on experimental\ndata where available. The developed model is robust to small absolute and large\nrelative changes in the parameter values. At the same time there is a strong\nregulatory potential in that the switching between branching modes can be\nachieved by targeted changes in the parameter values. We note that the sequence\nof different branching events may also be the result of different growth\nspeeds: fast growth triggers lateral branching while slow growth favours\nbifurcations in our model. We conclude that the FGF10-SHH-Ptc1 module is\nsufficient to generate pattern that correspond to the observed branching modes\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 15:22:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Menshykau", "Denis", ""], ["Kraemer", "Conradin", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.4733", "submitter": "Giuseppe Saccomandi", "authors": "Aisling N\\'i Annaidh, Karine Bruy\\`ere, Michel Destrade, Michael D.\n  Gilchrist, Corrado Maurini, Melanie Ott\\'enio and Giuseppe Saccomandi", "title": "Automated Estimation of Collagen Fibre Dispersion in the Dermis and its\n  Contribution to the Anisotropic Behaviour of Skin", "comments": "to appear Annals of Biomedical Engineering", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10439-012-0542-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collagen fibres play an important role in the mechanical behaviour of many\nsoft tissues. Modelling of such tissues now often incorporates a collagen fibre\ndistribution. However, the availability of accurate structural data has so far\nlagged behind the progress of anisotropic constitutive modelling. Here, an\nautomated process is developed to identify the orientation of collagen fibres\nusing inexpensive and relatively simple techniques. The method uses established\nhistological techniques and an algorithm implemented in the MATLAB image\nprocessing toolbox. It takes an average of 15 s to evaluate one image, compared\nto several hours if assessed visually. The technique was applied to\nhistological sections of human skin with different Langer line orientations and\na definite correlation between the orientation of Langer lines and the\npreferred orientation of collagen fibres in the dermis was observed. The\nstructural parameters of the Gasser-Ogden-Holzapfel (GOH) model were all\nsuccessfully evaluated. It is expected that the results of this study will\nassist those wishing to model skin, and that the algorithm described will be of\nbenefit to those who wish to evaluate the collagen dispersion of other soft\ntissues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Mar 2012 13:35:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Annaidh", "Aisling N\u00ed", ""], ["Bruy\u00e8re", "Karine", ""], ["Destrade", "Michel", ""], ["Gilchrist", "Michael D.", ""], ["Maurini", "Corrado", ""], ["Ott\u00e9nio", "Melanie", ""], ["Saccomandi", "Giuseppe", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6257", "submitter": "Gilbert Zalczer", "authors": "Gilbert Zalczer", "title": "Fibonacci numbers in phyllotaxis : a simple model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple model is presented which explains the occurrence of high order\nFibonacci number parastichies in asteracae flowers by two distinct steps.
