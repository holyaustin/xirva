These factors diffuse through the\nextracellular matrix (ECM) and degrade the basement membrane of nearby\nvasculature. The TAFs also disrupt the corresponding endothelial cell receptors\nand form finger like capillary sprouts. These factors also create a chemical\ngradient (chemotaxis) between the tumour and the surrounding blood vessels. Due\nto the chemotactic force, the capillary sprouts migrate towards the tumour. On\nthe other hand, a haptotactic force generated due to fibronectin which is\nsecreted by the endothelial cell, also acts on these sprouts. These sprouts\ngrow through the proliferation of recruited endothelial cells from the parent\nvessels. Tumour angiogenesis is not fully understood yet. In this paper, we use\n2-D cellular automata (CA) model to study the behavior of tumour angiogenesis\nusing both Moore and von-Neumann neighborhood. The CA model also mimics\ncapillary sprout branching and the fusion of two adjacent sprout tips\n(anastomoses). In this simulation, a couple of important points are noted: a)\nno two capillary sprouts are generated from adjacent locations; b) as the\nsprouts approach closer to the tumour, its branching tendency increases; c)\nchemotaxis is the most effective driving force for angiogenesis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 09:17:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2019 16:24:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 6 Nov 2019 10:24:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sadhukhan", "Sounak", ""], ["Basu", "S.

In clinical\npractice, AF is classified under two primary categories: paroxysmal AF, short\nintermittent episodes separated by periods of normal electrical activity, and\npersistent AF, longer uninterrupted episodes of chaotic electrical activity.\nHowever, the precise reasons why AF in a given patient is paroxysmal or\npersistent is poorly understood. Recently, we have introduced the percolation\nbased Christensen-Manani-Peters (CMP) model of AF which naturally exhibits both\nparoxysmal and persistent AF, but precisely how these differences emerge in the\nmodel is unclear. In this paper, we dissect the CMP model to identify the cause\nof these different AF classifications. Starting from a mean-field model where\nwe describe AF as a simple birth-death process, we add layers of complexity to\nthe model and show that persistent AF arises from re-entrant circuits which\nexhibit an asymmetry in their probability of activation relative to\ndeactivation. As a result, different simulations generated at identical model\nparameters can exhibit fibrillatory episodes spanning several orders of\nmagnitude from a few seconds to months. These findings demonstrate that\ndiverse, complex fibrillatory dynamics can emerge from very simple dynamics in\nmodels of AF.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2019 14:34:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 10:16:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ciacci", "Alberto", ""], ["Falkenberg", "Max", ""], ["Manani", "Kishan A.", ""], ["Evans", "Tim S.", ""], ["Peters", "Nicholas S.", ""], ["Christensen", "Kim", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.03332", "submitter": "Nicolas Blondeau", "authors": "Tauskela Joseph S., Blondeau Nicolas (IPMC)", "title": "Requirement for preclinical prioritization of neuroprotective strategies\n  in stroke: Incorporation of preconditioning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Conditioning Medicine, 2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Acute neuroprotection in numerous human clinical trials has been an abject\nfailure. Major systemic-and procedural-based issues have subsequently been\nidentified in both clinical trials and preclinical animal model\nexperimentation. As well, issues related to the neuroprotective moiety itself\nhave contributed to clinical trial failures, including late delivery,\nmono-targeting, low potency and poor tolerability. Conditioning (pre-or post-)\nstrategies can potentially address these issues and are therefore gaining\nincreasing attention as approaches to protect the brain from cerebral ischemia.\nIn principle, conditioning can address concerns of timing (preconditioning\ncould be pre-emptively applied in high-risk patients, and post-conditioning\nafter patients experience an unannounced brain infarction) and signaling\n(multi-modal). However, acute neuroprotection and conditioning strategies face\na common translational issue: a myriad of possibilities exist, but with no\nstrategy to select optimal candidates. In this review, we argue that what is\nrequired is a neuroprotective framework to identify the \"best\" agent(s), at the\nearliest investigational stage possible. This may require switching mindsets\nfrom identifying how neuroprotection can be achieved to determining how\nneuroprotection can fail, for the vast majority of candidates. Understanding\nthe basis for failure can in turn guide supplementary treatment, thereby\nforming an evidence-based rationale for selecting combinations of therapies. An\nappropriately designed in vitro (neuron culture, brain slices) approach, based\non increasing the harshness of the ischemic-like insult, can be useful in\nidentifying the \"best\" conditioner or acute neuroprotective therapy, as well as\nhow the two modalities can be combined to overcome individual limitations.
