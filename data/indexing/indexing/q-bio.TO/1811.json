The traditional\ndiagnostic marker of osteoporosis, bone mineral density (BMD), has been shown\nin ex vivo experiments to correlate poorly with fracture resistance when\nconsidered on its own, while structural features in conjunction with BMD can\nexplain more of the variation in trabecular bone strength. We develop a\nnetwork-based model of trabecular bone by creating graphs from micro-computed\ntomography images of human bone, with weighted links representing trabeculae\nand nodes representing branch points. These graphs enable calculation of\nquantitative network metrics to characterize trabecular structure. We also\ncreate finite element models of the networks in which each link is represented\nby a beam, facilitating analysis of the mechanical response of the bone samples\nto simulated loading. We examine the structural and mechanical properties of\ntrabecular bone at the scale of individual trabeculae (of order 0.1 mm) and at\nthe scale of selected volumes of interest (approximately a few mm), referred to\nas VOIs. At the VOI scale, we find significant correlations between the\nstiffness of VOIs and 10 different structural metrics. Individually, the volume\nfraction of each VOI is most strongly correlated to the stiffness of the VOI.\nWe use multiple linear regression to identify the smallest subset of variables\nneeded to capture the variation in stiffness. In a linear fit, we find that\nnode degree, weighted node degree, Z-orientation, weighted Z-orientation,\ntrabecular spacing, link length, and the number of links are the structural\nmetrics that are most significant (p < 0.05) in capturing the variation of\nstiffness in trabecular networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2018 20:04:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2019 20:33:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Mondal", "Avik", ""], ["Nguyen", "Chantal", ""], ["Ma", "Xiao", ""], ["Elbanna", "Ahmed E.", ""], ["Carlson", "Jean M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.05001", "submitter": "H\\'el\\`ene Delano\\\"e-Ayari Ph.D.", "authors": "S.
