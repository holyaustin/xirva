Slow pathway is driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs.\nAccelerated pathwayis driven by accumulation of PDMs/MECCs/IECC(s). A\ntransformation via slow pathwayoccurs at old age; whereas that via accelerated\npathway occurs at any age. Thus, CML andpediatric AML may develop via\naccelerated pathway, and adult AML may develop via bothpathways. In conclusion,\npediatric AML and CML may develop as a result of transformationof a MC via\naccelerated pathway; and repeated bone-remodeling for bone-growth may be\natrigger for the transformation of a MC in a child.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2018 08:44:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", ""], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas M", ""]]}]
