This procedure\ncombines hyperthermia (tumor heating) with standard radiotherapy to improve\nefficacy of the overall treatment. In addition to directly killing tumor cells,\ntumor heating amends several parameters within the tumor microenvironment. This\nleads to radiosensitization, which improves the performance of radiotherapy\nwhile reducing the side-effects of excess radiation in the surrounding normal\ntissue. Existing tools to model this kind of treatment consider each of the\nphysics separately. The model presented in this paper accounts for the synergy\nbetween hyperthermia and radiotherapy providing a more realistic and holistic\napproach to simulate CHR treatment. Our model couples radiation transport and\nheat-transfer with cell population dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2019 20:46:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Jul 2019 18:36:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Patel", "Japan K.", ""], ["Vasques", "Richard", ""], ["Ganapol", "Barry D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11295", "submitter": "Arti Ahluwalia Dr", "authors": "Ludovica Cacopardo, Joana Costa, Serena Giusti, Lucia Buoncompagni,\n  Sandro Meucci, Alessandro Corti, Giorgio Mattei and Arti Ahluwalia", "title": "Real-time Cellular Impedance Monitoring and Imaging of Biological\n  Barriers in a dual flow membrane bioreactor", "comments": "17 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Here, we present an advanced cell culture system able to\nmimic the dynamic environment of biological barriers while monitoring cell\nbehaviour through real-time impedance measurements and imaging. It consists of\na fluidic device with an apical and a basal flow compartment separated by a\nsemi-permeable membrane. The main features of the device are the integration of\na transepithelial electrical impedance (TEEI) meter and transparent windows for\noptical monitoring within a dual flow system. Caco-2 cells were cultured in the\nTEEI bioreactor under both flow and static conditions. Although no differences\nin the expression of peripheral actin and occludin were visible, the cells in\ndynamic conditions developed higher impedance values at low frequencies,\nindicative of a higher paracellular electrical impedance and thus suggesting\naccelerated barrier and tight junction formation with respect to the static\ncultures. TEEI measurements at high frequency also enabled monitoring the\nevolution of transcellular impedance during culture. The cells subject to flow\nshowed a typical RC behaviour, while the controls showed minimal capacitive\nbehaviour, again highlighting the differences between flow and static\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2019 15:30:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cacopardo", "Ludovica", ""], ["Costa", "Joana", ""], ["Giusti", "Serena", ""], ["Buoncompagni", "Lucia", ""], ["Meucci", "Sandro", ""], ["Corti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Mattei", "Giorgio", ""], ["Ahluwalia", "Arti", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11341", "submitter": "Ahmed Fouad", "authors": "Ahmed M.

The\nreaction-diffusion model [2] that captures the key elements of the hypothesis\nshows how the densities of normal cells, tumor cells, and excess H+ ions change\nwith time due to both chemical reactions between these three populations and\ndensity-dependent diffusion by which they spread out in three-dimensional\nspace. Moreover, it proposes that each cell has an optimal pH for survival;\nthat is, if the local pH deviates from the optimal value in either an acidic or\nalkaline direction, the cells begin to die, and that the death rate saturates\nat some maximum value when the microenvironment is extremely acidic or\nalkaline. We have previously studied in detail how the death-rate functions of\nthe normal and tumor populations depend upon the H+ ion density [4]. Here, we\nextend previous work by investigating how the equilibrium densities (at which\nthe time rates of change of the cellular densities are equal to zero) reached\nby the normal and tumor populations in three-dimensional space are affected by\nthe presence of the H+ ions, and we present detailed analytical and\ncomputational techniques to analyze the dynamical stability of these\nequilibrium densities. For a sample set of biological input parameters and\nwithin the acid-mediation hypothesis, our model predicts the transformation to\na malignant behavior, as indicated by the presence of unstable sets of\nequilibrium densities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2019 18:44:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Fouad", "Ahmed M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.12179", "submitter": "Tom Chou", "authors": "Stephanie M.

To understand how an\ninstance of stress affects the size and \"diversity\" of the peripheral naive T\ncell pool, we derive a mean-field autonomous ODE model of T cell replenishment\nthat allows us to track the clone abundance distribution (the mean number of\ndifferent TCRs each represented by a specific number of cells). We identify\nequilibrium solutions that arise at different rates of T cell production, and\nderive analytic approximations to the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of\nthe problem linearized about these equilibria. From the forms of the\neigenvalues and eigenvectors, we estimate rates at which counts of clones of\ndifferent sizes converge to and depart from equilibrium values--that is, how\nthe number of clones of different sizes \"adjust\" to the changing rate of T cell\nproduction. Under most physiologically realistic realizations of our model, the\ndominant eigenvalue (representing the slowest dynamics of the clone abundance\ndistribution) scales as a power law in the thymic output for low output levels,\nbut saturates at higher T cell production rates. Our analysis provides a\nframework for quantitatively understanding how the clone abundance\ndistributions evolve under small changes in the overall T cell production rate\nby the thymus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2019 02:21:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lewkiewicz", "Stephanie M.", ""], ["Chuang", "Yao-Li", ""], ["Chou", "Tom", ""]]}]
