The goal is essentially to bring Gillespie's\ncelebrated stochastic methodology to the level of an interacting population of\ncells. Specifically, we are interested in how the gold standard of single cell\ncomputational modeling, here taken to be spatial stochastic reaction-diffusion\nmodels, may be efficiently coupled with a similar approach at the cell\npopulation level.\n  Concretely, we target a recently proposed set of pathways for pattern\nformation involving Notch-Delta signaling mechanisms. These involve\ncell-to-cell communication as mediated both via direct membrane contact sites\nas well as via cellular protrusions. We explain how to simulate the process in\ngrowing tissue using a multilevel approach and we discuss implications for\nfuture development of the associated computational methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Feb 2018 21:45:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jun 2018 09:08:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Engblom", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.01375", "submitter": "Yasser A.

The current study aimed\nto explore the existence of this cell type in rabbits. The auricles of adult\nmale white rabbits were harvested and processed for histological examination\nwith light and electron microscopy. With the light microscopy, the auricular\ncartilage of adult rabbits contained central large rounded adipocyte-like\nchondrocytes, termed in the current study adipochondrocytes The\nadipochondrocytes were embedded in relatively wide lacunae and had large lipid\ndroplets with a rim of cytoplasm. The scanning electron microscopy confirmed\nthis result. With the transmission electron microscopy, the adipochondrocytes\nshowed dark nucleus and electron-dense cytoplasm with few organelles and\ncytoplasmic processes. The adipochondrocytes of the auricular cartilage in\nadult rabbits were unique cell type and different from chondrocytes in other\ncartilage subtypes. This result should be considered during cartilage\ntransplant. Further studies are suggested to investigate the development and\nphysiological roles of adipochondrocytes in the auricular cartilage in rabbits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 13:11:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmed", "Yasser A.", ""], ["Abdelsabour-Khalaf", "Mohammed", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.01496", "submitter": "Konstantinos Aronis", "authors": "Konstantinos N.

An key element for in-vivo measurements and extrapolations is\nthe dependence of shear stress on body mass. In the case of a Poiseuille\nmodeling of the blood flow, P. Weinberg and C. Ethier have shown that shear\nstress on the aortic endothelium varies like body mass to the power\n$-\\frac{3}{8}$, and is therefore 20-fold higher in mice than in men. However,\nby considering a more physiological oscillating Poiseuille + Womersley\ncombinated flow in the aorta, we show that results differ notably: at larger\nmasses ($M>10 \\ kg$) shear stress varies as body mass to the power\n$-\\frac{1}{8}$ and modifies the man to mouse ratio to 1:8. The allometry and\nvalues of temporal gradient of shear stress also change: $\\partial\\tau/\\partial\nt$ varies as $M^{-3/8}$ instead of $M^{-5/8}$ at larger masses, and the 1:150\nratio from man to mouse becomes 1:61. Lastly, we show that the unsteady\ncomponent of blood flow does not influence the constant allometry of peak\nvelocity on body mass: $u_{max} \\propto M^{0}$.

This\nsuggestion has become a part of the accepted paradigm on soil toxicity.\nConsequently, stringent fertilizer control programs to monitor Cd have been\nlaunched. Attempts to link Cd toxicity and fertilizers to chronic diseases are\ncommon. A re-assessment of this \"accepted\" paradigm is timely, given the larger\nbody of data available today. The data show that both the input and output of\nCd per hectare from fertilizers are negligibly small compared to the total\namount of Cd/hectare usually present in the soil itself. Calculations based on\ncurrent agricultural practices are used to show that it will take about 18\ncenturies to double the ambient soil-cadmium level, and about 8 centuries to\ndouble the soil-fluoride level, even after neglecting leaching and other\nremoval effects. Hence the concern of long-term agriculture should be the\ndepletion of available phosphate fertilizers, rather than the contamination of\nthe soil by trace metals or fluoride. This conclusion is confirmed by showing\nthat the claimed correlations between fertilizer input and cadmium accumulation\nin crops are not robust. Alternative scenarios that explain the data are\nexamined. Thus soil acidulation on fertilizer loading, and the effect of\nmagnesium, zinc, and fluoride ions contained in fertilizers are considered\nusing recent Cd$^{2+}$, Mg$^{2+}$ and F$^-$ ion-association theories. The\nprotective role of ions like Zn, Se, Fe, etc., is emphasized, and the question\nof cadmium toxicity in the presence of other ions is considered. These help to\nclarify and rectify difficulties found in the standard point of view. This\nanalysis does not modify the accepted views on Cd contamination by airborne\ndelivery, smoking, and industrial activity, or P-contamination causing algal\nblooms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 18:40:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 20:16:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 23:48:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Dharma-wardana", "M.

Clinical trials for\nsepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single\ncurrently FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an\neffective cytokine mediation treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously\ndeveloped agent-based model that simulates the innate immune response to\ninfection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous\nattempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM\nhave failed to reduce mortality across all patient parameterizations and\nmotivated us to investigate whether adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine\nmediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient mortality. We\nused the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient\nmeasurements are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep\nreinforcement learning, we identified a policy that achieves 0% mortality on\nthe patient parameterization on which it was trained. More importantly, this\npolicy also achieves 0.8% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient\nparameterizations with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99% (with an\naverage of 49%) spanning the entire clinically plausible parameter space of the\nIIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine\nmediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope\nthat this work motivates researchers to consider such an approach as part of\nfuture clinical trials.
