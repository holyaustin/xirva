We performed over 500\ncardiovascular experiments using clinical autonomic tests on 72 subjects\nranging from 11 to 82 years old and collected typical cardiovascular signals\nsuch as electrocardiogram, arterial pulse, arterial blood pressure, respiration\npattern, galvanic skin response and skin temperature.

Results bring evidences supporting\nthe hypothesis that Mayer waves result from a rhythmic sympathetic discharge of\npacemaker-like sympathetic premotor neurons. Simulation also shows that\nvagally-mediated tachycardia, observed during vagal maneuvers on some subjects\ncould be related to the secretion of vasoactive neurotransmitters by the vagal\nnerve. We additionally identified model parameters for estimating the resting\nsympathetic and parasympathetic tone which are believed to be linked to some\npathological states. Results show higher vagal tone on young subjects with a\ndecreasing trend with aging, what agrees with the data from heart rate\nvariability studies. Tonic sympathetic activity was found to possibly emerge\nfrom pacemaker premotor neurons, but also from activation of chemoreceptors to\na lesser extent.

Delayed treatment of the involved\npatients results in collapse of the femoral head, which leads to a need for\ntotal hip arthroplasty surgery. Core decompression, as the most popular\ntechnique for treatment of the osteonecrosis, includes removal of the lesion\narea by drilling a straight tunnel to the lesion, debriding the dead bone and\nreplacing it with bone substitutes. However, there are two drawbacks for this\ntreatment method. First, due to the rigidity of the instruments currently used\nduring core decompression, lesions cannot be completely removed and/or\nexcessive healthy bone may also be removed with the lesion. Second, the use of\nbone substitutes, despite its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity, may not\nprovide sufficient mechanical strength and support for the bone. To address\nthese shortcomings, a novel robot-assisted curved core decompression (CCD)\ntechnique is introduced to provide surgeons with direct access to the lesions\ncausing minimal damage to the healthy bone. In this study, with the aid of\nfinite element (FE) simulations, we investigate biomechanical performance of\ncore decompression using the curved drilling technique in the presence of\nnormal gait loading. In this regard, we compare the result of the CCD using\nbone substitutes and flexible implants with other conventional core\ndecompression techniques.

Here, we present a novel glucose prediction algorithm which, in\naddition to standard inputs, accounts for meal absorption and physical exercise\ninformation to enhance prediction accuracy. Methods: a compartmental model of\nglucose-insulin dynamics combined with a deconvolution technique for state\nestimation is employed for glucose prediction. In silico data corresponding\nfrom the 10 adult subjects of UVa-Padova simulator, and clinical data from 10\nadults with T1D were used. Finally, a comparison against a validated glucose\nprediction algorithm based on a latent variable with exogenous input (LVX)\nmodel is provided. Results: For a prediction horizon of 60 minutes, accounting\nfor meal absorption and physical exercise improved glucose forecasting\naccuracy. In particular, root mean square error (mg/dL) went from 26.68 to\n23.89, p<0.001 (in silico data); and from 37.02 to 35.96, p<0.001 (clinical\ndata - only meal information). Such improvement in accuracy was translated into\nsignificant improvements on hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia prediction.\nFinally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is statistically superior to\nthat of the LVX algorithm (26.68 vs. 32.80, p<0.001 (in silico data); 37.02 vs.\n49.17, p<0.01 (clinical data).

Although a\nsingle-cell behavior, EADs can lead to tissue-level arrhythmias, including\nventricular tachycardia. Much is currently known about the biophysical\nmechanisms (i.e., the roles of ion channels and intracellular calcium stores)\nfor EADs, due partially to the development and analysis of mathematical models.\nThis includes the application of slow/fast analysis, which takes advantage of\ntimescale separation inherent in the system to simplify its analysis.
