The characteristic feature of these systems is the absence of\nany governing center and, thereby, their self-regulation is based on a\ncooperative interaction of all the elements. The work develops a mathematical\ntheory of a vascular network response to local effects on scales of individual\nunits of peripheral circulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2009 18:07:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lubashevsky", "Wassily", ""], ["Lubashevsky", "Ihor", ""], ["Mahnke", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5231", "submitter": "Andrea Tosin", "authors": "Andrea Tosin", "title": "Initial/boundary-value problems of tumor growth within a host tissue", "comments": "30 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

Models specialize in nonlinear systems of possibly\ndegenerate parabolic equations, which include phenomenological terms related to\nspecific cell functions. The paper discusses general modeling guidelines for\nsuch terms, as well as for initial and boundary conditions, aiming at both\nbiological consistency and mathematical robustness of the resulting problems.\nParticularly, it addresses some qualitative properties such as a priori\nnonnegativity, boundedness, and uniqueness of the solutions. Existence of the\nsolutions is studied in the one-dimensional time-independent case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2009 10:15:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 17 Jul 2011 12:53:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tosin", "Andrea", ""]]}]
