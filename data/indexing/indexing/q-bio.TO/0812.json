The characteristic feature of these systems is the absence of\nany governing center and, thereby, their self-regulation is based on a\ncooperative interaction of all the elements. The paper develops a mathematical\ntheory of a vascular network response to local effects on scales of individual\nunits of peripheral circulation.\n  First, it formulates a model for the self-processing of information about the\ncellular tissue state and cooperative interaction of blood vessels governing\nredistribution of blood flow over the vascular network. Mass conservation\n(conservation of blood flow as well as transported biochemical compounds) plays\nthe key role in implementing these processes. The vascular network is\nconsidered to be of the tree form and the blood vessels are assumed to respond\nindividually to an activator in blood flowing though them.\n  Second, the constructed governing equations are analyzed numerically. It is\nshown that at the first approximation the blood perfusion rate depends locally\non the activator concentration in the cellular tissue, which is due to the\nhierarchical structure of the vascular network. Then the distinction between\nthe reaction threshold of individual vessels and that of the vascular network\nas a whole is demonstrated. In addition, the nonlocal component of the\ndependence of the blood perfusion rate on the activator concentration is found\nto change its form as the activator concentration increases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2008 17:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Lubashevsky", "Wassily", ""], ["Lubashevsky", "Ihor", ""], ["Mahnke", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.0666", "submitter": "Stephane Gerbi", "authors": "Christian Bourdarias (LM-Savoie), St\\'ephane Gerbi (LM-Savoie),\n  Jacques Ohayon (TIMC)", "title": "A pseudo active kinematic constraint for a biological living soft\n  tissue: an effect of the collagen network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP physics.class-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent studies in mammalian hearts show that left ventricular wall thickening\nis an important mechanism for systolic ejection and that during contraction the\ncardiac muscle develops significant stresses in the muscular cross-fiber\ndirection.

When a block of biological soft tissue is subjected to large\nshear, it is likely that its surface in the plane of shear will buckle\n(apparition of wrinkles). One factor that distinguishes soft tissues from\nrubber-like solids is the presence -- sometimes visible to the naked eye -- of\noriented collagen fibre bundles, which are stiffer than the elastin matrix into\nwhich they are embedded but are nonetheless flexible and extensible. Here we\nshow that the simplest model of isotropic nonlinear elasticity, namely the\nincompressible neo-Hookean model, suffers surface instability in shear only at\ntremendous amounts of shear, i.e., above 3.09, which corresponds to a 72\ndegrees angle of shear. Next we incorporate a family of parallel fibres in the\nmodel and show that the resulting solid can be either reinforced or strongly\nweakened with respect to surface instability, depending on the angle between\nthe fibres and the direction of shear, and depending on the ratio E/mu between\nthe stiffness of the fibres and that of the matrix. For this ratio we use\nvalues compatible with experimental data on soft tissues. Broadly speaking, we\nfind that the surface becomes rapidly unstable when the shear takes place\n\"against\" the fibres, and that as E/mu increases, so does the sector of angles\nwhere early instability is expected to occur.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2008 23:17:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Destrade", "M.", ""], ["Gilchrist", "M.

A theory encompassing temporal and\nspatial domains of local and collective aspects of the system is essential to\ntackle these questions. Our delayed coupling theory achieves this by\nrepresenting the PSM as an array of phase oscillators, combining four key\nelements: a frequency profile of oscillators slowing across the PSM; coupling\nbetween neighboring oscillators; delay in coupling; and a moving boundary\ndescribing embryonic axis elongation. This theory predicts that the\nsegmentation clock's collective period depends on delayed coupling. We derive\nan expression for pattern wavelength across the PSM and show how this can be\nused to fit dynamic wildtype gene-expression patterns, revealing the\nquantitative values of parameters controlling spatial and temporal organization\nof the oscillators in the system. Our theory can be used to analyze\nexperimental perturbations, thereby identifying roles of genes involved in\nsegmentation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2008 14:02:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Morelli", "Luis G.", ""], ["Ares", "Saul", ""], ["Herrgen", "Leah", ""], ["Schroeter", "Christian", ""], ["Julicher", "Frank", ""], ["Oates", "Andrew C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3898", "submitter": "Spyros Yannopoulos N.", "authors": "Spyros N.
