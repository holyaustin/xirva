The theory is based on the solution of the\none-dimensional diffusion equation on a simplified model of lung septum. Gases\ndissolved into different compartments of the lung are all treated separately\nwith physiologically important parameters. The model can be applied in magnetic\nresonance of hyperpolarized xenon for quantification of lung parameters such as\nsurface-to-volume ratio and the air-blood barrier thickness. In general this\nmodel provides a description of a broad range of biological exchange processes\nthat are driven by diffusion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Aug 2010 04:35:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Yulin V.", ""]]}]
