Many attempts have been made to model this\nbehaviour in biology, chemistry and physics. Using the theory of finite\nelasticity, Rodriguez has postulated a multiplicative decomposition of the\ngeometric deformation gradient into a growth-induced part and an elastic one\nneeded to ensure compatibility of the body. In order to fully explore the\nconsequences of this hypothesis, the equations describing thin elastic objects\nunder finite growth are derived. Under appropriate scaling assumptions for the\ngrowth rates, the proposed model is of the Foppl-von Karman type. As an\nillustration, the circumferential growth of a free hyperelastic disk is\nstudied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 16:21:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dervaux", "Julien", ""], ["Amar", "Martine Ben", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4001", "submitter": "Marat Akhmet", "authors": "M.U.

One of its primary functions is matter transport among\ndifferent parts of the organism including tissue supplying with oxygen, carbon\ndioxide excretion, drug propagation etc. Forecasting of these processes under\nnormal conditions and in the presence of different pathologies like\natherosclerosis, loss of blood, anatomical abnormalities, pathological changing\nin chemical transformations and others is significant issue for many\nphysiologists. In this connection should be pointed out that global processes\nare of special interest as they include feedbacks and interdependences among\ndifferent regions of the organism. Thus the main goal of this work is to\ndevelop the model allowing to describe effectively blood flow in the whole\norganism. As we interested in global processes the models of the four vascular\ntrees (arterial and venous parts of systemic and pulmonary circulation) must be\nclosed with heart and peripheral circulation models. As one of the model\napplications the processes of the blood loss is considered in the end of the\npaper.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2007 11:38:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kholodov", "A.
