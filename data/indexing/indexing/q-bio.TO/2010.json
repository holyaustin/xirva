A key area of importance is\ncardiovascular deconditioning, that is, the collection of hemodynamic changes -\nfrom blood volume shift and reduction to altered cardiac function - induced by\nsustained presence in microgravity. A thorough grasp of the 0G adjustment point\nper se is important from a physiological viewpoint and fundamental for\nastronauts' safety and physical capability on long spaceflights. However,\nhemodynamic details of cardiovascular deconditioning are incomplete,\ninconsistent and poorly measured to date; thus a computational approach can be\nquite valuable. We present a validated 1D-0D multiscale model to study the\ncardiovascular response to long-term 0G spaceflight in comparison to the 1G\nsupine reference condition. Cardiac work, oxygen consumption and contractility\nindexes, as well as central mean and pulse pressures were reduced, augmenting\nthe cardiac deconditioning scenario. Exercise tolerance of a spaceflight\ntraveler was found to be comparable to an untrained person with a sedentary\nlifestyle. At the capillary-venous level significant waveform alterations were\nobserved which can modify the regular perfusion and average nutrient supply at\nthe cellular level. The present study suggests special attention should be paid\nto future long spaceflights which demand prompt physical capacity at the time\nof restoration of partial gravity (e.g., Moon/Mars landing). Since spaceflight\ndeconditioning has features similar to accelerated aging understanding\ndeconditioning mechanisms in microgravity are also relevant to the\nunderstanding of aging physiology on Earth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 17:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gallo", "Caterina", ""], ["Ridolfi", "Luca", ""], ["Scarsoglio", "Stefania", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.02346", "submitter": "Alexander Kaiser", "authors": "Alexander D.

As much as possible, the model\nconstruction is based on first principles, but such that the model is\nconsistent with experimental observations. We require that tension in the\nleaflets must support a pressure, then derive a system of partial differential\nequations governing its mechanical equilibrium. The solution to these\ndifferential equations is referred to as the predicted loaded configuration; it\nincludes the loaded leaflet geometry, fiber orientations and tensions needed to\nsupport the prescribed load. From this configuration, we derive a reference\nconfiguration and constitutive law. In fluid-structure interaction simulations\nwith the immersed boundary method, the model seals reliably under physiological\npressures, and opens freely over multiple cardiac cycles. Further, model\nclosure is robust to extreme hypo- and hypertensive pressures. Then, exploiting\nthe unique features of this model construction, we conduct experiments on\nreference configurations, constitutive laws, and gross morphology. These\nexperiments suggest the following conclusions, which are directly applicable to\nthe design of prosthetic aortic valves. (i) The loaded geometry, tensions and\ntangent moduli primarily determine model function. (ii) Alterations to the\nreference configuration have little effect if the predicted loaded\nconfiguration is identical. (iii) The leaflets must have sufficiently nonlinear\nmaterial response to function over a variety of pressures. (iv) Valve\nperformance is highly sensitive to free edge length and leaflet height.

This\nwork aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus\nimprove the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep\nlearning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature\nengineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a\ncombination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed\nmartial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can\ncalculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in\nless than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a\nstandard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and\nmodel initialization).

We\ndemonstrate results from our inference method on a cohort of twenty virtual\nsubjects with cardiac volumes ranging from 74 cm3 to 171 cm3 and considering\nlow versus high resolution for the endocardial discretisation (which determines\npossible locations of the earliest activation sites). Results show that our\nmethod can successfully infer the ventricular activation properties from\nnon-invasive data, with higher accuracy for earliest activation sites,\nendocardial speed, and sheet (transmural) speed in sinus rhythm, rather than\nthe fibre or sheet-normal speeds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 20:25:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Camps", "Julia", ""], ["Lawson", "Brodie", ""], ["Drovandi", "Christopher", ""], ["Minchole", "Ana", ""], ["Wang", "Zhinuo Jenny", ""], ["Grau", "Vicente", ""], ["Burrage", "Kevin", ""], ["Rodriguez", "Blanca", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16260", "submitter": "Emma Lejeune", "authors": "Emma Lejeune and Bill Zhao", "title": "Exploring the potential of transfer learning for metamodels of\n  heterogeneous material deformation", "comments": "9 figures, 35 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO cs.LG physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  From the nano-scale to the macro-scale, biological tissue is spatially\nheterogeneous. Even when tissue behavior is well understood, the exact subject\nspecific spatial distribution of material properties is often unknown. And,\nwhen developing computational models of biological tissue, it is usually\nprohibitively computationally expensive to simulate every plausible spatial\ndistribution of material properties for each problem of interest. Therefore,\none of the major challenges in developing accurate computational models of\nbiological tissue is capturing the potential effects of this spatial\nheterogeneity. Recently, machine learning based metamodels have gained\npopularity as a computationally tractable way to overcome this problem because\nthey can make predictions based on a limited number of direct simulation runs.\nThese metamodels are promising, but they often still require a high number of\ndirect simulations to achieve an acceptable performance. Here we show that\ntransfer learning, a strategy where knowledge gained while solving one problem\nis transferred to solving a different but related problem, can help overcome\nthis limitation. Critically, transfer learning can be used to leverage both\nlow-fidelity simulation data and simulation data that is the outcome of solving\na different but related mechanical problem. In this paper, we extend Mechanical\nMNIST, our open source benchmark dataset of heterogeneous material undergoing\nlarge deformation, to include a selection of low-fidelity simulation results\nthat require 2-4 orders of magnitude less CPU time to run. Then, we show that\ntransferring the knowledge stored in metamodels trained on these low-fidelity\nsimulation results can vastly improve the performance of metamodels used to\npredict the results of high-fidelity simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 12:43:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Lejeune", "Emma", ""], ["Zhao", "Bill", ""]]}]
