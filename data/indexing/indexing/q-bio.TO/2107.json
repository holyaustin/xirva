Differences in\nchoriocapillaris flow area percentage between SFD patients and controls were\ndetermined and a structure-function correlation with outer retinal layer\nthicknesses were analyzed based on mixed model analysis. Results: SFD patients\nexhibited a significantly greater choriocapillaris FDs area percentage than\ncontrols (estimate [95% CI] 32.05% [24.31-39.80] vs. 23.36% [20.64-26.09],\nP<0.001), even when adjusting for age.

Similar pathology image search offers the opportunity to comb\nthrough large historical repositories of gigapixel WSIs to identify cases with\nsimilar morphological features and can be particularly useful for diagnosing\nrare diseases, identifying similar cases for predicting prognosis, treatment\noutcomes, and potential clinical trial success. A critical challenge in\ndeveloping a WSI search and retrieval system is scalability, which is uniquely\nchallenging given the need to search a growing number of slides that each can\nconsist of billions of pixels and are several gigabytes in size. Such systems\nare typically slow and retrieval speed often scales with the size of the\nrepository they search through, making their clinical adoption tedious and are\nnot feasible for repositories that are constantly growing. Here we present Fast\nImage Search for Histopathology (FISH), a histology image search pipeline that\nis infinitely scalable and achieves constant search speed that is independent\nof the image database size while being interpretable and without requiring\ndetailed annotations. FISH uses self-supervised deep learning to encode\nmeaningful representations from WSIs and a Van Emde Boas tree for fast search,\nfollowed by an uncertainty-based ranking algorithm to retrieve similar WSIs. We\nevaluated FISH on multiple tasks and datasets with over 22,000 patient cases\nspanning 56 disease subtypes. We additionally demonstrate that FISH can be used\nto assist with the diagnosis of rare cancer types where sufficient cases may\nnot be available to train traditional supervised deep models. FISH is available\nas an easy-to-use, open-source software package\n(https://github.com/mahmoodlab/FISH).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Jul 2021 18:15:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Chengkuan", ""], ["Lu", "Ming Y.", ""], ["Williamson", "Drew F.
