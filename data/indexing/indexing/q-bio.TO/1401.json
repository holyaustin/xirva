We\nstudy the fine temporal structure of this synchrony in healthy young, healthy\nelderly, and elderly subjects with coronary artery disease. We employ novel\ntime-series analysis to explore how phases of oscillations go in and out of the\nphase-locked state at each cycle of oscillations. For the first time we show\nthat cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a\nvery specific temporal patterning of synchrony: the oscillations go out of\nsynchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually\nwithin just one cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the\nage and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher\n(1:4) frequency-locking ratio between respiratory and cardiac rhythms, while\nsubjects with coronary artery disease exhibited relatively more 1:2 synchrony.\nHowever, multiple short desynchronization episodes prevailed regardless of age\nand disease status. The same average synchrony level could alternatively be\nachieved with few long desynchronizations, but this was not observed in the\ndata. This implies functional importance of short desynchronizations dynamics.\nThese dynamics suggest that a synchronous state is easy to create if needed,\nbut is also easy to break. Short desynchronizations dynamics may facilitate the\nmutual coordination of cardiac and respiratory rhythms by creating intermittent\nsynchronous episodes. It may be an efficient background dynamics to promote\nadaptation of cardiorespiratory coordination to various external and internal\nfactors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 17:31:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ahn", "Sungwoo", ""], ["Solfest1", "Jessica", ""], ["Rubchinsky", "Leonid L", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.5701", "submitter": "Fabian Spill", "authors": "Fabian Spill, Pilar Guerrero, Tomas Alarcon, Philip K.

In\nthis paper, we propose a mesoscopic lattice-based model of angiogenesis, in\nwhich processes that include proliferation and cell movement are considered as\nstochastic events. By studying the dependence of the model on the lattice\nspacing and the number of cells involved, we are able to derive the\ndeterministic continuum limit of our equations and compare it to similar\nexisting models of angiogenesis. We further identify conditions under which the\nuse of continuum models is justified, and others for which stochastic or\ndiscrete effects dominate. We also compare different stochastic models for the\nmovement of endothelial tip cells which have the same macroscopic,\ndeterministic behaviour, but lead to markedly different behaviour in terms of\nproduction of new vessel cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:15:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Spill", "Fabian", ""], ["Guerrero", "Pilar", ""], ["Alarcon", "Tomas", ""], ["Maini", "Philip K.", ""], ["Byrne", "Helen M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7497", "submitter": "Deepak Mathur", "authors": "Uma Ladiwala, Aseefhali Bankapur, Bhushan Thakur, Chidangil Santhosh,\n  and Deepak Mathur", "title": "Raman spectroscopic detection of rapid, reversible, early-stage\n  inflammatory cytokine-induced apoptosis of adult hippocampal progenitors/stem\n  cells", "comments": "Keywords: neural stem cell, Raman spectroscopy, cytokine, apoptosis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph physics.med-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The role of neuro-inflammation in diverse, acute and chronic brain\npathologies is being increasingly recognized. Neuro-inflammation is accompanied\nby increased levels of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines; these have\ndeleterious as well as protective/reparative effects. Inflammation has varying\neffects on neurogenesis and is a subject of intense contemporary interest. We\nshow that TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, used concomitantly, cause apoptosis of adult\nrat hippocampal progenitor/stem cells in vitro as detected by the TUNEL and MTT\nassays on time scales of several hours. We have coupled Raman spectroscopy to\nan optical trap to probe early changes of apoptosis in single, live neural stem\ncells that have been treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha and\nIFN-gamma. Changes caused by inflammation-induced denaturation of DNA are\nobserved in the Raman spectra that correspond to very early stages of\napoptosis, occurring on very fast time scales: as short as 10 minutes. Addition\nof the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 either 10-30 min before or 10-30 min\nafter treatment with TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reverses the changes\nsubstantially. Our findings imply that inflammation can induce very rapid\nchanges leading to cell death but that these are reversible, in the early\nstages at least.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 12:52:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ladiwala", "Uma", ""], ["Bankapur", "Aseefhali", ""], ["Thakur", "Bhushan", ""], ["Santhosh", "Chidangil", ""], ["Mathur", "Deepak", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7567", "submitter": "Philipp Germann", "authors": "Dagmar Iber and Philipp Germann", "title": "How do digits emerge? - Mathematical Models of Limb Development", "comments": "Review", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The mechanism that controls digit formation has long intrigued developmental\nand theoretical biologists, and many different models and mechanisms have been\nproposed.
