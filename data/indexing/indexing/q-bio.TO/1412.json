Clinically,\nit is a challenge to determine whether resistance arises prior to, or as a\nresult of, cancer therapy. Further, a number of different intracellular and\nmicroenvironmental factors have been correlated with the emergence of drug\nresistance. With the goal of better understanding drug resistance and its\nconnection with the tumor microenvironment, we have developed a hybrid\ndiscrete-continuous mathematical model. In this model, cancer cells described\nthrough a particle-spring approach respond to dynamically changing oxygen and\nDNA damaging drug concentrations described through partial differential\nequations. We thoroughly explored the behavior of our self-calibrated model\nunder the following common conditions: a fixed layout of the vasculature, an\nidentical initial configuration of cancer cells, the same mechanism of drug\naction, and one mechanism of cellular response to the drug. We considered one\nset of simulations in which drug resistance existed prior to the start of\ntreatment, and another set in which drug resistance is acquired in response to\ntreatment. This allows us to compare how both kinds of resistance influence the\nspatial and temporal dynamics of the developing tumor, and its clonal\ndiversity. We show that both pre-existing and acquired resistance can give rise\nto three biologically distinct parameter regimes: successful tumor eradication,\nreduced effectiveness of drug during the course of treatment (resistance), and\ncomplete treatment failure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 04:17:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gevertz", "Jana L.", ""], ["Aminzare", "Zahra", ""], ["Norton", "Kerri-Ann", ""], ["Perez-Velazquez", "Judith", ""], ["Volkening", "Alexandria", ""], ["Rejniak", "Katarzyna A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.1272", "submitter": "Henrik Ronellenfitsch", "authors": "Henrik Ronellenfitsch, Johannes Liesche, Kaare H.

The phloem is an\nintricate distribution system, and many questions about its regulation and\nstructural diversity remain unanswered. Here, we investigate the phloem\nstructure in the simplest possible geometry: a linear leaf, found, for example,\nin the needles of conifer trees. We measure the phloem structure in four tree\nspecies representing a diverse set of habitats and needle sizes, from 1 cm\n(\\textit{Picea omorika}) to 35 cm (\\textit{Pinus palustris}). We show that the\nphloem shares common traits across these four species and find that the size of\nits conductive elements obeys a power law. We present a minimal model that\naccounts for these common traits and takes into account the transport strategy\nand natural constraints. This minimal model predicts a power law phloem\ndistribution consistent with transport energy minimization, suggesting that\nenergetics are more important than translocation speed at the leaf level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 11:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ronellenfitsch", "Henrik", ""], ["Liesche", "Johannes", ""], ["Jensen", "Kaare H.", ""], ["Holbrook", "N.

The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a commonly used animal model,\nwith roughly an 80% incidence rate of T1D among females. In 100% of NOD mice,\nmacrophages and T-cells invade the islets in a process called insulitis. It can\nbe several weeks between insulitis and T1D, and some mice do not progress at\nall. It is thought that this delay is mediated by regulatory T-cells (Tregs)\nand that a gradual loss of effectiveness in this population leads to T1D.\nHowever, this does not explain why some mice progress and others do not. We\npropose a simple mathematical model of the interaction between beta cells and\nthe immune populations, including regulatory T-cells. We find that individual\nmice may enter one of two stable steady states: a `mild' insulitis state that\ndoes not progress to T1D and a `severe' insulitis state that does.
