The concentration of AMH in blood may also reflect the non-growing\nfollicle (NGF) population, i.e. the ovarian reserve, and be of value in\npredicting reproductive lifespan. A full description of AMH production up to\nthe menopause has not been reported. Methodology/Principal Findings: By\nsearching the published literature for AMH concentrations in healthy\npre-menopausal females, and using our own data (combined n = 3,260) we have\ngenerated and robustly validated the first model of AMH concentration from\nconception to menopause. This model shows that 34% of the variation in AMH is\ndue to age alone. We have shown that AMH peaks at age 24.5 years, followed by a\ndecline to the menopause. We have also shown that there is a neonatal peak and\na potential pre-pubertal peak. Our model allows us to generate normative data\nat all ages. Conclusions/Significance: These data highlight key inflection\npoints in ovarian follicle dynamics. This first validated model of circulating\nAMH in healthy females describes a transition period in early adulthood, after\nwhich AMH reflects the progressive loss of the NGF pool. The existence of a\nneonatal increase in gonadal activity is confirmed for females. An improved\nunderstanding of the relationship between circulating AMH and age will lead\nmore accurate assessment of ovarian reserve for the individual woman.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jun 2011 16:00:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kelsey", "T W", ""], ["Wright", "P", ""], ["Nelson", "S M", ""], ["Anderson", "R A", ""], ["Wallace", "W H B", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.1382", "submitter": "Tom Kelsey", "authors": "W H B Wallace and T W Kelsey", "title": "Human ovarian reserve from conception to the menopause", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008772", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The human ovary contains a fixed number of non-growing follicles (NGFs)\nestablished before birth that decline with increasing age culminating in the\nmenopause at 50-51 years. The objective of this study is to model the\nage-related population of NGFs in the human ovary from conception to menopause.\nData were taken from eight separate quantitative histological studies (n = 325)\nin which NGF populations at known ages from seven weeks post conception to 51\nyears (median 32 years) were calculated. The data set was fitted to 20 peak\nfunction models, with the results ranked by obtained r2 correlation\ncoefficient. The highest ranked model was chosen. Our model matches the\nlog-adjusted NGF population from conception to menopause to a five-parameter\nasymmetric double Gaussian cumulative (ADC) curve (r2 = 0.81). When restricted\nto ages up to 25 years, the ADC curve has r2 = 0.95. We estimate that for 95%\nof women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF\npopulation is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. Furthermore,\nwe found that the rate of NGF recruitment towards maturation for most women\nincreases from birth until approximately age 14 years then decreases towards\nthe menopause. To our knowledge, this is the first model of ovarian reserve\nfrom conception to menopause. This model allows us to estimate the number of\nNGFs present in the ovary at any given age, suggests that 81% of the variance\nin NGF populations is due to age alone, and shows for the first time, to our\nknowledge, that the rate of NGF recruitment increases from birth to age 14\nyears then declines with age until menopause. An increased understanding of the\ndynamics of human ovarian reserve will provide a more scientfic basis for\nfertility counselling for both healthy women and those who have survived\ngonadotoxic cancer treatments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jun 2011 16:00:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Wallace", "W H B", ""], ["Kelsey", "T W", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.3162", "submitter": "Jan Buytaert", "authors": "Jan A.N.

To date, micro-scale\nX-ray computed tomography (\\mu CT) recordings have been used as geometric input\ndata for FEM models of the ME ossicles. Previously, attempts were made to\nobtain this data on ME soft tissue structures as well. However, due to low\nX-ray absorption of soft tissue, quality of these images is limited. Another\npopular approach is using histological sections as data for 3D models,\ndelivering high in-plane resolution for the sections, but the technique is\ndestructive in nature and registration of the sections is difficult. We combine\ndata from high-resolution \\mu CT recordings with data from high-resolution\northogonal-plane fluorescence optical-sectioning microscopy (OPFOS), both\nobtained on the same gerbil specimen. State-of-the-art \\mu CT delivers\nhigh-resolution data on the three-dimensional shape of ossicles and other ME\nbony structures, while the OPFOS setup generates data of unprecedented quality\nboth on bone and soft tissue ME structures. Each of these techniques is\ntomographic and non-destructive, and delivers sets of automatically aligned\nvirtual sections. The datasets coming from different techniques need to be\nregistered with respect to each other. By combining both datasets, we obtain a\ncomplete high-resolution morphological model of all functional components in\nthe gerbil ME. The resulting three-dimensional model can be readily imported in\nFEM software and is made freely available to the research community. In this\npaper, we discuss the methods used, present the resulting merged model and\ndiscuss morphological properties of the soft tissue structures, such as muscles\nand ligaments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jun 2011 08:26:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Buytaert", "J.
