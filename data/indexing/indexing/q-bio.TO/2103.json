Here, we aimed to identify factors explaining variabilities in CsA PK\nproperties and characterise time-dependent clearance (CL/F) by performing a\ncomprehensive analysis of CsA PK factors using population PK (popPK) modelling\nof long-term follow-up data from our institution. Methods In total, 3,674\nwhole-blood CsA concentrations from 183 patients who underwent initial renal\ntransplantation were analysed using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling. The\neffects of potential covariates were selected according to a previous report\nand well-accepted theoretical mechanisms. Model-informed individualised\ntherapeutic regimens were also conducted. Results A two-compartment model\nadequately described the data and the estimated mean CsA CL/F was 32.6 L h-1\n(5%). Allometrically scaled body size, haematocrit (HCT) level, CGC haplotype\ncarrier status, and postoperative time may contribute to CsA PK variability.\nThe CsA bioavailability in patients receiving a prednisolone dose (PD) of 80 mg\nwas 20.6% lower than that in patients receiving 20 mg. A significant decrease\n(52.6%) in CL/F was observed as the HCT increased from 10.5% to 60.5%. The CL/F\nof the non-CGC haplotype carrier was 14.4% lower than that of the CGC haplotype\ncarrier at 3 months post operation. CsA dose adjustments should be considered\nin different postoperative periods. Conclusions By monitoring body size, HCT,\nPD, and CGC haplotype, changes in CsA CL/F over time could be predicted. Such\ninformation could be used to optimise CsA therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2021 09:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mao", "Junjun", ""], ["Qiu", "Xiaoyan", ""], ["Qin", "Weiwei", ""], ["Xu", "Luyang", ""], ["Zhang", "Ming", ""], ["Zhong", "Mingkang", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.02000", "submitter": "Dimitrios Patsatzis", "authors": "Dimitrios G.

In this work, the dynamics of a\nfundamental model formulating the interactions of tumor cells with natural\nkiller cells, CD8$^+$ T cells and circulating lymphocytes is examined.

Near InfraRed (NIR) light irradiation for inducing hyperthermia is\nparticularly attractive, because biological systems mostly lack chromophores\nthat absorb in this spectral window, facilitating the selective heating and\ndestruction of cells which have internalized the NIR absorbing-nanomaterials.\nHowever, little is known about biological effects accompanying nGO-mediated\nhyperthermiaat cellular and molecular levels.In this work, well-characterised\npegylatednGOsheets with an hydrodynamic size of 300 nm were incubated with\nhuman Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells for 24h and their incorporation verified by\nflow cytometry and confocal microscopy. No effect on cell viability was\nobserved after nGO incorporation by Saos-2 cells. However, a proliferation\ndelay was observed due to the presence of nGO sheets in the cytoplasm.1H NMR\nmetabolomicswas employed to screen for changes in the metabolic profile of\ncells, as this could help to improve understanding of celular responses to\nnanomaterials and provide new endpoint markers of effect.Cells incorporating\nnGO sheets showed noticeable changes in 10 metabolites compared to control\ncells, including decreased levels of several amino acids, taurine and creatine\nand increased levels of phosphocholine and uridine/adenosine nucleotides. After\nNIR irradiation, cells showed decreases in glutamate and uridine nulceotides,\ntogether with increases in glycerophosphocholine and adenosine monophosphate.\nOverall, this study has shown that the celular metabolome sensitively responded\nto nGO exposure and nGO-mediated hyperthermia and that NMR metabolomics is a\npowerful tool toinvestigate treatment responses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Cicuendez", "Monica", ""], ["Flores", "Joana", ""], ["Oliveira", "Helena", ""], ["Portoles", "M.

Incorporating methods of this kind in the research for\ncancer treatment and related drug discovery in particular, is shown to be\nchallenging due to the complexity and the dynamic nature of the related\nfactors. Usually, there are two objectives in such settings; first to calibrate\nthe simulators so as to reproduce real-world cases, and second, to search for\nspecific values of the parameter space concerning effective drug treatments. We\ncombine a multi-scale simulator for tumor cell growth and a Genetic Algorithm\n(GA) as a heuristic search method for finding good parameter configurations in\nreasonable time. The two modules are integrated into a single workflow that can\nbe executed in a parallel manner on high performance computing infrastructures,\nsince large-scale computational and storage capabilities are necessary in this\ndomain. After using the GA for calibration, our goal is to explore different\ndrug delivery schemes. Among these schemes, we aim to find those that minimize\ntumor cell size and the probability of emergence of drug resistant cells in the\nfuture. Results from experiments on high performance computing infrastructure\nillustrate the effectiveness and timeliness of the approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Mar 2021 20:58:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Akasiadis", "Charilaos", ""], ["Ponce-de-Leon", "Miguel", ""], ["Montagud", "Arnau", ""], ["Michelioudakis", "Evangelos", ""], ["Atsidakou", "Alexia", ""], ["Alevizos", "Elias", ""], ["Artikis", "Alexander", ""], ["Valencia", "Alfonso", ""], ["Paliouras", "Georgios", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.15043", "submitter": "Sumit Sinha", "authors": "Sumit Sinha and Abdul N Malmi-Kakkada", "title": "Inter-particle adhesion regulates the surface roughness of growing dense\n  three-dimensional active particle aggregates", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Activity and self-generated motion are fundamental features observed in many\nliving and non-living systems. Given that inter-particle adhesive forces are\nknown to regulate particle dynamics, we investigate how adhesion strength\ncontrols the boundary growth and roughness in an active particle aggregate.\nUsing particle based simulations incorporating both activity (birth, death and\ngrowth) and systematic physical interactions (elasticity and adhesion), we\nestablish that inter-particle adhesion strength ($f^{ad}$) controls the surface\nroughness of a densely packed three-dimensional(3D) active particle aggregate\nexpanding into a highly viscous medium. We discover that the surface roughness\nof a 3D active particle aggregate increases in proportion to the inter-particle\nadhesion strength, $f^{ad}$. We show that asymmetry in the radial and\ntangential active particle mean squared displacement (MSD) suppresses 3D\nsurface roughness at lower adhesion strengths. By analyzing the statistical\nproperties of particle displacements at the aggregate periphery, we determine\nthat the 3D surface roughness is driven by the movement of active particle\ntowards the core at high inter-particle adhesion strengths. Our results\nelucidate the physics controlling the expansion of adhesive 3D active particle\ncollectives into a highly viscous medium, with implications into understanding\nstochastic interface growth in active matter systems characterized by self\ngenerated particle flux.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Mar 2021 04:26:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sinha", "Sumit", ""], ["Malmi-Kakkada", "Abdul N", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.16888", "submitter": "Raymond Goldstein", "authors": "Francesco Boselli, Jerome Jullien, Eric Lauga, and Raymond E.\n  Goldstein", "title": "Fluid mechanics of mosaic ciliated tissues", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures; Supplemental Material (4 pages, 4 figures)\n  included", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn q-bio.TO", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In tissues as diverse as amphibian skin and the human airway, the cilia that\npropel fluid are grouped in sparsely distributed multiciliated cells (MCCs).
