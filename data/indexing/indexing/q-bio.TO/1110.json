A few recent models respect the intra-corneal GRIN, but are\nbased on the paraxial approximation, and thereby have limited validity in\nperipheral visual field analysis and non-paraxial photon tracking. Here, we\nintroduce the Trajectron algorithm. It uses a closed form solution of the ray\nequation of constant axial GRIN media, and evaluates over piece-wise constant\nGRIN. Using Trajectron, we present the first quantitative demonstration of\nnon-paraxial intra-corneal light-bending phenomena. This demonstration has\nsignificant implications in the development of refractive surgery algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Oct 2011 07:21:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Odaibo", "Stephen G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0584", "submitter": "Mikhail Peslyak", "authors": "Mikhail Peslyak", "title": "Model of pathogenesis of psoriasis.

Psoriasis is dermal\nimplication of systemic psoriatic process (SPP). New SPP model explaining\nresults of clinical and laboratory experiments was formulated. According to\nY-model there are two main factors: hyperpermeability of small intestine for\nbacterial products and colonization of its walls by Gram+ bacteria (incl.\npsoriagenic bacteria PsB) and Gram(-) TLR4-active bacteria. Inside SPP there is\na vicious cycle which is supported by disturbance of production and-or\ncirculation of bile acids. SPP central subprocess is PAMP-nemia, namely chronic\nkPAMP-load on blood phagocytes (neutrophiles, monocytes and dendritic cells).\nThe load results in increase of blood kPAMP level. The major key PAMP (kPAMP)\nare LPS and PG (incl. PG-Y - peptidoglycan of psoriagenic bacteria).\nChronically increased kPAMP-load possibly provides tolerization of some\nneutrophils Neu, monocytes Mo and dendritic cells DC in blood flow. The\nchemostatus of tolerized blood Neu-T in process of their aging changes\nsimilarly to chemostatus nonactivated Neu and, hence, they carry endocytosed\ncontent from blood flow into the bone marrow. Chemostatuses of tolerized Mo-T\nand DC-T are similar to nonactivated ones. So they don't bring endocytosed\ncontent to lymph nodes or spleen and remain in blood. Tolerized phagocytes\ndegrade endocytosed fragments of bacterial products containing kPAMP slowly and\nincompletely, Tolerized phagocytes appeared to be (PG-Y)-carriers are named by\nR-phagocytes and are designated as Neu-R, Mo-R and DC-R. SPP severity\npredetermines possibility of psoriasis initialization and maintenance because\nMo-R and DC-R along with normal Mo and DC participate in homeostatic and\ninflammatory renewal of pool of dermal macrophages and DC of non-resident\norigin.

However, there are controversial\nissues about their role in cancer pathogenesis. This study was designed to\nevaluate genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of Carbenoxolone (CBX) as a prototype of\ninter-cellular gap junction blocker in MCF7 and BT20 human breast cancer cells.\nMethods: The MCF7and BT20 human breast cancer cell lines were cultivated, and\ntreated at designated confluency with different doses of CBX. Cellular\ncytotoxicity was examined using standard colorimetric assay associated with\ncell viability tests. Gene expression evaluation was carried out using real\ntime polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: MCF7 and BT20 cells were\nsignificantly affected by CBX in a dose dependent manner in cell viability\nassays. Despite varying expression of genes, down regulation of pro- and\nanti-apoptotic genes was observed in these cells. Conclusion: Based upon this\ninvestigation, it can be concluded that CBX could affect both low and high\nproliferative types of breast cancer cell lines and disproportionate down\nregulation of both pre- and anti-apoptotic genes may be related to interacting\nbiomolecules, perhaps via gap junctions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Oct 2011 07:46:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Asadi-Khiavi", "Masoud", ""], ["Hamzeiy", "Hossein", ""], ["Khani", "Sajjad", ""], ["Nakhlband", "Ailar", ""], ["Barar", "Jaleh", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1725", "submitter": "Mikhail Peslyak", "authors": "Nikolai Korotky, Mikhail Peslyak", "title": "Psoriasis as a consequence of incorporation of beta-streptococci into\n  the microbiocenosis of highly permeable intestines (a pathogenic concept).\n  Russian edition", "comments": "16 pages, 1 figure, in Russian, ISSN 0042-4609, Journal NLM Unique\n  ID: 0414246", "journal-ref": "Vestn Dermatol Venerol 2005; 1: 9-18", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A review of recent investigations into pathogenesis of psoriasis summarizing\ndata on the relationship between the presence beta-streptococci in the organism\nand the cutaneous immune reaction.
