The ground\nbreaking innovations and novel methods help in the early detection, in setting\nthe stages of the therapy and in assessing the response of the patient to the\ntreatment. The prediction of the recurrent cancer is also crucial for the\nsurvival of the patient. This paper studies various techniques used for the\ndiagnosis of breast cancer. Different methods are explored for their merits and\nde-merits for the diagnosis of breast lesion. Some of the methods are yet\nunproven but the studies look very encouraging. It was found that the recent\nuse of the combination of Artificial Neural Networks in most of the instances\ngives accurate results for the diagnosis of breast cancer and their use can\nalso be extended to other diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Jun 2012 18:02:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Beg", "Mahjabeen Mirza", ""], ["Jain", "Monika", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.6071", "submitter": "Pascal Buenzli", "authors": "Pascal R.

Yet, this\ndysregulation of bone remodelling does not occur equally in all bone regions.\nLoss of bone is more pronounced near and at the endocortex, leading to cortical\nwall thinning and medullary cavity expansion, a process sometimes referred to\nas \"trabecularisation\" or \"cancellisation\". Cortical wall thinning is of\nprimary concern in osteoporosis due to the strong deterioration of bone\nmechanical properties that it is associated with. In this paper, we examine the\npossibility that the non-uniformity of microscopic bone surface availability\ncould explain the non-uniformity of bone loss in osteoporosis. We use a\ncomputational model of bone remodelling in which microscopic bone surface\navailability influences bone turnover rate and simulate the evolution of the\nbone volume fraction profile across the midshaft of a long bone. We find that\nbone loss is accelerated near the endocortical wall where the specific surface\nis highest. Over time, this leads to a substantial reduction of cortical wall\nthickness from the endosteum. The associated expansion of the medullary cavity\ncan be made to match experimentally observed cross-sectional data from the\nMelbourne Femur Collection. Finally, we calculate the redistribution of the\nmechanical stresses in this evolving bone structure and show that mechanical\nload becomes critically transferred to the periosteal cortical bone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jun 2012 18:26:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 17:32:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""], ["Thomas", "C.
