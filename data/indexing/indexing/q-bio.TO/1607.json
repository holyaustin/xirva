The disease is congenital and children that do not succumb\nto it during the neonatal period will, by age 10 years, more often than not,\nrequire nephrectomy+renal replacement therapy for management of both pain and\nrenal insufficiency. Since increasing cystic index (CI; percent of kidney\noccupied by cysts) drives both renal expansion and organ dysfunction,\nmanagement of these patients, including decisions such as elective nephrectomy\nand prioritization on the transplant waitlist, could clearly benefit from\nserial determination of CI. So also, clinical trials in ARPKD evaluating the\nefficacy of novel drug candidates could benefit from serial determination of\nCI. Although ultrasound is currently the imaging modality of choice for\ndiagnosis of ARPKD, its utilization for assessing disease progression is highly\nlimited. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography, although more\nreliable for determination of CI, are expensive, time-consuming and somewhat\nimpractical in the pediatric population. Using a well-established mammalian\nmodel of ARPKD, we undertook a big data-like analysis of minimally- or\nnon-invasive serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury/dysfunction to derive a\nfamily of equations for estimating CI. We then applied a signal averaging\nprotocol to distill these equations to a single empirical formula for\ncalculation of CI.

The present work aimed to computationally study how\nphysical conditions imposed by pathologic valvular anatomy act on AF\nhemodynamics. We simulated AF with different severity grades of left-sided\nvalvular diseases and compared the cardiovascular effects that they exert\nduring AF, compared to lone AF. The fluid dynamics model used here has been\nrecently validated for lone AF and relies on a lumped parameterization of the\nfour heart chambers, together with the systemic and pulmonary circulation.\nThree different grades of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analyzed for\neach of the four valvulopathies (aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, aortic\nregurgitation, mitral regurgitation). Regurgitation was hemodynamically more\nrelevant than stenosis, as the latter led to inefficient cardiac flow, while\nthe former introduced more drastic fluid dynamics variation. Moreover, mitral\nvalvulopathies were more significant than aortic ones. In case of aortic valve\ndiseases, proper mitral functioning damps out changes at atrial and pulmonary\nlevels. In the case of mitral valvulopathy, the mitral valve lost its\nregulating capability, thus hemodynamic variations almost equally affected\nregions upstream and downstream of the valve. The present study revealed that\nboth mitral and aortic regurgitation strongly affect hemodynamics, followed by\nmitral stenosis, while aortic stenosis has the least impact among the analyzed\nvalvular diseases. The proposed approach can provide new mechanistic insights\nas to which valvular pathologies merit more aggressive treatment of AF.
