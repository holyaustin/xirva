We hypothesized that this is reflected in regionally different outflow\nstructures and analyzed the entire limbus by high-resolution, full-thickness\nribbon-scanning confocal microscopy (RSCM). Methods: We perfused pig eyes by\nanterior chamber cannulation with eight lectin-fluorophore conjugates, followed\nby optical clearance with benzyl alcohol benzyl benzoate (BABB). RSCM and an\nadvanced analysis software (Imaris) were used to reconstruct a\nthree-dimensional, whole-specimen rendering of the perilimbal outflow\nstructures.

RSCM produced terabyte-sized\nfiles allowing for in silico dissection of outflow tract vessel at a high\nresolution and in 3D. Networks of interconnected lumina were traced from the TM\nto downstream drainage structures. The collector channel (CC) volumes were ten\ntimes smaller than the receiving SVP vessels, the largest of which were in the\ninferior limbus. Proximal CC diameters were up to four times the size of distal\ndiameters and more elliptical at their proximal ends.
