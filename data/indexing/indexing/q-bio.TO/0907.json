Tripartite\npatterning is proposed to occur by the interaction of two signaling pathways.\nEach pathway produces stimulated extracellular emission of like ligand upon\nactivation of its respective receptor, as well as inhibiting such emission from\nthe other pathway. Patterns arise spontaneously from zero density of activated\nreceptor. All known phyllotactic patterns are reproduced, Fibonacci,\ndistichous, decussate, and whorls, as well as the rare monostichy, with only\none leaf directly above the previous.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jul 2009 20:40:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Cummings", "F.
