This includes metabolism (e.g., temperature, hormonal\nblood levels) and cell proliferation. It has been observed in tumor-bearing\nlaboratory rodents that a severe disruption of these physiological rhythms\nresults in accelerated tumor growth. The question of accurately representing\nthe control exerted by circadian clocks on healthy and tumour tissue\nproliferation to explain this phenomenon has given rise to mathematical\ndevelopments, which we review. The main goal of these previous works was to\nexamine the influence of a periodic control on the cell division cycle in\nphysiologically structured cell populations, comparing the effects of periodic\ncontrol with no control, and of different periodic controls between them. We\nstate here a general convexity result that may give a theoretical justification\nto the concept of cancer chronotherapeutics. Our result also leads us to\nhypothesize that the above mentioned effect of disruption of circadian rhythms\non tumor growth enhancement is indirect, that, is this enhancement is likely to\nresult from the weakening of healthy tissue that are at work fighting tumor\ngrowth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Jun 2010 13:26:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Clairambault", "Jean", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Gaubert", "Stephane", "", "INRIA Saclay\n  - Ile de France"], ["Lepoutre", "Thomas", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt, LJLL"]]}, {"id": "1006.5117", "submitter": "Grace Chiu", "authors": "Penny S Reynolds and Grace S Chiu", "title": "Understanding thermoregulatory transitions during haemorrhage by\n  piecewise regression", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transition points are common in physiological processes. However the\ntransition between normothermia and hypothermia during haemorrhagic shock has\nrarely been systematically quantified from intensive time series data. We\nestimated the critical transition point (CTP) and provided confidence intervals\nfor core body temperature response to acute severe haemorrhage in a conscious\nrat model. Estimates were obtained by traditional piecewise linear regression\n(broken stick model) and compared to those from the more novel bent cable\nregression. Bent cable regression relaxes the assumption of an abrupt point\ntransition, and thus allows the capture of a potentially gradual transition\nphase; the broken stick is a special case of the bent cable model. We\ncalculated two types of confidence intervals, assuming either independent or\nautoregressive structure for the residuals. In spite of the severity of the\nhaemorrhage, median temperature change was minor (0.8 C; IQR 0.57-1.31 C) and\nonly four of 38 rats were clinically hypothermic (core temperature < 35 C).\nHowever, a transition could be estimated for 23 rats. Bent cable fits were\nsuperior when the transition appeared to be gradual rather than abrupt. In all\ncases, assuming independence gave incorrect uncertainty estimates of CTP. For\n15 animals, neither model could be fitted because of irregular temperature\nprofiles that did not conform to the assumption of a single transition.\nArbitrary imposition of broken stick fits on a gradual transition profile and\nassuming independent rather than autocorrelated error may result in misleading\nestimates of CTP. Identification of the onset of irreversible shock will\nrequire further quantification of appropriate time-dependent physiological\nvariables and their behaviour during haemorrhage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jun 2010 07:03:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Reynolds", "Penny S", ""], ["Chiu", "Grace S", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5650", "submitter": "Vadim N.

Here we present theoretical analysis of the waves of electrical\nactivity that can rise on the boundary of cardiac cell network upon its\nrecovery from ischaemia-like conditions. The main factors included in our\nanalysis are macroscopic gradients of the cell-to-cell coupling and cell\nexcitability and microscopic heterogeneity of individual cells. The interplay\nbetween these factors allows one to explain how spirals form, drift together\nwith the moving boundary, get transiently pinned to local inhomogeneities, and\nfinally penetrate into the bulk of the well-coupled tissue where they reach\nmacroscopic scale. The asymptotic theory of the drift of spiral and scroll\nwaves based on response functions provides explanation of the drifts involved\nin this mechanism, with the exception of effects due to the discreteness of\ncardiac tissue. In particular, this asymptotic theory allows an extrapolation\nof 2D events into 3D, which has shown that cells within the border zone can\ngive rise to 3D analogues of spirals, the scroll waves. When and if such scroll\nwaves escape into a better coupled tissue, they are likely to collapse due to\nthe positive filament tension. However, our simulations have shown that such\ncollapse of newly generated scrolls is not inevitable and that under certain\nconditions filament tension becomes negative, leading to scroll filaments to\nexpand and multiply leading to a fibrillation-like state within small areas of\ncardiac tissue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 13:05:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Jun 2011 15:31:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 23 Aug 2011 06:59:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Biktashev", "Vadim N.", ""], ["Biktasheva", "Irina V.", ""], ["Sarvazyan", "Narine A.", ""]]}]
