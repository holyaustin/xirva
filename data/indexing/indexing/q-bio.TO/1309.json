How such\nspatial organization emerges on the growing long bone domain is still\nunresolved. Based on the reported biochemical interactions we developed a\nregulatory model for the core signaling factors IHH, PTCH1, and PTHrP and\nincluded two cell types, proliferating/resting chondrocytes and\n(pre-)hypertrophic chondrocytes. We show that the reported IHH-PTCH1\ninteraction gives rise to a Schnakenberg-type Turing kinetics, and that\ninclusion of PTHrP is important to achieve robust patterning when coupling\npatterning and tissue dynamics. The model reproduces relevant spatiotemporal\ngene expression patterns, as well as a number of relevant mutant phenotypes. In\nsummary, we propose that a ligand-receptor based Turing mechanism may control\nthe emergence of patterns during long bone development, with PTHrP as an\nimportant mediator to confer patterning robustness when the sensitive Turing\nsystem is coupled to the dynamics of a growing and differentiating tissue. We\nhave previously shown that ligand-receptor based Turing mechanisms can also\nresult from BMP-receptor and GDNF-receptor interactions, and that these\nreproduce the wildtype and mutant patterns during digit formation in limbs and\nbranching morphogenesis in lung and kidneys. Receptor-ligand interactions may\nthus constitute a general mechanism to generate Turing patterns in nature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Sep 2013 14:32:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Tanaka", "Simon", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.1196", "submitter": "Kevin Leder", "authors": "Jasmine Foo and Kevin Leder and Marc Ryser", "title": "Multifocality and recurrence risk: a quantitative model of field\n  cancerization", "comments": "36 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Primary tumors often emerge within genetically altered fields of premalignant\ncells that appear histologically normal but have a high chance of progression\nto malignancy.

The\nprobabilities of each of these events provide the most important parameters of\nthe model. Fully differentiated cells do not divide, but a proportion undergoes\nprogrammed death in each generation. Our previous models showed that failure of\nprogrammed death - for example, in tumorigenesis - could lead either to\nexponential growth in cell numbers or to growth to some plateau. Our new models\nincorporate plausible fluctuation in the parameters of the model and introduce\nnon-linearity by assuming that the parameters depend on the numbers of cells in\neach state of differentiation. We find that the model is characterized by\nbifurcation between increase in cell numbers to stable equilibrium or\n'explosive' exponential growth; in a restricted number of cases, there may be\nmultiple stable equilibria. Fluctuation in cell numbers undergoing programmed\ndeath, for example caused by tissue damage, generally makes exponential growth\nmore likely, as long as the size of the fluctuation exceeds a certain critical\nvalue for a sufficiently long period of time. In most cases, once exponential\ngrowth has started, this process is irreversible.
