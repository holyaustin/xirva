Cd$^{2+}$ is known as a non-essentiel HM that can\nbe harmful to plants even at low concentrations. Brassica juncea (L.) is able\nto accumulate more than 400 $\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W. in the shoot, a physiological\ntrait which may be exploited for the phytoremediation of contaminated soils and\nwaters. . The application of 75 $\\mu$M CdCl$_2$ for three days does not show\nany effect in the B. juncea growth parameters (F.W. and D.W.) whatever the type\nof plantlets. This application decreases also the contents of chlorophyll a,\ncarotenoids and Chl a/b ratio (2.26) for plantlets regenerated in the absence\nof CdCl$_2$ but not those of plantlets regenerated in its presence. Roots have\nthe highest contents (3071; 1544 $\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) followed by stems (850;\n687$\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.) and leaves (463; 264$\\mu$g.g$^{-1}$ D.W.)\nrespectively. In our conditions, we suggest that the low accumulation in the\nplantlets regenerated in the presence of CdCl$_2$ by the means of in-vitro\nregeneration technology is still benefical, to some extent, for the\nphytoextraction process and seems to be an interesting technology that allows\nthe cultivation of these plantlets in contaminated soils with low accumulation\nof metal in their shoots and probably in their seeds used in many food\ntechnologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2008 16:13:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aoun", "Michel", ""], ["Cabon", "Jean-Yves", ""], ["Hourmant", "Annick", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1061", "submitter": "Michel Aoun", "authors": "Michel Aoun, Gilbert Charles, Annick Hourmant", "title": "Micropropagation of three genotypes of Indian mustard [{Brassica juncea}\n  (L.)

Two isoforms of COX, termed COX-1 and COX-2, have been identified.\nUnlike COX-1, COX-2 expression is dramatically induced by ischemia and appears\nto be an effector of tissue damage.

Using as an example a human knee joint, this\npaper proposes a new coupled-loading-rate hypothesis, which states that a\ngeneric cause of any musculo-skeletal injury is a Euclidean jolt, or\nSE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that hits a joint in several coupled\ndegrees-of-freedom simultaneously. Informally, it is a rate-of-change of joint\nacceleration in all 6-degrees-of-freedom simultaneously, times the\ncorresponding portion of the body mass. In the case of a human knee, this\nhappens when most of the body mass is on one leg with a semi-flexed knee -- and\nthen, caused by some external shock, the knee suddenly `jerks'; this can happen\nin running, skiing, sports games (e.g., soccer, rugby) and various\ncrashes/impacts. To show this formally, based on the previously defined\ncovariant force law and its application to traumatic brain injury (Ivancevic,\n2008), we formulate the coupled Newton--Euler dynamics of human joint motions\nand derive from it the corresponding coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics of the joint\nin case. The SE(3)-jolt is the main cause of two forms of discontinuous joint\ninjury: (i) mild rotational disclinations and (ii) severe translational\ndislocations. Both the joint disclinations and dislocations, as caused by the\nSE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum\njoint model.\n  Keywords: musculo-skeletal injury, coupled-loading--rate hypothesis, coupled\nNewton-Euler dynamics, Euclidean jolt dynamics, joint dislocations and\ndisclinations\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jul 2008 01:24:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Aug 2008 04:16:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2008 02:32:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2008 02:01:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2009 00:48:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2995", "submitter": "Michael Yampolsky", "authors": "Michael Yampolsky, Oleksandr Shlakhter, Carolyn M.

One way to\ncharacterize this complexity is to take advantage of the high interconnectivity\nof cerebral cortex and use intracellular recordings of cortical neurons, which\ncontain information about the activity of thousands of other cortical neurons.\nIdentifying the membrane potential (Vm) to a stochastic process enables the\nextraction of important statistical signatures of this complex synaptic\nactivity. Typically, one estimates the total synaptic conductances (excitatory\nand inhibitory) but this type of estimation requires at least two Vm levels and\ntherefore cannot be applied to single Vm traces. We propose here a method to\nextract excitatory and inhibitory conductances (mean and variance) from single\nVm traces. This \"VmT method\" estimates conductance parameters using maximum\nlikelihood criteria, under the assumption are that synaptic conductances are\ndescribed by Gaussian stochastic processes and are integrated by a passive\nleaky membrane. The method is illustrated using models and is tested on\nguinea-pig visual cortex neurons in vitro using dynamic-clamp experiments. The\nVmT method holds promises for extracting conductances from single-trial\nmeasurements, which has a high potential for in vivo applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2008 13:47:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Jan 2009 16:24:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Pospischil", "Martin", ""], ["Piwkowska", "Zuzanna", ""], ["Bal", "Thierry", ""], ["Destexhe", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4959", "submitter": "Xiaolin Li", "authors": "Zhuang Liu, Joshua T.
