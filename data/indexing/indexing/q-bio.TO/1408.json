This connection comes from\nup-regulation of glycolysis by tumor cells, which can lead to active\ncompetition for resources in the tumor microenvironment between tumor and\nimmune cells. Here it is further proposed that cancer stem cells (CSCs) can\ncircumvent the anti-tumor immune response by creating a 'protective shield' of\nnon-stem cancer cells around them. This shield can protect the CSCs both by\ncreating a physical barrier between them and cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs), and\nby promoting competition for the common resources, such as glucose, between\nnon-stem cancer cells and CTLs. The implications of this hypothesis are\ninvestigate using an agent-based model, leading to a prediction that relative\nCSC to non-CSC ratio will vary with the strength of the host immune response,\nwith the highest occurring at an intermediate state of immune activation. A\ndiscussion of possible therapeutic approaches concludes the paper, suggesting\nthat a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of regular pulsed doses, i.e.,\nmetronomic chemotherapy, would yield the best clinical outcome by allowing CTLs\nto most effectively reach and eliminate CSCs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Aug 2014 18:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kareva", "Irina", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1589", "submitter": "Zahra Karimaddini", "authors": "Zahra Karimaddini, Erkan Unal, Denis Menshykau and Dagmar Iber", "title": "Simulating Organogenesis in COMSOL: Image-based Modeling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mathematical Modelling has a long history in developmental biology.

To detect and process\nthese signals, the ear employs a highly nonlinear, adaptive, real-time spectral\nanalyzer: the cochlea. Sound excites vibration of the eardrum and the three\nminiscule bones of the middle ear, the last of which acts as a piston to\ninitiate oscillatory pressure changes within the liquid-filled chambers of the\ncochlea. The basilar membrane, an elastic band spiraling along the cochlea\nbetween two of these chambers, responds to these pressures by conducting a\nlargely independent traveling wave for each frequency component of the input.\nBecause the basilar membrane is graded in mass and stiffness along its length,\nhowever, each traveling wave grows in magnitude and decreases in wavelength\nuntil it peaks at a specific, frequency-dependent position: low frequencies\npropagate to the cochlear apex, whereas high frequencies culminate at the base.\nThe oscillations of the basilar membrane deflect hair bundles, the mechanically\nsensitive organelles of the ear's sensory receptors, the hair cells. As\nmechanically sensitive ion channels open and close, each hair cell responds\nwith an electrical signal that is chemically transmitted to an afferent nerve\nfiber and thence into the brain.

A second, alternative pathway exists, however: stimulation\nof the cochlear bone vibrates the basilar membrane as well. This pathway,\nreferred to as bone conduction, is increasingly used in the construction of\nheadphones that bypass the ear canal and the middle ear. Furthermore,\notoacoustic emissions, sounds generated inside the ear and measured in the ear\ncanal, may not involve the usual wave on the basilar membrane, suggesting that\nadditional cochlear structures are involved in their propagation.

We present here a compact MFP (cMFP) that can be used on a\nstandard inverted microscope and assist in the local processing of tissue\nsections and biological specimens. The cMFP has a footprint of 175 X 100 X 140\nmm^3 and can scan an area of 45 X 45 mm^2 on a surface with an accuracy of +-15\num. The cMFP is compatible with standard surfaces used in life science\nlaboratories such as microscope slides and Petri dishes.

Switching the processing liquid in the flow\nconfinement is performed within 90 seconds using a selector valve with a\ndead-volume of approximately 5 uL. We further implemented height-compensation\nthat allows a cMFP head to follow non-planar surfaces common in tissue and\ncellular ensembles. This was shown by patterning different macroscopic\ncopper-coated topographies with height differences up to 750 um. To illustrate\nthe applicability to tissue processing, 5 um thick M000921 BRAF V600E+ melanoma\ncell blocks were stained with hematoxylin to create contours, lines, spots,\ngradients of the chemicals, and multiple spots over larger areas. The local\nstaining was performed in an interactive manner using a joystick and a\nscripting module.
