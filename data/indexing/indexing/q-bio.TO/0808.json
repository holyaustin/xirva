Our model of the blood flow network\nconsists of a bifurcating tree, into which we introduce particles (emboli) that\nhalt flow on reaching a node of similar size. Flow is weighted away from\nblocked arteries, inducing an effective interaction between emboli. We justify\nthe form of the flow weighting using a steady flow (Poiseuille) analysis and a\nmore complicated nonlinear analysis. We discuss free flowing and heavily\ncongested limits and examine the transition from free flow to congestion using\nnumerics. The correlation time is found to increase significantly at a critical\nvalue, and a finite size scaling is carried out. An order parameter for\nnon-equilibrium critical behavior is identified as the overlap of blockages'\nflow shadows. Our work shows embolic stroke to be a feature of the cerebral\nblood flow network on the verge of a phase transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Aug 2008 17:26:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2009 16:21:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hague", "J.

By considering the human body as a dynamic\nsystem of variable mass (and volume), growing under a gravity field, it is\nshown how natural laws may influence the vertical growth of humans. This\napproach makes sense because the non-linear percentile curves of different\naspects of human physical growth from childhood to adolescence can be described\nin relation to physics laws independently of gender and nationality. Analytical\nrelations for the dependence of stature, measured mass (weight), growth\nvelocity (and their mix as the body mass index) on age are deduced with a set\nof common statistical parameters which could relate environmental, genetics and\nmetabolism and different aspects of physical growth on earth. A relationship to\nthe monotone smoothing using functional data analysis to estimate growth curves\nand its derivatives is established. A preliminary discussion is also presented\non horizontal growth in an essentially weightless environment (i.e., aquatic)\nwith a connection to the Laird-Gompertz formula for growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 18:37:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Canessa", "E.", ""]]}]
