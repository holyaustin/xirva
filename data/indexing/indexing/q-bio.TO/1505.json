We consider neuromechanical systems where slow movements are\nproduced by neural commands that modulate muscle stiffness. This formulation\nbased on strain-energy equilibria is in agreement with prior work on neural\ncontrol of muscle and limb impedance. Slow limb movements are driftless in the\nsense that movement stops when neural commands stop. We demonstrate, in the\ncontext of two planar tendon-driven systems representing a finger and a leg,\nthat the control of muscle stiffness suffices to produce stable and accurate\nlimb postures and quasi-static (slow) transitions among them. We prove,\nhowever, that stable postures are achievable only when muscles are\npre-tensioned, as is the case for natural muscle tone. Our results further\nindicate, in accordance with experimental findings, that slow movements are\nnon-smooth. The non-smoothness arises because the precision with which\nindividual muscle stiffnesses need to be controlled changes substantially\nthroughout the limb's motion. These results underscore the fundamental roles of\nmuscle tone and accurate neural control of muscle stiffness in producing stable\nlimb postures and slow movements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 May 2015 16:32:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 17:18:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Babikian", "Sarine", ""], ["Valero-Cuevas", "Francisco J.", ""], ["Kanso", "Eva", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.01289", "submitter": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch", "authors": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch and Thomas M.

In order to\nunderstand this in-homogeneity, the pathology of APs is analyzed by Misrepair\nmechanism, a mechanism proposed in our Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. I.\nIn general, development of an AP is a result of repair of injured endothelium.\nBecause of infusion and deposition of lipids beneath endothelial cells, the\nrepair has to be achieved by altered remodeling of local endothelium. Such a\nrepair is a Misrepair. During repair, smooth muscular cells (SMCs) are\nclustered and collagen fibers are produced to the lesion of endothelium for\nreconstructing an anchoring structure for endothelial cells and for forming a\nbarrier to isolate the lipids. II. Altered remodeling (Misrepair) makes the\nlocal part of endothelium have increased damage-sensitivity and reduced\nrepair-efficiency. Thus, this part of endothelium will have increased risk for\ninjuries, lipid-infusion, and Misrepairs. Focalized accumulation of Misrepairs\nand focalized deposition of lipids result in development of a plaque. III. By a\nviscous circle between lipid-infusion and endothelium-Misrepair, growing of an\nAP is self-accelerating. Namely, once an AP develops, it grows in an increasing\nrate with time and it does not stop growing. Within part of an arterial wall,\nolder APs grow faster than younger ones. The oldest and the biggest AP is the\nmost threatening one in narrowing local vessel lumen. Therefore, the\nself-accelerated growing of an AP is a fatal factor in atherosclerosis. In\nconclusion, development of APs is focalized and self-accelerating, because it\nis a result of accumulation of Misrepairs of endothelium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2015 08:59:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 09:08:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", ""], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.01375", "submitter": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch", "authors": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch and Thomas M.

These data help to\nbetter understand the negative feedback loop in the TGF$\\beta$ signalling\nsystem, and enlighten an interesting role of Sp1 to regulate TGF$\\beta$\nresponse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 12:19:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Baug\u00e9", "Catherine", "", "MILPAT"], ["Cauvard", "Olivier", "", "MILPAT"], ["Leclercq", "Sylvain", "", "MILPAT"], ["Gal\u00e9ra", "Philippe", "", "MILPAT"], ["Boum\u00e9diene", "Karim", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.06921", "submitter": "Catherine Bauge", "authors": "Elise Duval, Nicolas Bigot, Magalie Hervieu, Ikuyo Kou, Sylvain\n  Leclercq, Philippe Gal\\'era, Karim Boumediene, Catherine Baug\\'e", "title": "Asporin expression is highly regulated in human chondrocytes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Molecular Medicine, Feinstein Institute for Medical Research,\n  2010, 17 (7-8), pp.816-23", "doi": "10.2119/molmed.2011.00052", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A significant association between a polymorphism in the D repeat of the gene\nencoding asporin and osteoarthritis, the most frequent of articular diseases,\nhas been recently reported. The goal of the present study was to investigate\nthe expression of this new class I small leucine-rich proteoglycan (SLRP) in\nhuman articular chondrocytes. First, we studied the modulation of asporin\n(ASPN) expression by cytokines by Western blot and reverse\ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction. Interleukin-1$\\beta$ and tumor\nnecrosis factor-$\\alpha$ downregulated ASPN, whereas transforming growth\nfactor-$\\beta$1 (when incubated in a serum-free medium) upregulated it.\nSimilarly to proinflammatory cytokines, chondrocyte dedifferentiation induced\nby a successive passages of cells was accompanied by a decreased asporin\nexpression, whereas their redifferentiation by three-dimensional culture\nrestored its expression. Finally, we found an important role of the\ntranscription factor Sp1 in the regulation of ASPN expression. Sp1 ectopic\nexpression increased ASPN mRNA level and promoter activity. In addition, using\ngene reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that\nSp1 mediated its effect through a region located between -473 and -140 bp\nupstream of the transcription start site in ASPN gene. In conclusion, this\nreport is the first study on the regulation of asporin expression by different\ncytokines in human articular chondrocytes.

To understand the mechanism of development of age spots,\ncharacteristics of age spots are analyzed by Misrepair mechanism, a mechanism\nintroduced in Misrepair-accumulation aging theory. An age spot is\npathologically a group of aggregated basal cells, which contain lipofuscin\nbodies. Accumulation of lipofuscin bodies is a sign of aging of a cell.\nCharacteristics of age spots include: inhomogeneity in distribution, growing\nflatly before becoming protruding, irregularity on shape, inhomogeneity on the\ncolor and on the protruding degree of a spot, and softness of a protruding\nspot. After analyzing these characteristics, we make a hypothesis on the\nprocess of development of an age spot. A. Aging of a tissue is the basis for\ndevelopment of age spots. B. A flat spot results from accumulation of\nlipofuscin containing cells. When an aged cell remains, this cell can\naccelerate the aging of its neighbor cells by increasing damage sensitivity and\nreducing repair efficiency of the local tissue. By a viscous circle, more and\nmore neighbor cells become aged and they form a flat spot, which has an\nirregular shape. C. A protruding spot develops when some of the cells in a flat\nspot die and release lipofuscin bodies. For the survival of an organism, the un\ndegradable lipofuscin bodies have to be isolated by a capsule made by fibrotic\nmembrane, for maintaining the structural integrity of local epidermis.\nSuccessive deaths of lipofuscin containing cells make the capsule include more\nand more dead substances by layers of fibrotic membrane. In this way, the spot\n\"grows\" in three-dimension, resulting in protruding of the spot. In conclusion,\ndevelopment of an age spot is a result of accumulation of aged cells in aged\nskin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 15:31:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 10:45:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", ""], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas M", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07016", "submitter": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch", "authors": "Jicun Wang-Michelitsch, Thomas M.

With a new concept of Misrepair, this theory reaches a unified\nunderstanding of aging: aging of an organism is a result of accumulation of\nMisrepairs of its structure. Misrepair accumulation theory (MA theory) is\ndistinct and it can improve our understanding of life on several aspects. I. MA\ntheory is fundamentally different from other theories by: A. proposing a\ngeneralized concept of Misrepair; B. pointing out the evolutionary advantage of\naging mechanism; and C. distinguishing between aging of a cell and aging of a\ntissue. II. MA theory overcomes the limitations of traditional theories on\ninterpreting the phenomena of tissue fibrosis and cancer development. Tissue\nfibrosis, as a result of accumulation of Misrepairs with collagen fibers, is a\npowerful evidence for demonstrating the central role of Misrepairs in aging.\nCancer development is a result of accumulation of DNA Misrepairs in somatic\ncells, which needs to proceed over many generations of cells in a regenerable\ntissue. III. MA theory improves also our understanding on longevity, premature\naging, adaptation, and species evolution. The potential of longevity of an\norganism is hidden in the complexity of its structure. IV. MA theory suggests\nthat for retarding aging, the most important is to reduce the opportunity of\ndamage-exposure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2015 15:42:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 10:12:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Wang-Michelitsch", "Jicun", ""], ["Michelitsch", "Thomas M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07513", "submitter": "Jitendra Jonnagaddala", "authors": "Jitendra Jonnagaddala, Damian Sue", "title": "A Report on the Workshop on Biobanking Informatics", "comments": "5 Pages, Workshop", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Workshop on Biobanking Informatics in NSW 2013 (WBIN13) was held on\nFriday, 10 May 2013 at The Wallace Wurth Building in the University of New\nSouth Wales.

A\nrecently developed magneto-optical (MO) method allows the high-sensitivity\ndetection of malaria pigment (hemozoin) crystals in blood via their\nmagnetically induced rotational motion. The evaluation of the method using\nsynthetic $\\beta$-hematin crystals and P. falciparum in vitro cultures implies\nits potential for in-field diagnosis. Here, we study the performance of the\nmethod in monitoring the in vivo onset and progression of the blood stage\ninfection using a malaria mouse model. We found that the MO method can detect\nthe first generation of intraerythrocytic parasites at the ring stage 61-66\nhours after sporozoite injection demonstrating better sensitivity than light\nmicroscopy and flow cytometry. MO measurements performed after treatment of\nsevere P. berghei infections show that the clearance period of hemozoin in mice\nis approx. 5 days which indicates the feasibility of the detection of later\nreinfections as well. Being label and reagent-free, cost-effective and rapid,\ntogether with the demonstrated sensitivity, we believe that the MO method is a\nsuitable candidate for in-depth clinical evaluation in endemic settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2015 18:35:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 12:11:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Orban", "Agnes", ""], ["Rebelo", "Maria", ""], ["Albuquerque", "In\u00eas S.", ""], ["Butykai", "Adam", ""], ["Kezsmarki", "Istvan", ""], ["H\u00e4nscheid", "Thomas", ""]]}]
