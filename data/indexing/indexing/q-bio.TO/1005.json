In particular auxin induces the polar localization of its\nown efflux facilitator. Due to this positive feedback auxin flow is directed\nand patterns of auxin and PIN arise. During the earliest stage of vein\ninitiation in leaves auxin accumulates in a single cell in a rim of epidermal\ncells from which it flows into the ground meristem tissue of the leaf blade.\nThere the localized auxin supply yields the successive polarization of PIN\ndistribution along a strand of cells. We model the auxin and PIN dynamics\nwithin cells with a minimal canalization model. Solving the model analytically\nwe uncover an excitable polarization front that triggers a polar distribution\nof PIN proteins in cells.

Predicted speeds\nwere in reasonable agreement with experimental data, and the pressure gradients\nneeded to produce these flows are small. Furthermore, cords that were predicted\nto carry fast-moving or large currents were significantly more likely to\nincrease in size than cords with slow-moving or small currents. The\nincompressibility of the fluids within fungi means there is a rapid global\nresponse to local fluid movements. Hence velocity of fluid flow is a local\nsignal that conveys quasi-global information about the role of a cord within\nthe mycelium. We suggest that fluid incompressibility and the coupling of\ngrowth and mass flow are critical physical features that enable the development\nof efficient, adaptive, biological transport networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 May 2010 14:48:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Heaton", "Luke", ""], ["Lopez", "Eduardo", ""], ["Maini", "Philip K.", ""], ["Fricker", "Mark D.", ""], ["Jones", "Nick S.", ""]]}]
