Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a highly conserved peptide\nthat appears to play a central role in nociceptive signaling in inflammatory\nand neuropathic pain. However, little is known about the peptide in\ncancer-induced bone pain. Here, we evaluate the role of spinal NPY in the\nMRMT-1 rat model of cancer-induced bone pain. Our studies revealed an\nup-regulation of NPY-immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn of cancer-bearing rats\n17 days after inoculation, which could be a compensatory antinociceptive\nresponse. Consistent with this interpretation, intrathecal administration of\nNPY to rats with cancer-induced bone pain caused a reduction in nociceptive\nbehaviors that lasted up to 150 min. This effect was diminished by both Y1\n(BIBO3304) and Y2 (BIIE0246) receptor antagonists, indicating that both\nreceptors participate in mediating the antinociceptive effect of NPY. Y1 and Y2\nreceptor binding in the spinal cord was unchanged in the cancer state as\ncompared to sham-operated rats, consistent with the notion that increased NPY\nresults in a net antinociceptive effect in the MRMT-1 model.

An acellular collagen platform with an endothelial blood\nvessel served as control. SUM149 and MDA-MB-231 platforms exhibited a\nsignificantly (p<0.05) higher vessel permeability and decreased endothelial\ncoverage of the vessel lumen compared to the control. Both IBC platforms,\nMDA-IBC3 and SUM149, expressed higher levels of VEGF (p<0.05) and increased\ncollagen ECM porosity compared to non-IBC MDA-MB-231 (p<0.05) and control\n(p<0.01) platforms. Additionally, unique to the MDA-IBC3 platform, we observed\nprogressive sprouting of the endothelium over time resulting in viable vessels\nwith lumen. The newly sprouted vessels encircled clusters of MDA-IBC3 cells\nreplicating a feature of in vivo IBC. The IBC in vitro vascularized platforms\nintroduced in this study model well-described in vivo and clinical IBC\nphenotypes and provide an adaptable, high throughout tool for systematically\nand quantitatively investigating tumor-stromal mechanisms and dynamics of tumor\nprogression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2018 16:33:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2019 14:43:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:20:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gadde", "Manasa", ""], ["Phillips", "Caleb", ""], ["Ghousifam", "Neda", ""], ["Sorace", "Anna G.", ""], ["Wong", "Enoch", ""], ["Krishnamurthy", "Savitri", ""], ["Syed", "Anum", ""], ["Rahal", "Omar", ""], ["Yankeelov", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Woodward", "Wendy A.", ""], ["Rylander", "Marissa Nichole", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.08179", "submitter": "Patrick Dondl", "authors": "Patrina S.P.

These new capillaries are\nmorphologically different from normal physiological vessels. In particular,\nthey have a much higher spatial tortuosity forcing an impaired flow within the\nperitumoral area. This is a major obstacle for the efficient delivery of\nantitumoral drugs. This work proposes a morpho-elastic model of the tumour\nvessels. A tumour capillary is considered as a growing hyperelastic tube that\nis spatially constrained by a linear elastic environment, representing the\ninterstitial matter. We assume that the capillary is an incompressible\nneo-Hookean material, whose growth is modeled using a multiplicative\ndecomposition of the deformation gradient. We study the morphological stability\nof the capillary by means of the method of incremental deformations superposed\non finite strains, solving the corresponding incremental problem using the\nStroh formulation and the impedance matrix method. The incompatible axial\ngrowth of the straight capillary is found to control the onset of a bifurcation\ntowards a tortuous shape. The post-buckling morphology is studied using a mixed\nfinite element formulation in the fully nonlinear regime. The proposed model\nhighlights how the geometrical and the elastic properties of the capillary and\nthe surrounding medium concur to trigger the loss of marginal stability of the\nstraight capillary and the nonlinear development of its spatial tortuosity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2018 20:58:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-26", "authors_parsed": [["Riccobelli", "Davide", ""], ["Ciarletta", "Pasquale", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.09450", "submitter": "Alican Ozkan", "authors": "Alican Ozkan, Neda Ghousifam, P.

The results show that when breast cancer cells were cultured\nin the microenvironments they had a 2.62-fold higher vessel porosity relative\nto vessels within healthy liver microenvironments. Hence, the permeability of\nthe tumor microenvironment increased by 2.35- and 2.77-fold compared to a\nhealthy liver for small and large particles, respectively. The ECM accumulation\nrate of larger particles was 2.57-fold lower than smaller particles in a\nhealthy liver.

Spiral wave dynamics of cardiac\nfibrillation shows chaotic and disintegrated patterns while sinus rhythm shows\nsynchronized excitation patterns. To determine functional interactions between\ncardiomyocytes during complex fibrillation states, we applied a pairwise\nmaximum entropy model (MEM) to the sequential electrical activity maps acquired\nfrom the 2D computational simulation of human atrial fibrillation. Then, we\nconstructed energy landscape and estimated hierarchical structure among the\ndifferent local minima (attractors) to explain the dynamic properties of\ncardiac fibrillation. Four types of the wave dynamics were considered: sinus\nrhythm; single stable rotor; single rotor with wavebreak; and multiple wavelet.\nThe MEM could describe all types of wave dynamics (both accuracy and\nreliability>0.9) except the multiple random wavelet. Both of the sinus rhythm\nand the single stable rotor showed relatively high pairwise interaction\ncoefficients among the cardiomyocytes. Also, the local energy minima had\nrelatively large basins and high energy barrier, showing stable attractor\nproperties. However, in the single rotor with wavebreak, there were relatively\nlow pairwise interaction coefficients and a similar number of the local minima\nseparated by a relatively low energy barrier compared with the single stable\nrotor case. The energy landscape of the multiple wavelet consisted of a large\nnumber of the local minima separated by a relatively low energy barrier,\nshowing unstable dynamics. These results indicate that the MEM provides\ninformation about local and global coherence among the cardiomyocytes beyond\nthe simple structural connectivity. Energy landscape analysis can explain\nstability and transitional properties of complex dynamics of cardiac\nfibrillation, which might be determined by the presence of 'driver' such as\nsinus node or rotor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2018 04:19:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2018 05:10:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Jun-Seop", ""], ["Song", "Tobias G.", ""], ["Pak", "Hui-Nam", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10866", "submitter": "Philippe Marcq", "authors": "V.
