Naturally derived antibacterial agents, such as Manuka\nhoney, consist of a mixture of compounds, more than one of which can influence\nantimicrobial potency. The non-peroxide bacteriostatic properties of Manuka\nhoney have been previously linked to the presence of methylglyoxal (MGO). The\nincorporation of MGO as a functional antibacterial additive during fibre\nproduction was explored as a potential route for manufacturing wound dressing\ncomponents. Synthetic MGO and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were fabricated into webs\nof sub-micron fibres by means of electrostatic spinning of an aqueous spinning\nsolution. Composite fabrics were also produced by direct deposition of the\nPVA-MGO fibres onto a preformed spunbonded nonwoven substrate. Attenuated Total\nReflectance Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic\nResonance (<p><sup>1</sup>H-NMR) spectroscopies confirmed the presence of MGO\nwithin the resulting fibre structure. The antibacterial activity of the fibres\nwas studied using strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Strong\nantibacterial activity, as well as diffusion of MGO from the fibres was\nobserved at a concentration of 1.55mg/<p>cm<sup>-1</sup>.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Jul 2015 16:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bulman", "Sophie E.

It is still unclear to\nwhat extent tip cell overtaking is a side effect of sprouting or to what extent\na biological function. To address this question, we studied tip cell overtaking\nin two existing cellular Potts models of angiogenic sprouting. In these models\nangiogenic sprouting-like behavior emerges from a small set of plausible cell\nbehaviors and the endothelial cells spontaneously migrate forwards and\nbackwards within sprouts, suggesting that tip cell overtaking might occur as a\nside effect of sprouting. In accordance with experimental observations, in our\nsimulations the cells' tendency to occupy the tip position can be regulated\nwhen two cell lines with different levels of Vegfr2 expression are contributing\nto sprouting (mosaic sprouting assay), where cell behavior is regulated by a\nsimple VEGF-Dll4-Notch signaling network. Our modeling results suggest that tip\ncell overtaking occurs spontaneously due to the stochastic motion of cells\nduring sprouting. Thus, tip cell overtaking and sprouting dynamics may be\ninterdependent and should be studied and interpreted in combination.\nVEGF-Dll4-Notch can regulate the ability of cells to occupy the tip cell\nposition, but only when cells in the simulation strongly differ in their levels\nof Vegfr2. We propose that VEGF-Dll4-Notch signaling might not regulate which\ncell ends up at the tip, but assures that the cell that randomly ends up at the\ntip position acquires the tip cell phenotype.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 15:48:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 12:17:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Boas", "Sonja E.
