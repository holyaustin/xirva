To answer the\nquestion we consider a general model of hierarchically organized self-renewing\ntissues and show that the lifetime divisional load of such a tissue is\nindependent of the details of the cell differentiation processes, and depends\nonly on two structural and two dynamical parameters. Our results demonstrate\nthat a strict analytical relationship exists between two seemingly disparate\ncharacteristics of self-renewing tissues: divisional load and tissue\norganization. Most remarkably, we find that a sufficient number of\nprogressively slower dividing cell types can be almost as efficient in\nminimizing the divisional load, as non-renewing tissues. We argue that one of\nthe main functions of tissue-specific stem cells and differentiation\nhierarchies is the prevention of cancer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 08:59:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Der\u00e9nyi", "Imre", ""], ["Sz\u00f6ll\u0151si", "Gergely J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.01361", "submitter": "Christophe Gole", "authors": "Pau Atela and Christophe Gole", "title": "Rhombic Tilings and Primordia Fronts of Phyllotaxis", "comments": "33 pages, 10 pictures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO math.DS", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce and study properties of phyllotactic and rhombic tilings on the\ncylin- der.

The AF lumped-parameter model was run to simulate resting (1\nMetabolic Equivalent of Task-MET) and various exercise conditions (4 METs:\nbrisk walking; 6 METs: skiing; 8 METs: running), considering different resting\nHR (70 bpm for the slower resting HR-SHR simulations, and 100 bpm for the\nhigher resting HR-HHR simulations).

Pulmonary venous pressure underwent a greater increase in HHR\ncompared to SHR simulations (VCI4 = 0.71, VCI6 = 0.73 and VCI8 = 0.77), while\nfor systemic arterial pressure the opposite is true (VCI4 = 1.15, VCI6 = 1.36,\nVCI8 = 1.56).\n  Conclusions.

With just three global parameters, this model achieves up to 90%\nagreement between predicted and measured flow.
