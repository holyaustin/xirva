We present a\nmathematical model to study the influence of hypoxia and acidity on the\nevolutionary dynamics of cancer cells in vascularised tumours. The model is\nformulated as a system of partial integro-differential equations that describe\nthe phenotypic evolution of cancer cells in response to dynamic variations in\nthe spatial distribution of three abiotic factors that are key players in\ntumour metabolism: oxygen, glucose and lactate. The results of numerical\nsimulations of a calibrated version of the model based on real data\nrecapitulate the eco-evolutionary spatial dynamics of tumour cells and their\nadaptation to hypoxic and acidic microenvironments. Moreover, such results\ndemonstrate how nonlinear interactions between tumour cells and abiotic factors\ncan lead to the formation of environmental gradients which select for cells\nwith phenotypic characteristics that vary with distance from intra-tumour blood\nvessels, thus promoting the emergence of intra-tumour phenotypic heterogeneity.\nFinally, our theoretical findings reconcile the conclusions of earlier studies\nby showing that the order in which resistance to hypoxia and resistance to\nacidity arise in tumours depend on the ways in which oxygen and lactate act as\nenvironmental stressors in the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 06:10:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 09:14:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Fiandaca", "Giada", ""], ["Delitala", "Marcello", ""], ["Lorenzi", "Tommaso", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00388", "submitter": "Michel Destrade", "authors": "Ilaria Cinelli, Michel Destrade, Peter McHugh, Antonia Trotta, Michael\n  Gilchrist, Maeve Duffy", "title": "Head-to-nerve analysis of electromechanical impairments of diffuse\n  axonal injury", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology volume 18, pages\n  361-374(2019)", "doi": "10.1007/s10237-018-1086-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO cond-mat.soft", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim was to investigate mechanical and functional failure of diffuse\naxonal injury (DAI) in nerve bundles following frontal head impacts, by finite\nelement simulations.

These models generally\nconsist of a balance equation for the cell density, one for the density of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM), and a force-balance equation describing the\nmechanical equilibrium of the cell-ECM system. Assuming this system can be\nregarded as an isotropic linear viscoelastic material, the force-balance\nequation is often defined using the Kelvin-Voigt model of linear\nviscoelasticity to represent the stress-strain relation of the ECM.

By fluorescence stereomicroscopy and layer-by-layer\ndissection after the rabbits were sacrificed, the perivascular and adventitial\nconnective tissues (PACT) along the saphenous veins and inferior vena cava were\nfound to be stained by sodium fluorescein from ankle dermis, which coincided\nwith the findings by MRI. By confocal microscopy and histological analysis, the\nstained PACT pathways were verified to be the fibrous connective tissues and\nconsisted of longitudinally assembled fibers. By usages of nanoparticles and\nsurfactants, a PACT pathway was found to be accessible for a nanoparticle under\n100nm and contain two parts: a tunica channel part and an absorptive part. In\nreal-time observations, the calculated velocity of a continuous ISF flow along\nfibers of a PACT pathway was 3.6-15.6 mm/sec. Conclusion: These data further\nrevealed more kinetic features of a continuous ISF flow along vascular vessel.\nA multiscale, multilayer, and multiform interstitial/interfacial fluid flow\nthroughout perivascular and adventitial connective tissues was suggested as one\nof kinetic and dynamic mechanisms for ISF flow, which might be another\nprincipal fluid dynamic pattern besides convective/vascular and diffusive\ntransport in biological system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:30:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2020 03:31:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Hongyi", ""], ["Lv", "You", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaoliang", ""], ["Li", "Bei", ""], ["Hua", "Qi", ""], ["Ji", "Fusui", ""], ["Yin", "Yajun", ""], ["Li", "Hua", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.13775", "submitter": "Maryam Ghoojaei", "authors": "Maryam Ghoojaei, Reza Shirkoohi, Mojtaba Saffari, Amirnader\n  Emamirazavi, Mehrdad Hashemi", "title": "Foot-print of Claudin and Occludin Transcriptome in Colorectal Cancer", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background and Purpose: Colorectal cancer as a leading cause of mortality\nworldwide, can be regarded as a relatively common and fatal disease with\nincreasing incidence over recent years. Colorectal cancer is characterized by\nuncontrolled growth of abnormal cells occurring in different parts of the\ncolon. About 90% of deaths associated with cancers occur due to metastasis\nwhich overcome overcomes the body's cellular connection, including tight\njunctions. Claudin and Occludin are integral membrane proteins found in tight\njunctions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level\nof claudin and occludin in human colorectal cancer. Method: In this study, 38\ncolorectal cancer patients who referred to Cancer Institute of Imam Khomeini\nHospital in Tehran, Iran were studied after obtaining the informed consent.\nFirst, quantitative extraction of RNA was performed, then the expression levels\nof claudin and Occludin genes were examined by reverse transcription, PCR, and\nReal-time PCR. Findings: The expression levels of both claudin and Occludin\ngenes in cases with higher stage and grade of disease, in the state of\nmetastasis were more than those of the control samples. Conclusion: The\nincreased expression level of the mentioned genes can be considered as an\ninfluential factor in turning the normal healthy tissues into cancerous cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2020 04:20:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ghoojaei", "Maryam", ""], ["Shirkoohi", "Reza", ""], ["Saffari", "Mojtaba", ""], ["Emamirazavi", "Amirnader", ""], ["Hashemi", "Mehrdad", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14068", "submitter": "Felix Meister", "authors": "Felix Meister, Tiziano Passerini, Chlo\\'e Audigier, \\`Eric Lluch,\n  Viorel Mihalef, Hiroshi Ashikaga, Andreas Maier, Henry Halperin, Tommaso\n  Mansi", "title": "Graph convolutional regression of cardiac depolarization from sparse\n  endocardial maps", "comments": "Accepted at the MICCAI 2020 Workshop Statistical Atlases and\n  Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electroanatomic mapping as routinely acquired in ablation therapy of\nventricular tachycardia is the gold standard method to identify the\narrhythmogenic substrate.

The training set consists of data produced\nby a computational model of cardiac electrophysiology on a large cohort of\nsynthetically generated geometries of ischemic hearts. The predicted\ndepolarization pattern has good agreement with activation times computed by the\ncardiac electrophysiology model in a validation set of five swine heart\ngeometries with complex scar and border zone morphologies. The mean absolute\nerror hereby measures 8 ms on the entire myocardium when providing 50\\% of the\nendocardial ground truth in over 500 computed depolarization patterns.\nFurthermore, when considering a complete animal data set with high density\nelectroanatomic mapping data as reference, the neural network can accurately\nreproduce the endocardial depolarization pattern, even when a small percentage\nof measurements are provided as input features (mean absolute error of 7 ms\nwith 50\\% of input samples).
