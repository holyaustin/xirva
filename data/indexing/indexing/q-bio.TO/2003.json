One\nsuch condition is pressure overload where elevated wall stresses stimulate the\ngrowth in cardiomyocyte thickness, associated with a phenotype of concentric\nhypertrophy at the organ scale, and promote fibrosis. The initial hypertrophic\nresponse can be considered adaptive and beneficial by favoring myocyte\nsurvival, but over time if pressure overload conditions persist, maladaptive\nmechanisms favoring cell death and fibrosis start to dominate, ultimately\nmediating the transition towards an overt heart failure phenotype. The\nunderlying mechanisms linking biological factors at the myocyte level to\nbiomechanical factors at the systemic and organ level remain poorly understood.\nComputational models of G&R show high promise as a unique framework for\nproviding a quantitative link between myocardial stresses and strains at the\norgan scale to biological regulatory processes at the cellular level which\ngovern the hypertrophic response. However, microstructurally motivated,\nrigorously validated computational models of G&R are still in their infancy.\nThis article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art of\ncomputational models to study cardiac G&R. The microstructure and\nmechanosensing/mechanotransduction within cells of the myocardium is discussed\nand quantitative data from previous experimental and clinical studies is\nsummarized. We conclude with a discussion of major challenges and possible\ndirections of future research that can advance the current state of cardiac G&R\ncomputational modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2020 11:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Niestrawska", "Justyna A.", ""], ["Augustin", "Christoph M.", ""], ["Plank", "Gernot", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.01042", "submitter": "Dapeng Bi", "authors": "Amit Das, Srikanth Sastry, Dapeng Bi", "title": "Controlled neighbor exchanges drive glassy behavior, intermittency and\n  cell streaming in epithelial tissues", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.CB q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cell neighbor exchanges are integral to tissue rearrangements in biology,\nincluding development and repair.

Previous work evaluated GMT using ideal\nradiofrequency (RF) excitations. The aim of this simulation study was to assess\nGMT performance with a realistic RF coil. Methods: We designed a\ntransmit-receive RF coil with $8$ decoupled channels for $7$T head imaging. We\ncalculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for\ndifferent RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct\nEP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable\nwhen the coil was loaded with different head models. Mean error in EP\nestimation changed from $7.5\\%$ to $9.5\\%$ and from $4.8\\%$ to $7.2\\%$ for\nrelative permittivity and conductivity, respectively, when changing head model\nwithout re-tuning the coil. Results slightly improved when an SVD-based RF\nshimming algorithm was applied, in place of excitation with one coil at a time.\nDespite errors in EP, RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) and absorbed power could be\npredicted with less than $0.5\\%$ error over the entire head. GMT could\naccurately detect a numerically inserted tumor. Conclusion: This work\ndemonstrates that GMT can reliably reconstruct EP in realistic simulated\nscenarios using a tailored 8-channel RF coil design at $7$T. Future work will\nfocus on construction of the coil and optimization of GMT's robustness to\nnoise, to enable in-vivo GMT experiments. Significance: GMT could provide\naccurate estimations of tissue EP, which could be used as biomarkers and could\nenable patient-specific estimation of RF power deposition, which is an unsolved\nproblem for ultra-high-field magnetic resonance imaging.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:11:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Giannakopoulos", "Ilias I.", ""], ["Serrall\u00e9s", "Jos\u00e9 E.

Prior to the formation of\nsomites along the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM), periodic expression of clock\ngenes is observed in its constituent cells. As the PSM expands through the\naddition of new cells at its posterior, the oscillations in the cells closer to\nthe anterior cease and eventually lead to formation of rostral and caudal\nhalves of the somites. This pattern formation is believed to be coordinated by\ninteractions between neighboring cells via receptor-ligand coupling.
