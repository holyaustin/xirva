In addition to massive\ncellular depolarization, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and\nmetabolism -- aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to\ntraumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine.\n  In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on\nmodeling the features essential to understanding the implications of\nneurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium--ATPase,\nmainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a\nrate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is\ndetermined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an\neffective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium\nconcentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex\nexceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of\nvascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation\nplay important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model\nreplicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD --\nvasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation,\nprolonged depolarization -- found in experimental studies.\n  We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the\ncontribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the\nvariability of CSD between species and even within the same animal.

Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the\npericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (Heavy Metal ATPase) transporters.\nThe combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and\nefflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here,\nmathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation,\nHMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of\nzinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.\n  A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in\nroots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the\nstructure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects\nof water flow, diffusion, and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It\nalso incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as\nwell as regulation of ZIP transporters.\n  Steady state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the\nmedium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc\ngradient was reproduced very well. Increase of HMA or decrease in water influx\nled to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium\nconcentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation\ntimes in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to\noscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and\nexistence of buffering agents.\n  The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the\nhypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc\nconcentration.
