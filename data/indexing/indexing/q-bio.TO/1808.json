Previous studies reported\ntwo negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of follicle-stimulating hormone\nreceptor (FSHR), ADX68692 and ADX68693, with differential effects on\nFSHR-mediated steroidogenesis and ovulation. In this study, we attempted to\npharmacologically profile these NAMs on the closely related\nluteinizing/chorionic gonadotropin hormone receptor (LH/CGR) with regards to\nits canonical Gs/cAMP pathway as well as \\beta-arrestin recruitment in HEK293\ncells. The NAMs effects on progesterone and testosterone production were also\nassessed in murine Leydig tumor cell line (mLTC-1). We found that both NAMs\nstrongly antagonized LH/CGR signaling in both HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells. ADX68693\nappeared more potent than ADX68692 to inhibit hCG-induced cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestin 2 in HEK293 and mLTC-1 cells whereas no significant difference\nin their efficacy on hCG-promoted \\beta-arrestin 2 recruitment. Interestingly,\ndifferential antagonism of the two NAMs on hCG-promoted steroidogenesis in\nmLTC-1 cells was observed with significant inhibition of testosterone but not\nprogesterone production. These observations suggest biased effects of the two\nNAMs on LH/CGR-dependent pathways controlling steroidogenesis, which appeared\nto be different to that previously shown on FSHR. This also illustrates the\ncomplexity of signaling pathways controlling FSHR- and LH/CGR-mediated\nsteroidogenesis, suggesting differential implication of cAMP and\n\\beta-arrestins.

However, it also presents a problem: each\nhierarchical level adds a new source of assembly errors, and substantially\nincreases the information required for proper assembly. This seems to conflict\nwith the prevalence of naturally occurring hierarchical structures, suggesting\nthat a common mechanical source of hierarchical robustness may exist.

The consumption of oxygen diffusing into the cells is approximated\nusing Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The problem is transformed to dimensionless\nunits and solved numerically. Two regimes are identified, one that is diffusion\nlimited and the other consumption limited. A regression is fit that describes\nthe concentration at the center of the cells as a function of the relevant\nphysical parameters. It is determined that, in a cell culture environment, the\ncells will remain viable as long as the islet has a radius of around $142 \\mu\nm$ or less and the encapsulating shell has a radius of less than approximately\n$283 \\mu m$. When the islet is on the order of $100 \\mu m$ it is possible for\nthe cells to remain viable in environments with as little as $4.6\\times10^{-2}\nmol/m^{-3}$ $O_2$. These results indicate such an encapsulation scheme may be\nused to prepare artificial pancreas to treat diabetes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 04:50:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Clarence C.", ""], ["Brown", "Amelia Ann", ""], ["Sargin", "Irmak", ""], ["Bratlie", "Kaitlin M.", ""], ["Beckman", "Scott P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.07142", "submitter": "Ivo Siekmann", "authors": "Ivo Siekmann, Stefan Bjelosevic, Kerry Landman, Paul Monagle, Vera\n  Ignjatovic, Edmund Crampin", "title": "Mathematical modelling indicates that lower activity of the haemostatic\n  system in neonates is primarily due to lower prothrombin concentration", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-40435-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.BM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Haemostasis is governed by a highly complex system of interacting proteins.\nDue to the central role of thrombin, thrombin generation and specifically the\nthrombin generation curve (TGC) is commonly used as an indicator of haemostatic\nactivity. Functional characteristics of the haemostatic system in neonates and\nchildren are significantly different compared with adults; at the same time\nplasma levels of haemostatic proteins vary considerably with age. However,\nrelating one to the other has been difficult, both due to significant\ninter-individual differences for individuals of similar age and the complexity\nof the biochemical reactions underlying haemostasis. Mathematical modelling has\nbeen very successful at representing the biochemistry of blood clotting. In\nthis study we address the challenge of large inter-individual variability by\nparameterising the Hockin-Mann model with data from individual patients, across\ndifferent age groups from neonates to adults. Calculating TGCs for each patient\nof a specific age group provides us with insight into the variability of\nhaemostatic activity across that age group. From our model we observe that two\ncommonly used metrics for haemostatic activity are significantly lower in\nneonates than in older patients. Because both metrics are strongly determined\nby prothrombin and prothrombin levels are considerably lower in neonates we\nconclude that decreased haemostatic activity in neonates is due to lower\nprothrombin availability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:39:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Siekmann", "Ivo", ""], ["Bjelosevic", "Stefan", ""], ["Landman", "Kerry", ""], ["Monagle", "Paul", ""], ["Ignjatovic", "Vera", ""], ["Crampin", "Edmund", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.07358", "submitter": "Rasika Karkare", "authors": "Rasika Karkare", "title": "HAC Analysis to Explore Clusters within Chronic Comorbid Inpatient\n  Visits", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1807.04325 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multimorbidities are associated with significant burden on the healthcare\nsystem and the lack of accurate and pertinent statistical exploratory\ntechniques have often limited their analysis.

In experiments, cells are seeded in a porous SC where\nover a month, the SC slowly degrades while cells divide and synthesize\nextracellular matrix (ECM) constituents. We use an off-lattice cellular\nautomaton framework to model the individual behavior of cells within the SC.\nThe movement of cells and the ability to reproduce is determined by the\nnutrient profile and local porosity. A phenomenological approach is used to\ncapture a continuous profile for SC and ECM evolution, which will then change\nthe local porosity. We parameterize the model by matching total cell counts to\nchondrocytes seeded in a polyglycolic acid SC. We investigate the total cell\ncount and location of various cell populations for different initial SC\nporosities. Similar to experiments, we observe cell counts that level off\naround day 15 with higher values in SCs of lower initial porosity. Cell\nclustering is observed in regions at the edge of the construct that are close\nto the nutrient-rich medium in the fluid bath. Model results show that a bias\nin motion due to sensitivity to porosity allows cells to move in a more optimal\narrangement. We investigate the distribution of cells as the cell reproduction\nrate, cell movement distance, and sensitivity to porosity is varied. We observe\nnon monotonic changes in total cell counts within different regions of the\nconstruct due to the interplay between porosity and cellular movement. We also\nanalyze the emergent average cell speed for different initial SC porosities,\nobserving an higher average for the lowest initial SC porosity.
