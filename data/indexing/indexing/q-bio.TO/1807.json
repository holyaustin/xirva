Thirty quail embryos were collected for\nthe current study (5 embryos/ day) during the period between Day (D) 5 and D10\nof embryonic development and processed for light microscopy. The\ndifferentiation of mesenchymal condensation in to the chondrogenic cells was\nobserved at D5 whereas the secretion of extracellular matrix could be evident\nat D6. The cartilage primordia were observed by D7 which were consisted of\nchondrocytes, embedded in matrix and surrounded by perichondrium.

This template attained the shape of future\nsternum by D9, which was more distinct at D10. These preliminary observations\nsuggested that the quail sternum grows through endochondral ossification.

Lymphangions, the spontaneously contracting units of the\nlymphatic system, are sensitive to luminal wall shear stress. In this study,\nthe response of the lymphangions to dynamically varying wall shear stress is\ncharacterized in isolated rat thoracic ducts in relation to their shear\nsensitivity. The critical shear stress above which the thoracic duct shows\nsubstantial inhibition of contraction was found to be significantly negatively\ncorrelated to the diameter of the lymphangion. The entrainment of the\nlymphangion to an applied oscillatory shear stress was found to be\nsignificantly dependent on the difference between the applied frequency and\nintrinsic frequency of contraction of the lymphangion. The strength of\nentrainment was also positively correlated to the applied shear stress when\nthis shear was below the critical shear stress. The results suggest an\nadaptation of the lymphangion contractility to the existing oscillatory\nmechanical shear stress as a function of its intrinsic contractility and shear\nsensitivity.
