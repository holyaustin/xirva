Their resemblance to traditional viscous\nfingering patterns in driven fluids suggests that epithelial fingers could\narise from an interfacial instability. However, the existence and physical\nmechanism of such a putative instability remain unclear. Here, based on an\nactive polar fluid model for epithelial spreading, we analytically predict a\ngeneric instability of the tissue front. On the one hand, active cellular\ntraction forces impose a velocity gradient that leads to an accelerated front,\nwhich is, thus, unstable to long-wavelength perturbations. On the other hand,\ncontractile intercellular stresses typically dominate over surface tension in\nstabilizing short-wavelength perturbations. Finally, the finite range of\nhydrodynamic interactions in the tissue selects a wavelength for the fingering\npattern, which is, thus, given by the smallest between the tissue size and the\nhydrodynamic screening length. Overall, we show that spreading epithelia\nexperience an active fingering instability based on a simple kinematic\nmechanism. Moreover, our results underscore the crucial role of long-range\nhydrodynamic interactions in the dynamics of tissue morphology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Mar 2019 21:47:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Alert", "Ricard", ""], ["Blanch-Mercader", "Carles", ""], ["Casademunt", "Jaume", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.02346", "submitter": "Daniela Sapienza", "authors": "Daniela Sapienza, Alessio Asmundo, Salvatore Silipigni, Ugo Barbaro,\n  Antonella Cinquegrani, Francesca Granata, Valeria Barresi, Patrizia\n  Gualniera, Antonio Bottari, Michele Gaeta", "title": "Quantitative MRI molecular imaging in the evaluation of early post\n  mortem changes in muscles.

Serum C1M, plasma\nand synovial fluid IL-6 (p-IL-6, sf-IL-6) were measured in 104 end-stage knee\nOA patients. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to\nsemi-quantitatively assess an 11-point synovitis score; pain was assessed by\nthe Western Ontario & McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and\nthe Neuropathic Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). Linear regression was used to\ninvestigate associations between biomarkers and synovitis, and biomarkers and\npain while controlling for age, sex and body mass index. We also tested whether\nassociations between biomarkers and pain were confounded by synovitis. We found\nsf-IL-6 was associated with synovitis in the parapatellar subregion (B=0.006;\n95% CI 0.003-0.010), and no association between p-IL-6 and synovitis. We also\nobserved an association between C1M and synovitis in the peri-ligamentous\nsubregion (B=0.013; 95% CI 0.003-0.023).

There was no association between C1M and WOMAC\npain but we did find an association between C1M and NPQ (B=0.229; 95% CI\n0.036-0.422). Lastly, synovitis explained both biomarker-NPQ associations, but\nnot the biomarker-WOMAC association.

The etiology of neuromuscular fatigue\nwas identified using non-invasive methods such as surface electromyography,\nnear-infrared spectroscopy, magnetic nerve stimulation and twitch interpolation\ntechnique.Results The number of repetitions was significantly lower in men at\nOPT (14.8$\\pm$3.2) and LONG (15.8$\\pm$5.8) than boys (39.7$\\pm$18.4 and 29.5\n$\\pm$10.2, respectively; p<0.001), while no difference was found at SHORT\nbetween both age groups (boys: 33.7$\\pm$15.4, men: 40.9$\\pm$14.2). At OPT and\nLONG boys showed a lower reduction in the single potentiated twitch (Qtwpot)\nand a greater decrease in the voluntary activation level (VA) than men. At\nSHORT, both populations displayed a moderate Qtwpot decrement and a significant\nVA reduction (p<0.001). The differences in maximal torque between boys and men\nwere almost twice greater at OPT (223.9 N.m) than at SHORT (123.3 N.m) and LONG\n(136.5 N.m).Conclusion The differences in neuromuscular fatigue between\nchildren and adults are dependent on MTU length. Differences in maximal torque\ncould underpin differences in neuromuscular fatigue between children and adults\nat OPT and SHORT. However, at LONG these differences do not seem to be\nexplained by differences in maximal torque. The origins of this specific effect\nof MTU length remain to be determined.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2019 10:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Piponnier", "Enzo", "", "AME2P"], ["Martin", "Vincent", "", "AME2P"], ["Chalchat", "Emeric", "", "AME2P"], ["Bontemps", "Bastien", "", "AME2P"], ["Julian", "Val\u00e9rie", "", "UB"], ["Bocock", "Olivia", "", "UB"], ["Duclos", "Martine", "", "UNH"], ["Ratel", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "AME2P"]]}, {"id": "1903.12009", "submitter": "Dana Sherman", "authors": "Dana Sherman and David Harel", "title": "Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of the pharyngeal motions in\n  Caenorhabditis elegans", "comments": "32 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The pharynx of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a neuromuscular pump\nthat exhibits two typical motions: pumping and peristalsis.
