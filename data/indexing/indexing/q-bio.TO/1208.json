The\ncochlea not only acts as a passive detector of sound, however, but can also\nproduce tones itself. These otoacoustic emissions are a striking manifestation\nof the cochlea's mechanical active process. A controversy remains of how these\nmechanical signals propagate back to the middle ear, from which they are\nemitted as sound. Here we combine theoretical and experimental studies to show\nthat mechanical signals can be transmitted by waves on Reissner's membrane, an\nelastic structure within the cochea. We develop a theory for wave propagation\non Reissner's membrane and its role in otoacoustic emissions. Employing a\nscanning laser interferometer, we measure traveling waves on Reissner's\nmembrane in the gerbil, guinea pig, and chinchilla. The results accord with the\ntheory and thus support a role for Reissner's membrane in otoacoustic\nemissions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 20:49:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Reichenbach", "Tobias", ""], ["Stefanovic", "Aleksandra", ""], ["Nin", "Fumiaki", ""], ["Hudspeth", "A.

One of the most commonly used models is represented\nby the bidomain equations, the derivation of which relies on a homogenisation\ntechnique to construct a suitable approximation to the discrete model. This\nderivation does not explicitly account for the presence of gap junctions\nconnecting one cell to another. It has been seen experimentally [Rohr,\nCardiovasc. Res. 2004] that these gap junctions have a marked effect on the\npropagation of the action potential, specifically as the upstroke of the wave\npasses through the gap junction.\n  In this paper we explicitly include gap junctions in a both a 2D discrete\nmodel of cardiac electrophysiology, and the corresponding continuum model, on a\nsimplified cell geometry. Using these models we compare the results of\nsimulations using both continuum and discrete systems. We see that the form of\nthe action potential as it passes through gap junctions cannot be replicated\nusing a continuum model, and that the underlying propagation speed of the\naction potential ceases to match up between models when gap junctions are\nintroduced. In addition, the results of the discrete simulations match the\ncharacteristics of those shown in Rohr 2004. From this, we suggest that a\nhybrid model -- a discrete system following the upstroke of the action\npotential, and a continuum system elsewhere -- may give a more accurate\ndescription of cardiac electrophysiology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Aug 2012 16:00:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Bruce", "Doug", "", "Computational Biology Group, Department of Computer\n  Science, University of Oxford"], ["Pathmanathan", "Pras", "", "Computational Biology\n  Group, Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford"], ["Whiteley", "Jonathan P.", "", "Computational Biology Group, Department of Computer Science,\n  University of Oxford"]]}, {"id": "1208.4217", "submitter": "Miroslaw Rewekant PhD MD", "authors": "Piekarski S. and M.

In cortical bone, a linear phenomenological relationship between\nmatrix apposition rate (MAR) and BMU cavity radius is found experimentally. How\nthis relationship emerges from the combination of complex, nonlinear\nregulations of osteoblast number and secretory activity is unknown.\n  Here, we extend our previous mathematical model of cell development within a\nsingle BMU to investigate how osteoblast number and osteoblast secretory\nactivity vary along the BMU's closing cone. MARs predicted by the model are\ncompared with data from tetracycline double labelling experiments. We find that\nthe linear phenomenological relationship observed in these experiments between\nMAR and BMU cavity radius holds for most of the refilling phase simulated by\nour model, but not near the start and end of refilling. This suggests that at a\nparticular bone site undergoing remodelling, bone formation starts and ends\nrapidly. Our model also suggests that part of the observed cross-sectional\nvariability in tetracycline data may be due to different bone sites being\nrefilled by BMUs at different stages of their lifetime. The different stages of\na BMU's lifetime depend on whether the cell populations within the BMU are\nstill developing or have reached a quasi-steady state while travelling through\nbone. We find that due to their longer lifespan, active osteoblasts reach a\nquasi-steady distribution more slowly than active osteoclasts. We suggest that\nthis fact may locally enlarge the Haversian canal diameter (due to a local lack\nof osteoblasts compared to osteoclasts) near the BMU's point of origin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 04:10:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 Nov 2012 17:04:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 05:49:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Buenzli", "Pascal R.", ""], ["Pivonka", "Peter", ""], ["Smith", "David W.", ""]]}]
