Here we aim to examine the\nexpression profiles of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and of\ntransient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)\nand extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and to assess the possible\ntherapeutic strategies through blockade of transient receptor potential (TRP)\nchannels. Methods: Cancer was induced within the sciatic nerves of male\nCopenhagen rats, and tissues from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were collected and\nused for measurements of immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The TRPV1\nantagonist capsazepine, the selective TRPV4 antagonist HC-067047 and the\ncalcium ions inhibitor ruthenium red were used to treat thermal and/or\nmechanical hyperalgesia. Results: Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1\nshowed a lower expression in DRGs on days 7 and 14. The expression of TRPV4,\nTLR4 and ERK1/2 showed an increase on day 3 then a decrease on days 7 and 14.\nTRPV1 and TLR4 as well as TRPV4 and ERK1/2 co-existed on the same neuronal\ncells. The neuropathic pain was reversed in dose-dependent manners by using the\nTRP antagonists and the calcium ions inhibitor. Conclusion: The decreased\nexpression of TRPV1 and TRPV4 is associated with high activation. The increased\nexpression of TLR4 and ERK1/2 reveals earlier immune response and tumor\nprogression, respectively, and their ultimate decrease is an indicator of nerve\ndamage. We studied the possible role of TRPV1 and TRPV4 in transducing\ncancer-induced hyperalgesia. The possible treatment strategies of\ncancer-induced thermal and/or mechanical hyperalgesia using capsazepine,\nHC-067047 and ruthenium red are examined.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2018 18:03:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Maqboul", "Ahmad", ""], ["Elsadek", "Bakheet", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.00757", "submitter": "Ricardo Ruiz Baier I", "authors": "Ricardo Ruiz Baier, Alessio Gizzi, Alessandro Loppini, Christian\n  Cherubini, Simonetta Filippi", "title": "Modelling thermo-electro-mechanical effects in orthotropic cardiac\n  tissue", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Communications in Computational Physics (2019)", "doi": "10.4208/cicp.OA-2018-0253", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a new mathematical model for the active\ncontraction of cardiac muscle, featuring different thermo-electric and\nnonlinear conductivity properties.
