Different\ndynamical patterns such as ectopic foci, localized and meandering spiral waves\nare found depending on the characteristics of the inhomogeneities. Their\nappearance in dependence of the size and strength of the inhomogeneities is\nquantified by phase diagrams. Furthermore it is shown that regularly paced\nwaves in a region R, that is connected by a small bridge connection to another\nregion L with perturbing waves emanating from an additional pacemaker, can be\nstrongly disturbed, so that a fibrillatory state emerges in region R after a\ntransient time interval. This finding supports conjectures that fibrillatory\nstates in the right atrium can be induced by self-excitatory pacemakers in the\nleft atrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Apr 2010 16:08:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lenk", "Claudia", ""], ["Einax", "Mario", ""], ["Maass", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4388", "submitter": "David Young", "authors": "David A.

A model is needed that can produce these shapes\nwith a small set of parameters. This paper presents a simple model of leaf\nshape based on a growth algorithm, which governs the growth rate of leaf tissue\nin two dimensions and hence the outline of the leaf. The growth of leaf lobes\nis governed by the position of leaf veins. This model gives an approximation to\na wide variety of higher plant leaf shapes. The variation of leaf shapes found\nin closely related plants is discussed in terms of variability in the growth\nalgorithms. The model can be extended to more complex leaf types.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Apr 2010 23:09:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "David A.", ""]]}]
