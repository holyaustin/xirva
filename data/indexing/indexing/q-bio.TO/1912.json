The gold standard\nin drug development remains microscopic imaging of liver stage parasites in in\nvitro cell culture models. Image analysis presents a major bottleneck in this\npipeline since the parasite has significant variability in size, shape, and\ndensity in these models. As with other highly variable datasets, traditional\nsegmentation models have poor generalizability as they rely on hand-crafted\nfeatures; thus, manual annotation of liver stage malaria images remains\nstandard. To address this need, we develop a convolutional neural network\narchitecture that utilizes spatial dropout sampling for parasite segmentation\nand epistemic uncertainty estimation in images of liver stage malaria. Our\npipeline produces high-precision segmentations nearly identical to expert\nannotations, generalizes well on a diverse dataset of liver stage malaria\nparasites, and promotes independence between learned feature maps to model the\nuncertainty of generated predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Nov 2019 20:57:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Soleimany", "Ava P.", ""], ["Suresh", "Harini", ""], ["Ortiz", "Jose Javier Gonzalez", ""], ["Shanmugam", "Divya", ""], ["Gural", "Nil", ""], ["Guttag", "John", ""], ["Bhatia", "Sangeeta N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.00989", "submitter": "Namrata Gundiah", "authors": "Aritra Chatterjee, Nimesh R.

Research studies dedicated to ATAA tend more and\nmore to invoke multifactorial eects. In the current review, we show that all\nthese eects converge towards a single paradigm relying upon the crucial\nbiome-chanical role played by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in controlling the\ndistribution of mechanical stresses across the aortic wall. The chapter is\norganized as follows. In section 6.2, we introduce the basics of arterial wall\nbiomechanics and how the stresses are distributed across its dierent layers and\namong the main structural constituents: collagen, elastin, and SMCs. In section\n6.3, we introduce the biome-chanical active role of SMCs and its main\nregulators. We show how SMCs actively regulate the distribution of stresses\nacross the aortic wall and among the main structural constituents. In section\n6.4, we review studies showing that SMCs tend to have a preferred homeostatic\ntension. We show that mechanosensing can be understood as a reaction to\nhomeostasis unbalance of SMC tension. Through the use of layer-specic\nmultiscale modeling of the arterial wall, it is revealed that the quantication\nof SMC homeostatic tension is crucial to predict numerically the initiation and\ndevelopment of ATAA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:08:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Petit", "Claudie", "", "SAINBIOSE-ENSMSE"], ["Mousavi", "S.

A deeper insight into spinal\nloading could provide valuable information for the improvement of current\ntreatment strategies. This work therefore aimed at using subject-specific\nmusculoskeletal full-body models of patients with AIS to predict segmental\ncompressive forces around the curve apex and to investigate how these forces\nare affected by simulated load carrying. Models were created based on spatially\ncalibrated biplanar radiographic images from 24 patients with mild to moderate\nAIS and validated by comparing predictions of paravertebral muscle activity\nwith reported values from in vivo studies. Spinal compressive forces were\npredicted during unloaded upright standing as well as upright standing with\nexternal loads of 10%, 15% and 20% of body weight (BW) applied to the scapulae\nto simulate carrying a backpack in the regular way, in front of the body and\nover both shoulders. The validation studies showed higher convex muscle\nactivity, which was comparable to the literature. The implementation of spinal\ndeformity resulted in a 10% increase of compressive force at the curve apex\nduring unloaded upright standing. Apical compressive forces further increased\nby 50-62%, 77-94% and 103-128% for 10%, 15% and 20% BW loads, respectively.\nMoreover, load-dependent compressive force increases were the lowest in the\nregular backpack and the highest in the frontpack and convex conditions. The\npredictions indicated increased segmental compressive forces during unloaded\nstanding, which could be ascribed to the scoliotic deformation. When carrying\nloads, compressive forces further increased depending on the carrying mode and\nthe weight of the load. These results can be used as a basis for further\nstudies investigating segmental loading in AIS patients during functional\nactivities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 09:34:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2020 21:08:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schmid", "Stefan", ""], ["Burkhart", "Katelyn A.", ""], ["Allaire", "Brett T.", ""], ["Grindle", "Daniel", ""], ["Bassani", "Tito", ""], ["Galbusera", "Fabio", ""], ["Anderson", "Dennis E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.08937", "submitter": "Faisal Mahmood", "authors": "Richard J.

METHODS A total of 740 unbound\nMPA (uMPA), 741 total MPA (tMPA) and 734 total MPAG (tMPAG) concentration-time\ndata from 58 Chinese kidney transplant patients were analysed using a nonlinear\nmixed-effect model. The influence of covariates was tested using a stepwise\nprocedure. RESULTS The PK of unbound MPA and MPAG were characterised by a two-\nand one-compartment model with first-order elimination, respectively. Apparent\nclearance of uMPA (CLuMPA/F) was estimated to be 852 L/h with a relative\nstandard error (RSE) of 7.1%. The tMPA and uMPA were connected using a linear\nprotein binding model, in which the protein binding rate constant (kB)\nincreased non-linearly with the serum albumin (ALB) concentration. The\nestimated kB was 53.4 /h (RSE, 2.3%) for patients with ALB of 40 g/L. In\naddition, model-based simulation showed that changes in ALB substantially\naffected tMPA but not uMPA exposure.
