Recent studies have indicated that intra-tumoural heterogeneity has a\nsignificant role in driving resistance to chemotherapy in many human\nmalignancies. Multiple factors including the internal cell-cycle dynamics and\nthe external microenvironement contribute to the intra-tumoural heterogeneity.\nIn this paper we present a hybrid, multiscale, individual-based mathematical\nmodel, incorporating internal cell-cycle dynamics and changes in oxygen\nconcentration, to study the effects of delivery of several different\nchemotherapeutic drugs on the heterogeneous subpopulations of cancer cells with\nvarying cell-cycle dynamics. The computational simulation results from the\nmultiscale model are in good agreement with available experimental data and\nsupport the hypothesis that slow-cycling sub-populations of tumour cells within\na growing tumour mass can induce drug resistance to chemotherapy and thus the\nuse of conventional chemotherapy may actually result in the emergence of\ndominant, therapy-resistant, slow-cycling subpopulations of tumour cells. Our\nresults indicate that the appearance of this chemotherapeutic resistance is\nmainly due to the inability of the administered drug to target all cancer cells\nirrespective of the stage in the cell-cycle they are in i.e. most\nchemotherapeutic drugs target cells in a particular phase/phases of the\ncell-cycle, and hence always spare some cancer cells that are not in the\ntargeted cell-cycle phase/phases. The results also suggest that this\ncell-cycle-mediated drug resistance may be overcome by using multiple doses of\ncell-cycle, phase-specific chemotherapy that targets cells in all phases and\nits appropriate sequencing and scheduling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 11:03:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Powathil", "Gibin G", ""], ["Chaplain", "Mark AJ", ""], ["Swat", "Maciej", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1524", "submitter": "Paolo Zuliani", "authors": "Bing Liu, Soonho Kong, Sicun Gao, Paolo Zuliani and Edmund M.

In this paper we focus on parameter synthesis for hybrid\n(continuous/discrete) models, as many biological systems can possess multiple\noperational modes with specific continuous dynamics in each mode. These\nbiological systems are naturally modeled as hybrid automata, most often with\nnonlinear continuous dynamics. However, hybrid automata are notoriously hard to\nanalyze --- even simple reachability for hybrid systems with linear\ndifferential dynamics is an undecidable problem. In this paper we present a\nparameter synthesis framework based on $\\delta$-complete decision procedures\nthat sidesteps undecidability. We demonstrate our method on two highly\nnonlinear hybrid models of the cardiac cell action potential. The results show\nthat our parameter synthesis framework is convenient and efficient, and it\nenabled us to select a suitable model to study and identify crucial parameter\nranges related to cardiac disorders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 18:41:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 11:43:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Sep 2014 15:01:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Bing", ""], ["Kong", "Soonho", ""], ["Gao", "Sicun", ""], ["Zuliani", "Paolo", ""], ["Clarke", "Edmund M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.3147", "submitter": "Katrin B\\\"ottger", "authors": "Katrin B\\\"ottger, Haralambos Hatzikirou, Anja Voss-Boehme, Miguel A.\n  Herrero, Andreas Deutsch", "title": "Emerging Allee effect in tumor growth", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Tumor cells develop different features to adapt to environmental conditions.\nA prominent example is the ability of tumor cells to switch between migratory\nand proliferative phenotypes, a phenomenon known as go-or-grow mechanism. It is\nhowever unclear how this particular phenotypic plasticity affects overall tumor\ngrowth. To address this problem, we formulate and study a mathematical model of\nspatio-temporal tumor dynamics where different responses to local cell density\nmediate the go-or-grow dichotomy. Our analysis reveals that two dynamic regimes\ncan be distinguished. If cell motility is allowed to increase with local cell\ndensity, any tumor cell population will persist in time, irrespective of its\ninitial size. On the contrary, if cell motility is assumed to decrease with\nrespect to local cell density, an Allee effect emerges, so that any tumor\npopulation below a certain size threshold eventually extinguishes. These\nresults suggest that strategies aimed at hindering migration, for instance by\nenhancing contact inhibition, are worth to be explored as alternatives to those\nmainly focused at checking tumor proliferation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jul 2014 13:19:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-14", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00f6ttger", "Katrin", ""], ["Hatzikirou", "Haralambos", ""], ["Voss-Boehme", "Anja", ""], ["Herrero", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Deutsch", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7114", "submitter": "Denis Menshykau", "authors": "Tam\\'as Kurics, Denis Menshykau and Dagmar Iber", "title": "Feedbacks, Receptor Clustering, and Receptor Restriction to Single Cells\n  yield large Turing Spaces for Ligand-receptor based Turing Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.90.022716", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Turing mechanisms can yield a large variety of patterns from noisy,\nhomogenous initial conditions and have been proposed as patterning mechanism\nfor many developmental processes. However, the molecular components that give\nrise to Turing patterns have remained elusive, and the small size of the\nparameter space that permits Turing patterns to emerge makes it difficult to\nexplain how Turing patterns could evolve. We have recently shown that Turing\npatterns can be obtained with a single ligand if the ligand-receptor\ninteraction is taken into account. Here we show that the general properties of\nligand-receptor systems result in very large Turing spaces. Thus, the\nrestriction of receptors to single cells, negative feedbacks, regulatory\ninteractions between different ligand-receptor systems, and the clustering of\nreceptors on the cell surface all greatly enlarge the Turing space. We further\nshow that the feedbacks that occur in the FGF10/SHH network that controls lung\nbranching morphogenesis are sufficient to result in large Turing spaces. We\nconclude that the cellular restriction of receptors provides a mechanism to\nsufficiently increase the size of the Turing space to make the evolution of\nTuring patterns likely. Additional feedbacks may then have further enlarged the\nTuring space. Given their robustness and flexibility, we propose that\nreceptor-ligand based Turing mechanisms present a general mechanism for\npatterning in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jul 2014 09:48:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kurics", "Tam\u00e1s", ""], ["Menshykau", "Denis", ""], ["Iber", "Dagmar", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7853", "submitter": "Irina Kareva", "authors": "Irina Kareva", "title": "Competition driven cancer immunoediting", "comments": "This paper is an abridged version of the following manuscript: Kareva\n  I., Beheshti, A., L.

What is often neglected is that\ncytotoxic cells of the immune system also have increased energy demands and\nalso switch to pure glycolysis when they are in an activated state. Moreover,\nwhile cancer cells can revert back to aerobic metabolism, rapidly proliferating\ncytotoxic lymphocytes are incapable of performing their function when adequate\nresources are lacking.
