In this study, local distributions of\ndeposited inhaled radon progenies in airway bifurcation models were computed at\nexposure conditions, which are characteristic of homes and uranium mines. Then,\nmaximum local deposition enhancement factors at bronchial airway bifurcations,\nexpressed as the ratio of local to average deposition densities, were\ndetermined to characterize the inhomogeneity of deposition and to elucidate\ntheir effect on resulting hit probabilities. The results obtained suggest that\nin the vicinity of the carinal regions of the central airways the probability\nof multiple hits can be quite high even at low average doses. Assuming a\nuniform distribution of activity there are practically no multiple hits and the\nhit probability as a function of dose exhibits a linear shape in the low dose\nrange. The results are quite the opposite in the case of hot spots revealed by\nrealistic deposition calculations, where practically all cells receive multiple\nhits and the hit probability as a function of dose is non-linear in the average\ndose range of 10-100 mGy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 08:00:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bal\u00e1sh\u00e1zy", "Imre", ""], ["Farkas", "\u00c1rp\u00e1d", ""], ["Madas", "Bal\u00e1zs Gergely", ""], ["Hofmann", "Werner", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2898", "submitter": "Uwe Aickelin", "authors": "Grazziela P.

Recent studies have shown that in vitro\nstimulation of T cells can help in the treatment of patients. There are many\nfactors that have to be considered when simulating an organism's\nimmunocompetence. Our particular interest lies in the study of loss of\nimmunocompetence with age. We are trying to answer questions such as: Given a\ncertain age of a patient, how fit is their immune system to fight cancer? Would\nan immune boost improve the effectiveness of a cancer treatment given the\npatient's immune phenotype and age? We believe that understanding the processes\nof immune system ageing and degradation through computer simulation may help in\nanswering these questions. Specifically, we have decided to look at the change\nin numbers of naive T cells with age, as they play a important role in\nresponses to cancer and anti-tumour vaccination. In this work we present an\nagent-based simulation model to understand the interactions which influence the\nnaive T cell populations over time. Our agent model is based on existing\nmathematical system dynamic model, but in comparisons offers better scope for\ncustomisation and detailed analysis. We believe that the results obtained can\nin future help with the modelling of T cell populations inside tumours.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 17:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Figueredo", "Grazziela P.", ""], ["Aickelin", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.3813", "submitter": "Berta Cillero-Pastor", "authors": "Berta Cillero-Pastor, Gert Eijkel, Andras Kiss, Francisco J.

A higher intensity of oleic acid and other fatty acids in the OA\ncartilages exhibited a similar localization. On the other hand, CN(-) was\nobserved with a higher intensity in the healthy samples.
