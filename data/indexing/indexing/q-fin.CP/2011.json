Langevin dynamics are mapped onto an equivalent quantum\nmechanical (QM) system. Borrowing ideas from supersymmetric quantum mechanics\n(SUSY QM), we use a parameterized ground state wave function (WF) of this QM\nsystem as a direct input to the model, which also fixes a non-linear Langevin\npotential. A stationary distribution of the original Langevin model is given by\nthe square of this WF, and thus is also a direct input to the model. Using a\ntwo-component Gaussian mixture as a ground state WF with an asymmetric double\nwell potential produces a tractable low-parametric model with interpretable\nparameters, referred to as the NES (Non-Equilibrium Skew) model. Supersymmetry\n(SUSY) is then used to find time-dependent solutions of the model in an\nanalytically tractable way. The model produces time-varying variance, skewness\nand kurtosis of market returns, whose time variability can be linked to\nprobabilities of crisis-like events. For option pricing out of equilibrium, the\nNES model offers a closed-form approximation by a mixture of three\nBlack-Scholes prices, which can be calibrated to index options data and used to\npredict moments of future returns. The NES model is shown to be able to\ndescribe both regimes of a benign market and a market in a crisis or a severe\ndistress.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 01:56:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2020 04:53:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Halperin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.04256", "submitter": "Matteo Gardini", "authors": "Matteo Gardini, Piergiacomo Sabino, Emanuela Sasso", "title": "A bivariate Normal Inverse Gaussian process with stochastic delay:\n  efficient simulations and applications to energy markets", "comments": "26 pages, 4 figures, 13 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.PR q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using the concept of self-decomposable subordinators introduced in Gardini et\nal.

Although many deep learning models have recently\nbeen proposed in this domain, most of them treat the stock trading time-series\ndata as 2-D image data, whereas its true nature is 1-D time-series data. Since\nthe stock trading systems are multi-channel data, many existing techniques\ntreating them as 1-D time-series data are not suggestive of any technique to\neffectively fusion the information carried by the multiple channels. To\ncontribute towards both of these shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end\nsupervised learning framework inspired by the previously established\n(unsupervised) convolution transform learning framework. Our approach consists\nof processing the data channels through separate 1-D convolution layers, then\nfusing the outputs with a series of fully-connected layers, and finally\napplying a softmax classification layer. The peculiarity of our framework -\nSuperDeConFuse (SDCF), is that we remove the nonlinear activation located\nbetween the multi-channel convolution layers and the fully-connected layers, as\nwell as the one located between the latter and the output layer. We compensate\nfor this removal by introducing a suitable regularization on the aforementioned\nlayer outputs and filters during the training phase. Specifically, we apply a\nlogarithm determinant regularization on the layer filters to break symmetry and\nforce diversity in the learnt transforms, whereas we enforce the non-negativity\nconstraint on the layer outputs to mitigate the issue of dead neurons. This\nresults in the effective learning of a richer set of features and filters with\nrespect to a standard convolutional neural network. Numerical experiments\nconfirm that the proposed model yields considerably better results than\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques for real-world problem of stock\ntrading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2020 11:58:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Pooja", ""], ["Majumdar", "Angshul", ""], ["Chouzenoux", "Emilie", ""], ["Chierchia", "Giovanni", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.06430", "submitter": "Xingchen Wan", "authors": "Xingchen Wan, Jie Yang, Slavi Marinov, Jan-Peter Calliess, Stefan\n  Zohren, Xiaowen Dong", "title": "Sentiment Correlation in Financial News Networks and Associated Market\n  Movements", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures, 1 table (29 pages including References and\n  Appendices).
