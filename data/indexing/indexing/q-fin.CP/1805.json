We extracted tweets on an hourly basis for a period of 3.5\nweeks, classifying each tweet as positive, neutral, or negative. We then\ncompiled these tweets into an hourly sentiment index, creating an unweighted\nand weighted index, with the latter giving larger weight to retweets. These two\nindices, alongside the raw summations of positive, negative, and neutral\nsentiment were juxtaposed to $\\sim 400$ data points of hourly pricing data to\ntrain an Extreme Gradient Boosting Regression Tree Model. Price predictions\nproduced from this model were compared to historical price data, with the\nresulting predictions having a 0.81 correlation with the testing data. Our\nmodel's predictive data yielded statistical significance at the $p < 0.0001$\nlevel.

The stock price\nevolution is driven by the aggregated investment decision of all agents. In\nfact, we are faced with a differential game since all agents aim to invest\noptimal. Mathematically such a problem is ill posed and we introduce the\nconcept of Nash equilibrium solutions to ensure the existence of a solution.\nEspecially, we denote an agent who solves this Nash equilibrium exactly a\nrational agent. As next step we use model predictive control to approximate the\ncontrol problem. This enables us to derive a precise mathematical\ncharacterization of the degree of rationality of a financial agent.

In a second step we consider the case of a fully myopic agent, where\nwe can solve the optimal investment decision of investors analytically. We\nselect the running cost to be the expected missed revenue of an agent and we\nassume quadratic transaction costs.
