When present values of\nbuilding instruments are expressed as linear combinations of some primary\nquantities such as zero-coupon bonds, discount factor, or survival probabilit-\nies, arbitrage-free bounds can be derived for those quantities at the most\nliquid maturities. As a matter of example, we present an iterative procedure\nthat allows to compute model-free bounds for OIS-implied discount rates and\nCDS-implied default probabilities. We then show how mean-reverting term\nstructure models can be used as generators of admissible curves. This framework\nis based on a particular specification of the mean-reverting level which al-\nlows to perfectly reproduce market quotes of standard vanilla interest-rate and\ndefault-risky securities while preserving a certain degree of smoothness. The\nnumerical results suggest that, for both OIS discounting curves and CDS credit\ncurves, the operational task of term- structure construction may be associated\nwith a significant degree of uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2014 18:47:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cousin", "Areski", "", "SAF"], ["Niang", "Ibrahima", "", "SAF"]]}, {"id": "1404.1180", "submitter": "Louis Paulot", "authors": "Calypso Herrera and Louis Paulot", "title": "Parallel American Monte Carlo", "comments": "36 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for American Monte Carlo that can\nbe used either for American-style options, callable structured products or for\ncomputing counterparty credit risk (e.g. CVA or PFE computation).
