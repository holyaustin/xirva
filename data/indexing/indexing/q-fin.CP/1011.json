In\nparticular, we focus on stochastic volatility models, such as the exponential\nVasicek model, and extend the pricing formulas and propagator of this model to\nincorporate jump diffusion with a given jump size distribution. This model is\nof importance to include non-Gaussian fluctuations beyond the Black-Scholes\nmodel, and moreover yields a lognormal distribution of the volatilities, in\nagreement with results from superstatistical analysis.
