The developed method, as well as for the\ncalculation of prices and Greeks, can also be employed to compute the\nno-arbitrage fee, which is a common practice in the Variable Annuities sector.\nNumerical experiments show that the accuracy of the values estimated by GPR is\nhigh with very low computational cost.
