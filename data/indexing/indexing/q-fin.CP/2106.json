Such modeling arises whenever certain components of a\nstochastic model are stochastically determined by other models. There are at\nleast two main areas of applications, including (1) portfolio risk management\nin the banking sector and (2) principle-based reserving and capital\nrequirements in the insurance sector. As financial instrument values often\nchange with economic fundamentals, the risk management of a portfolio (outer\nloop) often requires the assessment of financial positions subject to changes\nin risk factors in the immediate future. The valuation of financial position\n(inner loop) is based on projections of cashflows and risk factors into the\ndistant future. The nesting of such stochastic modeling can be computationally\nchallenging.\n  Most of existing techniques to speed up nested simulations are based on curve\nfitting. The main idea is to establish a functional relationship between inner\nloop estimator and risk factors by running a limited set of economic scenarios,\nand, instead of running inner loop simulations, inner loop estimations are made\nby feeding other scenarios into the fitted curve. This paper presents a\nnon-conventional approach based on the concept of sample recycling. Its essence\nis to run inner loop estimation for a small set of outer loop scenarios and to\nfind inner loop estimates under other outer loop scenarios by recycling those\nknown inner loop paths.

It replaces a traditional order book type of\ntrading common on centralized exchanges (CEX) with a deterministic model that\nswaps currencies (or tokens/assets) along a fixed price function determined by\nthe amount of currencies supplied by the liquidity providers. Liquidity\nproviders can be regarded as investors in the decentralized exchange and earn\nfixed commissions per trade. They lock up funds in liquidity pools for distinct\npairs of currencies allowing market participants to swap them using the fixed\nprice function. Liquidity providers take on market risk as a liquidity provider\nin exchange for earning commissions on each trade. Here we analyze the risk\nprofile of a liquidity provider and the so called impermanent (unrealized) loss\nin particular. We provide an improved version of the commonly denoted\nimpermanent loss function for Uniswap v2 on the semi-infinite domain. The\ndifferences between Uniswap v2 and v3 are also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 05:38:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Aigner", "Andreas A.", ""], ["Dhaliwal", "Gurvinder", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15452", "submitter": "Matteo Gardini", "authors": "Gardini, M. and Sabino, P. and Sasso, E", "title": "The Variance Gamma++ Process and Applications to Energy Markets", "comments": "39 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this article is to introduce a new L\\'evy process, termed\nVariance Gamma++ process, to model the dynamic of assets in illiquid markets.\nSuch a process has the mathematical tractability of the Variance Gamma process\nand is obtained applying the self-decomposability of the gamma law. Compared to\nthe Variance Gamma model, it has an additional parameter representing the\nmeasure of the trading activity. We give a full characterization of the\nVariance Gamma++ process in terms of its characteristic triplet, characteristic\nfunction and transition density. In addition, we provide efficient path\nsimulation algorithms, both forward and backward in time. We also obtain an\nefficient \"integral-free\" explicit pricing formula for European options. These\nresults are instrumental to apply Fourier-based option pricing and maximum\nlikelihood techniques for the parameter estimation. Finally, we apply our model\nto illiquid markets, namely to the calibration of European power future market\ndata. We accordingly evaluate exotic derivatives using the Monte Carlo method\nand compare these values to those obtained using the Variance Gamma process and\ngive an economic interpretation of the obtained results. Finally, we illustrate\nan extension to the multivariate framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:41:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gardini", "", ""], ["M.", "", ""], ["Sabino", "", ""], ["P.", "", ""], ["Sasso", "", ""], ["E", "", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15496", "submitter": "Mohan Yang", "authors": "Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Chassagneux, Mohan Yang", "title": "Numerical approximation of singular Forward-Backward SDEs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA cs.NA math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we study the numerical approximation of a class of singular\nfully coupled forward backward stochastic differential equations. These\nequations have a degenerate forward component and non-smooth terminal\ncondition. They are used, for example, in the modeling of carbon market[9] and\nare linked to scalar conservation law perturbed by a diffusion. Classical\nFBSDEs methods fail to capture the correct entropy solution to the associated\nquasi-linear PDE. We introduce a splitting approach that circumvent this\ndifficulty by treating differently the numerical approximation of the diffusion\npart and the non-linear transport part. Under the structural condition\nguaranteeing the well-posedness of the singular FBSDEs [8], we show that the\nsplitting method is convergent with a rate $1/2$. We implement the splitting\nscheme combining non-linear regression based on deep neural networks and\nconservative finite difference schemes. The numerical tests show very good\nresults in possibly high dimensional framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2021 15:24:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Chassagneux", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Yang", "Mohan", ""]]}]
