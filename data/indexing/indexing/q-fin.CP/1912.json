The strategy we adopt for the\nexistence part is based on approximations using stochastic Volterra equations\nwith $L^2$-kernels combined with a general stability result. Most importantly,\nwe establish weak uniqueness using a duality argument on the Fourier--Laplace\ntransform via a deterministic Riccati--Volterra integral equation. We\nillustrate the applicability of our results on Hawkes processes and a class of\nhyper-rough Volterra Heston models with a Hurst index $H \\in (-1/2,1/2]$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2019 15:31:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:22:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jaber", "Eduardo Abi", "", "CES"]]}, {"id": "1912.08713", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin and Fazlollah Soleymani", "title": "Four-factor model of Quanto CDS with jumps-at-default and stochastic\n  recovery", "comments": "30 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1711.07133", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we modify the model of Itkin, Shcherbakov and Veygman, (2019)\n(ISV2019), proposed for pricing Quanto Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and risky\nbonds, in several ways. First, it is known since the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy\nthat the recovery rate could significantly vary right before or at default,\ntherefore, in this paper we consider it to be stochastic. Second, to reduce\ncomplexity of the model, we treat the domestic interest rate as deterministic,\nbecause, as shown in ISV2019, volatility of the domestic interest rate does not\ncontribute much to the value of the Quanto CDS spread. Finally, to solve the\ncorresponding systems of 4D partial differential equations we use a different\nflavor of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) method which is a combination of\nlocalized RBF and finite-difference methods, and is known in the literature as\nRBF-FD. Results of our numerical experiments presented in the paper demonstrate\nthat the influence of volatility of the recovery rate is significant if the\ncorrelation between the recovery rate and the log-intensity of the default is\nnon-zero. Also, the impact of the recovery mean-reversion rate on the Quanto\nCDS spread could be comparable with the impact due to jump-at-default in the FX\nrate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 04:23:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Itkin", "Andrey", ""], ["Soleymani", "Fazlollah", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.11059", "submitter": "Shengli Chen", "authors": "Shengli Chen, Zili Zhang", "title": "Forecasting Implied Volatility Smile Surface via Deep Learning and\n  Attention Mechanism", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The implied volatility smile surface is the basis of option pricing, and the\ndynamic evolution of the option volatility smile surface is difficult to\npredict.
