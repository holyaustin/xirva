Executing the entire order at once usually\nincurs a large trading cost because of this limited liquidity. In order to\nminimize this cost traders split up large orders over time. Varying volatility\nhowever implies that they now take on price risk, as the underlying assets'\nprices can move against the traders over the execution period. This execution\nproblem therefore requires a careful balancing between trading slow to reduce\nliquidity cost and trading fast to reduce the volatility cost. R.
