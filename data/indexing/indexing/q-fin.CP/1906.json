Unfortunately, Monte\nCarlo methods are very computationally expensive when it comes to running\nsimulations in high-dimensional state spaces where they are still a method of\nchoice in the financial industry. Recently, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) have\nprovided considerable speedups and decreased the cost of running Stochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD) in Deep Learning. After highlighting computational\nsimilarities between training neural networks with SGD and simulating\nstochastic processes, we ask in the present paper whether TPUs are accurate,\nfast and simple enough to use for financial Monte Carlo. Through a theoretical\nreminder of the key properties of such methods and thorough empirical\nexperiments we examine the fitness of TPUs for option pricing, hedging and risk\nmetrics computation. In particular we demonstrate that, in spite of the use of\nmixed precision, TPUs still provide accurate estimators which are fast to\ncompute when compared to GPUs. We also show that the Tensorflow programming\nmodel for TPUs is elegant, expressive and simplifies automated differentiation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2019 21:11:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2019 20:40:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2019 17:34:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2019 19:14:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2020 22:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Belletti", "Francois", ""], ["King", "Davis", ""], ["Yang", "Kun", ""], ["Nelet", "Roland", ""], ["Shafi", "Yusef", ""], ["Chen", "Yi-Fan", ""], ["Anderson", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.03507", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "A Itkin", "title": "Deep learning calibration of option pricing models: some pitfalls and\n  solutions", "comments": "16 pages, 15 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent progress in the field of artificial intelligence, machine learning and\nalso in computer industry resulted in the ongoing boom of using these\ntechniques as applied to solving complex tasks in both science and industry.\nSame is, of course, true for the financial industry and mathematical finance.\nIn this paper we consider a classical problem of mathematical finance -\ncalibration of option pricing models to market data, as it was recently drawn\nsome attention of the financial society in the context of deep learning and\nartificial neural networks.

I show\nthat the relative size of the money market (that is, relative to the Kelly\nbankroll) is a martingale that nonetheless converges in probability to zero.\nThe margin loan interest rate is a submartingale that converges in mean square\nto the choke price $r_\\infty:=\\nu-\\sigma^2/2$, where $\\nu$ is the asymptotic\ncompound growth rate of the stock market and $\\sigma$ is its annual volatility.\nIn this environment, the gambler no longer beats the market asymptotically a.s.\nby an exponential factor (as he would under perfectly elastic supply).
