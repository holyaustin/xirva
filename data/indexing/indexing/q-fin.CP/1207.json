We set up an\nagent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the\norder book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a\ndouble-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In\nsituations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not\nobserve fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap\nstructure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails.
