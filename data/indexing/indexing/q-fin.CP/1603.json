For this purpose we use a cointegration analysis with one structural\nbreak to capture the crisis effect, and we assess the inflation uncertainty\nbased on a time-varying unobserved component model. In line with recent\nempirical studies we discover that in the long-run, the inflation and its\nuncertainty negatively impact the stock prices, opposed to the well-known\nFisher effect. In addition we show that for several sector stock indexes the\nnegative effect of inflation and its uncertainty vanishes after the crisis\nsetup. However, in the short-run the results provide evidence in the favor of a\nnegative impact of uncertainty, while the inflation has no significant\ninfluence on stock prices, except for the consumption indexes. The\nconsideration of business cycle effects confirms our findings, which proves\nthat the results are robust, both for the long-and the short-run relationships.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 19:46:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Albulescu", "Claudiu", "", "UPT"], ["Aubin", "Christian", "", "CRIEF"], ["Goyeau", "Daniel", "", "CRIEF"]]}, {"id": "1603.02874", "submitter": "Aurelio Fernandez Bariviera", "authors": "Aurelio F.
