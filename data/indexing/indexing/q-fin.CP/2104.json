A soft distributional version of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n(HJB) equation is given by a semilinear partial differential equation (PDE).\nThis `soft HJB equation' can be learned from offline data without assuming that\nthe latter correspond to a previous optimal or near-optimal policy. A\ndata-driven solution of the soft HJB equation uses methods of Neural PDEs and\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks developed in the field of Scientific Machine\nLearning (SciML). The suggested approach, dubbed `SciPhy RL', thus reduces\nDOCTR-L to solving neural PDEs from data. Our algorithm called Deep DOCTR-L\nconverts offline high-dimensional data into an optimal policy in one step by\nreducing it to supervised learning, instead of relying on value iteration or\npolicy iteration methods. The method enables a computable approach to the\nquality control of obtained policies in terms of both their expected returns\nand uncertainties about their values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2021 13:22:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Halperin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.01365", "submitter": "Ludovic Mathys", "authors": "Johan Auster, Ludovic Mathys, Fabio Maeder", "title": "JDOI Variance Reduction Method and the Pricing of American-Style Options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present article revisits the Diffusion Operator Integral (DOI) variance\nreduction technique originally proposed in Heath and Platen (2002) and extends\nits theoretical concept to the pricing of American-style options under\n(time-homogeneous) L\\'evy stochastic differential equations.
