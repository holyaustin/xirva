Instead of looking at the estimated capital reserve and\nthe realised cash-flow separately, one could bind them into the secured\nposition, for which risk measurement is much easier. Using this simple concept\ncombined with monotonicity of Expected Shortfall with respect to its target\nconfidence level we introduce a natural and efficient backtesting framework.\nOur test statistics is given by the biggest number of worst realisations for\nthe secured position that add up to a negative total. Surprisingly, this simple\nquantity could be used to construct an efficient backtesting framework for\nunconditional coverage of Expected Shortfall in a natural extension of the\nregulatory traffic-light approach for Value-at-Risk. While being easy to\ncalculate, the test statistic is based on the underlying duality between\ncoherent risk measures and scale-invariant performance measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 11:37:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Mar 2018 00:42:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2018 01:05:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Moldenhauer", "Felix", ""], ["Pitera", "Marcin", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.03803", "submitter": "Yongxin Yang", "authors": "Guosheng Hu and Yuxin Hu and Kai Yang and Zehao Yu and Flood Sung and\n  Zhihong Zhang and Fei Xie and Jianguo Liu and Neil Robertson and Timothy\n  Hospedales and Qiangwei Miemie", "title": "Deep Stock Representation Learning: From Candlestick Charts to\n  Investment Decisions", "comments": "Accepted to International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal\n  Processing (ICASSP) 2018", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a novel investment decision strategy (IDS) based on deep learning.\nThe performance of many IDSs is affected by stock similarity.

To solve these problems, we apply\nConvolutional AutoEncoder to learn a stock representation, based on which we\npropose a novel portfolio construction strategy by: (i) using the deeply\nlearned representation and modularity optimisation to cluster stocks and\nidentify diverse sectors, (ii) picking stocks within each cluster according to\ntheir Sharpe ratio (Sharpe 1994). Overall this strategy provides low-risk\nhigh-return portfolios. We use the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index\n(FTSE 100) data for evaluation.

With the world economy getting\nmore integrated day by day, more people are investing in global emerging\nmarkets. This means that it is pertinent to understand the efficiency of these\nmarkets. This paper tests for market efficiency by studying the impact of\nglobal financial crisis of 2008 and the recent Chinese crisis of 2015 on stock\nmarket efficiency in emerging stock markets of China and India. The data for\nlast 20 years was collected from both Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE200) and the\nShanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and divided into four sub-periods, i.e.\nbefore financial crisis period (period-I), during recession (period-II), after\nrecession and before Chinese Crisis (periodIII) and from the start of Chinese\ncrisis till date (period- IV). Daily returns for the SSE and BSE were examined\nand tested for randomness using a combination of auto correlation tests, runs\ntests and unit root tests (Augmented Dickey-Fuller) for the entire sample\nperiod and the four sub-periods. The evidence from all these tests supports\nthat both the Indian and Chinese stock markets do not exhibit weak form of\nmarket efficiency. They do not follow random walk overall and in the first\nthree periods (1996 till the 2015) implying that recession did not impact the\nmarkets to a great extent, although the efficiency in percentage terms seems to\nbe increasing after the global financial crisis of 2008.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 21:05:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Malafeyev", "Oleg", ""], ["Awasthi", "Achal", ""], ["Kambekar", "Kaustubh S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.05287", "submitter": "Aurelien Alfonsi", "authors": "Aur\\'elien Alfonsi, Jacopo Corbetta and Benjamin Jourdain", "title": "Sampling of probability measures in the convex order by Wasserstein\n  projection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, for $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ two probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$\nwith finite moments of order $\\rho\\ge 1$, we define the respective projections\nfor the $W_\\rho$-Wasserstein distance of $\\mu$ and $\\nu$ on the sets of\nprobability measures dominated by $\\nu$ and of probability measures larger than\n$\\mu$ in the convex order.
