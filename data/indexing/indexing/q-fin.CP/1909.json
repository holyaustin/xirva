However, application of MCMC methods to heavy\ntailed distributions and distributions with analytically intractable densities\nturns out to be rather problematic. In this paper, we propose a novel approach\ntowards the use of MCMC algorithms for distributions with analytically known\nFourier transforms and, in particular, heavy tailed distributions. The main\nidea of the proposed approach is to use MCMC methods in Fourier domain to\nsample from a density proportional to the absolute value of the underlying\ncharacteristic function. A subsequent application of the Parseval's formula\nleads to an efficient algorithm for the computation of integrals with respect\nto the underlying density. We show that the resulting Markov chain in Fourier\ndomain may be geometrically ergodic even in the case of heavy tailed original\ndistributions. We illustrate our approach by several numerical examples\nincluding multivariate elliptically contoured stable distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2019 12:54:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 14:03:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Belomestny", "Denis", ""], ["Iosipoi", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.03870", "submitter": "Stephan Eckstein", "authors": "Stephan Eckstein, Gaoyue Guo, Tongseok Lim, Jan Obloj", "title": "Robust pricing and hedging of options on multiple assets and its\n  numerics", "comments": "Forthcoming in SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.OC q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider robust pricing and hedging for options written on multiple assets\ngiven market option prices for the individual assets.

Yet, driven by the rapid development of information\ntechnology and machine intelligence, the velocity of today's information leads\nto high market efficiency. Sound financial theories demonstrate that in an\nefficient marketplace all information available today, including expectations\non future events, are represented in today prices whereas future price trend is\ndriven by the uncertainty. This jeopardizes the efforts put in designing\nprediction models. To deal with the unpredictability of financial systems,\ntoday's portfolio management is largely based on the Markowitz framework which\nputs more emphasis in the analysis of the market uncertainty and less in the\nprice prediction. The limitation of the Markowitz framework stands in taking\nvery strong ideal assumptions about future returns probability distribution.\n  To address this situation we propose PAGAN, a pioneering methodology based on\ndeep generative models. The goal is modeling the market uncertainty that\nultimately is the main factor driving future trends. The generative model\nlearns the joint probability distribution of price trends for a set of\nfinancial assets to match the probability distribution of the real market. Once\nthe model is trained, a portfolio is optimized by deciding the best\ndiversification to minimize the risk and maximize the expected returns observed\nover the execution of several simulations.
