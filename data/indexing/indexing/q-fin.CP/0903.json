Briefly, when we apply a classical\nnonlinear neural-network learning to a linear quantum Schr\\\"odinger equation,\nas a result we get a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS), performing as a\nquantum stochastic filter. In this paper, we present a bidirectional quantum\nassociative memory model for the Black--Scholes--like option price evolution,\nconsisting of a pair of coupled NLS equations, one governing the stochastic\nvolatility and the other governing the option price, both self-organizing in an\nadaptive `market heat potential', trained by continuous Hebbian learning. This\nstiff pair of NLS equations is numerically solved using the method of lines\nwith adaptive step-size integrator.\n  Keywords: Option price modelling, Quantum neural computation, nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, leverage effect, bidirectional associative memory\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 02:59:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2009 02:58:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 02:12:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1592", "submitter": "William Shaw", "authors": "William T.

The simulation of any\ndistribution is greatly facilitated by a knowledge of the quantile function, by\nwhich uniformly distributed samples may be converted to samples of the given\ndistribution. This article analyzes the calculation of a quantile function\ndirect from the characteristic function of a probability distribution, without\nexplicit knowledge of the density. We form a non-linear integro-differential\nequation that despite its complexity admits an iterative solution for the power\nseries of the quantile about the median. We give some examples including tail\nmodels and show how to generate C-code for examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 16:53:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""], ["McCabe", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1629", "submitter": "Guido Germano", "authors": "Mauro Politi, Enrico Scalas, Daniel Fulger, and Guido Germano", "title": "Spectral densities of Wishart-Levy free stable random matrices:\n  Analytical results and Monte Carlo validation", "comments": "10 pages, 1 figure, submitted to Eur.
