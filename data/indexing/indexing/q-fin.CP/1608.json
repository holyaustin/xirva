Here, the large number of risk factors rules\nout traditional PDE-based techniques and allows only a relatively small number\nof paths for nested Monte Carlo simulations, resulting in large variances of\nestimators in practice. We propose a novel approach based on Kolmogorov forward\nand backward PDEs, where we counter the high dimensionality by a generalisation\nof anchored-ANOVA decompositions. By computing only the most significant terms\nin the decomposition, the dimensionality is reduced effectively, such that a\nsignificant computational speed-up arises from the high accuracy of PDE schemes\nin low dimensions compared to Monte Carlo estimation. Moreover, we show how\nthis truncated decomposition can be used as control variate for the full\nhigh-dimensional model, such that any approximation errors can be corrected\nwhile a substantial variance reduction is achieved compared to the standard\nsimulation approach. We investigate the accuracy for a realistic portfolio of\nexchange options, interest rate and cross-currency swaps under a fully\ncalibrated ten-factor model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 14:13:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 17:50:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Feb 2018 21:47:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["de Graaf", "Cornelis S.

In many\nscenarios of practical interest, financial option prices associated to an\nunderlying asset reduces to computing an expectation w.r.t.~a diffusion\nprocess. In general, these expectations cannot be calculated analytically, and\none way to approximate these quantities is via the Monte Carlo method; Monte\nCarlo methods have been used to price options since at least the 1970's. It has\nbeen seen in Del Moral, P. \\& Shevchenko, P.V. (2014) `Valuation of barrier\noptions using Sequential Monte Carlo' and Jasra, A. \\& Del Moral, P. (2011)\n`Sequential Monte Carlo for option pricing' that Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)\nmethods are a natural tool to apply in this context and can vastly improve over\nstandard Monte Carlo. In this article, in a similar spirit to Del Moral, P. \\&\nShevchenko, P.V. (2014) `Valuation of barrier options using sequential Monte\nCarlo' and Jasra, A. \\& Del Moral, P. (2011) `Sequential Monte Carlo for option\npricing' we show that one can achieve significant gains by using SMC methods by\nconstructing a sequence of artificial target densities over time. In\nparticular, we approximate the optimal importance sampling distribution in the\nSMC algorithm by using a sequence of weighting functions. This is demonstrated\non two examples, barrier options and target accrual redemption notes (TARN's).\nWe also provide a proof of unbiasedness of our SMC estimate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Aug 2016 02:54:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Sen", "Deborshee", ""], ["Jasra", "Ajay", ""], ["Zhou", "Yan", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.03636", "submitter": "Atul Deshpande", "authors": "Atul Deshpande and B.

Existing\npairs-trading algorithms in the literature require rather restrictive\nassumptions on the underlying stochastic stock-price processes and the\nso-called spread function. In contrast to existing literature, we consider an\nalgorithm for pairs trading which requires less restrictive assumptions than\nheretofore considered. Since our point of view is control-theoretic in nature,\nthe analysis and results are straightforward to follow by a non-expert in\nfinance. To this end, we describe a general pairs-trading algorithm which\nallows the user to define a rather arbitrary spread function which is used in a\nfeedback context to modify the investment levels dynamically over time. When\nthis function, in combination with the price process, satisfies a certain\nmean-reversion condition, we deem the stocks to be a tradeable pair. For such a\ncase, we prove that our control-inspired trading algorithm results in positive\nexpected growth in account value. Finally, we describe tests of our algorithm\non historical trading data by fitting stock price pairs to a popular spread\nfunction used in literature. Simulation results from these tests demonstrate\nrobust growth while avoiding huge drawdowns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Aug 2016 23:37:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Deshpande", "Atul", ""], ["Barmish", "B.

In multi-scale analysis; clearly identifiable 1, 2 and 3 year\nnon-stationary periodic modulations in NYSE and BSE have been observed, with\nNYSE commensurating changes in BSE at 3 years scale. Interestingly, at one year\ntime scale, the two exchanges are phase locked only during the turbulent times,\nwhile at the scale of three year, in-phase nature is observed for a much longer\ntime frame. The two year time period, having characteristics of both one and\nthree year variations, acts as the transition regime. The normalised NYSE's\nstock value is found to Granger cause those of BSE, with a time lag of 9\nmonths. Surprisingly, observed Granger causality of high frequency variations\nreveals BSE behaviour getting reflected in the NYSE index fluctuations, after a\nsmaller time lag. This Janus faced relationship, shows that smaller stock\nexchanges may provide a natural setting for simulating market fluctuations of\nmuch bigger exchanges. This possibly arises due to the fact that high frequency\nfluctuations form an universal part of the financial time series, and are\nexpected to exhibit similar characteristics in open market economies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 10:08:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Neeraj", "", ""], ["Panigrahi", "Prasanta K.", ""]]}]
