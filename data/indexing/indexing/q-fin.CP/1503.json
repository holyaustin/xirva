Motivated by high-dimensional complex systems typically\nfound in interest rate markets, we investigate correlation in high-dimensional\nhigh-frequency data generated by continuous semimartingales. In contrast to the\ntraditional PCA methodology, the directions of large variations are not\ndeterministic, but rather they are bounded variation adapted processes which\nmaximize quadratic variation almost surely. This allows us to reduce\ndimensionality from high-dimensional semimartingale systems in terms of\nquadratic covariation rather than the usual covariance concept.\n  The proposed methodology allows us to investigate space-time data driven by\nmulti-dimensional latent semimartingale state processes. The theory is applied\nto discretely-observed stochastic PDEs which admit finite-dimensional\nrealizations. In particular, we provide consistent estimators for\nfinite-dimensional invariant manifolds for Heath-Jarrow-Morton models. More\nimportantly, components of the invariant manifold associated to volatility and\ndrift dynamics are consistently estimated and identified. The proposed\nmethodology is illustrated with both simulated and real data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 19:47:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 04:04:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ohashi", "Alberto", ""], ["Simas", "Alexandre B", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.07676", "submitter": "Brett Hemenway", "authors": "Brett Hemenway and Sanjeev Khanna", "title": "Sensitivity and Computational Complexity in Financial Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Modern financial networks exhibit a high degree of interconnectedness and\ndetermining the causes of instability and contagion in financial networks is\nnecessary to inform policy and avoid future financial collapse. In the American\nEconomic Review, Elliott, Golub and Jackson proposed a simple model for\ncapturing the dynamics of complex financial networks. In Elliott, Golub and\nJackson's model, each institution in the network can buy underlying assets or\npercentage shares in other institutions (cross-holdings) and if any\ninstitution's value drops below a critical threshold value, its value suffers\nan additional failure cost.\n  This work shows that even in simple model put forward by Elliott, Golub and\nJackson there are fundamental barriers to understanding the risks that are\ninherent in a network. First, if institutions are not required to maintain a\nminimum amount of self-holdings, an $\\epsilon$ change in investments by a\nsingle institution can have an arbitrarily magnified influence on the net worth\nof the institutions in the system. This sensitivity result shows that if\ninstitutions have small self-holdings, then estimating the market value of an\ninstitution requires almost perfect information about every cross-holding in\nthe system. Second, we show that even if a regulator has complete information\nabout all cross-holdings in the system, it may be computationally intractable\nto even estimate the number of failures that could be caused by an arbitrarily\nsmall shock to the system. Together, these results show that any uncertainty in\nthe cross-holdings or values of the underlying assets can be amplified by the\nnetwork to arbitrarily large uncertainty in the valuations of institutions in\nthe network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 10:24:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 15:54:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hemenway", "Brett", ""], ["Khanna", "Sanjeev", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.08465", "submitter": "Tomaso Aste", "authors": "Noemi Nava, T.
