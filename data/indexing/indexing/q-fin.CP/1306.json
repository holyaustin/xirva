We use an extension of\nclassical B-splines obtained by including basis functions with infinite\nsupport. We first come back to the application of shape-constrained B-splines\nto the estimation of conditional expectations, not merely from a scatter plot\nbut also from the given marginal distributions. An application is the Monte\nCarlo calibration of stochastic local volatility models by Markov projection.\nThen we present a new technique for the calibration of an implied volatility\nsurface to sparse option data. We use a B-spline parameterization of the\nRadon-Nikodym derivative of the underlying's risk-neutral probability density\nwith respect to a roughly calibrated base model. We show that this method\nprovides smooth arbitrage-free implied volatility surfaces. Finally, we sketch\na Galerkin method with B-spline finite elements to the solution of the partial\ndifferential equation satisfied by the Radon-Nikodym derivative.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 06:23:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 18:02:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 18:35:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 20:04:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Corlay", "Sylvain", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1378", "submitter": "Bin Li", "authors": "Bin Li and Dingjiang Huang and Steven C.H.

Moments of arbitrary order, as well as non-polynomial moments\ncan be included in the formulation. We show that this gives rise to a hierarchy\nof optimization problems with decreasing levels of risk-aversion, with classic\nrobust optimization at one end of the spectrum, and stochastic programming at\nthe other.

The\nproposed method is applicable to problems with non-differentiable semi-infinite\nconstraints indexed by an infinite-dimensional index set. Examples comparing\nthe cutting surface algorithm to the central cutting plane algorithm of\nKortanek and No demonstrate the potential of our algorithm even in the solution\nof traditional semi-infinite convex programming problems whose constraints are\ndifferentiable and are indexed by an index set of low dimension. After the rate\nof convergence analysis of the cutting surface algorithm, we extend the\nauthors' moment matching scenario generation algorithm to a probabilistic\nalgorithm that finds optimal probability distributions subject to moment\nconstraints. The combination of this distribution optimization method and the\ncentral cutting surface algorithm yields a solution to a family of\ndistributionally robust optimization problems that are considerably more\ngeneral than the ones proposed to date.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 16:01:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 17:15:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:08:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mehrotra", "Sanjay", ""], ["Papp", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.3923", "submitter": "Kees van Schaik", "authors": "Albert Ferreiro-Castilla and Kees van Schaik", "title": "Applying the Wiener-Hopf Monte Carlo simulation technique for Levy\n  processes to path functionals such as first passage times, undershoots and\n  overshoots", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this note we apply the recently established Wiener-Hopf Monte Carlo (WHMC)\nsimulation technique for Levy processes from Kuznetsov et al.

It emerges that Keen's model has just\ntwo possible long term solutions: stable growth or terminal collapse. While\ncollapse can come about immediately from economies that are nonviable by virtue\nof unsuitable parameters or initial conditions, in general the collapse is\npreceded by an interval of exponential growth. In first approximation, the\nduration of that exponential growth is half a period of a sinusoidal\noscillation. The period is determined by reciprocal of the imaginary part of\none root of a certain quintic polynomial. The real part of the same root\ndetermines the rate of growth of the economy. The coefficients of that\npolynomial depend in a complicated way upon the numerous parameters in the\nproblem and so, therefore, the pattern of roots.
