The arbitrage free\nconditions give a system of stochastic PDEs for the evolution of the implied\nvolatility surface ${\\hat\\sigma}_t(T,K)$. We will focus on the family obtained\nfixing a strike $K$ and varying $T$. In order to give conditions to prove an\nexistence-and-uniqueness result for the solution of the system it is here\nexpressed in terms of the square root of the forward implied volatility and\nrewritten in an Hilbert space setting. The existence and the uniqueness for the\n(arbitrage free) evolution of the forward implied volatility, and then of the\nthe implied volatility, among a class of models, are proved. Specific examples\nare also given.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2007 15:36:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Dec 2007 10:30:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Brace", "A.", ""], ["Fabbri", "G.", ""], ["Goldys", "B.", ""]]}]
