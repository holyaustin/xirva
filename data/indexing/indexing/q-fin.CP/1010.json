Closed-form solutions for the price of these options have appeared in\nthe literature for the case when the contract underlying asset follows a\ngeometric Brownian motion with the constant interest rate, volatility, and\nnon-negative \"dividend\" yield. In this paper, the option price is derived for\nthe case of the underlying asset that follows a geometric Brownian motion with\nthe time-dependent drift and volatility which is important to use the solutions\nin real life applications. The formulas are derived for the drift that may\ninclude non-negative or negative \"dividend\" yield. The latter case results in a\nnew solution type that has not been studied in the literature. Several\ntypographical errors in the formula for the holder-extendible put, typically\nrepeated in textbooks and software, are corrected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 08:03:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Sep 2014 04:34:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1372", "submitter": "Bhojnarine R.

The method does not\nrequire the volatility process to be observed. Instead, it exploits the fact\nthat the optimal decision functions in the corresponding dynamic programming\nproblem can be expressed as functions of conditional distributions of\nvolatility, given observed data. By constructing statistics summarizing\ninformation about these conditional distributions, one can obtain high quality\napproximate solutions. Although the required conditional distributions are in\ngeneral intractable, they can be arbitrarily precisely approximated using\nsequential Monte Carlo schemes. The drawback, as with many Monte Carlo schemes,\nis potentially heavy computational demand. We present two variants of the\nalgorithm, one closely related to the well-known least-squares Monte Carlo\nalgorithm of Longstaff and Schwartz [The Review of Financial Studies 14 (2001)\n113-147], and the other solving the same problem using a \"brute force\" gridding\napproach. We estimate an illustrative SV model using Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) methods for three equities. We also demonstrate the use of our algorithm\nby estimating the posterior distribution of the market price of volatility risk\nfor each of the three equities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Oct 2010 08:54:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2012 09:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Rambharat", "Bhojnarine R.", ""], ["Brockwell", "Anthony E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1617", "submitter": "Rafal Weron", "authors": "Agnieszka Janek, Tino Kluge, Rafal Weron, Uwe Wystup", "title": "FX Smile in the Heston Model", "comments": "Chapter prepared for the 2nd edition of Statistical Tools for Finance\n  and Insurance, P.Cizek, W.Haerdle, R.Weron (eds.), Springer-Verlag,\n  forthcoming in 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Heston model stands out from the class of stochastic volatility (SV)\nmodels mainly for two reasons.
