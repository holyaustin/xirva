While our\nsimulations are simplified representations of actual market dynamics, they\nprovide an idealized \"playground\" in which our techniques can be demonstrated\nand tested. We present this work with the aim that our techniques could be\nrefined and, with some effort, scaled up to the full complexity of real-world\nmarket scenarios. We hope that the results presented encourage practitioners to\nadopt opponent-modeling methods and apply them online systems, in order to\nenable not only reactive but also proactive decisions to be made.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 18:14:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mahfouz", "Mahmoud", ""], ["Filos", "Angelos", ""], ["Chtourou", "Cyrine", ""], ["Lockhart", "Joshua", ""], ["Assefa", "Samuel", ""], ["Veloso", "Manuela", ""], ["Mandic", "Danilo", ""], ["Balch", "Tucker", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.13288", "submitter": "Murat Ozbayoglu", "authors": "Omer Berat Sezer, Mehmet Ugur Gudelek, Ahmet Murat Ozbayoglu", "title": "Financial Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning : A Systematic\n  Literature Review: 2005-2019", "comments": "13 figures, 13 tables, submitted to Applied Soft Computing", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-fin.CP stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial time series forecasting is, without a doubt, the top choice of\ncomputational intelligence for finance researchers from both academia and\nfinancial industry due to its broad implementation areas and substantial\nimpact. Machine Learning (ML) researchers came up with various models and a\nvast number of studies have been published accordingly. As such, a significant\namount of surveys exist covering ML for financial time series forecasting\nstudies. Lately, Deep Learning (DL) models started appearing within the field,\nwith results that significantly outperform traditional ML counterparts. Even\nthough there is a growing interest in developing models for financial time\nseries forecasting research, there is a lack of review papers that were solely\nfocused on DL for finance. Hence, our motivation in this paper is to provide a\ncomprehensive literature review on DL studies for financial time series\nforecasting implementations. We not only categorized the studies according to\ntheir intended forecasting implementation areas, such as index, forex,\ncommodity forecasting, but also grouped them based on their DL model choices,\nsuch as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Deep Belief Networks (DBNs),\nLong-Short Term Memory (LSTM). We also tried to envision the future for the\nfield by highlighting the possible setbacks and opportunities, so the\ninterested researchers can benefit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 18:43:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sezer", "Omer Berat", ""], ["Gudelek", "Mehmet Ugur", ""], ["Ozbayoglu", "Ahmet Murat", ""]]}]
