It is shown that the presence of arbitrarily small\nstochastic deviations in the evolution of the num\\'eraire process causes\nsignificant changes in the market properties. In particular, an equivalent\nmartingale measure is not unique for this market, and there are non-replicable\nclaims. The martingale prices and the hedging error can vary significantly and\ntake extreme values, for some extreme choices of the equivalent martingale\nmeasures. Some rational choices of the equivalent martingale measures are\nsuggested and discussed, including implied measures calculated from observed\nbond prices. This allows to calculate the implied market price of risk process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 00:42:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 02:58:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 23 Apr 2014 13:52:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 12:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dokuchaev", "Nikolai", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1216", "submitter": "Antonis Papapantoleon", "authors": "Antonis Papapantoleon", "title": "Computation of copulas by Fourier methods", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide an integral representation for the (implied) copulas of dependent\nrandom variables in terms of their moment generating functions.

Its natural formulation,\ndescribed in terms of stochastic differential equations, is solved through\nMonte Carlo simulations, that usually involve rather large computation time,\ninefficient from a practical (financial) perspective. This model turns to be\nMarkovian in three dimensions and therefore it can be mapped into a 3D partial\ndifferential equations problem.
