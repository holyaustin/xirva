We find that\nthe returns of the stocks are positively (negatively) correlated when agents'\nexpected returns for one stock are positively (negatively) correlated with the\nhistorical return of the other. We provide both numerical simulations and\nanalytical studies and give explanations to stock correlations for cases with\nagents having either homogeneous or heterogeneous expected returns.

The main result of this paper is a\ngeneralization of this theorem. Whereas previous work applies to a single\nstock, in this paper, we consider a pair of stocks. To this end, we make two\nassumptions on their expected returns. The first assumption involves price\ncorrelation between the two stocks and the second involves a bounded non-zero\nmomentum condition. With known uncertainty bounds on the parameters associated\nwith these assumptions, our new version of the RPE Theorem provides necessary\nand sufficient conditions on the positive feedback parameter K of the\ncontroller under which robust positive expectation is assured.
