Recently the grouped t-copula was generalized to allow each group to\nhave one member only, so that a priori grouping is not required and the\ndependence modeling is more flexible. This paper describes a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) method under the Bayesian inference framework for estimating and\nchoosing t-copula models. Using historical data of foreign exchange (FX) rates\nas a case study, we found that Bayesian model choice criteria overwhelmingly\nfavor the generalized t-copula. In addition, all the criteria also agree on the\nsecond most likely model and these inferences are all consistent with classical\nlikelihood ratio tests. Finally, we demonstrate the impact of model choice on\nthe conditional Value-at-Risk for portfolios of six major FX rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2011 04:56:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1050", "submitter": "Helin Wu", "authors": "Yuanyuan Sui and Helin Wu", "title": "Inf-convolution of g_\\Gamma-solution and its applications", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1011.1976", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A risk-neutral method is always used to price and hedge contingent claims in\ncomplete market, but another method based on utility maximization or risk\nminimization is wildly used in more general case.

Indeed, these techniques may be computationally expensive\nand do not provide flexibility for variance reduction. In contrast, the\nMalliavin approach exhibits a higher flexibility by providing a class of\nfunctions that return the same expected value (the Greek) with different\naccuracies. This versatility for variance reduction is not possible without the\nuse of the generalized integral by part formula of Malliavin Calculus.
