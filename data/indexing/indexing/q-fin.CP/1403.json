If the income\neffect, which implies enhanced saving as a result of an increase in risk\naversion, dominates the substitution effect, which causes the representative\nagent to reallocate his portfolio in favour of riskless assets, the demand for\nsecurities increases. Thus, asset prices are forced to rise when the\nrepresentative agent is more risk adverse. By disentangling risk aversion and\nintertemporal substituability, we demonstrate that the risky asset price is an\nincreasing function of the coefficient of risk aversion only if the elasticity\nof intertemporal substitution (EIS) exceeds unity. This result, which was first\nproved par Epstein (1988) in a stationary economy setting with a constant risk\naversion, is shown to hold true for non-stationary economies with a variable or\nconstant risk aversion coefficient. The conclusion is that the EIS probably\nexceeds unity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 16:45:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pepin", "Dominique", "", "CRIEF"]]}, {"id": "1403.1804", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin", "title": "High-Order Splitting Methods for Forward PDEs and PIDEs", "comments": "25 pages, 2 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is dedicated to the construction of high-order (in both space and\ntime) finite-difference schemes for both forward and backward PDEs and PIDEs,\nsuch that option prices obtained by solving both the forward and backward\nequations are consistent.
