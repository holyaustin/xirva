In addition to the problem formulation and related\nalgorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the\nCapital Growth theory in order to better understand the similarities and\ndifferences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a\ntimely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining\nresearchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial\nindustry to help them understand the state-of-the-art and facilitate their\nresearch and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and\nevaluate some emerging new trends for future research directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2012 16:49:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 May 2013 12:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Bin", ""], ["Hoi", "Steven C.
