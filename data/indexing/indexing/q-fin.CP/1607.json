In particular, we develop a framework for solving Black-Scholes-type\nequations by first transforming them into advection-diffusion problems, and\nnumerically integrating using an iterative explicit finite-difference approach,\nin which the Fickian term is represented as an additional advective term. We\ndiscuss the correspondence between transport phenomena and financial models,\nuncovering the possibility of expressing the no-arbitrage principle as a\nconservation law. We depict second-order accuracy in time and space of the\nembraced numerical scheme. This is done in a convergence analysis comparing\nMPDATA numerical solutions with classic Black-Scholes analytical formulae for\nthe valuation of European options. We demonstrate in addition a way of applying\nMPDATA to solve the free boundary problem (leading to a linear complementarity\nproblem) for the valuation of American options. We finally comment on the\npotential the MPDATA framework has with respect to being applied in tandem with\nmore complex models typically used in quantitive finance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 19:24:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Aug 2016 15:57:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 20:34:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 18 Jan 2017 14:26:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 31 Dec 2018 17:36:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Arabas", "Sylwester", ""], ["Farhat", "Ahmad", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.05572", "submitter": "Christian Bayer", "authors": "Christian Bayer, Markus Siebenmorgen, Raul Tempone", "title": "Smoothing the payoff for efficient computation of Basket option prices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of pricing basket options in a multivariate Black\nScholes or Variance Gamma model.

Despite its theoretical appeal, the\nimplementation of a convex risk function remains difficult, as there is little\nguidance regarding how a convex risk function should be chosen so that it also\nwell represents one's own risk preferences. In this paper, we address this\nissue through the lens of inverse optimization. Specifically, given solution\ndata from some (forward) risk-averse optimization problems we develop an\ninverse optimization framework that generates a risk function that renders the\nsolutions optimal for the forward problems. The framework incorporates the\nwell-known properties of convex risk functions, namely, monotonicity,\nconvexity, translation invariance, and law invariance, as the general\ninformation about candidate risk functions, and also the feedbacks from\nindividuals, which include an initial estimate of the risk function and\npairwise comparisons among random losses, as the more specific information. Our\nframework is particularly novel in that unlike classical inverse optimization,\nno parametric assumption is made about the risk function, i.e. it is\nnon-parametric. We show how the resulting inverse optimization problems can be\nreformulated as convex programs and are polynomially solvable if the\ncorresponding forward problems are polynomially solvable. We illustrate the\nimputed risk functions in a portfolio selection problem and demonstrate their\npractical value using real-life data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 22:00:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jonathan Yu-Meng", ""]]}]
