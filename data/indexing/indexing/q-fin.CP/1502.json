In real stock exchanges, however, the price formation\nis goverend by the order book. It is thus interesting to check if the resulting\nstylized facts of a model with equilibrium pricing change, remain the same or,\nmore generally, are compatible with the order book environment. We tackle this\nissue in the framework of a case study by embedding the\nBornholdt-Kaizoji-Fujiwara spin model into the order book dynamics. To this\nend, we use a recently developed agent based model that realistically\nincorporates the order book. We find realistic stylized facts. We conclude for\nthe studied case that equilibrium pricing is not needed and that the\ncorresponding assumption of a \"fundamental\" price may be abandoned.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 08:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Meudt", "Frederik", ""], ["Schmitt", "Thilo A.", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Rudi", ""], ["Guhr", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02963", "submitter": "Ricardo Cris\\'ostomo", "authors": "Ricardo Crisostomo", "title": "An Analysis of the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model: Implementation\n  and Calibration using Matlab", "comments": "34 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.NA math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyses the implementation and calibration of the Heston\nStochastic Volatility Model.

In this context,\nthe notion of utility indifference price has gained popularity in the academic\ncircles. Although theoretically very appealing, this pricing method remains\ndifficult to apply in practice, due to the high computational cost of solving\nthe nonlinear partial integro-differential equation associated to the\nindifference price. In this work, we develop closed form approximations to\nexponential utility indifference prices in exponential L\\'evy models. To this\nend, we first establish a new non-asymptotic approximation of the indifference\nprice which extends earlier results on small risk aversion asymptotics of this\nquantity. Next, we use this formula to derive a closed-form approximation of\nthe indifference price by treating the L\\'evy model as a perturbation of the\nBlack-Scholes model. This extends the methodology introduced in a recent paper\nfor smooth linear functionals of L\\'evy processes (A. \\v{C}ern\\'y, S. Denkl and\nJ. Kallsen, arXiv:1309.7833) to nonlinear and non-smooth functionals. Our\nclosed formula represents the indifference price as the linear combination of\nthe Black-Scholes price and correction terms which depend on the variance,\nskewness and kurtosis of the underlying L\\'evy process, and the derivatives of\nthe Black-Scholes price. As a by-product, we obtain a simple explicit formula\nfor the spread between the buyer's and the seller's indifference price.
