We analyze\nsolutions to the generalized Cox-Ingersoll-Ross two factors model describing\nclustering of interest rate volatilities. The main goal is to derive an\nasymptotic expansion of the bond price with respect to a singular parameter\nrepresenting the fast scale for the stochastic volatility process. We derive\nthe second order asymptotic expansion of a solution to the two factors\ngeneralized CIR model and we show that the first two terms in the expansion are\nindependent of the variable representing stochastic volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 20:04:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Stehlikova", "B.", ""], ["Sevcovic", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.1561", "submitter": "Michel Fliess", "authors": "Michel Fliess (LIX, INRIA Saclay - Ile de France), C\\'edric Join\n  (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, CRAN)", "title": "Time Series Technical Analysis via New Fast Estimation Methods: A\n  Preliminary Study in Mathematical Finance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IAR-ACD08 (23rd IAR Workshop on Advanced Control and Diagnosis)\n  (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP math.AC math.OC math.ST q-fin.CP q-fin.TR stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  New fast estimation methods stemming from control theory lead to a fresh look\nat time series, which bears some resemblance to \"technical analysis\".

The main motivation of this work is a financial\nor actuarial problem of hedging of defaultable contingent claims or life\ninsurance contracts, for which the terminal time is a default time or a death\ntime, which are not stopping times. We have to use progressive enlargement of\nthe Brownian filtration, and to solve the obtained BSDE under this enlarged\nfiltration. This work gives a solution to the mathematical problem and proves\nthe existence and uniqueness of solutions of such BSDE under certain general\nconditions.
