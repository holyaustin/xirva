We introduce Continual Learning\nAugmentation (CLA) which is based on an explicit memory structure and a feed\nforward neural network (FFNN) base model and used to drive long term financial\ninvestment decisions. We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy in\ninvestment decision making while memory is addressed in an explainable way. Our\napproach introduces novel remember cues, consisting of empirically learned\nchange points in the absolute error series of the FFNN. Memory recall is also\nnovel, with contextual similarity assessed over time by sampling distances\nusing dynamic time warping (DTW). We demonstrate the benefits of our approach\nby using it in an expected return forecasting task to drive investment\ndecisions. In an investment simulation in a broad international equity universe\nbetween 2003-2017, our approach significantly outperforms FFNN base models. We\nalso illustrate how CLA's memory addressing works in practice, using a worked\nexample to demonstrate the explainability of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 04:26:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Dec 2018 17:26:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 10:19:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 09:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Philps", "Daniel", ""], ["Weyde", "Tillman", ""], ["Garcez", "Artur d'Avila", ""], ["Batchelor", "Roy", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.04272", "submitter": "Suren Harutyunyan", "authors": "Suren Harutyunyan, Adri\\`A Masip Borr\\`As", "title": "A Numerical Analysis of the Modified Kirk's Formula and Applications to\n  Spread Option Pricing Approximations a numerical analysis of the modified\n  kirk's formula and applications to spread option pricing approximations", "comments": "44 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "10230/36014", "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study recent developments in the approximation of the spread\noption pricing.

In the absence of analytical European\noption pricing methods for the model, and due to the non-Markovian nature of\nthe fractional driver, the prevalent option is to use the Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulation for pricing. Despite recent advances in the MC method in this\ncontext, pricing under the rBergomi model is still a time-consuming task. To\novercome this issue, we have designed a novel, hierarchical approach, based on\ni) adaptive sparse grids quadrature (ASGQ), and ii) quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC).\nBoth techniques are coupled with a Brownian bridge construction and a\nRichardson extrapolation on the weak error. By uncovering the available\nregularity, our hierarchical methods demonstrate substantial computational\ngains with respect to the standard MC method, when reaching a sufficiently\nsmall relative error tolerance in the price estimates across different\nparameter constellations, even for very small values of the Hurst parameter.\nOur work opens a new research direction in this field, i.e., to investigate the\nperformance of methods other than Monte Carlo for pricing and calibrating under\nthe rBergomi model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Dec 2018 12:55:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 19:59:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2019 01:13:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 17:24:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 3 Aug 2019 15:55:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2019 07:22:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:47:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bayer", "Christian", ""], ["Hammouda", "Chiheb Ben", ""], ["Tempone", "Raul", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.09904", "submitter": "Victor Nistor", "authors": "Olesya Grishchenko, Xiao Han, Victor Nistor", "title": "A volatility-of-volatility expansion of the option prices in the SABR\n  stochastic volatility model", "comments": "38 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.AP math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a general, very fast method to quickly approximate the solution of\na parabolic Partial Differential Equation (PDEs) with explicit formulas. Our\nmethod also provides equaly fast approximations of the derivatives of the\nsolution, which is a challenge for many other methods. Our approach is based on\na computable series expansion in terms of a \"small\" parameter. As an example,\nwe treat in detail the important case of the SABR PDE for $\\beta = 1$, namely\n$\\partial_{\\tau}u = \\sigma^2 \\big [ \\frac{1}{2} (\\partial^2_xu - \\partial_xu) +\n\\nu \\rho \\partial_x\\partial_\\sigma u + \\frac{1}{2} \\nu^2 \\partial^2_\\sigma u \\,\n\\big ] + \\kappa (\\theta - \\sigma) \\partial_\\sigma$, by choosing $\\nu$ as small\nparameter. This yields $u = u_0 + \\nu u_1 + \\nu^2 u_2 + \\ldots$, with $u_j$\nindependent of $\\nu$. The terms $u_j$ are explicitly computable, which is also\na challenge for many other, related methods. Truncating this expansion leads to\ncomputable approximations of $u$ that are in \"closed form,\" and hence can be\nevaluated very quickly. Most of the other related methods use the \"time\" $\\tau$\nas a small parameter. The advantage of our method is that it leads to shorter\nand hence easier to determine and to generalize formulas. We obtain also an\nexplicit expansion for the implied volatility in the SABR model in terms of\n$\\nu$, similar to Hagan's formula, but including also the {\\em mean reverting\nterm.} We provide several numerical tests that show the performance of our\nmethod. In particular, we compare our formula to the one due to Hagan. Our\nresults also behave well when used for actual market data and show the mean\nreverting property of the volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Dec 2018 12:05:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Grishchenko", "Olesya", ""], ["Han", "Xiao", ""], ["Nistor", "Victor", ""]]}]
