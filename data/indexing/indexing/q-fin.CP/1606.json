For this\nreason, financial agent-based models are frequently validated by demonstrating\nan ability to reproduce well-known log return time series and central limit\norder book stylized facts, as opposed to being rigorously calibrated to\ntransaction data. We thus apply an established financial agent-based model\ncalibration framework to a simple model of high- and low-frequency trader\ninteraction and demonstrate possible inadequacies of a stylized fact-centric\napproach to model validation. We further argue for the centrality of\ncalibration to the validation of financial agent-based models and possible\npitfalls of current approaches to financial agent-based modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 11:29:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 10:13:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2016 06:45:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 09:48:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Platt", "Donovan", ""], ["Gebbie", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.04285", "submitter": "Masaaki Fujii", "authors": "Masaaki Fujii, Akihiko Takahashi", "title": "Solving Backward Stochastic Differential Equations with quadratic-growth\n  drivers by Connecting the Short-term Expansions", "comments": "Forthcoming in Stochastic Processes and their Applications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article proposes a new approximation scheme for quadratic-growth BSDEs\nin a Markovian setting by connecting a series of semi-analytic asymptotic\nexpansions applied to short-time intervals.

We also extend\nautomatic differentiation for second order derivatives of options with\nnon-twice differentiable payoff. 1. Introduction. Due to BASEL III regulations,\nbanks are requested to evaluate the sensitivities of their portfolios every day\n(risk assessment). Some of these portfolios are huge and sensitivities are time\nconsuming to compute accurately. Faced with the problem of building a software\nfor this task and distrusting automatic differentiation for non-differentiable\nfunctions, we turned to an idea developed by Mike Giles called Vibrato. Vibrato\nat core is a differentiation of a combination of likelihood ratio method and\npathwise evaluation. In Giles [12], [13], it is shown that the computing time,\nstability and precision are enhanced compared with numerical differentiation of\nthe full Monte Carlo path. In many cases, double sensitivities, i.e. second\nderivatives with respect to parameters, are needed (e.g. gamma hedging). Finite\ndifference approximation of sensitivities is a very simple method but its\nprecision is hard to control because it relies on the appropriate choice of the\nincrement. Automatic differentiation of computer programs bypass the difficulty\nand its computing cost is similar to finite difference, if not cheaper. But in\nfinance the payoff is never twice differentiable and so generalized derivatives\nhave to be used requiring approximations of Dirac functions of which the\nprecision is also doubtful. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the\nfeasibility of Vibrato for second and higher derivatives. We will first compare\nVibrato applied twice with the analytic differentiation of Vibrato and show\nthat it is equivalent, as the second is easier we propose the best compromise\nfor second derivatives: Automatic Differentiation of Vibrato. In [8], Capriotti\nhas recently investigated the coupling of different mathematical methods --\nnamely pathwise and likelihood ratio methods -- with an Automatic differ\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 14:36:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Pag\u00e8s", "Gilles", "", "UPMC"], ["Pironneau", "Olivier", "", "LJLL"], ["Sall", "Guillaume", "", "LJLL"]]}, {"id": "1606.06829", "submitter": "Marco Bianchetti", "authors": "Marco Bianchetti, Davide Galli, Camilla Ricci, Angelo Salvatori, Marco\n  Scaringi", "title": "Brexit or Bremain ?

The complex\nstructure of VA products and computational complexity of their accurate\nevaluation have compelled insurance companies to adopt Monte Carlo (MC)\nsimulations to value their large portfolios of VA products. Because the MC\nsimulations are computationally demanding, especially for intraday valuations,\ninsurance companies need more efficient valuation techniques. Recently, a\nframework based on traditional spatial interpolation techniques has been\nproposed that can significantly decrease the computational complexity of MC\nsimulation (Gan and Lin, 2015). However, traditional interpolation techniques\nrequire the definition of a distance function that can significantly impact\ntheir accuracy. Moreover, none of the traditional spatial interpolation\ntechniques provide all of the key properties of accuracy, efficiency, and\ngranularity (Hejazi et al., 2015). In this paper, we present a neural network\napproach for the spatial interpolation framework that affords an efficient way\nto find an effective distance function. The proposed approach is accurate,\nefficient, and provides an accurate granular view of the input portfolio.
