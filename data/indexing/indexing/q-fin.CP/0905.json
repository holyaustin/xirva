This created the challenge of developing a pricing framework that\ncan simultaneously handle European options, forward-starts, options on the\nrealized variance and options on the VIX. In this paper we propose a new\napproach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching\nmodel with jumps and local volatility defined in \\cite{FXrev} and calibrate it\nto the European options on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and\nmaturities. The main idea of this paper is to \"lift\" (i.e. extend) the\ngenerator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path\ninformation, namely the realized variance. The lifted generator is too large a\nmatrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying\na new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us\nto evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock\nprice and the realized variance, which in turn gives us a way of pricing\nconsistently European options, general accrued variance payoffs and\nforward-starting and VIX options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2009 12:18:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Albanese", "Claudio", ""], ["Lo", "Harry", ""], ["Mijatovi\u0107", "Aleksandar", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.3326", "submitter": "Aleksandar Mijatovic", "authors": "A.

In this paper we assume that\nthe asset price process $S$ is Markov with cadlag paths and propose a scheme\nfor computing the law of the realized variance of the log returns accrued while\nthe asset was trading in a prespecified corridor. We thus obtain an algorithm\nfor pricing and hedging volatility derivatives and derivatives on the\ncorridor-realized variance in such a market. The class of models under\nconsideration is large, as it encompasses jump-diffusion and Levy processes. We\nprove the weak convergence of the scheme and describe in detail the\nimplementation of the algorithm in the characteristic cases where $S$ is a CEV\nprocess (continuous trajectories), a variance gamma process (jumps with\nindependent increments) or an infinite activity jump-diffusion (discontinuous\ntrajectories with dependent increments).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 May 2009 14:51:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Mijatovic", "A.", ""], ["Lo", "H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4657", "submitter": "M.
