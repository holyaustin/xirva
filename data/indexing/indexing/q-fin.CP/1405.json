In contrast to the standard small-diffusion asymptotic\nexpansion method, the dynamics of variables given by the forward SDEs is\ntreated exactly. Although it requires a special form of the quadratic\ncovariation terms of the continuous part, it allows rather generic drift as\nwell as jump components to exist. The resultant approximation is given by a\npolynomial function in terms of the unperturbed forward variables whose\ncoefficients are uniquely specified by the solution of the recursive system of\nlinear ODEs. Applications to a jump-extended Heston and lambda-SABR models for\nEuropean contingent claims, as well as the utility-optimization problem in the\npresence of a terminal liability are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2014 11:03:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2014 08:26:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 10 Sep 2014 09:55:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 03:50:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Fujii", "Masaaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.3561", "submitter": "Antoine Jacquier Dr.", "authors": "Jean-Francois Chassagneux, Antoine Jacquier, Ivo Mihaylov", "title": "An explicit Euler scheme with strong rate of convergence for financial\n  SDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficients", "comments": "36 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the approximation of stochastic differential equations (SDEs)\nwith non-Lipschitz drift or diffusion coefficients.

This paper presents\nSMC method for pricing barrier options with continuous and discrete monitoring\nof the barrier condition. Under the SMC method, simulated asset values rejected\ndue to barrier condition are re-sampled from asset samples that do not breach\nthe barrier condition improving the efficiency of the option price estimator;\nwhile under the standard Monte Carlo many simulated asset paths can be rejected\nby the barrier condition making it harder to estimate option price accurately.\nWe compare SMC with the standard Monte Carlo method and demonstrate that the\nextra effort to implement SMC when compared with the standard Monte Carlo is\nvery little while improvement in price estimate can be significant. Both\nmethods result in unbiased estimators for the price converging to the true\nvalue as $1/\\sqrt{M}$, where $M$ is the number of simulations (asset paths).\nHowever, the variance of SMC estimator is smaller and does not grow with the\nnumber of time steps when compared to the standard Monte Carlo. In this paper\nwe demonstrate that SMC can successfully be used for pricing barrier options.\nSMC can also be used for pricing other exotic options and also for cases with\nmany underlying assets and additional stochastic factors such as stochastic\nvolatility; we provide general formulas and references.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 May 2014 04:27:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Jul 2015 03:20:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""], ["Del Moral", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.6111", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin", "title": "Splitting and Matrix Exponential approach for jump-diffusion models with\n  Inverse Normal Gaussian, Hyperbolic and Meixner jumps", "comments": "32 pages, 7 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1304.3159", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is a further extension of the method proposed in Itkin, 2014 as\napplied to another set of jump-diffusion models: Inverse Normal Gaussian,\nHyperbolic and Meixner.

However, whilst the definitions of VAR and ES are\nunambiguous, they depend on input distributions that are data-cleaning- and\nData-Model-dependent. We quantify the scale of these effects from USD CDS\n(2004--2014), and from USD interest rates (1989--2014, single-curve setup\nbefore 2004, multi-curve setup after 2004), and make two standardisation\nproposals: for data; and for Data-Models. VAR and ES are required for lifetime\nportfolio calculations, i.e. collateral calls, which cover a wide range of\nmarket states. Hence we need standard, i.e. clean, complete, and common (i.e.\nidentical for all banks), market data also covering this wide range of market\nstates. This data is historically incomplete and not clean hence data\nstandardization is required. Stressed VAR and ES require moving market\nmovements during a past (usually not recent) window to current, and future,\nmarket states. All choices (e.g. absolute difference, relative, relative scaled\nby some function of market states) implicitly define a Data Model for\ntransformation of extreme market moves (recall that 99th percentiles are\ntypical, and the behaviour of the rest is irrelevant). Hence we propose\nstandard Data Models. These are necessary because different banks have\ndifferent stress windows. Where there is no data, or a requirement for\nsimplicity, we propose standard lookup tables (one per window, etc.). Without\nthis standardization of data and Data Models we demonstrate that VAR and ES are\ncomplex derivatives of subjective choices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 16:51:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""], ["Green", "Andrew", ""]]}]
