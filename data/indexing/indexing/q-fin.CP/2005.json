We conduct the first study of bond yield\nforecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, validating its\npotential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the\n10-year bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five\nforecasting horizons. We compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP),\nunivariate and with the most relevant features. To demystify the notion of\nblack box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of the\nmodel. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected\nlocations in the memory cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and\nmultivariate. We then proceed to explain the states' signals using exogenous\ninformation, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology. The results\nshow that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of\nachieving similar results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and\nmarket information. Furthermore, shorter forecasting horizons require smaller\ninput sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property found consistently\nin the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time, and\nthe specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are\ncomplex but can be explained by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the\nrelevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso are not commonly used in\nforecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of LSTMs\nand methodologies for bonds, providing additional tools for financial\npractitioners.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2020 14:23:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nunes", "Manuel", ""], ["Gerding", "Enrico", ""], ["McGroarty", "Frank", ""], ["Niranjan", "Mahesan", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.02318", "submitter": "Lucio Fernandez-Arjona", "authors": "Lucio Fernandez-Arjona", "title": "A neural network model for solvency calculations in life insurance", "comments": "20 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1017/S1748499520000330", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Insurance companies make extensive use of Monte Carlo simulations in their\ncapital and solvency models.

In this work, the classical problem of\npricing European and American financial options, based on the corresponding PDE\nformulations, is studied. Instead of using numerical techniques based on finite\nelement or difference methods, we address the problem using ANNs in the context\nof unsupervised learning. As a result, the ANN learns the option values for all\npossible underlying stock values at future time points, based on the\nminimization of a suitable loss function. For the European option, we solve the\nlinear Black-Scholes equation, whereas for the American option, we solve the\nlinear complementarity problem formulation. Two-asset exotic option values are\nalso computed, since ANNs enable the accurate valuation of high-dimensional\noptions. The resulting errors of the ANN approach are assessed by comparing to\nthe analytic option values or to numerical reference solutions (for American\noptions, computed by finite elements).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2020 12:05:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Salvador", "Beatriz", ""], ["Oosterlee", "Cornelis W.", ""], ["van der Meer", "Remco", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12483", "submitter": "Ernest Chan", "authors": "Xin Man and Ernest Chan", "title": "The best way to select features?", "comments": "8 pages, submitted to ACM International Conference on AI in Finance\n  (ICAIF-2020)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-fin.CP stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Feature selection in machine learning is subject to the intrinsic randomness\nof the feature selection algorithms (for example, random permutations during\nMDA). Stability of selected features with respect to such randomness is\nessential to the human interpretability of a machine learning algorithm. We\nproposes a rank based stability metric called instability index to compare the\nstabilities of three feature selection algorithms MDA, LIME, and SHAP as\napplied to random forests. Typically, features are selected by averaging many\nrandom iterations of a selection algorithm. Though we find that the variability\nof the selected features does decrease as the number of iterations increases,\nit does not go to zero, and the features selected by the three algorithms do\nnot necessarily converge to the same set. We find LIME and SHAP to be more\nstable than MDA, and LIME is at least as stable as SHAP for the top ranked\nfeatures. Hence overall LIME is best suited for human interpretability.\nHowever, the selected set of features from all three algorithms significantly\nimproves various predictive metrics out of sample, and their predictive\nperformances do not differ significantly. Experiments were conducted on\nsynthetic datasets, two public benchmark datasets, and on proprietary data from\nan active investment strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 02:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Man", "Xin", ""], ["Chan", "Ernest", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.12593", "submitter": "Bruno Bouchard", "authors": "Bruno Bouchard (CEREMADE), Adil Reghai, Benjamin Virrion (CEREMADE)", "title": "Computation of Expected Shortfall by fast detection of worst scenarios", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a multi-step algorithm for the computation of the historical\nexpected shortfall such as defined by the Basel Minimum Capital Requirements\nfor Market Risk. At each step of the algorithm, we use Monte Carlo simulations\nto reduce the number of historical scenarios that potentially belong to the set\nof worst scenarios. The number of simulations increases as the number of\ncandidate scenarios is reduced and the distance between them diminishes. For\nthe most naive scheme, we show that the L p-error of the estimator of the\nExpected Shortfall is bounded by a linear combination of the probabilities of\ninversion of favorable and unfavorable scenarios at each step, and of the last\nstep Monte Carlo error associated to each scenario. By using concentration\ninequalities, we then show that, for sub-gamma pricing errors, the\nprobabilities of inversion converge at an exponential rate in the number of\nsimulated paths. We then propose an adaptative version in which the algorithm\nimproves step by step its knowledge on the unknown parameters of interest: mean\nand variance of the Monte Carlo estimators of the different scenarios. Both\nschemes can be optimized by using dynamic programming algorithms that can be\nsolved off-line. To our knowledge, these are the first non-asymptotic bounds\nfor such estimators. Our hypotheses are weak enough to allow for the use of\nestimators for the different scenarios and steps based on the same random\nvariables, which, in practice, reduces considerably the computational effort.\nFirst numerical tests are performed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 May 2020 09:33:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchard", "Bruno", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Reghai", "Adil", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Virrion", "Benjamin", "", "CEREMADE"]]}, {"id": "2005.12619", "submitter": "Riccardo Doyle", "authors": "Riccardo Doyle", "title": "Using Network Interbank Contagion in Bank Default Prediction", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Interbank contagion can theoretically exacerbate losses in a financial system\nand lead to additional cascade defaults during downturn.
