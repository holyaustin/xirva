We propose a novel notion of admissibility that has many pleasant\nfeatures - admissibility is characterized purely under the objective measure;\neach admissible strategy can be approximated by simple strategies using finite\nnumber of trading dates; the wealth of any admissible strategy is a\nsupermartingale under all pricing measures; local boundedness of the price\nprocess is not required; neither strict monotonicity, strict concavity nor\ndifferentiability of the utility function are necessary; the definition\nencompasses both the classical mean-variance preferences and the monotone\nexpected utility.
