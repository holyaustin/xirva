Each time a numerical minimization is involved,\nautomatic differentiation can be used. In between formal derivation and\nstandard numerical schemes, this approach is based on software solutions\napplying mechanically the chain rule to obtain an exact value for the desired\nderivative. It has a cost in memory and cpu consumption. For participants of\nfinancial markets (banks, insurances, financial intermediaries, etc), computing\nderivatives is needed to obtain the sensitivity of its exposure to well-defined\npotential market moves. It is a way to understand variations of their balance\nsheets in specific cases. Since the 2008 crisis, regulation demand to compute\nthis kind of exposure to many different case, to be sure market participants\nare aware and ready to face a wide spectrum of configurations. This paper shows\nhow automatic differentiation provides a partial answer to this recent\nexplosion of computation to perform. One part of the answer is a\nstraightforward application of Adjoint Algorithmic Differentiation (AAD), but\nit is not enough. Since financial sensitivities involves specific functions and\nmix differentiation with Monte-Carlo simulations, dedicated tools and\nassociated theoretical results are needed. We give here short introductions to\ntypical cases arising when one use AAD on financial markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 10:18:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 14:35:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Geeraert", "S\u00e9bastien", "", "LJLL"], ["Lehalle", "Charles-Albert", "", "LJLL"], ["Pearlmutter", "Barak", "", "LJLL"], ["Pironneau", "Olivier", "", "LJLL"], ["Reghai", "Adil", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.07513", "submitter": "Leonardo dos Santos Pinheiro", "authors": "Leonardo dos Santos Pinheiro and Flavio Codeco COelho", "title": "An Agent-based Model of Contagion in Financial Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work develops an agent-based model for the study of how the leverage\nthrough the use of repurchase agreements can function as a mechanism for the\npropagation and amplification of financial shocks in a financial system.
