The theory relies on\ninequalities for the kurtosis and skewness of a general random variable which\nare themselves seemingly new. Asymptotically efficient schemes which attain the\nlower bounds are constructed explicitly. The result is directly applicable to\npractical hedging problem in mathematical finance; it gives an asymptotically\noptimal way to choose rebalancing dates and portofolios with respect to\ntransaction costs. The asymptotically efficient strategies in fact reflect the\nstructure of transaction costs. In particular a specific biased rebalancing\nscheme is shown to be superior to unbiased schemes if transaction costs follow\na convex model.
