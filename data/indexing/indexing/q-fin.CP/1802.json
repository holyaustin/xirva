The trading polarity\nmeasures the market sentiment toward stocks from a view of very essence of\ntrading desire. When using the polarity to examine market crash, we find that\ntrading polarity successfully reflects the changing of market-level behavior in\nterms of its flipping times, depth, and length. We further investigate the\nrelationship between polarity and return. At market-level, trading polarity is\nnegatively correlated with returns, while at stock-level, this correlation\nchanges according to market conditions, which becomes a good signal of market\npsychology transition. Also, the significant correlation disclosed by the\nmarket polarity and market emotion implies that our presented polarity, which\nessentially calculated in the context of high-frequency trading data, can\nreal-timely reflect the sentiment of the market. The trading polarity indeed\nprovides a new way to understand and foresee the market behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Feb 2018 15:22:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lu", "Shan", ""], ["Zhao", "Jichang", ""], ["Wang", "Huiwen", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.01307", "submitter": "Sander Willems", "authors": "Sander Willems", "title": "Asian Option Pricing with Orthogonal Polynomials", "comments": "Forthcoming in Quantitative Finance", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we derive a series expansion for the price of a continuously\nsampled arithmetic Asian option in the Black-Scholes setting.

It is often of\nconsiderable interest to obtain numerical solutions for such equations, but any\nsingular (\"particle\"-like) source modeling invariably introduces nontrivial\ncomputational obstacles. A common method to circumvent these is through some\nform of delta function approximation procedure on the computational grid;\nhowever, this often carries significant limitations on the efficiency of the\nnumerical convergence rates, or sometimes even the resolvability of the problem\nat all.\n  In this paper, we present an alternative technique for tackling such\nequations which avoids the singular behavior entirely: the\n\"Particle-without-Particle\" method. Previously introduced in the context of the\nself-force problem in gravitational physics, the idea is to discretize the\ncomputational domain into two (or more) disjoint pseudospectral\n(Chebyshev-Lobatto) grids such that the \"particle\" is always at the interface\nbetween them; thus, one only needs to solve homogeneous equations in each\ndomain, with the source effectively replaced by jump (boundary) conditions\nthereon. We prove here that this method yields solutions to any linear PDE the\nsource of which is any linear combination of delta distributions and\nderivatives thereof supported on a one-dimensional subspace of the problem\ndomain. We then implement it to numerically solve a variety of relevant PDEs:\nhyperbolic (with applications to neuroscience and acoustics), parabolic (with\napplications to finance), and elliptic. We generically obtain improved\nconvergence rates relative to typical past implementations relying on delta\nfunction approximations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Feb 2018 19:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Nov 2018 16:14:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Oltean", "Marius", ""], ["Sopuerta", "Carlos F.", ""], ["Spallicci", "Alessandro D.
