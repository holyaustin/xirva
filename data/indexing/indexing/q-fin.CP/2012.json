Highlighting its modular nature, we present multiple\nnovel variants of RMC algorithms, especially in terms of constructing\nsimulation designs for training the regressors, as well as in terms of machine\nlearning regression modules. At the same time, mlOSP nests most of the existing\nRMC schemes, allowing for a consistent and verifiable benchmarking of extant\nalgorithms. The article contains extensive R code snippets and figures, and\nserves the dual role of presenting new RMC features and as a vignette to the\nunderlying software package.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Dec 2020 18:41:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ludkovski", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.01883", "submitter": "Louis Abraham", "authors": "Louis Abraham", "title": "Competition analysis on the over-the-counter credit default swap market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.DS econ.EM q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study two questions related to competition on the OTC CDS market using\ndata collected as part of the EMIR regulation.\n  First, we study the competition between central counterparties through\ncollateral requirements. We present models that successfully estimate the\ninitial margin requirements. However, our estimations are not precise enough to\nuse them as input to a predictive model for CCP choice by counterparties in the\nOTC market.\n  Second, we model counterpart choice on the interdealer market using a novel\nsemi-supervised predictive task. We present our methodology as part of the\nliterature on model interpretability before arguing for the use of conditional\nentropy as the metric of interest to derive knowledge from data through a\nmodel-agnostic approach. In particular, we justify the use of deep neural\nnetworks to measure conditional entropy on real-world datasets. We create the\n$\\textit{Razor entropy}$ using the framework of algorithmic information theory\nand derive an explicit formula that is identical to our semi-supervised\ntraining objective. Finally, we borrow concepts from game theory to define\n$\\textit{top-k Shapley values}$. This novel method of payoff distribution\nsatisfies most of the properties of Shapley values, and is of particular\ninterest when the value function is monotone submodular. Unlike classical\nShapley values, top-k Shapley values can be computed in quadratic time of the\nnumber of features instead of exponential. We implement our methodology and\nreport the results on our particular task of counterpart choice.\n  Finally, we present an improvement to the $\\textit{node2vec}$ algorithm that\ncould for example be used to further study intermediation. We show that the\nneighbor sampling used in the generation of biased walks can be performed in\nlogarithmic time with a quasilinear time pre-computation, unlike the current\nimplementations that do not scale well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2020 13:02:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Abraham", "Louis", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.02698", "submitter": "Peter Hansen", "authors": "Ilya Archakov and Peter Reinhard Hansen", "title": "A Canonical Representation of Block Matrices with Applications to\n  Covariance and Correlation Matrices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.EM q-fin.CP stat.ME", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We obtain a canonical representation for block matrices.
