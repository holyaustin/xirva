The jumps of the obstacle processes could be either predictable or\ninaccessible. We show existence and uniqueness of the solution when the\nbarriers are completely separated and the generator uniformly Lipschitz. We do\nnot assume the existence of a difference of supermartingales between the\nobstacles. As an application, we show that the related mixed zero-sum\ndifferential-integral game problem has a value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Mar 2008 17:00:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Hamad\u00e9ne", "S.", ""], ["Wang", "H.", ""]]}]
