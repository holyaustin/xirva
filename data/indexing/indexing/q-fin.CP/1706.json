Our approach brings together\ntwo research areas; first, the results regarding the SV-LMM since the work of\nWu and Zhang (2006), especially on the moment generating function, and second\nthe approximation of density distributions based on Edgeworth or Gram-Charlier\nexpansions. By exploring the analytical tractability of moments up to fourth\norder, we are able to perform an adjustment of the reference Bachelier model\nwith normal volatilities for skewness and kurtosis, and as a by-product to\nderive a smile formula relating the volatility to the moneyness with\ninterpretable parameters. As a main conclusion, our numerical results show a\n98% reduction in computational time for the DD-SV-LMM calibration process\ncompared to the classical numerical integration method developed by Heston\n(1993).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 12:06:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Devineau", "Laurent", ""], ["Arrouy", "Pierre-Edouard", ""], ["Bonnefoy", "Paul", ""], ["Boumezoued", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01833", "submitter": "Yaxiong Zeng", "authors": "Yaxiong Zeng, Diego Klabjan", "title": "Online Adaptive Machine Learning Based Algorithm for Implied Volatility\n  Surface Modeling", "comments": "34 Pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML cs.LG q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we design a machine learning based method, online adaptive\nprimal support vector regression (SVR), to model the implied volatility surface\n(IVS).
