The algorithm provides a numerical solution to the\nproblem of characterizing conditional probability density functions at\narbitrary time, and we applied it successfully to quadratic and piecewise\nlinear diffusion processes. The ability in reproducing statistical features of\nfinancial return time series, such as thickness of the tails and scaling\nproperties, makes this processes appealing for option pricing. Since exact\nanalytical results are missing, we exploit the fast convolution as a numerical\nmethod alternative to the Monte Carlo simulation both in objective and risk\nneutral settings. In numerical sections we document how fast convolution\noutperforms Monte Carlo both in velocity and efficiency terms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 16:57:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Cazzaniga", "Sofia", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1831", "submitter": "Cristian Homescu", "authors": "Cristian Homescu", "title": "Adjoints and Automatic (Algorithmic) Differentiation in Computational\n  Finance", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two of the most important areas in computational finance: Greeks and,\nrespectively, calibration, are based on efficient and accurate computation of a\nlarge number of sensitivities.
