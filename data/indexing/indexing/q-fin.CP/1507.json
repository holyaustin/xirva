For each country we construct a financial\nnetwork based on the leverage ratio dependence between each pair of banks, and\nfind results that are comparable across countries. Banks present a variety of\nleverage ratio behaviors. This leverage diversity produces financial networks\nthat exhibit a modular structure characterized by one large bank community,\nsome small ones and isolated banks. There exist compact structures that have\nsynchronized dynamics. Many groups of banks merge together creating a financial\nnetwork topology that converges to a unique big cluster at a relatively low\nleverage dependence level. Finally, we propose a model that includes corporate\nand interbank loans for studying the banking system. This model generates\nnetworks similar to the empirical ones. Moreover, we find that faster-growing\nbanks tend to be more highly interconnected between them, and this is also\nobserved in empirical data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 18:00:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aparicio", "Diego", ""], ["Fraiman", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.02847", "submitter": "Nicolas Langren\\'e", "authors": "Nicolas Langren\\'e, Geoffrey Lee, Zili Zhu", "title": "Switching to non-affine stochastic volatility: A closed-form expansion\n  for the Inverse Gamma model", "comments": "30 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance 19(5)\n  1-37 (2016)", "doi": "10.1142/S021902491650031X", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces the Inverse Gamma (IGa) stochastic volatility model\nwith time-dependent parameters, defined by the volatility dynamics\n$dV_{t}=\\kappa_{t}\\left(\\theta_{t}-V_{t}\\right)dt+\\lambda_{t}V_{t}dB_{t}$. This\nnon-affine model is much more realistic than classical affine models like the\nHeston stochastic volatility model, even though both are as parsimonious (only\nfour stochastic parameters). Indeed, it provides more realistic volatility\ndistribution and volatility paths, which translate in practice into more robust\ncalibration and better hedging accuracy, explaining its popularity among\npractitioners. In order to price vanilla options with IGa volatility, we\npropose a closed-form volatility-of-volatility expansion. Specifically, the\nprice of a European put option with IGa volatility is approximated by a\nBlack-Scholes price plus a weighted combination of Black-Scholes greeks, where\nthe weights depend only on the four time-dependent parameters of the model.\nThis closed-form pricing method allows for very fast pricing and calibration to\nmarket data. The overall quality of the approximation is very good, as shown by\nseveral calibration tests on real-world market data where expansion prices are\ncompared favorably with Monte Carlo simulation results. This paper shows that\nthe IGa model is as simple, more realistic, easier to implement and faster to\ncalibrate than classical transform-based affine models. We therefore hope that\nthe present work will foster further research on non-affine models like the\nInverse Gamma stochastic volatility model, all the more so as this robust model\nis of great interest to the industry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 11:03:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Mar 2016 14:39:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Langren\u00e9", "Nicolas", ""], ["Lee", "Geoffrey", ""], ["Zhu", "Zili", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06514", "submitter": "Amirhossein Sadoghi", "authors": "A.

In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic\nrisk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,\ncirculatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors\nintroduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between\ndeath events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables\nbased on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing\nand, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence\nannuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in\nhealth treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available\ndata for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method\nto identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term\nforecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion\nof deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987\nto 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the\nfuture gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.\nNeoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due\nto mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due\nto circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in\ndeaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a\nmassive impact on social systems as, typically, such patients need long-term\ngeriatric care.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2015 02:51:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""], ["Hirz", "Jonas", ""], ["Schmock", "Uwe", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07870", "submitter": "Samuel R\\\"onnqvist", "authors": "Samuel R\\\"onnqvist and Peter Sarlin", "title": "Detect & Describe: Deep learning of bank stress in the news", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE q-fin.RM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  News is a pertinent source of information on financial risks and stress\nfactors, which nevertheless is challenging to harness due to the sparse and\nunstructured nature of natural text.
