Under an SLV model, it is common to approximate the\nfair value of European-style options by semidiscretizing the backward\nKolmogorov equation using finite differences. In the present paper we introduce\nan adjoint semidiscretization of the corresponding forward Kolmogorov equation.\nThis adjoint semidiscretization is used to obtain an expression for the\nleverage function in the pertinent SLV model such that the approximated fair\nvalues defined by the LV and SLV models are identical for non-path-dependent\nEuropean-style options. In order to employ this expression, a large non-linear\nsystem of ODEs needs to be solved. The actual numerical calibration is\nperformed by combining ADI time stepping with an inner iteration to handle the\nnon-linearity. Ample numerical experiments are presented that illustrate the\neffectiveness of the calibration procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 13:42:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wyns", "Maarten", ""], ["Hout", "Karel in 't", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.00819", "submitter": "Chris Kenyon", "authors": "Chris Kenyon and Andrew Green", "title": "Option-Based Pricing of Wrong Way Risk for CVA", "comments": "14 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The two main issues for managing wrong way risk (WWR) for the credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA, i.e. WW-CVA) are calibration and hedging.

We say \"start from\" because we\ndemonstrate that a naive worst-case approach contains hidden unrealistic\nassumptions on the variance of the hazard rate (i.e. that it is infinite). We\ncorrect this by making it an explicit (finite) parameter and present an\nefficient method for solving the parametrized model optimizing the hedges. We\nalso prove that WW-CVA is theoretically, but not practically, unbounded. The\noption-based hedges serve to significantly reduce (typically halve) practical\nWW-CVA.
