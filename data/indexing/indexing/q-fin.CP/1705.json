In high dimensions, nonlinear partial differential\nequation methods for solving the problem become prohibitively costly due to the\ncurse of dimensionality. Instead, this work proposes to use a stopping rule\nthat depends on the dynamics of a low-dimensional Markovian projection of the\ngiven basket of assets. It is shown that the ability to approximate the\noriginal value function by a lower-dimensional approximation is a feature of\nthe dynamics of the system and is unaffected by the path-dependent nature of\nthe American basket option. Assuming that we know the density of the forward\nprocess and using the Laplace approximation, we first efficiently evaluate the\ndiffusion coefficient corresponding to the low-dimensional Markovian projection\nof the basket. Then, we approximate the optimal early-exercise boundary of the\noption by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman partial differential equation in\nthe projected, low-dimensional space. The resulting near-optimal early-exercise\nboundary is used to produce an exercise strategy for the high-dimensional\noption, thereby providing a lower bound for the price of the American basket\noption. A corresponding upper bound is also provided. These bounds allow to\nassess the accuracy of the proposed pricing method. Indeed, our approximate\nearly-exercise strategy provides a straightforward lower bound for the American\nbasket option price. Following a duality argument due to Rogers, we derive a\ncorresponding upper bound solving only the low-dimensional optimal control\nproblem. Numerically, we show the feasibility of the method using baskets with\ndimensions up to fifty. In these examples, the resulting option price relative\nerrors are only of the order of few percent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 May 2017 15:08:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 May 2017 07:26:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 May 2017 20:56:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 09:30:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bayer", "Christian", ""], ["H\u00e4pp\u00f6l\u00e4", "Juho", ""], ["Tempone", "Ra\u00fal", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.00864", "submitter": "Yuuki Ida", "authors": "Yuuki Ida and Yuri Imamura", "title": "Towards the Exact Simulation Using Hyperbolic Brownian Motion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the present paper, an expansion of the transition density of Hyperbolic\nBrownian motion with drift is given, which is potentially useful for pricing\nand hedging of options under stochastic volatility models.

Selected characteristics of this\nheterogeneity are studied here and identified by focusing on the scientific\ncollaboration community of H. Eugene Stanley - one of the most prolific world\nscholars at the present time. Based on the Web of Science records as of March\n28, 2016, several variants of networks are constructed. It is found that the\nStanley #1 network - this in analogy to the Erd\\H{o}s # - develops a largely\nconsistent hierarchical organization and Stanley himself obeys rules of the\nsame hierarchy. However, this is seen exclusively in the weighted network\nrepresentation. When such a weighted network is evolving, an existing relevant\nmodel indicates that the spread of weight gets stimulation to the\nmultiplicative bursts over the neighbouring nodes, which leads to a balanced\ngrowth of interconnections among them. While not exclusive to Stanley, such a\nbehaviour is not a rule, however. Networks of other outstanding scholars\nstudied here more often develop a star-like form and the central hubs\nconstitute the outliers. This study is complemented by a spectral analysis of\nthe normalised Laplacian matrices derived from the weighted variants of the\ncorresponding networks and, among others, it points to the efficiency of such a\nprocedure for identifying the component communities and relations among them in\nthe complex weighted networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 May 2017 15:21:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 May 2017 14:37:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Oct 2017 15:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Drozdz", "Stanislaw", ""], ["Kulig", "Andrzej", ""], ["Kwapien", "Jaroslaw", ""], ["Niewiarowski", "Artur", ""], ["Stanuszek", "Marek", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.06868", "submitter": "Peter Mitic Dr", "authors": "Peter Mitic", "title": "Conduct Risk - distribution models with very thin Tails", "comments": "Presented at SYMCOMP 2017, Guimaraes Portugal, April 2017", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Regulatory requirements dictate that financial institutions must calculate\nrisk capital (funds that must be retained to cover future losses) at least\nannually. Procedures for doing this have been well-established for many years,\nbut recent developments in the treatment of conduct risk (the risk of loss due\nto the relationship between a financial institution and its customers) have\ncast doubt on 'standard' procedures. Regulations require that operational risk\nlosses should be aggregated by originating event. The effect is that a large\nnumber of small and medium-sized losses are aggregated into a small number of\nvery large losses, such that a risk capital calculation produces a hugely\ninflated result. To solve this problem, a novel distribution based on a\none-parameter probability density with an exponential of a fourth power is\nproposed, where the parameter is to be estimated. Symbolic computation is used\nto derive the necessary analytical expressions with which to formulate the\nproblem, and is followed by numeric calculations in R. Goodness-of-fit and\nparameter estimation are both determined by using a novel method developed\nspecifically for use with probability distribution functions.
