The approach allows deriving the a priori and a\nposteriori approximation errors of the solutions. Under certain nonlocal\nconditions we prove the convergence of the approximate solutions to the true\nsolution and hence the Stable Manifold Theorem.

The main idea is to expand a solution in a series of powers of a small\nparameter scaling the uncertainty in the economy around a solution to the\ndeterministic model, i.e. the model where the volatility of the shocks\nvanishes. If a deterministic path is global in state variables, then so are the\nconstructed solutions to the stochastic model, whereas these solutions are\nlocal in the scaling parameter. Under the assumption that a deterministic path\nis already known the higher order terms in the expansion are obtained\nrecursively by solving linear rational expectations models with time-varying\nparameters. The present work also proposes a method rested on backward\nrecursion for solving general systems of linear rational expectations models\nwith time-varying parameters and determines the conditions under which the\nsolutions of the method exist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 14:36:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ajevskis", "Viktors", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03898", "submitter": "Takuji Arai", "authors": "Takuji Arai, Yuto Imai and Ryoichi Suzuki", "title": "Numerical analysis on local risk-minimization forexponential L\\'evy\n  models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We illustrate how to compute local risk minimization (LRM) of call options\nfor exponential L\\'evy models.
