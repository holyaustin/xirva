This\nmethod involves recursively quantizing the conditional marginals of the\ndiscrete-time Euler approximation of the underlying process.

We further extend\nthe applicability of recursive marginal quantization by showing how absorption\nand reflection at the zero boundary may be incorporated, when this is\nnecessary. To illustrate the improved accuracy of the higher order schemes,\nvarious computations are performed using geometric Brownian motion and its\ngeneralization, the constant elasticity of variance model. For both processes,\nwe show numerical evidence of improved weak order convergence and we compare\nthe marginal distributions implied by the three schemes to the known analytical\ndistributions.

Multilayer networks,\nin their multiplex form, have been introduced within the last three years to\nanalysing the structure of financial systems, and existing studies have\nmodelled and evaluated interdependencies of different type among financial\ninstitutions. These studies, however, have considered the structure as a\nnon-interconnected multiplex - an ensemble of single layer networks comprising\nthe same nodes - rather than as an interconnected multiplex network. No\nmechanism of multichannel contagion has been modelled and empirically\nevaluated, and no multichannel stabilisation strategies for pre-emptive\ncontagion containment have been designed. This paper formulates an\ninterconnected multiplex structure, and a contagion mechanism among financial\ninstitutions due to bilateral exposures arising from institutions activity\nwithin different interconnected markets that compose the overall financial\nmarket. We introduce structural measures of absolute systemic risk and\nresilience, and relative systemic-risk indexes. Based on the contagion\nmechanism and systemic-risk quantification, this study designs minimum-cost\nstabilisation strategies that act simultaneously on different markets and their\ninterconnections, in order to effectively contain potential contagion\nprogressing through the overall structure. The stabilisation strategies subtly\naffect the emergence process of structure to adaptively build in structural\nresilience and achieve pre-emptive stabilisation at a minimum cost for each\ninstitution and at no cost for the system as a whole. We empirically evaluate\nthe new approach using large granular databases, maintained by the Prudential\nRegulatory Authority of the Bank of England.
