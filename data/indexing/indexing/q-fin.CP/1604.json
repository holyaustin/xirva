In\nthis paper, we propose a new term-structure interpolation method that extends\nclassical spline techniques by additionally allowing for quantification of\nuncertainty. The proposed method is based on a generalization of kriging models\nwith linear equality constraints (market-fit conditions) and shape-preserving\nconditions such as monotonicity or positivity (no-arbitrage conditions). We\ndefine the most likely curve and show how to build confidence bands. The\nGaussian process covariance hyper-parameters under the construction constraints\nare estimated using cross-validation techniques. Based on observed market\nquotes at different dates, we demonstrate the efficiency of the method by\nbuilding curves together with confidence intervals for term-structures of OIS\ndiscount rates, of zero-coupon swaps rates and of CDS implied default\nprobabilities. We also show how to construct interest-rate surfaces or default\nprobability surfaces by considering time (quotation dates) as an additional\ndimension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 06:43:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Cousin", "Areski", "", "SAF"], ["Maatouk", "Hassan", "", "GdR MASCOT-NUM, LIMOS,\n  DEMO-ENSMSE"], ["Rulli\u00e8re", "Didier", "", "SAF"]]}, {"id": "1604.03317", "submitter": "Jerome Lelong", "authors": "J\\'er\\^ome Lelong", "title": "Pricing American options using martingale bases", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we propose an algorithm to price American options by directly\nsolving the dual minimization problem introduced by Rogers.
