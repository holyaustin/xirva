It is a collection of positive semi-definite random\nmatrices indexed by any arbitrary dependent variable. We use it to model\ndynamic (e.g. time varying) covariance matrices. Unlike existing models, it can\ncapture a diverse class of covariance structures, it can easily handle missing\ndata, the dependent variable can readily include covariates other than time,\nand it scales well with dimension; there is no need for free parameters, and\noptional parameters are easy to interpret. We describe how to construct the\nGWP, introduce general procedures for inference and predictions, and show that\nit outperforms its main competitor, multivariate GARCH, even on financial data\nthat especially suits GARCH. We also show how to predict the mean of a\nmultivariate process while accounting for dynamic correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 12:25:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Wilson", "Andrew Gordon", ""], ["Ghahramani", "Zoubin", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0975", "submitter": "Marie Bernhart", "authors": "Marie Bernhart, Huy\\^en Pham, Peter Tankov and Xavier Warin", "title": "Swing Options Valuation: a BSDE with Constrained Jumps Approach", "comments": "6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a new probabilistic method for solving a class of impulse\ncontrol problems based on their representations as Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equations (BSDEs for short) with constrained jumps.

Moreover, these\nparameters are subjected to convoluted nonlinear constraints necessary to\nensure, for instance, the existence of stationary solutions and the positive\nsemidefinite character of the conditional covariance matrices used in the model\ndesign.

The Bregman-proximal\napproach allows us to handle the constraints in a very efficient and natural\nway by staying in the primal space and the Trust-Region mechanism stabilizes\nand speeds up the scheme.
