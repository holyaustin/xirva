There are\nindications that while equity ratios have been increased massively since the\nfinancial crisis, systemic risk levels might not have lowered, but even\nincreased. It has been shown that systemic risk is to a large extent related to\nthe underlying network topology of financial exposures. A natural question\narising is how much systemic risk can be eliminated by optimally rearranging\nthese networks and without increasing capital requirements. Overlapping\nportfolios with minimized systemic risk which provide the same market\nfunctionality as empirical ones have been studied by [pichler2018]. Here we\npropose a similar method for direct exposure networks, and apply it to\ncross-sectional interbank loan networks, consisting of 10 quarterly\nobservations of the Austrian interbank market. We show that the suggested\nframework rearranges the network topology, such that systemic risk is reduced\nby a factor of approximately 3.5, and leaves the relevant economic features of\nthe optimized network and its agents unchanged. The presented optimization\nprocedure is not intended to actually re-configure interbank markets, but to\ndemonstrate the huge potential for systemic risk management through rearranging\nexposure networks, in contrast to increasing capital requirements that were\nshown to have only marginal effects on systemic risk [poledna2017]. Ways to\nactually incentivize a self-organized formation toward optimal network\nconfigurations were introduced in [thurner2013] and [poledna2016].
