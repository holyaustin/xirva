Developing the adaptive\nMCMC framework for Bayesian CVAR models allows for efficient estimation of\nposterior parameters in significantly higher dimensional CVAR series than\npreviously possible with existing griddy Gibbs samplers. For a n-dimensional\nCVAR series, the matrix-variate posterior is in dimension $3n^2 + n$, with\nsignificant correlation present between the blocks of matrix random variables.\nWe also treat the rank of the CVAR model as a random variable and perform joint\ninference on the rank and model parameters. This is achieved with a Bayesian\nposterior distribution defined over both the rank and the CVAR model\nparameters, and inference is made via Bayes Factor analysis of rank.\nPractically the adaptive sampler also aids in the development of automated\nBayesian cointegration models for algorithmic trading systems considering\ninstruments made up of several assets, such as currency baskets.
