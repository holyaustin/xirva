To solve the diffusion equation, we use standard finite-difference\nmethods, which for multi-dimensional problems could also include splitting on\nvarious dimensions. For the jump part, we transform the jump integral into a\npseudo-differential operator. Then for various jump models we show how to\nconstruct an appropriate first and second order approximation on a grid which\nsupersets the grid that we used for the diffusion part. These approximations\nmake the scheme to be unconditionally stable in time and preserve positivity of\nthe solution which is computed either via a matrix exponential, or via P{\\'a}de\napproximation of the matrix exponent.

This paper\ndescribes a finite difference scheme for pricing a TARN option. Key steps in\nthe proposed scheme involve tracking of multiple one-dimensional finite\ndifference solutions, application of jump conditions at each cash flow exchange\ndate, and a cubic spline interpolation of results after each jump. Since a\nfinite difference scheme for TARN has significantly different features from a\ntypical finite difference scheme for options with a path independent payoff, we\ngive a step by step description on the implementation of the scheme, which is\nnot available in the literature. The advantages of the proposed finite\ndifference scheme over the Monte Carlo method are illustrated by examples with\nthree different knockout types. In the case of constant or time dependent\nvolatility models (where Monte Carlo requires simulation at cash flow dates\nonly), the finite difference method can be faster by an order of magnitude than\nthe Monte Carlo method to achieve the same accuracy in price. Finite difference\nmethod can be even more efficient in comparison with Monte Carlo in the case of\nlocal volatility model where Monte Carlo requires significantly larger number\nof time steps. In terms of robust and accurate estimation of Greeks, the\nadvantage of the finite difference method will be even more pronounced.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 05:08:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2014 23:26:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel", ""]]}]
