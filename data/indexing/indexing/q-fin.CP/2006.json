To mitigate this sensitivity, we propose\na new portfolio model called a Deeply Equal-Weighted Subset Portfolio (DEWSP).\nDEWSP is a subset of top-N ranked assets in an asset universe, the members of\nwhich are selected based on the predicted returns from deep learning algorithms\nand are equally weighted. Herein, we evaluate the performance of DEWSPs of\ndifferent sizes N in comparison with the performance of other types of\nportfolios such as optimized portfolios and historically equal-weighed subset\nportfolios (HEWSPs), which are subsets of top-N ranked assets based on the\nhistorical mean returns. We found the following advantages of DEWSPs: First,\nDEWSPs provides an improvement rate of 0.24% to 5.15% in terms of monthly\nSharpe ratio compared to the benchmark, HEWSPs. In addition, DEWSPs are built\nusing a purely data-driven approach rather than relying on the efforts of\nexperts. DEWSPs can also target the relative risk and return to the baseline of\nthe EWP of an asset universe by adjusting the size N. Finally, the DEWSP\nallocation mechanism is transparent and intuitive. These advantages make DEWSP\ncompetitive in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:45:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Sang Il", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.14498", "submitter": "Blanka Horvath", "authors": "Hans B\\\"uhler, Blanka Horvath, Terry Lyons, Imanol Perez Arribas, and\n  Ben Wood", "title": "A Data-driven Market Simulator for Small Data Environments", "comments": "27 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.CP q-fin.MF stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Neural network based data-driven market simulation unveils a new and flexible\nway of modelling financial time series without imposing assumptions on the\nunderlying stochastic dynamics.
