Given a sequence of continuation values estimates corresponding to\ndifferent levels of spatial approximation and time discretization, we propose a\nmulti-level low biased estimate for the price of an American option. It turns\nout that the resulting complexity gain can be rather high and can even reach\nthe order (\\varepsilon^{-1}) with (\\varepsilon) denoting the desired precision.\nThe performance of the proposed multilevel algorithm is illustrated by a\nnumerical example of pricing Bermudan max-call options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 13:56:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Dec 2013 11:40:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Belomestny", "Denis", ""], ["Dickmann", "Fabian", ""], ["Nagapetyan", "Tigran", ""]]}]
