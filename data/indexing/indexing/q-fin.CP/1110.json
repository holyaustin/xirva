As a result of this representation, along with\na short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, we develop an\nefficient method for pricing claims whose payoffs may depend on the full path\nof the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach is applied to price not\nonly simple European claims such as defaultable bonds, but also a new type of\npath-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as the important\nclass of vulnerable call and put options on a stock. We provide a detailed\nerror analysis and illustrate the accuracy and computational complexity of our\nmethod on several market traded instruments, such as defaultable bond prices,\nbarrier options, and vulnerable call options. Using again our Poisson series\nrepresentation, we show differentiability in time of the pre-default price\nfunction of European vulnerable claims, which enables us to rigorously deduce\nFeynman-Kac representations for the pre-default pricing function and new\nsemimartingale representations for the price process of the vulnerable claim\nunder both risk-neutral and objective probability measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2011 16:22:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:34:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Figueroa-Lopez", "Jose", ""], ["Nisen", "Jeffrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2477", "submitter": "Alet Roux", "authors": "Nan Zhang and Alet Roux and Tomasz Zastawniak", "title": "Parallel Binomial American Option Pricing with (and without) Transaction\n  Costs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DC q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a parallel algorithm that computes the ask and bid prices of an\nAmerican option when proportional transaction costs apply to the trading of the\nunderlying asset.
