Our model is highly tractable by applying the Lie\nsymmetries theory for PDEs, which means that the pricing procedure can be\nperformed efficiently. In fact, we obtain a closed-form solution for the joint\nFourier-Laplace transform so that equity and realized-variance derivatives can\nbe priced. We also employ our model to consistently price equity and VIX\nderivatives. In this process, the quasi-closed-form solutions for future and\noption prices are derived. Furthermore, through adopting data on daily VIX\nfuture and option prices, we investigate our model along with the Heston model\nand 3/2 model and compare their different performance in practice. Our result\nillustrates that the 4/2 model with an instantaneous volatility of the form\n$(a\\sqrt{V_t}+b/\\sqrt{V_t})$ for some constants $a, b$ presents considerable\nadvantages in pricing VIX derivatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2015 14:46:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 17:34:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Wei", ""], ["Li", "Shenghong", ""], ["Luo", "Xingguo", ""], ["Chern", "Shane", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02013", "submitter": "Makiko Sasada", "authors": "Yusuke Morimoto and Makiko Sasada", "title": "Algebraic Structure of Vector Fields in Financial Diffusion Models and\n  its Applications", "comments": "21 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/14697688.2016.1264618", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  High order discretization schemes of SDEs by using free Lie algebra valued\nrandom variables are introduced by Kusuoka, Lyons-Victoir, Ninomiya-Victoir and\nNinomiya-Ninomiya.
