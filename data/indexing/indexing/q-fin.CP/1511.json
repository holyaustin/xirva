The new algorithm relies on the\nconstruction of a discrete multinomial tree. The crucial feature of our\napproach is that -- in a similar spirit to the Brownian Bridge -- each random\npath runs backward from a terminal fixed point to the initial spot price. We\ncharacterize the tree in two alternative ways: in terms of the optimal grids\noriginating from the Recursive Marginal Quantization algorithm and following an\napproach inspired by the finite difference approximation of the diffusion's\ninfinitesimal generator. We assess the reliability of the new methodology\ncomparing the performance of both approaches and benchmarking them with\ncompetitor Monte Carlo methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 10:35:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Callegaro", "Giorgia", ""], ["Livieri", "Giulia", ""], ["Pallavicini", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.00884", "submitter": "Kathrin Glau Dr.", "authors": "Maximilian Ga{\\ss}, Kathrin Glau, Maximilian Mair", "title": "Magic points in finance: Empirical integration for parametric option\n  pricing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an offline-online procedure for Fourier transform based option\npricing.
