In this context, it is common for the quantity of\ninterest to be the expected value of a random variable defined via a stochastic\ndifferential equation. In 2008, Giles proposed a remarkable improvement to the\napproach of discretizing with a numerical method and applying standard Monte\nCarlo. His multilevel Monte Carlo method offers an order of speed up given by\nthe inverse of epsilon, where epsilon is the required accuracy. So computations\ncan run 100 times more quickly when two digits of accuracy are required. The\nmultilevel philosophy has since been adopted by a range of researchers and a\nwealth of practically significant results has arisen, most of which have yet to\nmake their way into the expository literature.\n  In this work, we give a brief, accessible, introduction to multilevel Monte\nCarlo and summarize recent results applicable to the task of option evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 11:39:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Higham", "Desmond J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.02039", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin and Alexander Lipton", "title": "Structural default model with mutual obligations", "comments": "27 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers mutual obligations in the interconnected bank system and\nanalyzes their influence on joint and marginal survival probabilities as well\nas CDS and FTD prices for the individual banks. To make the role of mutual\nobligations more transparent, a simple structural default model with banks'\nassets driven by correlated multidimensional Brownian motion with drift is\nconsidered. This model enables a closed form representation for many quantities\nof interest, at least in a 2D case, to be obtained, and moreover, model\ncalibration is provided.
