Two main aspects are\nconsidered: how the financial risk is distributed among the European countries\nand how large is the value of the total risk. The first aspect is evaluated by\nmeans of the expected value of a dynamic entropy measure. The second one is\nsolved by computing the evolution of the total credit spread over time.\nMoreover, the covariance between countries' total spread allows understand any\ncontagions in EU. The methodology is applied to real data of 24 countries for\nthe three major agencies: Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch. Obtained\nresults suggest that both the financial risk inequality and the value of the\ntotal risk increase over time at a different rate depending on the rating\nagency and that the dependence structure is characterized by a strong\ncorrelation between most of European countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Feb 2019 11:00:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["D'Amico", "Guglielmo", ""], ["Petroni", "Filippo", ""], ["Regnault", "Philippe", ""], ["Scocchera", "Stefania", ""], ["Storchi", "Loriano", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02854", "submitter": "Sergei Levendorskii", "authors": "Svetlana Boyarchenko and Sergei Levendorskii", "title": "Static and semi-static hedging as contrarian or conformist bets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we argue that, once the costs of maintaining the hedging\nportfolio are properly taken into account, semi-static portfolios should more\nproperly be thought of as separate classes of derivatives, with non-trivial,\nmodel-dependent payoff structures.
