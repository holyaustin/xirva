For special kinds of payoffs,\nthe complexity of the problem is reduced by one dimension. For more generic\npayoffs, instead of solving the 1+2 dimensional SABR PDE, it is sufficient to\nsolve $N_V$ uncoupled 1+1 dimensional PDE's, where $N_V$ is the number of\npoints used to discretize one dimension. Furthermore, the symmetry argument\nenables us to obtain prices of multiple options, whose payoffs are related to\neach other by convolutions, by valuing one of them. The results of the method\nare compared with the Monte Carlo simulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Aug 2013 06:24:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Aug 2013 20:28:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 5 Sep 2013 20:42:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2013 22:23:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Hyukjae", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.1704", "submitter": "Alberto  Ohashi", "authors": "Dorival Le\\~ao, Alberto Ohashi and Vinicius Siqueira", "title": "A general Multidimensional Monte Carlo Approach for Dynamic Hedging\n  under stochastic volatility", "comments": "Some typos are corrected in Section 6", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, we introduce a Monte Carlo method for the dynamic hedging of\ngeneral European-type contingent claims in a multidimensional Brownian\narbitrage-free market.
