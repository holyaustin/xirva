This is the class of financial models that combines the local and\nstochastic volatility features and has been subject of the attention by many\nresearchers recently. More precisely, given a local volatility surface and a\nchoice of stochastic volatility parameters, we calibrate the corresponding\nleverage function. Our approach makes use of regularization techniques from the\ninverse-problem theory, respecting the integrity of the data and thus avoiding\ndata interpolation. The result is a stable and robust algorithm which is\nresilient to instabilities in the regions of low probability density of the\nspot price and of the instantaneous variance. We substantiate our claims with\nnumerical experiments using simulated as well as real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Nov 2017 15:40:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Saporito", "Yuri F.", ""], ["Yang", "Xu", ""], ["Zubelli", "Jorge P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.03733", "submitter": "Xavier Warin", "authors": "Xavier Warin", "title": "Variance optimal hedging with application to Electricity markets", "comments": "17 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In Electricity markets, illiquidity, transaction costs and market price\ncharacteristics prevent managers to replicate exactly contracts.

Due to the amount of the portfolio, the heterogeneous\neffect of obligors, and the phenomena that default events are rare and mutually\ndependent, it is difficult to calculate portfolio credit risk either by means\nof direct analysis or crude Monte Carlo under such models. To capture the\nextreme dependence among obligors, we provide an efficient simulation method\nfor multi-factor models with a normal mixture copula that allows the\nmultivariate defaults to have an asymmetric distribution, while most of the\nliterature focuses on simulating one-dimensional cases. To this end, we first\npropose a general account of an importance sampling algorithm based on an\nunconventional exponential embedding, which is related to the classical\nsufficient statistic. Note that this innovative tilting device is more suitable\nfor the multivariate normal mixture model than traditional one-parameter\ntilting methods and is of independent interest. Next, by utilizing a fast\ncomputational method for how the rare event occurs and the proposed importance\nsampling method, we provide an efficient simulation algorithm to estimate the\nprobability that the portfolio incurs large losses under the normal mixture\ncopula. Here the proposed simulation device is based on importance sampling for\na joint probability other than the conditional probability used in previous\nstudies. Theoretical investigations and simulation studies, which include an\nempirical example, are given to illustrate the method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Nov 2017 09:52:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Dec 2017 04:14:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 14:47:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 12:58:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2018 18:08:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2019 00:50:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Fuh", "Cheng-Der", ""], ["Wang", "Chuan-Ju", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.07133", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "A.
