We have also\napplied the perturbative method to the PDE framework following the so-called\nFour Step Scheme. The method is found to render the original non-linear PDE\ninto a series of standard parabolic linear PDEs. Due to the equivalence of the\ntwo approaches, it is also possible to derive approximate analytic solution for\nthe non-linear PDE by applying the asymptotic expansion to the corresponding\nprobabilistic model.
