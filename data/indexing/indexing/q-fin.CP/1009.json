The wealth process is\nsubject to shocks produced by a general marked point process. The problem of\nthe agent is to derive the optimal insurance strategy which allows \"lowering\"\nthe level of the shocks. This optimization problem is related to a suitable\ndual stochastic control problem in which the delicate boundary constraints\ndisappear. In Mnif \\cite{mnif10}, the dual value function is characterized as\nthe unique viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton Jacobi Bellman\nVariational Inequality (HJBVI in short). We characterize the optimal insurance\nstrategy by the solution of the variational inequality which we solve\nnumerically by using an algorithm based on policy iterations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Sep 2010 11:31:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mnif", "Mohamed", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4143", "submitter": "Magda Schiegl", "authors": "Magda Schiegl", "title": "On the Savety Loading for Chain Ladder Estimates: A Monte Carlo\n  Simulation Study", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "ASTIN Bulletin, Vol. 32, No.1, 2002, pp. 107 - 128", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A method for analysing the risk of taking a too low reserve level by use of\nChain Ladder method is developed.

Every insurance\ncompany should be capable of running a holistic risk management process to meet\nthis challenge. For property and casualty (P&C) insurance companies the risk\nadequate modelling of the claim reserves is a very important topic as this\nliabilities determine up to 70% percent of the balance sum. We propose a three\ndimensional (3D) stochastic model for claim reserving. It delivers consistently\nthe reserve's distribution function as well as the distributions of all parts\nof it that are needed for accounting and controlling. The calibration methods\nfor the model are well known from data analysis and they are applicable in an\npractitioner environment. We evaluate the model numerically by the help of\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulation. Classical actuarial reserve models are two\ndimensional (2D). They lead to an estimation algorithm that is applied on a 2D\nmatrix, the run off triangle. Those methods (for instance the Chain - Ladder or\nthe Bornhuetter - Ferguson method) are widely used in practice nowadays and\ngive rise to several problems: They estimate the reserves' expectation and some\nof them - under very restriction assumptions - the variance. They provide no\ninformation about the tail of the reserve's distribution, what would be most\nimportant for risk calculation, for assessing the insurance company's financial\nstability and economic situation. Additionally, due to the projection of the\nclaim process into a two dimensional space the results are very often distorted\nand dependent on the kind of projection. Therefore we extend the classical 2D\nmodels to a 3D space because we find inconsistencies generated by inadequate\nprojections into the 2D spaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Sep 2010 17:03:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Schiegl", "Magda", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4683", "submitter": "Malik Magdon-Ismail", "authors": "Victor Boyarshinov and Malik Magdon-Ismail", "title": "Efficient Computation of Optimal Trading Strategies", "comments": "45 pages; working paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given the return series for a set of instruments, a \\emph{trading strategy}\nis a switching function that transfers wealth from one instrument to another at\nspecified times.
