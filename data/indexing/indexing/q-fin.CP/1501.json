As individual models are in\nthe literature most often built in isolation of other methods, the exercise is\nof high relevance for assessing the relative performance of a wide variety of\nmethods. Further, we test various ensemble approaches to aggregating the\ninformation products of the built models, providing a more robust basis for\nmeasuring country-level vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide approaches to\nestimating model uncertainty in early-warning exercises, particularly model\nperformance uncertainty and model output uncertainty. The approaches put\nforward in this paper are shown with Europe as a playground. Generally, our\nresults show that the conventional statistical approaches are outperformed by\nmore advanced machine learning methods, such as k-nearest neighbors and neural\nnetworks, and particularly by model aggregation approaches through ensemble\nlearning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 00:18:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 15:55:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 14:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Holopainen", "Markus", ""], ["Sarlin", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.06084", "submitter": "Andrei Cozma Mr", "authors": "Andrei Cozma and Matthieu Mariapragassam and Christoph Reisinger", "title": "Convergence of an Euler scheme for a hybrid stochastic-local volatility\n  model with stochastic rates in foreign exchange markets", "comments": "38 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the Heston-Cox-Ingersoll-Ross++ stochastic-local volatility model in\nthe context of foreign exchange markets and propose a Monte Carlo simulation\nscheme which combines the full truncation Euler scheme for the stochastic\nvolatility component and the stochastic domestic and foreign short interest\nrates with the log-Euler scheme for the exchange rate.
