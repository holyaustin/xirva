These features were\nnot achieved in previous works. Moreover, the central argument of our method\ncould be applied to interest rate derivatives and compound derivatives. The\nonly pre-requisite of our approach is the first-order approximation of the\nunderlying derivative. Furthermore, the model proposed here is well-suited for\ncommodities since it incorporates mean reversion of the spot price and\nmultiscale stochastic volatility.
