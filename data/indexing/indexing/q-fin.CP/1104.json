Such models are used in financial practice\nas parametric versions of the Markov functional model, or as approximations to\nthe log-normal Libor market model. We show that the model has two distinct\nregimes, at high and low volatilities, with different qualitative behavior. The\ntwo regimes are separated by a sharp transition, which is similar to a phase\ntransition in condensed matter physics. We study the behavior of the model in\nthe large volatility phase, and discuss the implications of the phase\ntransition for the pricing of interest rate derivatives. In the large\nvolatility phase, certain expectation values and convexity adjustments have an\nexplosive behavior. For sufficiently low volatilities the caplet smile is\nlog-normal to a very good approximation, while in the large volatility phase\nthe model develops a non-trivial caplet skew. The phenomenon discussed here\nimposes thus an upper limit on the volatilities for which the model behaves as\nintended.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Apr 2011 15:44:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Apr 2011 12:15:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 00:37:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 17:34:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pirjol", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1773", "submitter": "Kay Giesecke", "authors": "Kay Giesecke, Konstantinos Spiliopoulos, Richard B.

Our approach is inspired by the\ncontemporary movements in the string theory. The string map of data is defined\nhere by the boundary conditions, characteristic length, real valued and the\nmethod of redistribution of information. As a practical matter, this map\nrepresents the detrending and data standardization procedure. We introduced\nmaps onto 1-end-point and 2-end-point open strings that satisfy the Dirichlet\nand Neumann boundary conditions. The questions of the choice of\nextra-dimensions, symmetries, duality and ways to the partial compactification\nare discussed. Subsequently, we pass to higher dimensional and more complex\nobjects. The 2D-Brane was suggested which incorporated bid-ask spreads.\nPolarization by the spread was considered which admitted analyzing arbitrage\nopportunities on the market where transaction costs are taken into account. The\nmodel of the rotating string which naturally yields calculation of angular\nmomentum is suitable for tracking of several currency pairs. The systematic way\nwhich allows one suggest more structured maps suitable for a simultaneous study\nof several currency pairs was analyzed by means of the G\\^{a}teaux generalized\ndifferential calculus. The effect of the string and brane maps on test data was\nstudied by comparing their mean statistical characteristics. The study revealed\nnotable differences between topologies. We review the dependence on the\ncharacteristic string length, mean fluctuations and properties of the\nintra-string statistics.
