In this work, we propose a hybrid approach for stock price\nprediction using machine learning and deep learning-based methods. We select\nthe NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange of India, over a\nperiod of four years, from January 2015 till December 2019. Based on the NIFTY\ndata during the said period, we build various predictive models using machine\nlearning approaches, and then use those models to predict the Close value of\nNIFTY 50 for the year 2019, with a forecast horizon of one week. For predicting\nthe NIFTY index movement patterns, we use a number of classification methods,\nwhile for forecasting the actual Close values of NIFTY index, various\nregression models are built. We, then, augment our predictive power of the\nmodels by building a deep learning-based regression model using Convolutional\nNeural Network with a walk-forward validation. The CNN model is fine-tuned for\nits parameters so that the validation loss stabilizes with increasing number of\niterations, and the training and validation accuracies converge. We exploit the\npower of CNN in forecasting the future NIFTY index values using three\napproaches which differ in number of variables used in forecasting, number of\nsub-models used in the overall models and, size of the input data for training\nthe models. Extensive results are presented on various metrics for all\nclassification and regression models. The results clearly indicate that\nCNN-based multivariate forecasting model is the most effective and accurate in\npredicting the movement of NIFTY index values with a weekly forecast horizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jan 2020 03:27:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mehtab", "Sidra", ""], ["Sen", "Jaydip", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.10278", "submitter": "Sang Il Lee", "authors": "Sang Il Lee", "title": "Hyperparameter Optimization for Forecasting Stock Returns", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, hyperparameter optimization (HPO) has become an increasingly\nimportant issue in the field of machine learning for the development of more\naccurate forecasting models.
