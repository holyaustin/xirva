We use a \"transmutation\" map, which is the functional composition\nof the cumulative distribution function of one distribution with the inverse\ncumulative distribution (quantile) function of another. In contrast to the\nGram-Charlier approach, this is done without resorting to an asymptotic\nexpansion, and so avoids the pathologies that are often associated with it.\nExamples of parametric distributions that we can generate in this way include\nthe skew-uniform, skew-exponential, skew-normal, and skew-kurtotic-normal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2009 08:49:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""], ["Buckley", "Ian R.

Such functions allow the direct recycling of Monte\nCarlo samples from one distribution into samples from another. The method may\nbe developed analytically for certain special cases, and illuminate the idea\nthat it is a more precise form of the traditional Cornish-Fisher expansion. In\nthis manner the model risk of distributional risk may be assessed free of the\nMonte Carlo noise associated with resampling. Examples are given of equations\nfor converting normal samples to Student t, and converting exponential to\nhyperbolic, variance gamma and normal. In the case of the normal distribution,\nthe change of variables employed allows the sampling to take place to good\naccuracy based on a single rational approximation over a very wide range of the\nsample space. The avoidance of any branching statement is of use in optimal GPU\ncomputations as it avoids the effect of {\\it warp divergence}, and we give\nexamples of branch-free normal quantiles that offer performance improvements in\na GPU environment, while retaining the best precision characteristics of\nwell-known methods. We also offer models based on a low-probability of warp\ndivergence. Comparisons of new and old forms are made on the Nvidia Quadro\n4000, GTX 285 and 480, and Tesla C2050 GPUs. We argue that in single-precision\nmode, the change-of-variables approach offers performance competitive with the\nfastest existing scheme while substantially improving precision, and that in\ndouble-precision mode, this approach offers the most GPU-optimal Gaussian\nquantile yet, and without compromise on precision for Monte Carlo applications,\nworking twice as fast as the CUDA 4 library function with increased precision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jan 2009 12:14:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Jan 2009 17:51:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2009 10:37:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 26 Aug 2010 14:20:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 19:16:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""], ["Luu", "Thomas", ""], ["Brickman", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.0992", "submitter": "Tetsuya Takaishi", "authors": "Tetsuya Takaishi", "title": "An Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for GARCH Model", "comments": "11 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social\n  Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.
