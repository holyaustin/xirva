However,\nthe use of a standard t copula is often criticized due to its restriction of\nhaving a single parameter for the degrees of freedom (dof) that may limit its\ncapability to model the tail dependence structure in a multivariate case. To\novercome this problem, grouped t copula was proposed recently, where risks are\ngrouped a priori in such a way that each group has a standard t copula with its\nspecific dof parameter. In this paper we propose the use of a grouped t copula,\nwhere each group consists of one risk factor only, so that a priori grouping is\nnot required. The copula characteristics in the bivariate case are studied. We\nexplain simulation and calibration procedures, including a simulation study on\nfinite sample properties of the maximum likelihood estimators and Kendall's tau\napproximation. This new copula can be significantly different from the standard\nt copula in terms of risk measures such as tail dependence, value at risk and\nexpected shortfall.\n  Keywords: grouped t copula, tail dependence, risk management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2007 00:32:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2009 01:23:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 16 Feb 2010 00:30:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.5301", "submitter": "Daniel Sevcovic", "authors": "Daniel Sevcovic", "title": "An iterative algorithm for evaluating approximations to the optimal\n  exercise boundary for a nonlinear Black-Scholes equation", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA", "license": null, "abstract": "  The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compute the early exercise\nboundary for a class of nonlinear Black--Scholes equations with a nonlinear\nvolatility which can be a function of the second derivative of the option price\nitself. A motivation for studying the nonlinear Black--Scholes equation with a\nnonlinear volatility arises from option pricing models taking into account e.g.\nnontrivial transaction costs, investor's preferences, feedback and illiquid\nmarkets effects and risk from a volatile (unprotected) portfolio. We present a\nnew method how to transform the free boundary problem for the early exercise\nboundary position into a solution of a time depending nonlinear parabolic\nequation defined on a fixed domain. We furthermore propose an iterative\nnumerical scheme that can be used to find an approximation of the free\nboundary. We present results of numerical approximation of the early exercise\nboundary for various types of nonlinear Black--Scholes equations and we discuss\ndependence of the free boundary on various model parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Oct 2007 18:04:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sevcovic", "Daniel", ""]]}]
