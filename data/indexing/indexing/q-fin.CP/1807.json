Modern approaches, often relying on ADP, simulation, and/or\nduality, have limited rigorous guarantees, which may scale poorly and/or\nrequire previous knowledge of basis functions. A key difficulty with many\napproaches is that to yield stronger guarantees, they would necessitate the\ncomputation of deeply nested conditional expectations, with the depth scaling\nwith the time horizon T.\n  We overcome this fundamental obstacle by providing an algorithm which can\ntrade-off between the guaranteed quality of approximation and the level of\nnesting required in a principled manner, without requiring a set of good basis\nfunctions. We develop a novel pure-dual approach, inspired by a connection to\nnetwork flows. This leads to a representation for the optimal value as an\ninfinite sum for which: 1. each term is the expectation of an elegant\nrecursively defined infimum; 2. the first k terms only require k levels of\nnesting; and 3. truncating at the first k terms yields an error of 1/k. This\nenables us to devise a simple randomized algorithm whose runtime is effectively\nindependent of the dimension, beyond the need to simulate sample paths of the\nunderlying process. Indeed, our algorithm is completely data-driven in that it\nonly needs the ability to simulate the original process, and requires no prior\nknowledge of the underlying distribution. Our method allows one to elegantly\ntrade-off between accuracy and runtime through a parameter epsilon controlling\nthe associated performance guarantee, with computational and sample complexity\nboth polynomial in T (and effectively independent of the dimension) for any\nfixed epsilon, in contrast to past methods typically requiring a complexity\nscaling exponentially in these parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Jul 2018 02:53:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Aug 2018 18:47:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Goldberg", "David A.", ""], ["Chen", "Yilun", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.03192", "submitter": "Siddartha Ghoshal", "authors": "Sid Ghoshal, Stephen J.

For numerical implementation the pricing of\nderivatives with Libor market models is mainly carried out with Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The PDE grid approach is not particularly feasible due to Curse of\nDimensionality. The standard Monte Carlo method for American/Bermudan swaption\npricing more or less uses regression to estimate expected value as a linear\ncombination of basis functions (Longstaff and Schwartz). However, Monte Carlo\nmethod only provides the lower bound for American option price. Another\ncomplexity is the computation of the sensitivities of the option, the so-called\nGreeks, which are fundamental for a trader's hedging activity. Recently, an\nalternative numerical method based on deep learning and backward stochastic\ndifferential equations appeared in quite a few researches. For European style\noptions the feedforward deep neural networks (DNN) show not only feasibility\nbut also efficiency to obtain both prices and numerical Greeks. In this paper,\na new backward DNN solver is proposed for Bermudan swaptions. Our approach is\nrepresenting financial pricing problems in the form of high dimensional\nstochastic optimal control problems, FBSDEs, or equivalent PDEs. We demonstrate\nthat using backward DNN the high-dimension Bermudan swaption pricing and\nhedging can be solved effectively and efficiently. A comparison between Monte\nCarlo simulation and the new method for pricing vanilla interest rate options\nmanifests the superior performance of the new method. We then use this method\nto calculate prices and Greeks of Bermudan swaptions as a prelude for other\nLibor callable derivatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2018 18:53:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Sep 2018 17:05:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Haojie", ""], ["Chen", "Han", ""], ["Sudjianto", "Agus", ""], ["Liu", "Richard", ""], ["Shen", "Qi", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.08982", "submitter": "Lioudmila Vostrikova", "authors": "Lioudmila Vostrikova (LAREMA), Yuchao Dong", "title": "Utility maximization for L{\\'e}vy switching models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is devoted to the maximisation of HARA utilities of L{\\'e}vy\nswitching process on finite time interval via dual method.
