Using solutions of BSDEs on spaces related\nto finite state, continuous time Markov chains, we develop a theory of\nnonlinear expectations in the spirit of [Dynamically consistent nonlinear\nevaluations and expectations (2005) Shandong Univ.]. We prove basic properties\nof these expectations and show their applications to dynamic risk measures on\nsuch spaces. In particular, we prove comparison theorems for scalar and vector\nvalued solutions to BSDEs, and discuss arbitrage and risk measures in the\nscalar case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2008 01:49:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2010 10:35:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-14", "authors_parsed": [["Cohen", "Samuel N.", ""], ["Elliott", "Robert J.", ""]]}]
