One of the important problem connected with market graph is\nto identify it from observations. Traditional way for the market graph\nidentification is to use a simple procedure based on statistical estimations of\nPearson correlations between pairs of stocks. Recently a new class of\nstatistical procedures for the market graph identification was introduced and\noptimality of these procedures in Pearson correlation Gaussian network was\nproved. However the obtained procedures have a high reliability only for\nGaussian multivariate distributions of stocks attributes. One of the way to\ncorrect this drawback is to consider a different networks generated by\ndifferent measures of pairwise similarity of stocks. A new and promising model\nin this context is the sign similarity network. In the present paper the market\ngraph identification problem in sign similarity network is considered. A new\nclass of statistical procedures for the market graph identification is\nintroduced and optimality of these procedures is proved. Numerical experiments\ndetect essential difference in quality of optimal procedures in sign similarity\nand Pearson correlation networks. In particular it is observed that the quality\nof optimal identification procedure in sign similarity network is not sensitive\nto the assumptions on distribution of stocks attributes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2015 22:44:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-22", "authors_parsed": [["Kalyagin", "V.
