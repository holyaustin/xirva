It studies a financial market with asset\nprices that follow jump-diffusions with negative jumps. The central building\nblock of the market model is its growth optimal portfolio (GOP), which\nmaximizes the growth rate of strictly positive portfolios. Primary security\naccount prices, when expressed in units of the GOP, turn out to be nonnegative\nlocal martingales. In the proposed framework an equivalent risk neutral\nprobability measure need not exist. Derivative prices are obtained as\nconditional expectations of corresponding future payoffs, with the GOP as\nnumeraire and the real world probability as pricing measure. The time when the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio with no positive jumps, when expressed in units\nof the GOP, is reached, is shown to be a generic representation of an honest\ntime. We provide a general formula for the law of such honest times and compute\nthe conditional distributions of the global maximum of a portfolio in this\nframework. Moreover, we provide a stochastic integral representation for\nuniformly integrable martingales whose terminal values are functions of the\nglobal maximum of a portfolio. These formulae are model independent and\nuniversal. We also specialize our results to some examples where we hedge a\npayoff that arrives at an honest time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Aug 2008 09:33:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Nikeghbali", "Ashkan", ""], ["Platen", "Eckhard", ""]]}]
