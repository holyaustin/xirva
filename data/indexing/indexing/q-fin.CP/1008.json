We extend standard CVAR\nmodels to incorporate estimation of model parameters in the presence of price\nseries level shifts which are not accurately modeled in the standard Gaussian\nerror correction model (ECM) framework. This involves developing a novel matrix\nvariate Bayesian CVAR mixture model comprised of Gaussian errors intra-day and\nAlpha-stable errors inter-day in the ECM framework. To achieve this we derive a\nnovel conjugate posterior model for the Scaled Mixtures of Normals (SMiN CVAR)\nrepresentation of Alpha-stable inter-day innovations. These results are\ngeneralized to asymmetric models for the innovation noise at inter-day\nboundaries allowing for skewed Alpha-stable models.\n  Our proposed model and sampling methodology is general, incorporating the\ncurrent literature on Gaussian models as a special subclass and also allowing\nfor price series level shifts either at random estimated time points or known a\npriori time points. We focus analysis on regularly observed non-Gaussian level\nshifts that can have significant effect on estimation performance in\nstatistical models failing to account for such level shifts, such as at the\nclose and open of markets. We compare the estimation accuracy of our model and\nestimation approach to standard frequentist and Bayesian procedures for CVAR\nmodels when non-Gaussian price series level shifts are present in the\nindividual series, such as inter-day boundaries. We fit a bi-variate\nAlpha-stable model to the inter-day jumps and model the effect of such jumps on\nestimation of matrix-variate CVAR model parameters using the likelihood based\nJohansen procedure and a Bayesian estimation. We illustrate our model and the\ncorresponding estimation procedures we develop on both synthetic and actual\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 06:29:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Kannan", "Balakrishnan B.", ""], ["Lasscock", "Ben", ""], ["Mellen", "Chris", ""], ["Godsill", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0401", "submitter": "Jan Hendrik Witte", "authors": "Jan Hendrik Witte and Christoph Reisinger", "title": "A Penalty Method for the Numerical Solution of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\n  (HJB) Equations in Finance", "comments": "18 Pages, 4 Figures.
