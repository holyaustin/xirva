To determine\nreturn volatility in the spin financial market we use the GARCH model often\nused for volatility estimation in empirical finance. We apply the Bayesian\ninference performed by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to the parameter\nestimation of the GARCH model. It is found that volatility determined by the\nGARCH model exhibits \"volatility clustering\" also observed in the real\nfinancial markets. Using volatility determined by the GARCH model we examine\nthe mixture-of-distribution hypothesis (MDH) suggested for the asset return\ndynamics. We find that the returns standardized by volatility are approximately\nstandard normal random variables. Moreover we find that the absolute\nstandardized returns show no significant autocorrelation. These findings are\nconsistent with the view of the MDH for the return dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Aug 2014 14:51:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Takaishi", "Tetsuya", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0697", "submitter": "Bowei Chen", "authors": "Bowei Chen and Jun Wang", "title": "A lattice framework for pricing display advertisement options with the\n  stochastic volatility underlying model", "comments": "Bowei Chen and Jun Wang.

Simply, an ad option is a first look contract in which a publisher\nor search engine grants an advertiser a right but not obligation to enter into\ntransactions to purchase impressions or clicks from a specific ad slot at a\npre-specified price on a specific delivery date. Such a structure provides\nadvertisers with more flexibility of their guaranteed deliveries. The valuation\nof ad options is an important topic and previous studies on ad options pricing\nhave been mostly restricted to the situations where the underlying prices\nfollow a geometric Brownian motion (GBM). This assumption is reasonable for\nsponsored search; however, some studies have also indicated that it is not\nvalid for display advertising. In this paper, we address this issue by\nemploying a stochastic volatility (SV) model and discuss a lattice framework to\napproximate the proposed SV model in option pricing. Our developments are\nvalidated by experiments with real advertising data: (i) we find that the SV\nmodel has a better fitness over the GBM model; (ii) we validate the proposed\nlattice model via two sequential Monte Carlo simulation methods; (iii) we\ndemonstrate that advertisers are able to flexibly manage their guaranteed\ndeliveries by using the proposed options, and publishers can have an increased\nrevenue when some of their inventories are sold via ad options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 13:20:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 14:59:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2015 20:57:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 23:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Bowei", ""], ["Wang", "Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.1956", "submitter": "Enrique ter Horst A", "authors": "Roberto Casarin and Fabrizio Leisen and German Molina and Enrique ter\n  Horst", "title": "A Bayesian Beta Markov Random Field Calibration of the Term Structure of\n  Implied Risk Neutral Densities", "comments": "27 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We build on the work in Fackler and King 1990, and propose a more general\ncalibration model for implied risk neutral densities.
