The corresponding\ncalibration problem is addressed within an online framework, allowing the use\nof multiple price surfaces. Since uncertainty in the observation of the\nunderlying future prices translates to uncertainty in data locations, we\npropose a model-based adjustment of such prices that improves reconstructions\nand smile adherence. In order to tackle the ill-posedness of the calibration\nproblem we incorporate a priori information through a judiciously designed\nTikhonov-type regularization. Extensive empirical tests with market as well as\nsynthetic data are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology and\nalgorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 20:01:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Albani", "Vinicius", ""], ["Ascher", "Uri M.", ""], ["Zubelli", "Jorge P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.04423", "submitter": "Vladislav Malyshkin", "authors": "Vladislav Gennadievich Malyshkin", "title": "Market Dynamics.

However, the measurement or estimation of Supply and\nDemand at price different from the execution price is not possible even after\nthe transaction. An approach in which Supply and Demand are always matched, but\nthe rate $I=dv/dt$ (number of units traded per unit time) of their matching\nvaries, is proposed. The state of the system is determined not by a price $p$,\nbut by a probability distribution defined as the square of a wavefunction\n$\\psi(p)$. The equilibrium state $\\psi^{[H]}$ is postulated to be the one\ngiving maximal $I$ and obtained from maximizing the matching rate functional\n$<I\\psi^2(p)>/<\\psi^2(p)>$, i.e. solving the dynamic equation of the form\n\"future price tend to the value maximizing the number of shares traded per unit\ntime\". An application of the theory in a quasi--stationary case is\ndemonstrated. This transition from Supply and Demand concept to Liquidity\nDeficit concept, described by the matching rate $I$, allows to operate only\nwith observable variables, and have a theory applicable to practical problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 06:39:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Malyshkin", "Vladislav Gennadievich", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.05356", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Marcel Ausloos and Roy Cerqueti", "title": "Studies on Regional Wealth Inequalities: the case of Italy", "comments": "17 pages; 2 tables; 7 figures; 25 references; prepared for Acta\n  Physica Polonica (FENS 2015)", "journal-ref": "Acta Physica Polonica A 129 (2016) 959-964", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper contains a short review of techniques examining regional wealth\ninequalities based on recently published research work but is also presenting\nunpublished features.\n  The data pertains to Italy (IT), over the period 2007-2011: the number of\ncities in regions, the number of inhabitants in cities and in regions, as well\nas the aggregated tax income of the cities and of regions.
