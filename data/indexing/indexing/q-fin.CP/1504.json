An overview of various\noperator splitting methods is presented for the efficient numerical solution of\nthese problems.\n  Splitting schemes of the Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) type are\ndiscussed for multidimensional problems, e.g. given by stochastic volatility\n(SV) models. For jump models Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) methods are considered\nwhich efficiently treat the nonlocal jump operator. For American options an\neasy-to-implement operator splitting method is described for the resulting\nlinear complementarity problems.\n  Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the actual stability and\nconvergence of the splitting schemes. Here European and American put options\nare considered under four asset price models: the classical Black-Scholes\nmodel, the Merton jump-diffusion model, the Heston SV model, and the Bates SV\nmodel with jumps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 16:50:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Hout", "Karel in 't", ""], ["Toivanen", "Jari", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.01150", "submitter": "Alexandre Popier", "authors": "T Kruse, A Popier (LMM)", "title": "Minimal supersolutions for BSDEs with singular terminal condition and\n  application to optimal position targeting", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.OC q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the existence of a minimal supersolution for backward stochastic\ndifferential equations when the terminal data can take the value +$\\infty$ with\npositive probability.

The noises can naturally be\nnon-Gaussian (skewed and/or heavy tailed) or to accommodate spurious\nobservations, noises can be modeled as heavy tailed. However, at the cost of\nsuch noise robustness, the performance may degrade when such spurious\nobservations are absent. Therefore, any inference engine should not only be\nrobust to noise outlier, but also be adaptive to potentially unknown and time\nvarying noise parameters; yet it should be scalable and easy to implement.\n  To address them, we envisage here a new noise adaptive Rao-Blackwellized\nparticle filter (RBPF), by leveraging a hierarchically Gaussian model as a\nproxy for any non-Gaussian (process or measurement) noise density. This leads\nto a conditionally linear Gaussian model (CLGM), that is tractable. However,\nthis framework requires a valid transition kernel for the intractable state,\ntargeted by the particle filter (PF). This is typically unknown. We outline how\nsuch kernel can be constructed provably, at least for certain classes\nencompassing many commonly occurring non-Gaussian noises, using auxiliary\nlatent variable approach.
