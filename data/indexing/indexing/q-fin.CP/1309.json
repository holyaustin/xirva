The aim of this paper is to generalize the\ncomprehensive structural model for defaultable fixed income bonds (considered\nin [1]) into a comprehensive unified model of structural and reduced form\nmodels. Here we consider the one factor model and the two factor model. In the\none factor model the bond holders receive the deterministic coupon at\npredetermined coupon dates and the face value (debt) and the coupon at the\nmaturity as well as the effect of government taxes which are paid on the\nproceeds of an investment in bonds is considered under constant short rate. In\nthe two factor model the bond holders receive the stochastic coupon (discounted\nvalue of that at the maturity) at predetermined coupon dates and the face value\n(debt) and the coupon at the maturity as well as the effect of government taxes\nwhich are paid on the proceeds of an investment in bonds is considered under\nstochastic short rate. The expected default event occurs when the equity value\nis not enough to pay coupon or debt at the coupon dates or maturity and\nunexpected default event can occur at the first jump time of a Poisson process\nwith the given default intensity provided by a step function of time variable.\nWe consider the model and pricing formula for equity value and using it\ncalculate expected default barrier. Then we provide pricing model and formula\nfor defaultable corporate bonds with discrete coupons and consider its duration\nand the effect of the government taxes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Sep 2013 14:20:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 15:46:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 28 Sep 2013 04:35:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["O", "Hyong-Chol", ""], ["Kim", "Song-Yon", ""], ["Kim", "Dong-Hyok", ""], ["Pak", "Chol-Hyok", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.3832", "submitter": "Mike Ludkovski", "authors": "Robert B.

To this end, we examine sequential\ndesign schemes that adaptively place new design points close to the stopping\nboundaries. We then discuss dynamic regression algorithms that can implement\nsuch recursive estimation and local refinement of the classifiers.

Often Least Squares Monte\nCarlo techniques are used for the estimation. One method that can be combined\nwith Least Squares Monte Carlo is the \"Regress-Later\" method. Unlike\nconventional methods where the value function is regressed on a set of basis\nfunctions valued at the beginning of the interval, the \"Regress-Later\" method\nregresses the value function on a set of basis functions valued at the end of\nthe interval. The conditional expectation across the interval is then computed\nexactly for each basis function. We provide sufficient conditions under which\nwe derive the convergence rate of Regress-Later estimators. Importantly, our\nresults hold on non-compact sets. We show that the Regress-Later method is\ncapable of converging significantly faster than conventional methods and\nprovide an explicit example.
