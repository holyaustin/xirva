The problem of ranking response surfaces is motivated by\nestimating optimal feedback policy maps in stochastic control problems, aiming\nto efficiently find the index associated to the minimal response across the\nentire continuous input space $\\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$. By\nconsidering points in $\\mathcal{X}$ as pixels and indices of the minimal\nsurfaces as labels, we recast the problem as an image segmentation problem,\nwhich assigns a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same\nlabel share certain characteristics. This provides an alternative method for\nefficiently solving the problem instead of using sequential design in our\nprevious work [R. Hu and M. Ludkovski, SIAM/ASA Journal on Uncertainty\nQuantification, 5 (2017), 212--239].\n  Deep learning algorithms are scalable, parallel and model-free, i.e., no\nparametric assumptions needed on the response surfaces. Considering ranking\nresponse surfaces as image segmentation allows one to use a broad class of deep\nneural networks, e.g., UNet, SegNet, DeconvNet, which have been widely applied\nand numerically proved to possess high accuracy in the field.
