While\nprevious models reported in the literature are also capable of replicating some\nof these statistical properties, in general, they tend to oversimplify either\nthe trading mechanisms or the behavior of the agents. In our model, we strived\nto capture the most important characteristics of both aspects to create agents\nthat employ strategies inspired on those used in real markets, and, at the same\ntime, a more realistic trade mechanism based on a double auction order book. We\nstudy the role of the distinct types of trader on the return statistics:\nspecifically, correlation properties (or lack thereof), volatilty clustering,\nheavy tails, and the degree to which the distribution can be described by a\nlog-normal. Further, by introducing the practice of profit taking, our model is\nalso capable of replicating the stylized fact related to an asymmetry in the\ndistribution of losses and gains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2016 22:30:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Jul 2016 03:38:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Navarro", "Roberto Mota", ""], ["Ridaura", "Hern\u00e1n Larralde", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00822", "submitter": "Aurelien Hazan", "authors": "Aur\\'elien Hazan", "title": "Volume of the steady-state space of financial flows in a monetary\n  stock-flow-consistent model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2017.01.050", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that a steady-state stock-flow consistent macro-economic model can be\nrepresented as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).The set of solutions is\na polytope, which volume depends on the constraintsapplied and reveals the\npotential fragility of the economic circuit,with no need to study the dynamics.\nSeveral methods to compute the volume are compared, inspired by operations\nresearch methods and theanalysis of metabolic networks, both exact and\napproximate.We also introduce a random transaction matrix, and study the\nparticularcase of linear flows with respect to money stocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 13:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 13:14:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 14:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Hazan", "Aur\u00e9lien", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00919", "submitter": "Andrei Cozma Mr", "authors": "Andrei Cozma and Christoph Reisinger", "title": "Exponential integrability properties of Euler discretization schemes for\n  the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross process", "comments": "24 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze exponential integrability properties of the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross\n(CIR) process and its Euler discretizations with various types of truncation\nand reflection at 0.

RiskRank is a general-purpose aggregation\noperator that concurrently accounts for risk levels for individual entities and\ntheir interconnectedness. The measure relies on the decomposition of systemic\nrisk into sub-components that are in turn assessed using a set of risk measures\nand their relationships. For this purpose, motivated by the development of the\nChoquet integral, we employ the RiskRank function to aggregate risk measures,\nallowing for the integration of the interrelation of different factors in the\naggregation process. The use of RiskRank is illustrated through a real-world\ncase in a European setting, in which we show that it performs well in\nout-of-sample analysis. In the example, we provide an estimation of systemic\nrisk from country-level risk and cross-border linkages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Jan 2016 23:27:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Mezei", "J\u00f3zsef", ""], ["Sarlin", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07864", "submitter": "Nikolaos Halidias", "authors": "Nikolaos Halidias", "title": "On construction of boundary preserving numerical schemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our aim in this note is to extend the semi discrete technique by combine it\nwith the split step method.
