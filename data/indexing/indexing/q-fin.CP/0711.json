We show that strict local martingales arise\nwhenever there is a consistent family of change of measures where the two\nmeasures are not equivalent to one another. Several old and new strict local\nmartingales are identified. We treat examples of diffusions with various\nboundary behavior, size-bias sampling of diffusion paths, and non-colliding\ndiffusions. A multidimensional generalization to conformal strict local\nmartingales is achieved through Kelvin transform. As curious examples of\nnon-standard behavior, we show by various examples that strict local\nmartingales do not behave uniformly when the function (x-K)^+ is applied to\nthem. Implications to the recent literature on financial bubbles are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Nov 2007 19:04:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2007 20:46:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 05:53:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 20:11:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pal", "Soumik", ""], ["Protter", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.1594", "submitter": "Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos", "authors": "Konstantinos Kalogeropoulos, Gareth O.
