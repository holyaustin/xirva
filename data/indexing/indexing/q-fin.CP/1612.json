American option prices can be obtained\nby solving linear complementary problems (LCPs) with the same operators. A\nfinite difference discretization leads to a so-called full order model (FOM).\nReduced order models (ROMs) are derived employing proper orthogonal\ndecomposition (POD). The early exercise constraint of American options is\nenforced by a penalty on subset of grid points. The presented numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that pricing with ROMs can be orders of magnitude\nfaster within a given model parameter variation range.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 19:58:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Balajewicz", "Maciej", ""], ["Toivanen", "Jari", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.03031", "submitter": "Paola Pederzoli", "authors": "Antonio Cosma, Stefano Galluccio, Paola Pederzoli, Olivier Scaillet", "title": "Early exercise decision in American options with dividends, stochastic\n  volatility and jumps", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using a fast numerical technique, we investigate a large database of investor\nsuboptimal non-exercise of short maturity American call options on\ndividend-paying stocks listed on the Dow Jones.
