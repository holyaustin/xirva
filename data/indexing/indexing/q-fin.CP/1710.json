Our\napproach is based on the contour integration method, and gives rise to a\nrepresentation of the tail probability of a compound distribution in the form\nof a rapidly convergent one-dimensional integral involving a discontinuity of\nthe imaginary part of its moment generating function across a branch cut. The\nlatter integral can be evaluated in quadratures, or alternatively represented\nas an asymptotic expansion. Our approach thus offers a viable (especially at\nhigh percentile levels) alternative to more standard methods such as Monte\nCarlo or the Fast Fourier Transform, traditionally used for such problems. As a\npractical application, we use our method to compute the operational Value at\nRisk (VAR) of a financial institution, where individual losses are modeled as\nspliced distributions whose large loss components are given by power-law or\nlognormal distributions. Finally, we briefly discuss extensions of the present\nformalism for calculation of tail probabilities of compound distributions made\nof compound distributions with heavy tails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 15:50:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Halperin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01797", "submitter": "Kathrin Glau Dr.", "authors": "Kathrin Glau, Paul Herold, Dilip B.
