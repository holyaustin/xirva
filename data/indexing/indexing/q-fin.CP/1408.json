We model a simple financial system in which banks\ndecide about their investment strategy based on a private belief about the\nstate of the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of\npeers. Observing a larger group of peers conveys more information and thus\nleads to a stronger social belief. Extending the standard model of Bayesian\nupdating in social networks, we show that the probability that banks\nsynchronize their investment strategy on a state non-matching action critically\ndepends on the weighting between private and social belief. This effect is\nalleviated when banks choose their peers endogenously in a network formation\nprocess, internalizing the externalities arising from social learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2014 00:02:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Aymanns", "Christoph", ""], ["Georg", "Co-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0981", "submitter": "Tetsuya Takaishi", "authors": "Tetsuya Takaishi", "title": "Bayesian estimation of realized stochastic volatility model by Hybrid\n  Monte Carlo algorithm", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Physics: Conference Series 490 (2014) 012092", "doi": "10.1088/1742-6596/490/1/012092", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm (HMCA) is applied for Bayesian parameter\nestimation of the realized stochastic volatility (RSV) model.

When\ntransition density of the underlying asset or its moments are known in closed\nform, it can be convenient and more efficient to utilize direct integration\nmethods to calculate the required option price expectations in a backward\ntime-stepping algorithm. This paper presents a simple, robust and efficient\nalgorithm that can be applied for pricing many exotic options by computing the\nexpectations using Gauss-Hermite integration quadrature applied on a cubic\nspline interpolation. The algorithm is fully explicit but does not suffer the\ninherent instability of the explicit finite difference counterpart. A `free'\nbonus of the algorithm is that it already contains the function for fast and\naccurate interpolation of multiple solutions required by many discretely\nmonitored path dependent options. For illustrations, we present examples of\npricing a series of American options with either Bermudan or continuous\nexercise features, and a series of exotic path-dependent options of target\naccumulation redemption note (TARN). Results of the new method are compared\nwith Monte Carlo and finite difference methods, including some of the most\nadvanced or best known finite difference algorithms in the literature. The\ncomparison shows that, despite its simplicity, the new method can rival with\nsome of the best finite difference algorithms in accuracy and at the same time\nit is significantly faster. Virtually the same algorithm can be applied to\nprice other path-dependent financial contracts such as Asian options and\nvariable annuities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2014 07:37:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 17 Sep 2014 01:21:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 01:46:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}]
