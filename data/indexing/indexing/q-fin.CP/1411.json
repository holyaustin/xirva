Our study shows a characteristic called\n\"fat tail\" is seen in the data obtained from our model that incorporates the\ninvestors' swarm behaviors. Our model captures two swarm behaviors: one is\ninvestors' behavior to follow a trend in the historical price movement, and\nanother is investors' behavior to send orders that contradict a trend in the\nhistorical price movement. In order to capture the features of influence by the\nswarm behaviors, from price data derived from our simulations using these\nmodels, we analyzed the price movement range, that is, how much the price is\nmoved when it is continuously moved in a single direction. Depending on the\ntype of swarm behavior, we saw a difference in the cumulative frequency\ndistribution of this price movement range. In particular, for the model of\ninvestors who followed a trend in the historical price movement, we saw the\npower law in the tail of the cumulative frequency distribution of this price\nmovement range. In addition, we analyzed the shape of the tail of the\ncumulative frequency distribution. The result demonstrated that one of the\nreasons the trend following of price occurs is that orders temporarily swarm on\nthe order book in accordance with past price trends.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2014 10:02:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ichiki", "Shingo", ""], ["Nishinari", "Katsuhiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2628", "submitter": "Liviu-Adrian Cotfas", "authors": "Liviu-Adrian Cotfas, Camelia Delcea, Nicolae Cotfas", "title": "Exact solution of a generalized version of the Black-Scholes equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze a generalized version of the Black-Scholes equation depending on a\nparameter $a\\!\\in \\!(-\\infty,0)$.

This product simultaneously deals with financial\nrisk, mortality risk and human behaviour. We assume that market is complete in\nfinancial risk and mortality risk is completely diversified by selling enough\npolicies and thus the annuity price can be expressed as appropriate\nexpectation. The computing engine employed to solve the optimal stochastic\ncontrol problem is based on a robust and efficient Gauss-Hermite quadrature\nmethod with cubic spline. We present results for three different types of death\nbenefit and show that, under the optimal policyholder behaviour, adding the\npremium for the death benefit on top of the GMWB can be problematic for\ncontracts with long maturities if the continuous fee structure is kept, which\nis ordinarily assumed for a GMWB contract. In fact for some long maturities it\ncan be shown that the fee cannot be charged as any proportion of the account\nvalue -- there is no solution to match the initial premium with the fair\nannuity price. On the other hand, the extra fee due to adding the death benefit\ncan be charged upfront or in periodic instalment of fixed amount, and it is\ncheaper than buying a separate life insurance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 06:45:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 06:02:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}]
