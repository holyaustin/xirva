The proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio\nvalue bounded within a targeted range, composed of a conservative lower target\nrepresenting a need for capital protection and a desired upper target\nrepresenting an investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire\nprobability distribution of returns, as it simultaneously seeks a desired\nexpected return, cuts off downside risk and implicitly caps volatility and\nhigher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of this investment strategy, we\nstudy a multiperiod portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs and\ndevelop a two-stage regression approach that improves the classical least\nsquares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm when dealing with difficult payoffs, such\nas highly concave, abruptly changing or discontinuous functions. Our numerical\nresults show substantial improvements over the classical LSMC algorithm for\nboth the constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility approach and the\nproposed skewed target range strategy (STRS). Our numerical results illustrate\nthe ability of the STRS to contain the portfolio value within the targeted\nrange. When compared with the CRRA utility approach, the STRS achieves a\nsimilar mean-variance efficient frontier while delivering a better downside\nrisk-return trade-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 03:50:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 06:21:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 02:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rongju", ""], ["Langren\u00e9", "Nicolas", ""], ["Tian", "Yu", ""], ["Zhu", "Zili", ""], ["Klebaner", "Fima", ""], ["Hamza", "Kais", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.02036", "submitter": "Andres P.

Price limit\nrules are introduced in the definition of relative price. The order placement\nprocess is determined by several empirical regularities: the long memory in\norder directions, the long memory in relative prices, the asymmetric\ndistribution of relative prices, and the nonlinear dependence of the average\norder size and its standard deviation on the relative price. Order cancellation\nfollows a Poisson process with the arrival rate determined from real data and\nthe cancelled order is determined according to the empirical distributions of\nrelative price level and relative position at the same price level. All these\ningredients of the model are derived based on the empirical microscopic\nregularities in the order flows of stocks on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. The\nmodel is able to produce the main stylized facts in real markets. Computational\nexperiments uncover that asymmetric setting of price limits will cause the\nstock price diverging exponentially when the up price limit is higher than the\ndown price limit and vanishing vice versus. We also find that asymmetric price\nlimits have influences on stylized facts.
