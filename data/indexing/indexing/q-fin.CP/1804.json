Both unilateral and bilateral types of\ncredit risks are considered. Our study shows that credit risk should be modeled\nas American style options in most cases, which require a backward induction\nvaluation. To correct a common mistake in the literature, we emphasize that the\nmarket value of a defaultable derivative is actually a risky value rather than\na risk-free value. Credit value adjustment (CVA) is also elaborated. A\npractical framework is developed for pricing defaultable derivatives and\ncalculating their CVAs at a portfolio level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2018 15:05:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.03975", "submitter": "Daniel Roth", "authors": "Thomas Gerstner, Bastian Harrach, Daniel Roth", "title": "Monte Carlo pathwise sensitivities for barrier options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.
