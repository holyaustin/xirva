More precisely, we propose to view the RND recovery problem as an\ninverse problem. We first show that it is possible to define restricted put and\ncall operators that admit a singular value decomposition (SVD), which we\ncompute explicitly. We subsequently show that this new framework allows us to\ndevise a simple and fast quadratic programming method to recover the smoothest\nRND whose corresponding put prices lie inside the bid-ask quotes. This method\nis termed the spectral recovery method (SRM). Interestingly, the SVD of the\nrestricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the RND recovery\nproblem. The SRM improves on other RND recovery methods in the sense that:\n  - it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single\nquadratic program, while being fully nonparametric; - it takes the bid ask\nquotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration, smoothing or\npreprocessing of the data; - it is robust to the paucity of price quotes; - it\nreturns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask\nquotes. The estimated RND is therefore as well-behaved as can be; - it returns\na closed form estimate of the RND on the interval [0,B] of the positive real\nline, where B is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily. We thus\nobtain both the middle part of the RND together with its full left tail and\npart of its right tail.\n  We confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it\nfares well in practice. The SRM is thus found to be a promising alternative to\nother RND recovery methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 18:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Monnier", "Jean-Baptiste", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.3306", "submitter": "Takashi Kato", "authors": "Takashi Kato, Akihiko Takahashi, Toshihiro Yamada", "title": "An Asymptotic Expansion Formula for Up-and-Out Barrier Option Price\n  under Stochastic Volatility Model", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": "JSIAM Letters Vol. 5 (2013) p.17-20", "doi": "10.14495/jsiaml.5.17", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper derives a new semi closed-form approximation formula for pricing\nan up-and-out barrier option under a certain type of stochastic volatility\nmodel including SABR model by applying a rigorous asymptotic expansion method\ndeveloped by Kato, Takahashi and Yamada (2012).
