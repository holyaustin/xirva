The Feller conditions are\nusually imposed on a continuous time multivariate square root process to ensure\nthat the roots have nonnegative arguments. For a discrete time approximate\nmodel, the Feller conditions do not give this guarantee. Moreover, in a\nmacro-finance context the restrictions imposed might be economically\nunappealing. At the same time, it has also been observed that even without the\nFeller conditions imposed, for a practically relevant term structure model,\nnegative arguments rarely occur. Using models estimated on German data, we\ncompare the yields implied by (approximate) analytic exponentially affine\nexpressions to those obtained through Monte Carlo simulations of very high\nnumbers of sample paths. It turns out that the differences are rarely\nstatistically significant, whether the Feller conditions are imposed or not.\nMoreover, economically the differences are negligible, as they are always below\none basis point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Apr 2008 14:48:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Spreij", "Peter", ""], ["Veerman", "Enno", ""], ["Vlaar", "Peter", ""]]}]
