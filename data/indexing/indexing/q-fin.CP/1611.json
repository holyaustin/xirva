This is then\napplied to VIX derivatives along with minor adjustments to handle issues caused\nby the square root function. The upper bound involves the evaluation of a\nvariance swap, while the lower bound involves estimating a martingale increment\ncorresponding to its hedging portfolio. Both can be achieved simultaneously\nusing a single linear least square regression.
