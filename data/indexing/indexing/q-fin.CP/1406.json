One of such recent approaches is\ncalled volatility homogenisation decomposition, and has been designed\nspecifically to aid the forecasting of price changes on financial markets. The\nauthors of this method have attempted to prove the its usefulness by applying a\nspecific forecasting procedure and determining the effectiveness of this\nprocedure on the decomposed time series, as compared with the original time\nseries. This is problematic in at least two ways. First, the choice of the\nforecasting procedure obviously has an effect on the results, rendering them\nnon-exhaustive. Second, the results obtained were not completely convincing,\nwith some values falling under 50% guessing rate. Additionally, only nine\nAustralian stocks were being investigated, which further limits the scope of\nthis proof. In this study we propose to find the usefulness of volatility\nhomogenisation by calculating the predictability of the decomposed time series\nand comparing it to the predictability of the original time series.
