The model is\nshown to have two distinct limiting states, corresponding to small and\nasymptotically large volatilities, respectively. These volatility regimes are\nseparated by a phase transition at some critical value of the volatility. We\ninvestigate the conditions under which this phase transition occurs, and show\nthat it is related to the position of the zeros of an appropriately defined\ngenerating function in the complex plane, in analogy with the Lee-Yang theory\nof the phase transitions in condensed matter physics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2010 14:36:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2010 10:49:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Jan 2011 10:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Pirjol", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.2593", "submitter": "Michael Kearns", "authors": "Michael Kearns, Alex Kulesza, Yuriy Nevmyvaka", "title": "Empirical Limitations on High Frequency Trading Profitability", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Addressing the ongoing examination of high-frequency trading practices in\nfinancial markets, we report the results of an extensive empirical study\nestimating the maximum possible profitability of the most aggressive such\npractices, and arrive at figures that are surprisingly modest. By \"aggressive\"\nwe mean any trading strategy exclusively employing market orders and relatively\nshort holding periods. Our findings highlight the tension between execution\ncosts and trading horizon confronted by high-frequency traders, and provide a\ncontrolled and large-scale empirical perspective on the high-frequency debate\nthat has heretofore been absent.

Standard\nmethods can be applied to solve the stochastic differential equations of the\nsuccessive LIBOR rates but the methods are generally slow. Our contribution is\ntwofold. Firstly, we propose an alternative approximation scheme based on\nPicard iterations. This approach is similar in accuracy to the Euler\ndiscretization, but with the feature that each rate is evolved independently of\nthe other rates in the term structure. This enables simultaneous calculation of\nderivative prices of different maturities using parallel computing. Secondly,\nthe product terms occurring in the drift of a LIBOR market model driven by a\njump process grow exponentially as a function of the number of rates, quickly\nrendering the model intractable. We reduce this growth from exponential to\nquadratic using truncated expansions of the product terms. We include numerical\nillustrations of the accuracy and speed of our method pricing caplets,\nswaptions and forward rate agreements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jul 2010 08:31:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 22:27:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Papapantoleon", "Antonis", ""], ["Skovmand", "David", ""]]}]
