Given its associations with fear and\nfine resolutions in frequency, the illiquidity of stocks may offer a promising\nperspective for understanding and even signaling a market crash. In this study,\nby connecting stocks with illiquidity comovements, an illiquidity network is\nestablished to model the market. Compared to noncrash days, on crash days the\nmarket is more densely connected due to heavier but more homogeneous\nilliquidity dependencies that facilitate abrupt collapses. Critical stocks in\nthe illiquidity network, particularly those in the finance sector, are targeted\nfor inspection because of their crucial roles in taking over and passing on the\nlosses of illiquidity. The cascading failures of stocks in market crashes are\nprofiled as disseminating from small degrees to high degrees that are usually\nlocated in the core of the illiquidity network and then back to the periphery.\nBy counting the days with random failures in the previous five days, an early\nsignal is implemented to successfully predict more than half of the crash days,\nespecially consecutive days in the early phase. Additional evidence from both\nthe Granger causality network and the random network further testifies to the\nrobustness of the signal. Our results would help market practitioners like\nregulators detect and prevent the risk of crashes in advance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2020 12:35:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Jul 2021 14:20:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Xiaoling", ""], ["Zhao", "Jichang", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.02198", "submitter": "Shiyi Wang", "authors": "Ivan Guo, Gregoire Loeper, Jan Obloj, Shiyi Wang", "title": "Joint Modelling and Calibration of SPX and VIX by Optimal Transport", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.OC q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper addresses the joint calibration problem of SPX options and VIX\noptions or futures.

In spite of the\navailability of data from multiple markets, current approaches in trading rely\nmainly on learning trading strategies per individual market. In this paper, we\ntake a step towards developing fully end-to-end global trading strategies that\nleverage systematic trends to produce superior market-specific trading\nstrategies. We introduce QuantNet: an architecture that learns market-agnostic\ntrends and use these to learn superior market-specific trading strategies. Each\nmarket-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder\ntransforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is\nprocessed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a\nmarket-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information\nfrom the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent\nadvances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are\nfree to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters\nare driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over\nidiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding\nthe problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns. We\nevaluate QuantNet on historical data across 3103 assets in 58 global equity\nmarkets. Against the top performing baseline, QuantNet yielded 51% higher\nSharpe and 69% Calmar ratios.

Alongside common\nmethods in time-series analysis of the economic markets, mapping the joint\nstructure of two time-series onto a network provides insight into hidden\naspects embedded in the couplings. We discretize the amplitude of two\ntime-series and investigate relative simultaneous locations of those\namplitudes. Each segment of a discretized amplitude is considered as a node.\nThe simultaneity of the amplitudes of the two time-series is considered as the\nedges in the network. The frequency of occurrences forms the weighted edges. In\norder to extract information, we need to measure that to what extent the\ncoupling deviates from the coupling of two uncoupled series. Also, we need to\nmeasure that to what extent the couplings inherit their characteristics from a\nGaussian distribution or a non-Gaussian distribution. We mapped the network\nfrom two surrogate time-series. The results show that the couplings of markets\npossess some features which diverge from the same features of the network\nmapped from white noise, and from the network mapped from two surrogate\ntime-series. These deviations prove that there exist joint information and\ncross-correlation therein. By applying the network's topological and\nstatistical measures and the deformation ratio in the joint probability\ndistribution, we distinguished basic structures of cross-correlation and\ncoupling of cross-markets. It was discovered that even two possibly known\nuncorrelated markets may possess some joint patterns with each other. Thereby,\nthose markets should be examined as coupled and \\textit{weakly} coupled\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Apr 2020 14:08:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Aug 2020 20:03:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ardalankia", "Jamshid", ""], ["Askari", "Jafar", ""], ["Sheykhali", "Somaye", ""], ["Haven", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Jafari", "G.

In\nthis paper, we propose a reductionism COP model that focuses exclusively on the\ninterplay between placing passive limit orders and sniping using aggressive\ntakeout orders.
