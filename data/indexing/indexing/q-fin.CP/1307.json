In recent research, a substantial effort has been\ninvested to develop sophisticated financial polarity-lexicons that can be used\nto investigate how financial sentiments relate to future company performance.\nHowever, based on experience from other fields, where sentiment analysis is\ncommonly applied, it is well-known that the overall semantic orientation of a\nsentence may differ from the prior polarity of individual words. The objective\nof this article is to investigate how semantic orientations can be better\ndetected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall\nphrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language. Our three\nmain contributions are: (1) establishment of a human-annotated finance\nphrase-bank, which can be used as benchmark for training and evaluating\nalternative models; (2) presentation of a technique to enhance financial\nlexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events\nthat affect overall sentiment; (3) development of a linearized phrase-structure\nmodel for detecting contextual semantic orientations in financial and economic\nnews texts. The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit\nof using the proposed learning-algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative\nstudy against previously used general sentiment models as well as the popular\nword frequency models used in recent financial studies. The proposed framework\nis parsimonious and avoids the explosion in feature-space caused by the use of\nconventional n-gram features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Jul 2013 20:49:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jul 2013 19:56:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Malo", "Pekka", ""], ["Sinha", "Ankur", ""], ["Takala", "Pyry", ""], ["Korhonen", "Pekka", ""], ["Wallenius", "Jyrki", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.6486", "submitter": "Marek Rutkowski", "authors": "Cyril Durand and Marek Rutkowski", "title": "CVA for Bilateral Counterparty Risk under Alternative Settlement\n  Conventions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We depart from the usual methods for pricing contracts with the counterparty\ncredit risk found in most of the existing literature. In effect, typically,\nthese models do not account for either systemic effects or at-first-default\ncontagion and postulate that the contract value at default equals either the\nrisk-free value or the pre-default value. We propose instead a fairly general\nframework, which allows us to perform effective Credit Value Adjustment (CVA)\ncomputations for a contract with bilateral counterparty risk in the presence of\nsystemic and wrong or right way risks. Our general methodology focuses on the\nrole of alternative settlement clauses, but it is also aimed to cover various\nfeatures of margin agreements. A comparative analysis of numerical results\nreported in the final section supports our initial conjecture that alternative\nspecifications of settlement values have a non-negligible impact on the CVA\ncomputation for contracts with bilateral counterparty risk. This emphasizes the\npractical importance of more sophisticated models that are capable of fully\nreflecting the actual features of financial contracts, as well as the influence\nof the market environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 16:45:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Durand", "Cyril", ""], ["Rutkowski", "Marek", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7070", "submitter": "Runhuan Feng", "authors": "Runhuan Feng and Hans W.
