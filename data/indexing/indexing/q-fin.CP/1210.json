We prove the strong existence and uniqueness of such processes and\nidentify them with the collections of ordered processes in a Brownian particle\nsystem, in which the drift coefficients, the diffusion coefficients, and the\ncollision local times for the individual particles are assigned according to\ntheir ranks. These Brownian systems can be viewed as generalizations of those\narising in first-order models for equity markets in the context of stochastic\nportfolio theory, and are able to correct for several shortcomings of such\nmodels while being equally amenable to computations. We also show that, in\naddition to being of interest in their own right, such systems of Brownian\nparticles arise as universal scaling limits of systems of jump processes on the\ninteger lattice with local interactions. A key step in the proof is the\nanalysis of a generalization of Skorokhod maps which include `local times' at\nthe intersection of faces of the nonnegative orthant. The result extends the\nconvergence of TASEP to its continuous analogue. Finally, we identify those\namong the Brownian particle systems which have a probabilistic structure of\ndeterminantal type.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2012 23:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Karatzas", "Ioannis", ""], ["Pal", "Soumik", ""], ["Shkolnikov", "Mykhaylo", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.0670", "submitter": "Hideyuki Tanaka", "authors": "Hideyuki Tanaka, Toshihiro Yamada", "title": "Strong Convergence for Euler-Maruyama and Milstein Schemes with\n  Asymptotic Method", "comments": "21 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by weak convergence results in the paper of Takahashi and Yoshida\n(2005), we show strong convergence for an accelerated Euler-Maruyama scheme\napplied to perturbed stochastic differential equations.
