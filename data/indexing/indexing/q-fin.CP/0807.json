We\nshow, that in the model with leverage, with jumps both in the volatility and in\nthe returns, all those measures are different, whereas in the model without\nleverage, with jumps in the volatility only and a continuous return process,\nseveral measures coincide, some simplifications can be made and the results are\nmore explicit.
