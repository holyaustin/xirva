The recent book Fouque,\nPapanicolaou, Sircar and S{\\o}lna (2011, CUP) analyzes models in which the\nvolatility of the underlying is driven by two diffusions -- one fast\nmean-reverting and one slow-varying, and provides a first order approximation\nfor European option prices and for the implied volatility surface, which is\ncalibrated to market data. Here, we present the full second order asymptotics,\nwhich are considerably more complicated due to a terminal layer near the option\nexpiration time. We find that, to second order, the implied volatility\napproximation depends quadratically on log-moneyness, capturing the convexity\nof the implied volatility curve seen in data. We introduce a new probabilistic\napproach to the terminal layer analysis needed for the derivation of the second\norder singular perturbation term, and calibrate to S&P 500 options data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 21:54:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 17:00:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 4 Jan 2014 04:45:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 18:45:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 15:44:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2015 16:22:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fouque", "Jean-Pierre", ""], ["Lorig", "Matthew", ""], ["Sircar", "Ronnie", ""]]}]
