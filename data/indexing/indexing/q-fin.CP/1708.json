We\nfind that the time change can be decomposed into two independent components.\nWhile the first component is a \\emph{finite} \\emph{generalized gamma\nconvolution} process whose increments can be sampled by either the exact double\nCFTP (\"coupling from the past\") method or an approximation scheme with high\nspeed and accuracy, the second component can easily be made arbitrarily small\nin the $L^1$ sense.

In the absence of analytical European option\npricing methods for the model, we focus on reducing the runtime-adjusted\nvariance of Monte Carlo implied volatilities, thereby contributing to the\nmodel's calibration by simulation. We employ a novel composition of variance\nreduction methods, immediately applicable to any conditionally log-normal\nstochastic volatility model. Assuming one targets implied volatility estimates\nwith a given degree of confidence, thus calibration RMSE, the results we\ndemonstrate equate to significant runtime reductions - roughly 20 times on\naverage, across different correlation regimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 17:13:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 10:07:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2018 22:15:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["McCrickerd", "Ryan", ""], ["Pakkanen", "Mikko S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.05352", "submitter": "Antoine Jacquier Dr.", "authors": "Antoine Jacquier, Louis Jeannerod", "title": "How many paths to simulate correlated Brownian motions?", "comments": "2 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide an explicit formula giving the optimal number of paths needed to\nsimulate two correlated Brownian motions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Aug 2017 10:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jacquier", "Antoine", ""], ["Jeannerod", "Louis", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.06586", "submitter": "Tomaso Aste", "authors": "Noemi Nava and T.
