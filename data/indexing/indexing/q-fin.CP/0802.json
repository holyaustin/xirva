In this approach the default times are defined as the\njump times of a Cox process, which is a Poisson process conditional on the\nrealization of its intensity. We assume that the intensity follows the\nCox-Ingersoll-Ross model. This model allows one to calculate survival\nprobabilities and prices of defaultable bonds explicitly. In this paper we\nassume that the Brownian motion, that drives the intensity, is not observed.\nUsing filtering theory for point process observations, we are able to derive\ndynamics for the intensity and its moment generating function, given the\nobservations of the Cox process. A transformation of the dynamics of the\nconditional moment generating function allows us to solve the filtering\nproblem, between the jumps of the Cox process, as well as at the jumps.\nAssuming that the initial distribution of the intensity is of the Gamma type,\nwe obtain an explicit solution to the filtering problem for all t>0. We\nconclude the paper with the observation that the resulting conditional moment\ngenerating function at time t corresponds to a mixture of Gamma distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2008 10:56:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Leijdekker", "Vincent", ""], ["Spreij", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3553", "submitter": "Leszek Szybisz Lesio", "authors": "Martin A.

It is\nsuggested to express the price index evolution explicitly in terms of the\nparameters introduced along the theoretical formulation avoiding any\ncombination of them used in the original work. This procedure allows to study\nunambiguously the uncertainties of such parameters when an error is assigned to\nthe measurement of the price index. In this way, it is possible to determine an\nuncertainty in the critical time at which the singularity occurs. For this\npurpose, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are applied. The hyperinflation\nepisodes of Peru (1969-90) and Weimar Germany (1920-3) are reexamined. The\nfirst analyses performed within this framework of the very extreme\nhyper-inflations occurred in Greece (1941-4) and Yugoslavia (1991-4) are\nreported. The study of the hyperinflation spiral experienced just nowadays in\nZimbabwe predicts a singularity, i.e., a complete economic crash within two\nyears.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2008 01:33:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Szybisz", "Martin A.", ""], ["Szybisz", "Leszek", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3769", "submitter": "Enrico Scalas", "authors": "Guido Germano, Mauro Politi, Enrico Scalas, Ren\\'e L.

An uncoupled CTRW with zero-mean\njumps is a martingale. It is proved that, as a consequence of the martingale\ntransform theorem, if the CTRW is a martingale, the Ito integral is a\nmartingale too. It is shown how the definition of the stochastic integrals can\nbe used to easily compute them by Monte Carlo simulation. The relations between\na CTRW, its quadratic variation, its Stratonovich integral and its Ito integral\nare highlighted by numerical calculations when the jumps in space of the CTRW\nhave a symmetric Levy alpha-stable distribution and its waiting times have a\none-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution. Remarkably these distributions have\nfat tails and an unbounded quadratic variation. In the diffusive limit of\nvanishing scale parameters, the probability density of this kind of CTRW\nsatisfies the space-time fractional diffusion equation (FDE) or more in general\nthe fractional Fokker-Planck equation, that generalize the standard diffusion\nequation solved by the probability density of the Wiener process, and thus\nprovides a phenomenologic model of anomalous diffusion.
