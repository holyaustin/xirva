The purpose of this research is to\npropose a methodological and practical framework in order to perform liquidity\nstress testing programs, which comply with regulatory guidelines (ESMA, 2019)\nand are useful for fund managers.

The\nhistorical approach must be complemented by an analytical approach based on\nzero-inflated models if we want to understand the true parameters that\ninfluence the redemption shocks. Moreover, we must also distinguish aggregate\npopulation models and individual-based models if we want to develop behavioral\napproaches.
