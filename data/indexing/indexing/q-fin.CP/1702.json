The contrast between method behaviors for options with\nan Asian tail and those with monitoring throughout their lifespan is\nemphasized. Rates of convergence are confirmed, but greater focus is put on\nactual performance in regions of accuracy which are realistic for use by\npractitioners. A hybrid approach combining Curran's analytical approximation\nwith a two-dimensional finite difference method is examined with respect to the\nerrors caused by the approximating assumptions. For Asian tails of equidistant\nmonitoring dates, this method performs very well, but as the scenario deviates\nfrom the method's ideal conditions, the errors in the approximation grow\nunfeasible. For general monitoring straightforward solution of the full\nthree-dimensional partial differential equation by finite differences is highly\naccurate but suffers from rapid degradation in performance as the monitoring\ninterval increases. For options with long monitoring intervals a randomized\nquasi-Monte Carlo method with control variate variance reduction stands out as\na powerful alternative.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 13:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2021 10:45:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lundgren", "Jacob", ""], ["Shpolyanskiy", "Yuri", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01045", "submitter": "Stephane Crepey", "authors": "St\\'ephane Cr\\'epey (LaMME), Shiqi Song (LaMME)", "title": "Invariance times", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  On a probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{A},\\mathbb{Q})$ we consider two\nfiltrations $\\mathbb{F}\\subset \\mathbb{G}$ and a $\\mathbb{G}$ stopping time\n$\\theta$ such that the $\\mathbb{G}$ predictable processes coincide with\n$\\mathbb{F}$ predictable processes on $(0,\\theta]$.

Computing risk\ncontributions involves difficulties caused by rare-event simulations. In this\nstudy, we address the problem of estimating risk contributions when the total\nrisk is measured by value-at-risk (VaR). Our proposed estimator of VaR\ncontributions is based on the Metropolis-Hasting (MH) algorithm, which is one\nof the most prevalent Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Unlike existing\nestimators, our MH-based estimator consists of samples from conditional loss\ndistribution given a rare event of interest. This feature enhances sample\nefficiency compared with the crude Monte Carlo method. Moreover, our method has\nthe consistency and asymptotic normality, and is widely applicable to various\nrisk models having joint loss density. Our numerical experiments based on\nsimulation and real-world data demonstrate that in various risk models, even\nthose having high-dimensional (approximately 500) inhomogeneous margins, our MH\nestimator has smaller bias and mean squared error compared with existing\nestimators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Feb 2017 08:49:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jan 2019 04:58:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Koike", "Takaaki", ""], ["Minami", "Mihoko", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.03232", "submitter": "Stephane Crepey", "authors": "St\\'ephane Cr\\'epey (LaMME), Shiqi Song (LaMME)", "title": "Invariance properties in the dynamic gaussian copula model *", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove that the default times (or any of their minima) in the dynamic\nGaussian copula model of Cr{\\'e}pey, Jeanblanc, and Wu (2013) are invariance\ntimes in the sense of Cr{\\'e}pey and Song (2017), with related invariance\nprobability measures different from the pricing measure.

In the context of continuous time Markov chains\n(CTMC) several deterministic and statistical algorithms have been proposed to\nestimate the generator matrix.

Firstly, we provide directly\ncomputable closed-form expressions for quantities appearing in the EM algorithm\nand associated information matrix, allowing to easily approximate confidence\nintervals. Previously, these quantities had to be estimated numerically and\nconsiderable computational speedups have been gained. Secondly, we prove\nconvergence to a single set of parameters under very weak conditions (for the\nTPM problem). Finally, we provide a numerical benchmark of our results against\nother known algorithms, in particular, on several problems related to credit\nrisk.
