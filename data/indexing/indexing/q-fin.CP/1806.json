These techniques can often be enhanced using several strategies\nespecially when one discretizes the dynamics of the underlying asset, of which\nwe assume follows a diffusion process. We consider the combination of two\nmethodologies in this direction. The first is the well-known multilevel Monte\nCarlo (MLMC) method, which is known to reduce the computational effort to\nachieve a given level of mean square error relative to MC in some cases.\nSequential Monte Carlo (or the particle filter (PF)) methods have also been\nshown to be beneficial in many option pricing problems potentially reducing\nvariances by large magnitudes (relative to MC). We propose a multilevel\nparticle filter (MLPF) as an alternative approach to price options. The\ncomputational savings obtained in using MLPF over PF for pricing both vanilla\nand exotic options is demonstrated via numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 15:02:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Osei", "P.

In each step of a dynamic programming time-stepping we\napproximate the value function with Chebyshev polynomials. The key advantage of\nthis approach is that it allows to shift the model-dependent computations into\nan offline phase prior to the time-stepping. In the offline part a family of\ngeneralised (conditional) moments is computed by an appropriate numerical\ntechnique such as a Monte Carlo, PDE or Fourier transform based method. Thanks\nto this methodological flexibility the approach applies to a large variety of\nmodels. Online, the backward induction is solved on a discrete Chebyshev grid,\nand no (conditional) expectations need to be computed. For each time step the\nmethod delivers a closed form approximation of the price function along with\nthe options' delta and gamma. Moreover, the same family of (conditional)\nmoments yield multiple outputs including the option prices for different\nstrikes, maturities and different payoff profiles. We provide a theoretical\nerror analysis and find conditions that imply explicit error bounds for a\nvariety of stock price models. Numerical experiments confirm the fast\nconvergence of prices and sensitivities. An empirical investigation of accuracy\nand runtime also shows an efficiency gain compared with the least-square\nMonte-Carlo method introduced by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2018 14:37:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Glau", "Kathrin", ""], ["Mahlstedt", "Mirco", ""], ["P\u00f6tz", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.05876", "submitter": "Carlos Pedro dos Santos Gon\\c{c}alves", "authors": "Carlos Pedro Gon\\c{c}alves", "title": "Financial Risk and Returns Prediction with Modular Networked Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG cs.CE cs.NE q-fin.CP stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An artificial agent for financial risk and returns' prediction is built with\na modular cognitive system comprised of interconnected recurrent neural\nnetworks, such that the agent learns to predict the financial returns, and\nlearns to predict the squared deviation around these predicted returns.
