We further\nshow that the behaviour at small strikes is uniquely determined by the mass of\nthe atom up to high asymptotic order, under mild assumptions on the remaining\ndistribution on the positive real line. We investigate the structural\ndifference with the no-mass-at-zero case, showing how one\ncan--theoretically--distinguish between mass at the origin and a\nheavy-left-tailed distribution. We numerically test our model-free results in\nstochastic models with absorption at the boundary, such as the CEV process, and\nin jump-to-default models.

However, in\ngeneral, the complex dependence structure inherent in most nontrivial\nstochastic volatility (SV) models makes exact simulation difficult. In this\npaper, we present a nontrivial SV model that parallels the notable Heston SV\nmodel in the sense of admitting exact path simulation as studied by Broadie and\nKaya. The instantaneous volatility process of the proposed model is driven by a\nGamma process. Extensions to the model including superposition of independent\ninstantaneous volatility processes are studied. Numerical results show that the\nproposed model outperforms the Heston model and two other L\\'evy driven SV\nmodels in terms of model fit to the real option data. The ability to exactly\nsimulate some of the path-dependent derivative prices is emphasized. Moreover,\nthis is the first instance where an infinite-activity volatility process can be\napplied exactly in such pricing contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 08:26:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2013 08:07:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["James", "Lancelot F.", ""], ["Kim", "Dohyun", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhiyuan", ""]]}]
