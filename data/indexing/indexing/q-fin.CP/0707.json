We then extend this work\nthrough a substantive analysis of examples provided by Meyer, Flitney, Iqbal\nand Weigert and Cheon and Tsutsui with respect to quantized games, quantum game\nstrategies and the extension of Nash Equilibrium to solvable games in Hilbert\nspace. Finally, we review earlier work by Sato, Taiji and Ikegami on non-linear\ncomputation and computational classes by way of reference to coherence,\ndecoherence and quantum computating systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 00:09:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fellman", "Philip V.", ""], ["Post", "Jonathan Vos", ""]]}]
