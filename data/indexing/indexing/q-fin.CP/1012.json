From a known useful representation of the premium of\nbarrier options one deduces an algorithm similar to one used to estimate\nnonlinear filter using quadratic optimal functional quantization. Some\nnumerical tests are fulfilled in the Black-Scholes model and in a local\nvolatility model and a comparison to the so called Brownian Bridge method is\nalso done.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Dec 2010 21:20:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Sagna", "Abass", "", "LAP"]]}, {"id": "1012.1878", "submitter": "Andrea Macrina", "authors": "Jiro Akahori, Andrea Macrina", "title": "Heat Kernel Interest Rate Models with Time-Inhomogeneous Markov\n  Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a heat kernel approach for the development of stochastic pricing\nkernels. The kernels are constructed by positive propagators, which are driven\nby time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. We multiply such a propagator with a\npositive, time-dependent and decreasing weight function, and integrate the\nproduct over time. The result is a so-called weighted heat kernel that by\nconstruction is a supermartingale with respect to the filtration generated by\nthe time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. As an application, we show how this\nframework naturally fits the information-based asset pricing framework where\ntime-inhomogeneous Markov processes are utilized to model partial information\nabout random economic factors. We present examples of pricing kernel models\nwhich lead to analytical formulae for bond prices along with explicit\nexpressions for the associated interest rate and market price of risk.\nFurthermore, we also address the pricing of fixed-income derivatives within\nthis framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Dec 2010 21:39:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Akahori", "Jiro", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.4976", "submitter": "Jan Hendrik Witte", "authors": "Christoph Reisinger and Jan Hendrik Witte", "title": "On the Use of Policy Iteration as an Easy Way of Pricing American\n  Options", "comments": "18 Pages, 1 Figure.
