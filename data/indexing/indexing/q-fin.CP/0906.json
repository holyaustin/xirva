We find that, within the class of metric we study,\nwhen we assume the Galilean invariance, the scale invariant deformation always\npreserves the non-relativistic conformal invariance. We discuss applications to\nscaling regime of Reggeon field theory and non-linear quantum finance. These\ntheories possess scale invariance but may or may not break the conformal\ninvariance, depending on the underlying symmetry assumptions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2009 17:52:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Nakayama", "Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.4456", "submitter": "Jeroen Devreese", "authors": "Jeroen P.A.
