It is direct extension and application of the work [1] into\nprediction of prices. The models are constructed with an idea of prediction\nmodels based on the string invariants (PMBSI). The performance of PMBSI is\ncompared to support vector machines (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANN)\non an artificial and a financial time series. Brief overview of the results and\nanalysis is given. The first model is based on the correlation function as\ninvariant and the second one is an application based on the deviations from the\nclosed string/pattern form (PMBCS). We found the difference between these two\napproaches. The first model cannot predict the behavior of the forex market\nwith good efficiency in comparison with the second one which is, in addition,\nable to make relevant profit per year.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2011 13:15:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2012 13:39:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pincak", "Richard", ""], ["Repasan", "Marian", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0738", "submitter": "Matthew Lorig", "authors": "Matthew Lorig", "title": "Pricing Derivatives on Multiscale Diffusions: an Eigenfunction Expansion\n  Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.SP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using tools from spectral analysis, singular and regular perturbation theory,\nwe develop a systematic method for analytically computing the approximate price\nof a derivative-asset.

The nonlocal component of volatility is multiscale, in the sense\nthat it is driven by one fast-varying and one slow-varying factor. The\nflexibility of our modeling framework is contrasted by the simplicity of our\nmethod. We reduce the derivative pricing problem to that of solving a single\neigenvalue equation. Once the eigenvalue equation is solved, the approximate\nprice of a derivative can be calculated formulaically.
