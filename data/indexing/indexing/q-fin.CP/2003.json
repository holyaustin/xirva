Against\nthis background, the purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of\nCOVID-19 numbers on crude oil prices, while controlling for the impact of\nfinancial volatility and the United States (US) economic policy uncertainty.\nOur ARDL estimation shows that the COVID-19 daily reported cases of new\ninfections have a marginal negative impact on the crude oil prices in the long\nrun. Nevertheless, by amplifying the financial markets volatility, COVID-19\nalso has an indirect effect on the recent dynamics of crude oil prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2020 10:15:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2020 10:56:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Albulescu", "Claudiu", "", "CRIEF"]]}, {"id": "2003.06218", "submitter": "Xin Zang", "authors": "Fan Jiang, Xin Zang, Jingping Yang", "title": "Asymptotic expansion for the transition densities of stochastic\n  differential equations driven by the gamma processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, enlightened by the asymptotic expansion methodology developed\nby Li(2013b) and Li and Chen (2016), we propose a Taylor-type approximation for\nthe transition densities of the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven\nby the gamma processes, a special type of Levy processes. After representing\nthe transition density as a conditional expectation of Dirac delta function\nacting on the solution of the related SDE, the key technical method for\ncalculating the expectation of multiple stochastic integrals conditional on the\ngamma process is presented. To numerically test the efficiency of our method,\nwe examine the pure jump Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (OU) model and its extensions to\ntwo jump-diffusion models.
