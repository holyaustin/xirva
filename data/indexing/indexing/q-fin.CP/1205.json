In this paper\nHPC is used for pricing of American options. Although the American options are\nvery significant in computational finance; their valuation is very challenging,\nespecially when the Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used. For getting the\nmost accurate price for these types of options we use Quasi Monte Carlo\nsimulation, which gives the best convergence. Furthermore, this algorithm is\nimplemented on both GPU and CPU. Additionally, the CUDA architecture is used\nfor harnessing the power and the capability of the GPU for executing the\nalgorithm in parallel which is later compared with the serial implementation on\nthe CPU. In conclusion this paper gives the reasons and the advantages of\napplying HPC in computational finance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 07:46:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cvetanoska", "Verche", ""], ["Stojanovski", "Toni", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.1163", "submitter": "Karel in 't Hout", "authors": "Karel in 't Hout, Chittaranjan Mishra", "title": "Stability of ADI schemes for multidimensional diffusion equations with\n  mixed derivative terms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.NA q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the unconditional stability of four well-known ADI schemes is\nanalyzed in the application to time-dependent multidimensional diffusion\nequations with mixed derivative terms.
