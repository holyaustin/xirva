Based on this, geometric\nproperties can be translated into economic statements and vice versa. For\ninstance, the European call-put parity corresponds to the central symmetry\nproperty, while the concept of dual markets can be explained by reflection with\nrespect to a plane. It is known that the classical univariate log-normal model\nbelongs to a large class of distributions with an extra property, analytically\nknown as put-call symmetry. The geometric interpretation of this symmetry\nproperty motivates a natural multivariate extension. The financial meaning of\nthis extension is explained, the asset price distributions that have this\nproperty are characterised and their further properties explored. It is also\nshown how to relate some multivariate asymmetric distributions to symmetric\nones by a power transformation that is useful to adjust for carrying costs. A\nparticular attention is devoted to the case of asset prices driven by L\\'evy\nprocesses. Based on this, semi-static hedging techniques for multiasset barrier\noptions are suggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2008 13:10:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Mar 2009 14:13:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Molchanov", "Ilya", ""], ["Schmutz", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4675", "submitter": "Jean-Claude Ndogmo", "authors": "JC Ndogmo", "title": "Some Control Variates for exotic options", "comments": "The paper is a contribution to Monte Carlo simulation and variance\n  reduction techniques", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA math.OC q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There are no known exact formulas for the valuation of a number of exotic\noptions, and this is particularly true for options under discrete monitoring\nand for American style options.
