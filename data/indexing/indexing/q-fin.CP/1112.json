In the present work, a\nnovel second-order approximation for ATM option prices under the CGMY L\\'evy\nmodel is derived, and then extended to a model with an additional independent\nBrownian component. Our results shed light on the connection between both the\nvolatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters and the behavior\nof ATM option prices near expiration. In case of an additional Brownian\ncomponent, the second-order term, in time-t, is of the form $ d_{2}\nt^{(3-Y)/2}$, with the coefficient $d_{2}$ depending only on the overall jump\nintensity parameter C and the tail-heaviness parameter Y. This extends the\nknown result that the leading term is $(\\sigma/\\sqrt{2\\pi})t^{1/2}$, where\n$\\sigma$ is the volatility of the continuous component. In contrast, under a\npure-jump CGMY model, the dependence on the two parameters C and Y is already\nreflected in the leading term, which is of the form $d_{1} t^{1/Y}$.\nInformation on the relative frequency of negative and positive jumps appears\nonly in the second-order term, which is shown to be of the form $d_{2} t$ and\nwhose order of decay turns out to be independent of Y. The third-order\nasymptotic behavior of the option prices as well as the asymptotic behavior of\nthe corresponding Black-Scholes implied volatilities are also addressed.
