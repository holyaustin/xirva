Consequently, cryptocurrencies\nare more appropriately described as crypto assets. A common investment\nattribute shared by the more than 2,500 crypto assets is that they are highly\nvolatile. An investor interested in reducing price volatility of a portfolio of\ncrypto assets can do so by constructing an optimal portfolio through standard\noptimization techniques that minimize tail risk. Because crypto assets are not\nbacked by any real assets, forming a hedge to reduce the risk contribution of a\nsingle crypto asset can only be done with another set of similar assets (i.e.,\na set of other crypto assets). A major finding of this paper is that crypto\nportfolios constructed via optimizations that minimize variance and Conditional\nValue at Risk outperform a major stock market index (the S$\\&$P 500).
