The paper\nillustrates the approach by showing the difference between using delta hedging\nand optimal hedging for a short position in a call option when the objective is\nto minimize a function equal to the mean hedging cost plus a constant times the\nstandard deviation of the hedging cost. Two situations are considered. In the\nfirst, the asset price follows a geometric Brownian motion. In the second, the\nasset price follows a stochastic volatility process. The paper extends the\nbasic reinforcement learning approach in a number of ways. First, it uses two\ndifferent Q-functions so that both the expected value of the cost and the\nexpected value of the square of the cost are tracked for different state/action\ncombinations. This approach increases the range of objective functions that can\nbe used. Second, it uses a learning algorithm that allows for continuous state\nand action space. Third, it compares the accounting P&L approach (where the\nhedged position is valued at each step) and the cash flow approach (where cash\ninflows and outflows are used). We find that a hybrid approach involving the\nuse of an accounting P&L approach that incorporates a relatively simple\nvaluation model works well. The valuation model does not have to correspond to\nthe process assumed for the underlying asset price.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:43:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Jay", ""], ["Chen", "Jacky", ""], ["Hull", "John", ""], ["Poulos", "Zissis", ""]]}]
