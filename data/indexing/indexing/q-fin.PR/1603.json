We illustrate conditions\nunder which our alternative weighting scheme converges faster to the true\nvaluation when compared to the minimum variance weighting. This weighting\nscheme is applicable in any situation where multiple forecasts are made and we\nneed a methodology to combine them. Our valuations can be useful either to\nderive a bidding strategy for an exclusive auction or to design an appropriate\nauction mechanism, depending on which side of the fence a participant sits\n(whether the interest is to procure the rights to use a portfolio for making\nstock loans such as for a lending desk, or, to obtain additional revenue from a\nportfolio such as from the point of view of a long only asset management firm).\nLastly, we run simulations to establish numerical examples for the set of\nvaluations and for various bidding strategies corresponding to different\nauction settings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 06:17:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 14:48:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Apr 2016 10:03:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2016 02:54:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2016 15:11:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 20 Oct 2018 04:17:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2019 13:45:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.02874", "submitter": "Aurelio Fernandez Bariviera", "authors": "Aurelio F.
