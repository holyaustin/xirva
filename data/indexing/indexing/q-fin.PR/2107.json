XVA are an exotic pricing component since they\nrequire the forward simulation of multiple risk factors in order to compute the\nportfolio exposure including collateral, leading to a significant model risk\nand computational effort, even in case of plain vanilla trades. This work\nanalyses the most critical model risk factors, meant as those to which XVA are\nmost sensitive, finding an acceptable compromise between accuracy and\nperformance. This task has been conducted in a complete context including a\nmarket standard multi-curve G2++ model calibrated on real market data, both\nVariation Margin and ISDA-SIMM dynamic Initial Margin, different\ncollateralization schemes, and the most common linear and non-linear interest\nrates derivatives. Moreover, we considered an alternative analytical approach\nfor XVA in case of uncollateralized Swaps. We show that a crucial element is\nthe construction of a parsimonious time grid capable of capturing all\nperiodical spikes arising in collateralized exposure during the Margin Period\nof Risk. To this end, we propose a workaround to efficiently capture all\nspikes. Moreover, we show that there exists a parameterization which allows to\nobtain accurate results in a reasonable time, which is a very important feature\nfor practical applications. In order to address the valuation uncertainty\nlinked to the existence of a range of different parameterizations, we calculate\nthe Model Risk AVA (Additional Valuation Adjustment) for XVA according to the\nprovisions of the EU Prudent Valuation regulation. Finally, this work can serve\nas an handbook containing step-by-step instructions for the implementation of a\ncomplete, realistic and robust modelling framework of collateralized exposure\nand XVA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2021 22:24:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Silotto", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Scaringi", "Marco", ""], ["Bianchetti", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.11340", "submitter": "Alexandre Carbonneau", "authors": "Alexandre Carbonneau and Fr\\'ed\\'eric Godin", "title": "Deep equal risk pricing of financial derivatives with non-translation\n  invariant risk measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of non-translation invariant risk measures within the equal risk\npricing (ERP) methodology for the valuation of financial derivatives is\ninvestigated.

In particular, suitable choices for the risk measure embedded\nin the ERP framework such as the semi-mean-square-error (SMSE) are shown herein\nto alleviate the price inflation phenomenon observed under Tail Value-at-Risk\nbased ERP as documented for instance in Carbonneau and Godin (2021b). The\nnumerical implementation of non-translation invariant ERP is performed through\ndeep reinforcement learning, where a slight modification is applied to the\nconventional deep hedging training algorithm (see Buehler et al., 2019) so as\nto enable obtaining a price through a single training run for the two neural\nnetworks associated with the respective long and short hedging strategies.
