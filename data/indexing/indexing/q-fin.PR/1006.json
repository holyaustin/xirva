As applications, we find that this correlation coefficient is always\nat least $1/\\sqrt{2}$ and, via the Hermite--Genocchi integral relation,\ndemonstrate that all moments of the time average are certain divided\ndifferences of the exponential function.

The market filtration is taken to be generated\njointly by the various information processes and by the default indicator\nprocesses of the various bonds. The value of a discount bond is obtained by\ntaking the discounted expectation of the value of the default indicator\nfunction at the maturity of the bond, conditional on the information provided\nby the market filtration. Explicit expressions are derived for the bond price\nprocesses and the associated default hazard rates. The latter are not given a\npriori as part of the model but rather are deduced and shown to be functions of\nthe values of the information processes. Thus the \"perceived\" hazard rates,\nbased on the available information, determine bond prices, and as perceptions\nchange so do the prices. In conclusion, explicit expressions are derived for\noptions on discount bonds, the values of which also fluctuate in line with the\nvicissitudes of market sentiment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2010 07:44:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.3337", "submitter": "Stefano De Marco", "authors": "Vlad Bally and Stefano De Marco", "title": "Bounds on Stock Price probability distributions in Local-Stochastic\n  Volatility models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that in a large class of stochastic volatility models with additional\nskew-functions (local-stochastic volatility models) the tails of the cumulative\ndistribution of the log-returns behave as exp(-c|y|), where c is a positive\nconstant depending on time and on model parameters.
