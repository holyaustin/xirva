In this model the prices are driven by a Geometric\nBrownian motion, whose diffusion coefficient is expressed through an\nexponential function of an hidden variable Y governed by a mean-reverting\nprocess. We derive closed-form expressions for the probability distribution and\nits characteristic function in two limit cases. In the first one the\nfluctuations of Y are larger than the volatility normal level, while the second\none corresponds to the assumption of a small stationary value for the variance\nof Y. Theoretical results are tested numerically by intensive use of Monte\nCarlo simulations. The effectiveness of the analytical predictions is checked\nvia a careful analysis of the parameters involved in the numerical\nimplementation of the Euler-Maruyama scheme and is tested on a data set of\nfinancial indexes. In particular, we discuss results for the German DAX30 and\nDow Jones Euro Stoxx 50, finding a good agreement between the empirical data\nand the theoretical description.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2008 14:13:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 10:14:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Cazzola", "Valentina", ""], ["Montagna", "Guido", ""], ["Nicrosini", "Oreste", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3470", "submitter": "Daniel Rockmore", "authors": "Greg Leibon, Scott D.

The\ntechnique is based on \"Partition Decoupled Null Models,'' a new class of null\nmodels that incorporate the interaction of clustered partitions into a random\nmodel and generalize the Gaussian ensemble. As an application we analyze a\ncorrelation matrix derived from four years of close prices of equities in the\nNYSE and NASDAQ. In this example we expose (1) a natural structure composed of\ntwo interacting partitions of the market that both agrees with and generalizes\nstandard notions of scale (eg., sector and industry) and (2) structure in the\nfirst partition that is a topological manifestation of a well-known pattern of\ncapital flow called \"sector rotation.'' Our approach gives rise to a natural\nform of multiresolution analysis of the underlying time series that naturally\ndecomposes the basic data in terms of the effects of the different scales at\nwhich it clusters. The equities market is a prototypical complex system and we\nexpect that our approach will be of use in understanding a broad class of\ncomplex systems in which correlation structures are resident.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2008 14:32:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Leibon", "Greg", ""], ["Pauls", "Scott D.", ""], ["Rockmore", "Daniel N.", ""], ["Savell", "Robert", ""]]}]
