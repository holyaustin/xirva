We quantify the value of optimally timing to sell\nthrough the concept of delayed liquidation premium, and analyze the associated\nprobabilistic representation and variational inequality. We illustrate the\noptimal liquidation policy for both single-named and multi-named credit\nderivatives.

As a result of this representation, along with\na short-time asymptotic expansion of the claim's price process, we develop an\nefficient method for pricing claims whose payoffs may depend on the full path\nof the underlying Markov chain. The proposed approach is applied to price not\nonly simple European claims such as defaultable bonds, but also a new type of\npath-dependent claims that we term self-decomposable, as well as the important\nclass of vulnerable call and put options on a stock. We provide a detailed\nerror analysis and illustrate the accuracy and computational complexity of our\nmethod on several market traded instruments, such as defaultable bond prices,\nbarrier options, and vulnerable call options. Using again our Poisson series\nrepresentation, we show differentiability in time of the pre-default price\nfunction of European vulnerable claims, which enables us to rigorously deduce\nFeynman-Kac representations for the pre-default pricing function and new\nsemimartingale representations for the price process of the vulnerable claim\nunder both risk-neutral and objective probability measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2011 16:22:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 00:34:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Figueroa-Lopez", "Jose", ""], ["Nisen", "Jeffrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.4669", "submitter": "Roman Makarov", "authors": "Giuseppe Campolieti, Roman N.

Our multi-asset\npricing model arises by employing copula methods. In particular, all discounted\nsingle-asset price processes are modeled as martingale diffusions under a\nrisk-neutral measure. The price processes are so-called UOU diffusions and they\nare each generated by combining a variable (Ito) transformation with a measure\nchange performed on an underlying Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Gaussian) process.\nConsequently, we exploit the use of a normal bridge copula for coupling the\nsingle-asset dynamics while reducing the distribution of the multi-asset price\nprocess to a multivariate normal distribution. Such an approach allows us to\nsimulate multidimensional price paths in a precise and fast manner and hence to\nprice path-dependent financial derivatives such as Asian-style and Bermudan\noptions using the Monte Carlo method. We also demonstrate how to successfully\ncalibrate our multi-asset pricing model by fitting respective equity option and\nasset market prices to the single-asset models and their return correlations\n(i.e. the copula function) using the least-square and maximum-likelihood\nestimation methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Oct 2011 00:36:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Campolieti", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Makarov", "Roman N.", ""], ["Vasiliev", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5594", "submitter": "Paul M.

In our approach, the two sides of the stylized balance sheet of\na firm, namely the asset value and debt value, are assumed to follow a two\ndimensional Markov process. Amongst models of this type we find examples that\nlead to derivative pricing formulas that are capable of reproducing the main\nfeatures of well known equity models such as the variance gamma model, and at\nthe same time reproducing the stylized facts about default stemming from\nstructural models of credit risk. Moreover, in contrast to one-factor\nstructural models, these models allow for much more flexible dependence between\nequity and credit markets. Two main technical obstacles to efficient\nimplementation of these pricing formulas are overcome in our paper. The first\nobstacle stems from the barrier condition implied by the non-default of the\nfirm, and is overcome by the idea of time-changing Brownian motion in a way\nthat preserves the reflection principle for Brownian motion. The second\nobstacle is the difficulty of computing spread options: this is overcome by\nusing results in recent papers that make efficient use of the two dimensional\nFast Fourier Transform.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 17:17:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Zhou", "Zhuowei", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.6170", "submitter": "Paul Lescot", "authors": "Paul Lescot (LMRS)", "title": "Symmetries of the Black-Scholes equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Methods Appl.
