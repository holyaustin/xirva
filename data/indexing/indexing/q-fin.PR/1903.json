Cover's rebalancing option (Ordentlich and Cover 1998) under\ndiscrete hindsight optimization in continuous time. The payoff in question is\nequal to the final wealth that would have accrued to a $\\$1$ deposit into the\nbest of some finite set of (perhaps levered) rebalancing rules determined in\nhindsight. A rebalancing rule (or fixed-fraction betting scheme) amounts to\nfixing an asset allocation (i.e. $200\\%$ stocks and $-100\\%$ bonds) and then\ncontinuously executing rebalancing trades to counteract allocation drift.\nRestricting the hindsight optimization to a small number of rebalancing rules\n(i.e. 2) has some advantages over the pioneering approach taken by Cover $\\&$\nCompany in their brilliant theory of universal portfolios (1986, 1991, 1996,\n1998), where one's on-line trading performance is benchmarked relative to the\nfinal wealth of the best unlevered rebalancing rule of any kind in hindsight.\nOur approach lets practitioners express an a priori view that one of the\nfavored asset allocations (\"bets\") $b\\in\\{b_1,...,b_n\\}$ will turn out to have\nperformed spectacularly well in hindsight. In limiting our robustness to some\ndiscrete set of asset allocations (rather than all possible asset allocations)\nwe reduce the price of the rebalancing option and guarantee to achieve a\ncorrespondingly higher percentage of the hindsight-optimized wealth at the end\nof the planning period. A practitioner who lives to delta-hedge this variant of\nCover's rebalancing option through several decades is guaranteed to see the day\nthat his realized compound-annual capital growth rate is very close to that of\nthe best $b_i$ in hindsight. Hence the point of the rock-bottom option price.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 04:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Garivaltis", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.00937", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Fazlollah Soleymani and Andrey Itkin", "title": "Pricing foreign exchange options under stochastic volatility and\n  interest rates using an RBF--FD method", "comments": "24 pages, 7 tables, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes a numerical method for pricing foreign exchange (FX)\noptions in a model which deals with stochastic interest rates and stochastic\nvolatility of the FX rate. The model considers four stochastic drivers, each\nrepresented by an It\\^{o}'s diffusion with time--dependent drift, and with a\nfull matrix of correlations. It is known that prices of FX options in this\nmodel can be found by solving an associated backward partial differential\nequation (PDE). However, it contains non--affine terms, which makes its\ndifficult to solve it analytically. Also, a standard approach of solving it\nnumerically by using traditional finite--difference (FD) or finite elements\n(FE) methods suffers from the high computational burden. Therefore, in this\npaper a flavor of a localized radial basis functions (RBFs) method, RBF--FD, is\ndeveloped which allows for a good accuracy at a relatively low computational\ncost. Results of numerical simulations are presented which demonstrate\nefficiency of such an approach in terms of both performance and accuracy for\npricing FX options and computation of the associated Greeks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2019 16:33:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Soleymani", "Fazlollah", ""], ["Itkin", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.04106", "submitter": "Hyong-Chol O", "authors": "Hyong-Chol O, Dae-Sung Choe", "title": "Pricing Formulae of Power Binary and Normal Distribution Standard\n  Options and Applications", "comments": "24 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the Buchen's pricing formulae of (higher order) asset and bond\nbinary options are incorporated into the pricing formula of power binary\noptions and a pricing formula of \"the normal distribution standard options\"\nwith the maturity payoff related to a power function and the density function\nof normal distribution is derived.
