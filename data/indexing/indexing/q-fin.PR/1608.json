Pricing for a European barrier\ncondition is straightforward for products of both types and depends on an\nefficient interpolation of observed market option pricing. Pricing products\nwith an American barrier condition requires stochastic modelling. We show that\nfor typical market parameters, this stochastic pricing problem can be\nsystematically reduced to evaluating only one fairly simple stochastic\nparameter being the asymmetry of hitting the barrier. Eventually, pricing Bonus\nCertificates and Barrier Reverse Convertibles with an American barrier\ncondition, shows to be dependent on stochastic modelling only within a range of\n$\\pm\\frac{2}{3}$ of accuracy - e.g. within this accuracy limitation we can\nprice these products without stochastic modelling. We show that the remaining\nprice component is weakly dependent on the stochastic models. Combining these\ntogether, we prove to have established an almost model independent pricing\nprocedure for Bonus Certificates and Barrier Reverse-Convertible Structured\nProducts with American barrier conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2016 22:54:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kuklinski", "Jan", ""], ["Papaioannou", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Tyloo", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.02028", "submitter": "Michael Kouritzin A", "authors": "Michael A.

In many\nscenarios of practical interest, financial option prices associated to an\nunderlying asset reduces to computing an expectation w.r.t.~a diffusion\nprocess.
