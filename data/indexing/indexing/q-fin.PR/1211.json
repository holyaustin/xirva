It is shown how, for\na class of models, the prices of bonds, caplets, and swaptions can be computed\nin closed form. The dynamical equations for the price processes are derived,\nand explicit formulae are obtained for the short rate of interest, the risk\npremium, and for the stochastic volatility of prices. Several of the\nclosed-form asset price models presented in this paper are driven by\ncombinations of Markovian jump processes with different probability laws. Such\nmodels provide a rich basis for consistent applications in several sectors of a\nfinancial market including equity, fixed-income, commodities, and insurance.\nThe flexible, multidimensional and multivariate structure, on which the asset\nprice models are constructed, lends itself well to the transparent modelling of\ndependence across asset classes. As an illustration, the impact on prices by\nspiralling debt, a typical feature of a financial crisis, is modelled\nexplicitly, and contagion effects are readily observed in the dynamics of asset\nreturns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2012 13:06:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 09:18:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.1564", "submitter": "Claudio Nordio", "authors": "Lorenzo Giada and Claudio Nordio", "title": "Funded Bilateral Valuation Adjustment", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show how the cost of funding the collateral in a particular set up can be\nequal to the Bilateral Valuation Adjustment with the \"funded\" probability of\ndefault, leading to the definition of a Funded Bilateral Valuation Adjustment\n(FBVA).
