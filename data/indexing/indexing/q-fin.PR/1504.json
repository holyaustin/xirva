Nadtochiy. As a result, we obtain a method for generating Monte\nCarlo samples of future paths of implied volatility surfaces. These paths and\nthe surfaces themselves are free of arbitrage, and are constructed in a way\nthat is consistent with the past and present values of implied volatility. We\nuse a real market data to estimate the parameters of these models and conduct\nan empirical study, to compare the performance of market-based models with the\nperformance of classical stochastic volatility models. We choose the problem of\nminimal-variance portfolio choice as a measure of model performance and compare\nthe two tangent Levy models to SABR model. Our study demonstrates that the\ntangent Levy models do a much better job at finding a portfolio with smallest\nvariance, their predictions for the variance are more reliable, and the\nportfolio weights are more stable. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst example of empirical analysis that provides a convincing evidence of the\nsuperior performance of the market-based models for European options using real\nmarket data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 18:43:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Carmona", "Rene", ""], ["Ma", "Yi", ""], ["Nadtochiy", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.02896", "submitter": "Marco Bianchetti", "authors": "Marco Bianchetti, Sergei Kucherenko, Stefano Scoleri", "title": "Pricing and Risk Management with High-Dimensional Quasi Monte Carlo and\n  Global Sensitivity Analysis", "comments": "43 pages, 21 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We review and apply Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Global Sensitivity Analysis\n(GSA) techniques to pricing and risk management (greeks) of representative\nfinancial instruments of increasing complexity.
