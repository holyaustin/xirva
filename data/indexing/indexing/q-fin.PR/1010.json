The arrival of new information then leads to price\nchanges. The `information-based framework' of Brody, Hughston and Macrina (BHM)\nisolates the emergence of information, and examines its role as a driver of\nprice dynamics. This approach has led to the development of new models that\ncapture a broad range of price behaviour. This thesis extends the work of BHM\nby introducing a wider class of processes for the generation of the market\nfiltration. In the BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of\nrandom cash flows. The asset price is the sum of the discounted expectations of\nthe cash flows. Expectations are taken with respect (i) an appropriate measure,\nand (ii) the filtration generated by a set of so-called information processes\nthat carry noisy or imperfect market information about the cash flows. To model\nthe flow of information, we introduce a class of processes termed L\\'evy random\nbridges (LRBs), generalising the Brownian and gamma information processes of\nBHM. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB is identical in law to a L\\'evy\nbridge. We consider in detail the case where the asset generates a single cash\nflow $X_T$ at a fixed date $T$. The flow of information about $X_T$ is modelled\nby an LRB with random terminal value $X_T$. An explicit expression for the\nprice process is found by working out the discounted conditional expectation of\n$X_T$ with respect to the natural filtration of the LRB. New models are\nconstructed using information processes related to the Poisson process, the\nCauchy process, the stable-1/2 subordinator, the variance-gamma process, and\nthe normal inverse-Gaussian process. These are applied to the valuation of\ncredit-risky bonds, vanilla and exotic options, and non-life insurance\nliabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Oct 2010 10:15:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hoyle", "Edward", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1212", "submitter": "Wolfgang Putschoegl", "authors": "Wolfgang Putschoegl", "title": "On Calibrating Stochastic Volatility Models with time-dependent\n  Parameters", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider stochastic volatility models using piecewise constant parameters.\nWe suggest a hybrid optimization algorithm for fitting the models to a\nvolatility surface and provide some numerical results.

Although the required conditional distributions are in\ngeneral intractable, they can be arbitrarily precisely approximated using\nsequential Monte Carlo schemes. The drawback, as with many Monte Carlo schemes,\nis potentially heavy computational demand.
