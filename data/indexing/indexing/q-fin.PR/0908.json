The\nconnection has zero curvature if and only if there is no arbitrage. We prove an\nextension of the Martingale pricing theorem in the case of arbitrage. In our\ncase, the present value of any traded asset is given by the expectation of\nfuture cash-flows discounted by a line integral of the gauge connection. We\ndevelop simple strategies to measure arbitrage using both simulated and real\nmarket data. We find that, within our limited data sample, the market is\nefficient at time horizons of one day or longer. However, we provide strong\nevidence for non-zero arbitrage in high frequency intraday data.
