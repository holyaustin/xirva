In spite of evidence that this\nparameter is not constant, this formula is widely used by financial markets.\nThis paper addresses the question of whether an alternative model for stock\nprice exists for which the Black-Scholes or similar formulae hold. The results\nobtained in this paper are very general as no assumptions are made on the\ndynamics of the model, whether it be the underlying price process, the\nvolatility process or how they relate to each other. We show that if the\nformula holds for a continuum of strikes and three terminal times, then the\nvolatility must be constant. However, when it only holds for finitely many\nstrikes, and three or more maturity times, we obtain a universal bound on the\nvariation of the volatility. This bound yields that the implied volatility is\nconstant when the sequence of strikes increases to cover the entire half-line.\nThis recovers the result for a continuum of strikes by a different approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 04:31:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hamza", "Kais", ""], ["Klebaner", "Fima", ""], ["Mah", "Olivia", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.1062", "submitter": "Shiqi Song", "authors": "Shiqi Song", "title": "An alternative proof of a result of Takaoka", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In Karatzas and Kardaras's paper on semimartingale financial models, it is\nproved that the NUPBR condition is a property of the local characteristic of\nthe asset process alone.

We\nrevisit the problem in the setting of modern interest rate theory, and show\nthat if the long \"simple\" interest rate (or Libor rate) is finite, then this\nrate (unlike the zero-coupon rate) acts viably as a state variable, the value\nof which can fluctuate randomly in line with other economic indicators. New\ninterest rate models are constructed, under this hypothesis and certain\ngeneralizations thereof, that illustrate explicitly the good asymptotic\nbehaviour of the resulting discount bond systems. The conditions necessary for\nthe existence of such \"hyperbolic\" and \"generalized hyperbolic\" long rates are\nthose of so-called social discounting, which allow for long-term cash flows to\nbe treated as broadly \"just as important\" as those of the short or medium term.\nAs a consequence, we are able to provide a consistent arbitrage-free valuation\nframework for the cost-benefit analysis and risk management of long-term social\nprojects, such as those associated with sustainable energy, resource\nconservation, and climate change.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2013 14:08:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 17:33:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 18:17:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 10:37:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6267", "submitter": "Thorsten Schmidt", "authors": "Stefan Tappe, and Thorsten Schmidt", "title": "Dynamic Term Structure Modelling with Default and Mortality Risk: New\n  Results on Existence and Monotonicity", "comments": "27 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers general term structure models like the ones appearing in\nportfolio credit risk modelling or life insurance.
