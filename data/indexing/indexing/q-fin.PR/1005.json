Here we examine this question\nwithin the classical Black and Scholes (BS) model, focusing on the evolution of\nthe probability density function P(w) of a random variable w =\na_T^{(1)}/(a_T^{(1)} + a_T^{(2)}) where a_T^{(1)} and a_T^{(2)} are the values\nof two (either European- or the Asian-style) options produced by two absolutely\nidentical BS stochastic equations. We show that within the realm of the BS\nmodel the behavior of P(w) is surprisingly different from common-sense-based\nexpectations. For the European-style options P(w) always undergoes a\ntransition, (when T approaches a certain threshold value), from a unimodal to a\nbimodal form with the most probable values being close to 0 and 1, and,\nstrikingly, w =1/2 being the least probable value. This signifies that the\nsymmetry between two options spontaneously breaks and just one of them\ncompletely dominates the sum. For path-dependent Asian-style options we observe\nthe same anomalous behavior, but only for a certain range of parameters.\nOutside of this range, P(w) is always a bell-shaped function with a maximum at\nw = 1/2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 08:51:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 19:46:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Oshanin", "Gleb", ""], ["Schehr", "Gregory", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.3565", "submitter": "Erhan Bayraktar", "authors": "Erhan Bayraktar and Song Yao", "title": "Quadratic Reflected BSDEs with Unbounded Obstacles", "comments": "Key Words: Quadratic reflected backward stochastic differential\n  equations, convex/concave generator, $\\th$-difference method, Legenre-Fenchel\n  duality, optimal stopping problems for quadratic $g$-evaluations, stability,\n  obstacle problems for semi-linear parabolic PDEs, viscosity solutions", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.AP math.OC q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we analyze a real-valued reflected backward stochastic\ndifferential equation (RBSDE) with an unbounded obstacle and an unbounded\nterminal condition when its generator $f$ has quadratic growth in the\n$z$-variable.
