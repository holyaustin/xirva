Next, we find the leading term of\nasymptotics of the implied volatility in the case where the asset prices follow\nthe multidimensional Black-Scholes model with time change by an independent\nincreasing stochastic process. Finally, we deal with a general situation in\nwhich the dependence between the assets is described by a given copula\nfunction. In this setting, we obtain a model-free tail-wing formula that links\nthe implied volatility to a special characteristic of the copula called the\nweak lower tail dependence function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 14:48:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gulisashvili", "Archil", ""], ["Tankov", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1149", "submitter": "Ahmadreza Yazdanian", "authors": "Ahmad Reza Yazdanian, T A Pirvu", "title": "Numerical analysis for Spread option pricing model in illiquid\n  underlying asset market: full feedback model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper performs the numerical analysis and the computation of a Spread\noption in a market with imperfect liquidity.
