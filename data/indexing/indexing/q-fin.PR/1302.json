We first show that it is possible to define restricted put and\ncall operators that admit a singular value decomposition (SVD), which we\ncompute explicitly.

This method\nis termed the spectral recovery method (SRM). Interestingly, the SVD of the\nrestricted put and call operators sheds some new light on the RND recovery\nproblem. The SRM improves on other RND recovery methods in the sense that:\n  - it is fast and simple to implement since it requires solution of a single\nquadratic program, while being fully nonparametric; - it takes the bid ask\nquotes as sole input and does not require any sort of calibration, smoothing or\npreprocessing of the data; - it is robust to the paucity of price quotes; - it\nreturns the smoothest density giving rise to prices that lie inside the bid ask\nquotes. The estimated RND is therefore as well-behaved as can be; - it returns\na closed form estimate of the RND on the interval [0,B] of the positive real\nline, where B is a positive constant that can be chosen arbitrarily. We thus\nobtain both the middle part of the RND together with its full left tail and\npart of its right tail.\n  We confront this method to both real and simulated data and observe that it\nfares well in practice.

Each asset volatility smile is\nmodeled according to a density-mixture dynamical model while the same property\nholds for the multivariate process of all assets, whose density is a mixture of\nmultivariate basic densities. This allows to reconcile single name and\nindex/basket volatility smiles in a consistent framework. Our approach could be\ndubbed a multidimensional local volatility approach with vector-state dependent\ndiffusion matrix. The model is quite tractable, leading to a complete market\nand not requiring Fourier techniques for calibration and dependence measures,\ncontrary to multivariate stochastic volatility models such as Wishart. We prove\nexistence and uniqueness of solutions for the model stochastic differential\nequations, provide formulas for a number of basket options, and analyze the\ndependence structure of the model in detail by deriving a number of results on\ncovariances, its copula function and rank correlation measures and\nvolatilities-assets correlations. A comparison with sampling simply-correlated\nsuitably discretized one-dimensional mixture dynamical paths is made, both in\nterms of option pricing and of dependence, and first order expansion\nrelationships between the two models' local covariances are derived. We also\nshow existence of a multivariate uncertain volatility model of which our\nmultivariate local volatilities model is a Markovian projection, highlighting\nthat the projected model is smoother and avoids a number of drawbacks of the\nuncertain volatility version. We also show a consistency result where the\nMarkovian projection of a geometric basket in the multivariate model is a\nunivariate mixture dynamics model.
