To make the role of mutual\nobligations more transparent, a simple structural default model with banks'\nassets driven by correlated multidimensional Brownian motion with drift is\nconsidered. This model enables a closed form representation for many quantities\nof interest, at least in a 2D case, to be obtained, and moreover, model\ncalibration is provided. Finally, we demonstrate that mutual obligations have\nto be taken into account in order to get correct values for model parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 May 2015 14:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Itkin", "Andrey", ""], ["Lipton", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.03587", "submitter": "Bj{\\o}rn Kjos-Hanssen", "authors": "Malihe Alikhani, Bj{\\o}rn Kjos-Hanssen, Amirarsalan Pakravan, and\n  Babak Saadat", "title": "Pricing complexity options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Algorithmic Finance (2015), 4:3-4, 127-137", "doi": "10.3233/AF-150050", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR cs.CC cs.FL math.LO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider options that pay the complexity deficiency of a sequence of up\nand down ticks of a stock upon exercise.

Due to the limited inclusion of prices, conditional Asian\noptions further reduce the volatility in the payoffs than their regular\ncounterparts and have been promoted in the market as viable hedging and risk\nmanagement instruments for equity-linked life insurance products. There has\nbeen no previous academic literature on this subject and practitioners have\nonly been known to price these products by simulations.
