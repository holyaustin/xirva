Drawdown and drawup refer to the differences between\nthe historical maximum and minimum of the asset price and its current value,\nrespectively. We consider four contracts. In the first contract, a protection\nbuyer pays a premium with a constant intensity $p$ until the drawdown of fixed\nsize occurs. In return, he/she receives a certain insured amount at the\ndrawdown epoch, which depends on the drawdown level at that moment. Next, the\ninsurance contract may expire earlier if a certain fixed drawup event occurs\nprior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of the\nprevious ones but with an additional cancellable feature that allows the\ninvestor to terminate the contracts earlier. In these cases, a fee for early\nstopping depends on the drawdown level at the stopping epoch. In this work, we\nfocus on two problems: calculating the fair premium $p$ for basic contracts and\nfinding the optimal stopping rule for the polices with a cancellable feature.\nTo do this, we use a fluctuation theory of L\\'evy processes and rely on a\ntheory of optimal stopping.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 18:20:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Feb 2018 17:12:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Palmowski", "Zbigniew", ""], ["Tumilewicz", "Joanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04990", "submitter": "Jan Korbel", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar, Cyril Coste, Jan Korbel", "title": "Series representation of the pricing formula for the European option\n  driven by space-time fractional diffusion", "comments": "24 pages, 2 figures This paper is now published (in revised form),\n  and is available online at http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fca, so always\n  cite it with the journal's coordinates", "journal-ref": "Fractional calculus and applied analysis 21(4), 2018, 981-1004", "doi": "10.1515/fca-2018-0054", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show that the price of an European call option, whose\nunderlying asset price is driven by the space-time fractional diffusion, can be\nexpressed in terms of rapidly convergent double-series.

This makes it possible for long-term bonds\nto be considered as deposit substitutes if they meet the 20-lender rule,\ntaxable at 20% final tax. However, long-term debt instruments cannot\nrealistically function as deposit substitutes even if they fall in the hands of\n20 or more lenders. First, long-term debt instruments cannot simultaneously\nreplicate the twin features of capital preservation and liquidity, which are\nintegral to the nature of a deposit substitute. Second, deposit substitutes are\nan integral part of the maturity transformation process (i.e. short-term\nborrowing for the purpose of long-term lending) in financial intermediaries,\nwhich means that they should have low borrowing cost, made possible only by\nhaving short-term maturity. To prove these propositions, this paper situates\nthe function of deposit substitutes within the context of shadow banking, where\nsaid instruments originated and are generally used. To show the incompatibility\nbetween a deposit substitute and a long-term debt instrument, the paper applies\nthe fundamental theory of bond values to 10-year zero-coupon treasury notes\ncalled 'PEACe Bonds' in Banco De Oro, et al. vs. Republic (2015 and 2016). The\npaper recommends that deposit substitutes should be limited to debt instruments\nwith maturity of not more than 1 year.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Dec 2017 18:39:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Geronimo", "Russell Stanley Q.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.10105", "submitter": "Nan-Jing Huang", "authors": "Ben-zhang Yang, Jia Yue and Nan-jing Huang", "title": "Variance swaps under L\\'{e}vy process with stochastic volatility and\n  stochastic interest rate in incomplete markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper focuses on the pricing of the variance swap in an incomplete\nmarket where the stochastic interest rate and the price of the stock are\nrespectively driven by Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model and Heston model with\nsimultaneous L\\'{e}vy jumps.
