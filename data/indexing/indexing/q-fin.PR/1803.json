Consider a typical case of a bank hedging a client trade via a\nCCP. On client default the hedge (effects) will be removed (rebalanced). On the\nother hand, if the hedge counterparty defaults the hedge will be replaced. Thus\nif the hedge required initial margin then the default probability driving MVA\nis from the client not from the hedge counterparty. This is the opposite of\nusual assumptions where counterparty XVAs are computed independent of each\nother. Replacement of the hedge counterparty means multiple CVA costs on the\nhedge side need inclusion. Since hedge trades are generally at riskless mid (or\nworse) these costs are paid on the client side, and must be calculated before\nthe replacement hedge counterparties are known. We call these counterparties\nanonymous counterparties. The effects on CVA and MVA will generally be\nexclusive because MVA largely removes CVA, and CVA is hardly relevant for CCPs.\nEffects on KVA and FVA will resemble those on MVA. We provide a theoretical\nframework, including anonymous counterparties, and numerical examples. Pricing\nXVA by considering counterparties in isolation is inadequate and behaviour must\nbe taken into account.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2018 11:44:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""], ["Iida", "Hayato", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03996", "submitter": "Jarno Talponen Dr.", "authors": "Jarno Talponen", "title": "Matching distributions: Recovery of implied physical densities from\n  option prices", "comments": "JEL classification: G10, G12, G13, C14, D53, C58", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a non-parametric method to recover physical probability\ndistributions of asset returns based on their European option prices and some\nother sparse parametric information.
