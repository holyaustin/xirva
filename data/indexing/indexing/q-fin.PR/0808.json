We make only weak\nassumptions about the underlying process (typically continuity), but assume\nthat the initial prices of call options with the same maturity and all strikes\nare known. Under such circumstances, we are able to give upper and lower bounds\non the arbitrage-free prices of the relevant options, and further, using\ntechniques from the theory of Skorokhod embeddings, to show that these bounds\nare tight. Additionally, martingale inequalities are derived, which provide the\ntrading strategies with which we are able to realise any potential arbitrages.\nWe show that, depending of the risk aversion of the investor, the resulting\nhedging strategies can outperform significantly the standard delta/vega-hedging\nin presence of market frictions and/or model misspecification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 17:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cox", "Alexander M.
