We consider four contracts, three of which\nwere introduced in Zhang et al. (2013) for a geometric Brownian motion. The\nfirst one is an insurance contract where the protection buyer pays a constant\npremium until the drawdown of fixed size of log-returns occurs. In return\nhe/she receives a certain insured amount at the drawdown epoch. The next\ninsurance contract provides protection from any specified drawdown with a\ndrawup contingency. This contract expires early if a certain fixed drawup event\noccurs prior to the fixed drawdown. The last two contracts are extensions of\nthe previous ones by an additional cancellation feature which allows the\ninvestor to terminate the contract earlier. We focus on two problems:\ncalculating the fair premium $p$ for the basic contracts and identifying the\noptimal stopping rule for the policies with the cancellation feature. To do\nthis we solve some two-sided exit problems related to drawdown and drawup of\nspectrally negative L\\'evy processes, which is of independent mathematical\ninterest. We also heavily rely on the theory of optimal stopping.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Jan 2017 22:52:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Oct 2017 17:10:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Palmowski", "Zbigniew", ""], ["Tumilewicz", "Joanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02821", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin", "title": "Modeling stochastic skew of FX options using SLV models with stochastic\n  spot/vol correlation and correlated jumps", "comments": "42 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.NA q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is known that the implied volatility skew of FX options demonstrates a\nstochastic behavior which is called stochastic skew.

Barrier options are considered\nin the paper and semi-static hedges are studied and discussed for a fairly\nlarge class of underlying price dynamics. Timing risk is identified with the\nuncertainty associated to the time at which the payoff payment of the barrier\noption is due. Starting from the work by Carr and Picron (1999), where the\nauthors show that the timing risk can be hedged via static positions in plain\nvanilla options, the present paper extends the static hedge formula proposed in\nCarr and Picron (1999) by giving sufficient conditions to decompose a\ngeneralized timing risk into an integral of knock-in options in a\nmulti-dimensional market model. A dedicated study of the semi-static hedge is\nthen conducted by defining the corresponding strategy based on positions in\nbarrier options. The proposed methodology allows to construct not only first\norder hedges but also higher order semi-static hedges, that can be interpreted\nas asymptotic expansions of the hedging error. The convergence of these higher\norder semi-static hedges to an exact hedge is shown. An illustration of the\nmain theoretical results is provided for i) a symmetric case, ii) a one\ndimensional case, where the first order and second order hedging errors are\nderived in analytic closed form. The materiality of the hedging benefit gain of\ngoing from order one to order two by re-iterating the timing risk hedging\nstrategy is discussed through numerical evidences by showing that order two can\nbring to more than 90% reduction of the hedging 'cost' w.r.t. order one\n(depending on the specific barrier option characteristics).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 05:19:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Akahori", "Jiro", ""], ["Barsotti", "Flavia", ""], ["Imamura", "Yuri", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08399", "submitter": "Igor Cialenco", "authors": "Tomasz R.
