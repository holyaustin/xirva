However, this\noptimal strategy is hard to train due to action dependence, that is, the\nappropriate hedging action at the next step depends on the current action. To\novercome this issue, we leverage the idea of a no-transaction band strategy,\nwhich is an existing technique that gives optimal hedging strategies for\nEuropean options and the exponential utility. We theoretically prove that this\nstrategy is also optimal for a wider class of utilities and derivatives\nincluding exotics. Based on this result, we propose a no-transaction band\nnetwork, a neural network architecture that facilitates fast training and\nprecise evaluation of the optimal hedging strategy. We experimentally\ndemonstrate that for European and lookback options, our architecture quickly\nattains a better hedging strategy in comparison to a standard feed-forward\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2021 14:46:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Imaki", "Shota", ""], ["Imajo", "Kentaro", ""], ["Ito", "Katsuya", ""], ["Minami", "Kentaro", ""], ["Nakagawa", "Kei", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.03275", "submitter": "Josselin Garnier", "authors": "Josselin Garnier", "title": "The Climate Extended Risk Model (CERM)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is directed to the financial community and focuses on the\nfinancial risks associated with climate change. It, specifically, addresses the\nestimate of climate risk embedded within a bank loan portfolio. During the 21st\ncentury, man-made carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere will raise global\ntemperatures, resulting in severe and unpredictable physical damage across the\nglobe. Another uncertainty associated with climate, known as the energy\ntransition risk, comes from the unpredictable pace of political and legal\nactions to limit its impact. The Climate Extended Risk Model (CERM) adapts well\nknown credit risk models. It proposes a method to calculate incremental credit\nlosses on a loan portfolio that are rooted into physical and transition risks.\nThe document provides detailed description of the model hypothesis and steps.\nThis work was initiated by the association Green RWA (Risk Weighted Assets).
