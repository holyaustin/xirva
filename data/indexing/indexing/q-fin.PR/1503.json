Standard methods used to treat the\nlatter scenario are mainly based on ad hoc implementations of the classic Monte\nCarlo (MC) approach, which is characterized by a high computational time,\nstrongly dependent on the number of considered assets. This is why many\nfinancial players moved to more enhanced Technologies, e.g., grid computing and\nGraphics Processing Units (GPUs) capabilities. In this paper we show how to\nimplement the quantization technique, in order to accurately estimate both\npricing and volatility values.
