Two Brownian motions drive moves across the forward\ncurve, with a third Heston-like stochastic volatility process scaling\ninstantaneous volatilities of all forward prices.\n  In addition to an efficient numerical scheme for calculating European vanilla\nand early-exercise option prices, we describe an algorithm for Monte\nCarlo-based pricing of more generic derivative payoffs which involves an\nefficient approximation for the risk neutral drift that avoids having to\nsimulate drifts for every forward settlement date required for pricing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Aug 2017 20:57:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 22:23:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Higgins", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02563", "submitter": "Mikko Pakkanen", "authors": "Ryan McCrickerd, Mikko S.

We\nremove the requirement from the FSE option for employees to fund any shortfall\nat the switching date. The resulting option is very similar to the DB underpin,\nbut with the possibility of early exercise.
