By combining the analytic and probabilistic tools for describing\nthe value function and the optimal strategy, we establish the feedback\nrepresentation of the latter. We use this representation to derive an explicit\nasymptotic expansion of the utility indifference price of the option, which\nallows us to quantify the price impact in options' market via the price impact\ncoefficient in the underlying market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Oct 2019 01:51:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:05:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Ekren", "Ibrahim", ""], ["Nadtochiy", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.05137", "submitter": "Johann Lussange", "authors": "J.

However recent advances in the\nfields of neuroscience and machine learning have overall brought the\npossibility for new tools to the bottom-up statistical inference of complex\nsystems. Most importantly, such tools allows for studying new fields, such as\nagent learning, which in finance is central to information and stock price\nestimation. We present here the results of a new generation MAS stock market\nsimulator, where each agent autonomously learns to do price forecasting and\nstock trading via model-free reinforcement learning, and where the collective\nbehaviour of all agents decisions to trade feed a centralised double-auction\nlimit order book, emulating price and volume microstructures. We study here\nwhat such agents learn in detail, and how heterogenous are the policies they\ndevelop over time. We also show how the agents learning rates, and their\npropensity to be chartist or fundamentalist impacts the overall market\nstability and agent individual performance. We conclude with a study on the\nimpact of agent information via random trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Oct 2019 15:07:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lussange", "J.", ""], ["Bourgeois-Gironde", "S.", ""], ["Palminteri", "S.", ""], ["Gutkin", "B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.07971", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "title": "The value of power-related options under spectrally negative L\\'evy\n  processes", "comments": "Minor typos corrected + DOI added + MSC classes added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11147-020-09174-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide analytical tools for pricing power options with exotic features\n(capped or log payoffs, gap options ...) in the framework of exponential L\\'evy\nmodels driven by one-sided stable or tempered stable processes.
