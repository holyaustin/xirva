The fundamental\nvalue itself is announced at a future random (stopping) time. We consider two\ncases. First when the release time of information is known to the insider and\nthen when it is unknown also to her. Allowing for very general dynamics, we\nstudy the structure of the insider's optimal strategies in equilibrium and we\ndiscuss market efficiency. In particular, we show that in the case the insider\nknows the information release time, the market is fully efficient. In the case\nthe insider does not know this random time, we see that there is an equilibrium\nwith no full efficiency, but where the sensitivity of prices is decreasing in\ntime according with the probability that the announcement time is greater than\nthe current time. In other words, the prices become more and more stable as the\nannouncement approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 14:53:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 09:49:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Mar 2018 12:47:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Corcuera", "Jos\u00e9 Manuel", ""], ["Di Nunno", "Giulia", ""], ["Farkas", "Gergely", ""], ["\u00d8ksendal", "Bernt", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2950", "submitter": "Peter Lerner B", "authors": "Peter B.
