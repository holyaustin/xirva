Under these models, we study the pricing of European and American\nVIX options and, for the latter, we obtain an early exercise premium\nrepresentation using a free-boundary approach and local time-space calculus.\nThe optimal exercise boundary for the volatility is obtained as the unique\nsolution to an integral equation of Volterra type.\n  We also consider a model mixing these two classes and formulate the\ncorresponding optimal stopping problem in terms of the observed factor process.\nThe price of an American VIX call is then represented by an early exercise\npremium formula. We show the existence of a pair of optimal exercise boundaries\nfor the factor process and characterize them as the unique solution to a system\nof integral equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 03:48:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 15:30:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 19:15:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 18:15:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 03:13:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Detemple", "Jerome", ""], ["Kitapbayev", "Yerkin", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.01343", "submitter": "Xiao Lin", "authors": "Xiao Lin", "title": "The Zero-Coupon Rate Model for Derivatives Pricing", "comments": "31 pages, 9 Sections and 1 Appendix, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this paper is to present a dual-term structure model of interest\nrate derivatives in order to solve the two hardest problems in financial\nmodeling: the exact volatility calibration of the entire swaption matrix, and\nthe calculation of bucket vegas for structured products. The model takes a\nseries of long-term zero-coupon rates as basic state variables that are driven\ndirectly by one or more Brownian motion. The model volatility is assigned in a\nmatrix form with two terms. A complete numerical scheme for implementing the\nmodel has been developed in the paper.

Anchoring as a heuristic bias causes\ninvestors focusing on recent price changes and price levels, which two lead to\na belief in continuing trend and mean-reversion respectively. The empirical\nresults support our theoretical explanation through an analysis of large price\nfluctuations in the S&P 500 and the resulting effects on implied and realized\nvolatility. These results indicate that asymmetry (a negative relationship)\nbetween shocks and volatility in the subsequent period indeed exists. Moreover,\ncontrary to previous research, our empirical tests also suggest that implied\nvolatility is not simply an upward biased predictor of future deviation\ncompensating for the variance of the volatility but rather, due to investors\nsystematic anchoring to losses and gains in their volatility forecasts, it is a\nco-integrated yet asymmetric over/under estimated financial instrument. We also\nprovide results indicating that the medium-term implied volatility (measured by\nthe VIX Index) is an unbiased though inefficient estimation of realized\nvolatility, while in contrast, the short-term volatility (measured by the\nrecently introduced VXST Index representing the 9-day implied volatility) is\nalso unbiased and yet efficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 13:59:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ormos", "Mihaly", ""], ["Timotity", "Dusan", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.07381", "submitter": "Jack Sarkissian", "authors": "Jack Sarkissian", "title": "Spread, volatility, and volume relationship in financial markets and\n  market making profit optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the relationship between price spread, volatility and trading\nvolume.
