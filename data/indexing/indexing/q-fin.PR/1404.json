The framework can be tailored also to CCP trading under initial and\nvariation margins, as explained in detail in Brigo and Pallavicini (2014). In\nparticular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding rates, replacement\nclose-out and re-hypothecation. The valuation equation takes the form of a\nbackward stochastic differential equation or semi-linear partial differential\nequation, and can be cast as a set of iterative equations that can be solved by\nleast-squares Monte Carlo. We propose such a simulation algorithm in a case\nstudy involving a generalization of the benchmark model of Black and Scholes\nfor option pricing. Our numerical results confirm that funding risk has a\nnon-trivial impact on the deal price, and that double counting matters too. We\nconclude the article with an analysis of large scale implications of\nnon-linearity of the pricing equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 11:29:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Liu", "Qing", ""], ["Pallavicini", "Andrea", ""], ["Sloth", "David", ""]]}]
