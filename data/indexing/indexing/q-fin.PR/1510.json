To hedge a net long delta inventory, for example, she pays a fee to\nborrow stock from the securities lending market.

This paper incorporates funding asymmetry (borrowed cash\nand invested cash earning different interest rates) and realistic stock\nfinancing cost into the classic option pricing theory. It is shown that an\noption position can be dynamically replicated and self financed in the presence\nof these funding costs. Noting that the funding amounts and costs are different\nfor long and short positions, we extend Black-Scholes partial differential\nequations (PDE) per position side. The PDE's nonlinear funding cost terms\ncreate a free funding boundary and would result in the bid price for a long\nposition on an option lower than the ask price for a short position. An\niterative Crank-Nicholson finite difference method is developed to compute\nEuropean and American vanilla option prices. Numerical results show that\nreasonable funding cost parameters can easily produce same magnitude of bid/ask\nspread of less liquid, longer term options as observed in the market place.\nPortfolio level pricing examples show the netting effect of hedges, which could\nmoderate impact of funding costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 01:27:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lou", "Wujiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.04899", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin", "title": "Nonlinear PDEs risen when solving some optimization problems in finance,\n  and their solutions", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a specific type of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDE)\nthat appear in mathematical finance as the result of solving some optimization\nproblems.

We argue that a derivative liability, after primary risk factors\nbeing hedged, resembles in economics an issued variable funding note, and\nshould be priced at the market rate of the issuer's debt. For the purpose of\ndetermining the fair value, the party on the liability side is economically\nneutral to make a deposit to the other party, which earns his current debt rate\nand effectively provides funding and hedging for the party holding the\nderivative asset. The newly derived partial differential equation for an option\ndiscounts the derivative's receivable part with counterparty's curve and\npayable part with own financing curve. The price difference from the\ncounterparty risk free price, or total counterparty risk adjustment, is\nprecisely defined by discounting the product of the risk free price and the\ncredit spread at the local liability curve. Subsequently the adjustment can be\nbroken into a default risk component -- CVA and a funding component -- FVA,\nconsistent with a simple note's fair value treatment and in accordance with the\nusual understanding of a bond's credit spread consisting of a CDS spread and a\nbasis. As for FVA, we define a cost -- credit funding adjustment (CFA) and a\nbenefit -- debit funding adjustment (DFA), in parallel to CVA and DVA and\nattributed to counterparty's and own funding basis. This resolves a number of\noutstanding FVA debate issues, such as double counting, violation of the law of\none price, misuse of cash flow discounting, and controversial hedging of own\ndefault risk. It also allows an integrated implementation strategy and reuse of\nexisting CVA infrastructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 01:45:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lou", "Wujiang", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.07221", "submitter": "Alexander Kushpel", "authors": "Alexander Kushpel", "title": "Pricing of high-dimensional options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.NA math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Pricing of high-dimensional options is one of the most important problems in\nMathematical Finance. The objective of this manuscript is to present an\noriginal self-contained treatment of the multidimensional pricing. During the\npast decades the Black-Scholes this model, which essentially is based on the\nlog-normal assumption, has been increasingly criticised. In particular, it was\nnoticed by Mandelbrot that empirical log-returns distributions are more\nconcentrated around the origin and have considerably heavier tails. This\nsuggests to adjust the Black-Scholes model by the introduction of the Levy\nprocesses instead of Brownian ones. This approach has been extensively studied\nin a univariate setup since the nineties. In the multivariate settings the\ntheory is not so advanced. We present a general method of high-dimensional\noption pricing based on a wide range of jump-diffusion models. Namely, we\nconstruct approximation formulas for the price of spread options. It is\nimportant to get an efficient approximation for the respective density\nfunction, since the reward function has usually a simple structure. Instead of\na commonly used tabulation approach, we use the respective m-widths to compare\na wide range of numerical methods. We give an algorithm of almost optimal, in\nthe sense of the respective m-widths, reconstruction of density functions. To\ndemonstrate the power of our approach we consider in details a concrete class\nof Levy driven processes and present the respective rates of convergence of\napproximation formulas. The interrelationship between the theory and tools\nreflects the richness and deep connections in Financial Mathematics, Stochastic\nProcesses, Theory of Martingales, Functional Analysis, Topology and Harmonic\nAnalysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 08:50:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kushpel", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08161", "submitter": "Adriana Ocejo", "authors": "Adriana Ocejo", "title": "Asian option as a fixed-point", "comments": "Accepted in Journal of Fixed Point Theory and Applications", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We characterize the price of an Asian option, a financial contract, as a\nfixed-point of a non-linear operator.

We study\nthe case of both floating- and fixed-strike Asian call options with arithmetic\naveraging when the asset follows a regime-switching geometric Brownian motion\nwith coefficients that depend on a Markov chain.
