Each asset is characterised by\nthe cash flows it generates. Each cash flow is expressed as a function of one\nor more independent random variables called market factors or \"X-factors\". Each\nX-factor is associated with a \"market information process\", the values of which\nbecome available to market participants. In addition to true information about\nthe X-factor, the information process contains an independent \"noise\" term\nmodelled here by a Brownian bridge. The information process thus gives partial\ninformation about the X-factor, and the value of the market factor is only\nrevealed at the termination of the process. The market filtration is assumed to\nbe generated by the information processes associated with the X-factors. The\nprice of an asset is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the sum of the\ndiscounted cash flows, conditional on the information available from the\nfiltration. The theory is developed in some detail, with a variety of\napplications to credit risk management, share prices, interest rates, and\ninflation. A number of new exactly solvable models are obtained for the price\nprocesses of various types of assets and derivative securities; and a novel\nmechanism is proposed to account for the dynamics of stochastic volatility and\ndynamic correlation. A discrete-time version of the information-based framework\nis also developed, and is used to construct a new class of models for the real\nand nominal interest rate term structures, and the dynamics of the associated\nprice index.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Jul 2008 10:42:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.2526", "submitter": "Teemu Pennanen Ph.D.", "authors": "Teemu Pennanen", "title": "Arbitrage and deflators in illiquid markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00780-009-0118-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.FA math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper presents a stochastic model for discrete-time trading in financial\nmarkets where trading costs are given by convex cost functions and portfolios\nare constrained by convex sets.
