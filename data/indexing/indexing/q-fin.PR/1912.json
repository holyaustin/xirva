Our method\ngeneralizes the quadratic approximation scheme of Barone-Adesi & Whaley (1987)\nand several of its extensions. Using perturbative arguments, we decompose the\nearly exercise pricing problem into sub-problems of different orders and solve\nthese sub-problems successively. The obtained solutions are combined to recover\napproximations to the original pricing problem of multiple orders, with the\n0-th order version matching the general Barone-Adesi & Whaley ansatz. We test\nthe accuracy and efficiency of the approximations via numerical simulations.\nThe results show a clear dominance of higher order approximations over their\nrespective 0-th order version and reveal that significantly more pricing\naccuracy can be obtained by relying on approximations of the first few orders.\nAdditionally, they suggest that increasing the order of any approximation by\none generally refines the pricing precision, however that this happens at the\nexpense of greater computational costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Dec 2019 18:02:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mathys", "Ludovic", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.00469", "submitter": "Ludovic Mathys", "authors": "Ludovic Mathys", "title": "Valuing Tradeability in Exponential L\\'evy Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The present article provides a novel theoretical way to evaluate tradeability\nin markets of ordinary exponential L\\'evy type.
