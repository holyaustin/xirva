Using the Legendre transform which links\nthe entropy function and the cumulant generating function, we show that it is\nboth the unique continuous density in this family and the one with the greatest\nentropy. We present a fast root-finding algorithm that can be used to calculate\nthe Buchen-Kelly density, and give upper boundaries for three different\ndiscrepancies that can be used as convergence criteria. Given the call prices,\narbitrage-free digital prices at the same strikes can only move within upper\nand lower boundaries given by left and right call spreads. As the number of\ncall prices increases, these bounds become tighter, and we give two examples\nwhere the densities converge to the Buchen-Kelly density in the sense of\nrelative entropy when we use centered call spreads as proxies for digital\nprices. As pointed out by Breeden and Litzenberger, in the limit a continuous\nset of call prices completely determines the density.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Feb 2011 17:23:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Neri", "Cassio", ""], ["Schneider", "Lorenz", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1186", "submitter": "Serguei Pergamenchtchikov", "authors": "Berdjane Belkacem, Serguei Pergamenchtchikov (LMRS)", "title": "Optimal consumption and investment for markets with random coefficients", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an optimal investment and consumption problem for a Black-Scholes\nfinancial market with stochastic coefficients driven by a diffusion process.
