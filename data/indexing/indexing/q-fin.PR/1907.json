Furthermore, we show equivalence to\nan alternative approach involving an artificial market consisting of after-tax\nand after-expense assets, and we establish a type of consistency with classic\nrisk-minimization.

The current paper\ninvestigates forward mortality models driven by a (possibly infinite\ndimensional) Wiener process and a compensated Poisson random measure. A major\ninnovation of the paper is the introduction of a family of processes called\nforward mortality improvements which provide a flexible tool for a simple\nconstruction of stochastic forward mortality models. In practice, the notion of\nmortality improvements are a convenient device for the quantification of\nchanges in mortality rates over time that enables, for example, the detection\nof cohort effects.\n  We show that the forward mortality rates satisfy Heath-Jarrow-Morton-type\nconsistency conditions which translate to the forward mortality improvements.\nWhile the consistency conditions of the forward mortality rates are analogous\nto the classical conditions in the context of bond markets, the conditions of\nthe forward mortality improvements possess a different structure: forward\nmortality models include a cohort parameter besides the time horizon; these two\ndimensions are coupled in the dynamics of consistent models of forwards\nmortality improvements. In order to obtain a unified framework, we transform\nthe systems of It\\^o-processes which describe the forward mortality rates and\nimprovements: in contrast to term-structure models, the corresponding\nstochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) describe the random dynamics\nof two-dimensional surfaces rather than curves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2019 12:45:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Tappe", "Stefan", ""], ["Weber", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.07305", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Peter Carr, Andrey Itkin and Sasha Stoikov", "title": "A model-free backward and forward nonlinear PDEs for implied volatility", "comments": "31 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive a backward and forward nonlinear PDEs that govern the implied\nvolatility of a contingent claim whenever the latter is well-defined.
