The perturbed Gaussian copula approach allows introducing the skew\ninformation of both random variables into the co-dependence structure. The\nanalytical expression of this copula is derived through an asymptotic expansion\nunder the assumption of a common fast mean reverting stochastic volatility\nfactor. This paper applies this new perturbed copula to the valuation of\nderivative products; in particular FX quanto options to a third currency. A\ncalibration procedure to fit the skew of both underlying securities is\npresented. The action of the perturbed copula is interpreted compared to the\nGaussian copula. A real worked example is carried out comparing both copulas\nand a local volatility model with constant correlation for varying maturities,\ncorrelations and skew configurations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Feb 2010 00:30:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Feb 2012 11:41:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Elices", "Alberto", ""], ["Fouque", "Jean-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.1344", "submitter": "Rachid Ouyed", "authors": "Daniel T.
