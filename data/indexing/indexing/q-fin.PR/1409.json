We derive the characteristic\nfunction for two market models featuring joint normally distributed jumps,\nstochastic volatility, and different stochastic dependence structures. With the\nuse of Fast Fourier Transform(FFT) we accurately compute spread option prices\nacross a variety of strikes and initial price vectors at a very low\ncomputational cost when compared to Monte Carlo pricing methods. We also look\nat the sensitivities of the prices to the model specifications and find strong\ndependence on the selection of the jump and stochastic volatility parameters.\nOur numerical implementation is based on the method developed by Hurd and Zhou\n(2009).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Sep 2014 17:28:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Olivares", "Pablo", ""], ["Cane", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.5142", "submitter": "Jose  Da Fonseca", "authors": "Jos\\'e Da Fonseca and Claude Martini", "title": "The $\\alpha$-Hypergeometric Stochastic Volatility Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this work is to introduce a new stochastic volatility model for\nequity derivatives.

Within this framework we\ndevelop all the key elements to perform the pricing of vanilla European options\nas well as of volatility derivatives.

Volatility modulated Volterra processes are in general\nnot semimartingales, but contain several special cases of interest in energy\nmarkets like for example continuous-time autoregressive moving average\nprocesses.
