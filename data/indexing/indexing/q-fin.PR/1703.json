The need for such an evaluation scheme arises naturally in the context\nof option pricing in polynomial diffusion models. In this setting a\ndiscretization process produces a sequence of nested block triangular matrices,\nand their exponentials are to be computed at each stage, until a dynamically\nevaluated criterion allows to stop. Our algorithm is based on scaling and\nsquaring. By carefully reusing certain intermediate quantities from one step to\nthe next, we can efficiently compute such a sequence of matrix exponentials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 08:38:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 13:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 08:54:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kressner", "Daniel", ""], ["Luce", "Robert", ""], ["Statti", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.00923", "submitter": "Jorge I\\~nigo", "authors": "Jorge Inigo", "title": "Pricing of Mexican Interest Rate Swaps in Presence of Multiple\n  Collateral Currencies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The financial crisis of 2007/08 caused catastrophic consequences and brought\na bunch of changes around the world.
