This question is crucial, since we\ncan show that the classical approach, martingale modeling, does not work in the\npresence of volatility uncertainty. Therefore, we need to adjust the model in\norder to find an arbitrage-free term structure. The resulting term structure is\naffine with respect to the short rate and the adjustment factor.
