This rollover risk consists of two components, a credit\nrisk component due to the possibility of being downgraded and thus facing a\nhigher credit spread when attempting to roll over short-term borrowing, and a\ncomponent reflecting the (systemic) possibility of being unable to roll over\nshort-term borrowing at the reference rate (e.g., LIBOR) due to an absence of\nliquidity in the market. The modelling framework is of \"reduced form\" in the\nsense that (similar to the credit risk literature) the source of credit risk is\nnot modelled (nor is the source of liquidity risk). However, the framework has\nmore structure than the literature seeking to simply model a different term\nstructure of interest rates for each tenor frequency, since relationships\nbetween rates for all tenor frequencies are established based on the modelled\nroll-over risk.

As compared\nwith the latest version of the model developed in CI2018 and called the ELVG\n(the Expanded Local Variance Gamma model), here we provide two innovations.\nFirst, in all previous papers the model was constructed based on a Gamma\ntime-changed {\\it arithmetic} Brownian motion: with no drift in CI2017, and\nwith drift in CI2018, and the local variance to be a function of the spot level\nonly. In contrast, here we develop a {\\it geometric} version of this model with\ndrift. Second, in CN2017 the model was calibrated to option smiles assuming the\nlocal variance is a piecewise constant function of strike, while in CI2018 the\nlocal variance is a piecewise linear} function of strike. In this paper we\nconsider 3 piecewise linear models: the local variance as a function of strike,\nthe local variance as function of log-strike, and the local volatility as a\nfunction of strike (so, the local variance is a piecewise quadratic function of\nstrike). We show that for all these new constructions it is still possible to\nderive an ordinary differential equation for the option price, which plays a\nrole of Dupire's equation for the standard local volatility model, and,\nmoreover, it can be solved in closed form. Finally, similar to CI2018, we show\nthat given multiple smiles the whole local variance/volatility surface can be\nrecovered which does not require solving any optimization problem. Instead, it\ncan be done term-by-term by solving a system of non-linear algebraic equations\nfor each maturity which is fast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Sep 2018 16:05:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Dec 2018 18:23:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Carr", "Peter", ""], ["Itkin", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.09466", "submitter": "Imanol Perez Arribas", "authors": "Imanol Perez Arribas", "title": "Derivatives pricing using signature payoffs", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce signature payoffs, a family of path-dependent derivatives that\nare given in terms of the signature of the price path of the underlying asset.\nWe show that these derivatives are dense in the space of continuous payoffs, a\nresult that is exploited to quickly price arbitrary continuous payoffs.
