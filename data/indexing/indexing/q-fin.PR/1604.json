In this paper, the volatility is modeled as a stationary process\nwith long-range correlation properties in order to capture such a situation,\nand we consider European option pricing. This means that the volatility process\nis neither a Markov process nor a martingale. However, by exploiting the fact\nthat the price process is still a semimartingale and accordingly using the\nmartingale method, we can obtain an analytical expression for the option price\nin the regime where the volatility process is fast mean-reverting. The\nvolatility process is modeled as a smooth and bounded function of a fractional\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. We give the expression for the implied volatility,\nwhich has a fractional term structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 02:20:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 00:24:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2018 11:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Garnier", "Josselin", ""], ["Solna", "Knut", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00148", "submitter": "Akihiko Noda", "authors": "Mikio Ito, Kiyotaka Maeda, Akihiko Noda", "title": "Market Integration in the Prewar Japanese Rice Markets", "comments": "41 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper examines the integration process of the Japanese major rice\nmarkets (Tokyo and Osaka) from 1881 to 1932.
