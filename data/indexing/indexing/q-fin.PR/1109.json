The payoff of the derivative-asset may be\npath-dependent. Additionally, the process underlying the derivative may exhibit\nkilling (i.e. jump to default) as well as combined local/nonlocal stochastic\nvolatility. The nonlocal component of volatility is multiscale, in the sense\nthat it is driven by one fast-varying and one slow-varying factor. The\nflexibility of our modeling framework is contrasted by the simplicity of our\nmethod. We reduce the derivative pricing problem to that of solving a single\neigenvalue equation. Once the eigenvalue equation is solved, the approximate\nprice of a derivative can be calculated formulaically. To illustrate our\nmethod, we calculate the approximate price of three derivative-assets: a\nvanilla option on a defaultable stock, a path-dependent option on a\nnon-defaultable stock, and a bond in a short-rate model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Sep 2011 18:33:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 18:49:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Lorig", "Matthew", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1075", "submitter": "Paul M.
