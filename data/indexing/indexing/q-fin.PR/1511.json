In this paper we show how this framework\ncould be extended by adding to the model stochastic interest rates and\ncorrelated jumps in all three components. We also propose a new fully implicit\nmodification of the popular Hundsdorfer and Verwer and Modified Craig-Sneyd\nfinite-difference schemes which provides second order approximation in space\nand time, is unconditionally stable and preserves positivity of the solution,\nwhile still has a linear complexity in the number of grid nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 20:16:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 16:01:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 01:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Itkin", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.01564", "submitter": "Nhat-Tan Le Dr.", "authors": "Song-Ping Zhu, Nhat-Tan Le, Wen-Ting Chen and Xiaoping Lu", "title": "Pricing Parisian down-and-in options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.aml.2014.10.019", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we price American-style Parisian down-and-in call options\nunder the Black-Scholes framework. Usually, pricing an American-style option is\nmuch more difficult than pricing its European-style counterpart because of the\nappearance of the optimal exercise boundary in the former. Fortunately, the\noptimal exercise boundary associated with an American-style Parisian knock-in\noption only appears implicitly in its pricing partial differential equation\n(PDE) systems, instead of explicitly as in the case of an American-style\nParisian knock-out option. We also recognize that the \"moving window\" technique\ndeveloped for pricing European-style Parisian up-and-out options can be adopted\nto price American-style Parisian knock-in options as well. In particular, we\nobtain a simple analytical solution for American-style Parisian down-and-in\ncall options and our new formula is written in terms of four double integrals,\nwhich can be easily computed numerically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 00:49:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Song-Ping", ""], ["Le", "Nhat-Tan", ""], ["Chen", "Wen-Ting", ""], ["Lu", "Xiaoping", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.04314", "submitter": "Sergio  Pulido", "authors": "Travis Fisher, Sergio Pulido, Johannes Ruf", "title": "Financial Models with Defaultable Num\\'eraires", "comments": "18 pages.

To obtain explicit approximation for option prices,\nwe propose to treat a given L\\'evy Libor model as a suitable perturbation of\nthe log-normal LMM.
