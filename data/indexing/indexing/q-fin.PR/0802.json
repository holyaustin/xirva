By using support arguments we prove that\nthe resulting model is arbitrage free under proportional transaction costs in\nthe same spirit of Guasoni [Math. Finance 16 (2006) 569-582]. In particular, we\nobtain a drift condition which is similar in nature to the classical HJM\nno-arbitrage drift restriction. The second part of this paper deals with\nconsistency problems related to the fractional HJM dynamics. We give a fairly\ncomplete characterization of finite-dimensional invariant manifolds for HJM\nmodels with fractional Brownian motion by means of Nagumo-type conditions. As\nan application, we investigate consistency of Nelson-Siegel family with respect\nto Ho-Lee and Hull-White models. It turns out that similar to the Brownian case\nsuch a family does not go well with the fractional HJM dynamics with\ndeterministic volatility. In fact, there is no nontrivial fractional interest\nrate model consistent with the Nelson-Siegel family.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 Feb 2008 20:09:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2008 22:43:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2009 07:14:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ohashi", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1823", "submitter": "Martin Keller-Ressel", "authors": "Martin Keller-Ressel", "title": "Moment Explosions and Long-Term Behavior of Affine Stochastic Volatility\n  Models", "comments": "minor revision", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a class of asset pricing models, where the risk-neutral joint\nprocess of log-price and its stochastic variance is an affine process in the\nsense of Duffie, Filipovic and Schachermayer [2003].
