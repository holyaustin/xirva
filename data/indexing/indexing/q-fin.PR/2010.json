In particular, for the case of a\ncall perturbed by a square bubble, an approximate solution (valid up third\norder in a perturbation series) is given in terms of the three first Greeks:\nDelta, Gamma, and Speed. Then an exact solution is constructed in terms of all\nhigher order $S$-derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula. It is also shown\nthat the interacting Black-Scholes equation is invariant under a discrete\ntransformation that interchanges the interest rate with the mean of the\nunderlying asset and vice versa. This implies that the interacting\nBlack-Scholes equation can be written in a 'low energy' and a 'high energy'\nform, in such a way that the high-interaction limit of the low energy form\ncorresponds to the weak-interaction limit of the high energy form. One can\napply a perturbative analysis to the high energy form to study the\nhigh-interaction limit of the low energy form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:25:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["G", "Mauricio Contreras", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.13411", "submitter": "Kamran Zakaria", "authors": "Kamran Zakaria, Saeed Hafeez", "title": "Options Pricing for Two Stocks by Black Sholes Time Fractional Order\n  NonLinear Partial Differential Equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/iCoMET48670.2020.9073866", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The BS equations with fractional order two asset price models give a better\nprediction of options pricing in the monetary market.

The sufficient\nconditions are formulated for the evolution of risky assets under which the\nfamily of equivalent martingale measures to the original measure is a non-empty\nset. The set of martingale measures is constructed from a set of strictly\nnonneg ative random variables, satisfying certain conditions. The inequalities\nare obtained for the non-negative random variables satisfying certain\nconditions. Using these inequalities, a new simple proof of optional\ndecomposition theorem for the nonnegative super-martingale is proposed. The\nfamily of spot measures is introduced and the representation is found for them.\nThe conditions are found under which each martingale measure is an integral\nover the set of spot measures. On the basis of nonlinear processes such as ARCH\nand GARCH, the parametric family of random processes is introduced for which\nthe interval of non-arbitrage prices are found. The formula is obtained for the\nfair price of the contract with option of European type for the considered\nparametric processes. The parameters of the introduced random processes are\nestimated and the estimate is found at which the fair price of contract with\noption is the least.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:46:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Gonchar", "N.
