Our main tool is the theory of\nregularity structures, which we use in the form of [Bayer et al; A regularity\nstructure for rough volatility, 2017]. In essence, we implement a Laplace\nmethod on the space of models (in the sense of Hairer), which generalizes\nclassical works of Azencott and Ben Arous on path space and then Aida,\nInahama--Kawabi on rough path space. When applied to rough volatility models,\ne.g. in the setting of [Forde-Zhang, Asymptotics for rough stochastic\nvolatility models, 2017], one obtains precise asymptotic for European options\nwhich refine known large deviation asymptotics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2018 07:25:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Nov 2020 09:17:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Friz", "Peter K.", ""], ["Gassiat", "Paul", ""], ["Pigato", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.01664", "submitter": "Alexander R.

Whereas up to now these two types of tax processes have been\ntreated separately, we show that, in fact, they are essentially equivalent.\nThis allows a unified treatment, translating results from one model to the\nother.

The pure jump process is assumed to be a semi-Markov process on\nfinite state space. This consideration helps to incorporate a specific type of\nmemory influence in the asset price. Under this model assumption, the locally\nrisk minimizing price of the European type path-independent options is found.\nThe F\\\"{o}llmer-Schweizer decomposition is adopted to show that the option\nprice satisfies an evolution problem, as a function of time, stock price,\nmarket regime, and the stagnancy period. To be more precise, the evolution\nproblem involves a linear, parabolic, degenerate and non-local system of\nintegro-partial differential equations.
