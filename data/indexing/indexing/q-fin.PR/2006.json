In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for data-driven model selection by integrating a classical\nquantitative setup with a generative modelling approach. Leveraging the\nproperties of the signature, a well-known path-transform from stochastic\nanalysis that recently emerged as leading machine learning technology for\nlearning time-series data, we develop the Sig-SDE model. Sig-SDE provides a new\nperspective on neural SDEs and can be calibrated to exotic financial products\nthat depend, in a non-linear way, on the whole trajectory of asset prices.\nFurthermore, we our approach enables to consistently calibrate under the\npricing measure $\\mathbb Q$ and real-world measure $\\mathbb P$. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the ability of Sig-SDE to simulate future possible market scenarios\nneeded for computing risk profiles or hedging strategies.
