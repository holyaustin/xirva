We derive the dynamics of the\nsystem of foreign LIBOR rates under the domestic forward measure and then\nconsider the price of the quanto option. In order to take the skew/smile effect\nobserved in fixed income and FX markets into account, we consider local\nvolatility models for both the LIBOR and the FX rate. Because of the structure\nof the local volatility function, a closed form solution for quanto option\nprices does not exist. Using expansions around a proxy related to log-normal\ndynamics, we derive approximation formulas of Black--Scholes type for the\nprice, that have the benefit of giving very rapid numerical procedures. Our\nexpansion formulas have the major advantage that they allow for an accurate\nestimation of the error, using Malliavin calculus, which is directly related to\nthe maturity of the option, the payoff, and the level and curvature of the\nlocal volatility function. These expansions also illustrate the impact of the\nquanto drift adjustment, while the numerical experiments show an excellent\naccuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jan 2018 23:28:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 15:07:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hok", "Julien", ""], ["Ngare", "Philip", ""], ["Papapantoleon", "Antonis", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04045", "submitter": "Yuri Imamura", "authors": "Jiro Akahori, Flavia Barsotti, Yuri Imamura", "title": "Asymptotic Static Hedge via Symmetrization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is a continuation of Akahori-Barsotti-Imamura (2017) and where the\nauthors i) showed that a payment at a random time, which we call timing risk,\nis decomposed into an integral of static positions of knock-in type barrier\noptions, ii) proposed an iteration of static hedge of a timing risk by\nregarding the hedging error by a static hedge strategy of Bowie-Carr type with\nrespect to a barrier option as a timing risk, and iii) showed that the error\nconverges to zero by infinitely many times of iteration under a condition on\nthe integrability of a relevant function. Even though many diffusion models\nincluding generic 1-dimensional ones satisfy the required condition, a\nconstruction of the iterated static hedge that is applicable to any uniformly\nelliptic diffusions is postponed to the present paper because of its\nmathematical difficulty. We solve the problem in this paper by relying on the\nsymmetrization, a technique first introduced in Imamura-Ishigaki-Okumura (2014)\nand generalized in Akahori-Imamura (2014), and also work on parametrix, a\nclassical technique from perturbation theory to construct a fundamental\nsolution of a partial differential equation. Due to a lack of continuity in the\ndiffusion coefficient, however, a careful study of the integrability of the\nrelevant functions is required.
