The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini &\nPrampolini 2010 has contributed to understanding this. However, there are two\nsignificant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same\nsource, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first\nomission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An\nexample is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically\nwritten down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The\nsecond omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are\nout of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require\nfunding that cannot be secured using the position itself. These contingent\nfuture funding positions are usually not booked in any position-keeping system.\nWe show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to\ncomplete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.\n  For a particular large complex financial institution that profited $2.5B from\nspread widening we show that including Goodwill would have resulted in a $4B\nloss under conservative assumptions. Whilst we cannot make a similar assessment\nfor its collateralized derivative portfolio we calculate both the funding costs\nand the CVA from own default for a range of swaps and find that CVA was a\npositive contribution in the examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:20:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3556", "submitter": "Thomas  Emmerling", "authors": "Thomas J.

Such an extension is\neconomically justified on account of the fact that in real markets information\nflow rates are rarely measurable. Effects of having a random information flow\nrate is investigated in detail in the context of a simple model setup.\nSpecifically, the price process of the asset is derived, and its characteristic\nbehaviours are revealed via simulation studies. The price of a European-style\noption is worked out, showing that the model has a sufficient flexibility to\nfit volatility surface.
