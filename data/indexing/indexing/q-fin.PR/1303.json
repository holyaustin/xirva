For HARA\nutilities we consider information quantities like Kullback-Leibler information\nand Hellinger integrals, and corresponding information processes. As a\nparticular case we study exponential Levy models depending on random factor. In\nthat case the information processes are deterministic and this fact simplify\nvery much indifference price calculus. Then we give the equations for\nindifference prices. We show that indifference price for seller and minus\nindifference price for buyer are risk measures. Finally, we apply the results\nto Geometric Brownian motion case. Using identity in law technique we give the\nexplicit expression for information quantities.
