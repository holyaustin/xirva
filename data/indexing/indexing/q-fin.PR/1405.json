In contrast to the standard small-diffusion asymptotic\nexpansion method, the dynamics of variables given by the forward SDEs is\ntreated exactly. Although it requires a special form of the quadratic\ncovariation terms of the continuous part, it allows rather generic drift as\nwell as jump components to exist. The resultant approximation is given by a\npolynomial function in terms of the unperturbed forward variables whose\ncoefficients are uniquely specified by the solution of the recursive system of\nlinear ODEs.

This paper\nformalises the addition of cost of capital by extending the Burgard-Kjaer\n(2013) semi-replication approach to CVA and FVA to include an addition capital\nterm, Capital Valuation Adjustment (KVA, i.e. Kapital Valuation Adjustment to\ndistinguish from CVA.) The utilization of the capital for funding purposes is\nalso considered. The use of the semi-replication approach means that the\nflexibility around the treatment of self-default is carried over into this\nanalysis.
