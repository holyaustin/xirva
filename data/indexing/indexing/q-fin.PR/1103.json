In\npractice, to hedge a contingent claim one typically uses the so-called\ndelta-hedging strategy. This strategy stems from the Black--Merton--Scholes\nmodel where it perfectly replicates contingent claims. From the theoretical\nviewpoint, there is no reason for this to hold in models with jumps. However in\npractice the delta-hedging strategy is widely used and its potential\nshortcoming in models with jumps is disregarded since such models are typically\nincomplete and hence most contingent claims are non-attainable. In this note we\ninvestigate a complete model with jumps where the delta-hedging strategy is\nwell-defined for regular payoff functions and is uniquely determined via the\nrisk-neutral measure. In this setting we give examples of (admissible)\ndelta-hedging strategies with bounded discounted value processes, which\nnevertheless fail to replicate the respective bounded contingent claims.
