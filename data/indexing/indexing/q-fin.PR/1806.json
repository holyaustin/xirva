Therefore, it integrates the recent developments in\nthe Malliavin calculus for the computation of Greeks: Delta, Vega, and Rho and\nit extends the method slightly. The main results show that Malliavin calculus\nallows a running Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to present numerical\nimplementations and to illustrate its effectiveness. The main advantage of this\nmethod is that once the algorithms are constructed, they can be used for\nnumerous types of option, even if their payoff functions are not\ndifferentiable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2018 06:49:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "Bilgi", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.06148", "submitter": "Jozef Barunik", "authors": "Jozef Barun\\'ik and Mat\\v{e}j Nevrla", "title": "Tail Risks, Investment Horizons, and Asset Prices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the two important sources of risk -- market tail risk and\nextreme market volatility risk -- are priced in the cross-section of asset\nreturns heterogeneously across horizons.
