Thus, if the individual constituent distributions of an equity\nindex are inferred from the single-stock option markets and combined via a\nGaussian copula, for example, one fails to explain the steepness of the\nobserved volatility skew of the index. Intuitively, index option prices are\nencoding higher correlations in cases where the option is particularly\nsensitive to stress scenarios of the market. As a result, more complex\ndependency structures emerge than the ones described by Gaussian copulas or\n(state-independent) linear correlation structures.\n  In this paper we \"decode\" the index option market and extract this\ncorrelation information in order to extend the multi-asset version of Dupire's\n\"local volatility\" model by making correlations a dynamic variable of the\nmarket. A \"local correlation\" model (LCM) is introduced for the pricing of\nmulti-asset derivatives. We show how consistency with the index volatility data\ncan be achieved by construction.\n  LCM achieves consistency with both the constituent- and index option markets\nby construction while preserving the efficiency and easy implementation of\nDupire's model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 13:48:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2009 15:51:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 13:53:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Langnau", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.4765", "submitter": "Maciej Wisniewolski", "authors": "Jacek Jakubowski and Maciej Wisniewolski", "title": "Linear stochastic volatility models", "comments": "20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate general linear stochastic volatility models with\ncorrelated Brownian noises.

The\nconstruction of the system is grounded upon a heterogeneous interacting agent\nmodel for a single risky asset market. An advantage of this construction\nprocedure is that the resulting dynamical system becomes a macroscopic market\nmodel which mirrors the market quantities and qualities that would typically be\ntaken into account solely at the microscopic level of modeling. The system's\nparameters correspond to: (a) the proportion of speculators in a market; (b)\nthe traders' speculative trend; (c) the degree of heterogeneity of\nidiosyncratic evaluations of the market agents with respect to the asset's\nfundamental value; and (d) the strength of the feedback of the population\nexcess demand on the asset price update increment.
