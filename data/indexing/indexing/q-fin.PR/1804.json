We model CDS spread regime switching, which is prevalent\nduring crises, as a hidden Markov process, coupled with a mean-reverting\nstochastic process of spread levels under fixed regimes, in order to obtain\nS-CoCo prices through simulation. The paper uses the pricing model in a\nLongstaff-Schwartz American option pricing framework to compute future state\ncontingent S-CoCo prices for risk management. Dual trigger pricing is also\ndiscussed using the idiosyncratic CDS spread for the sovereign debt together\nwith a broad market index. Numerical results are reported using S-CoCo designs\nfor Greece, Italy and Germany with both the pricing and contingent pricing\nmodels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2018 15:42:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Consiglio", "Andrea", ""], ["Tumminello", "Michele", ""], ["Zenios", "Stavros A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.02289", "submitter": "David Lee", "authors": "David Lee", "title": "Pricing Financial Derivatives Subject to Counterparty Risk and Credit\n  Value Adjustment", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1803.07843 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.GN q-fin.RM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article presents a generic model for pricing financial derivatives\nsubject to counterparty credit risk.

Existing pricing models assume\nconversion triggers based on market prices and on the assumption that markets\ncan always observe all relevant firm information.

We\nincorporate that markets receive information through noisy accounting reports\nissued at discrete time instants, which allows us to distinguish between market\nand accounting values, and between automatic triggers and regulator-mandated\nconversions. Our second contribution is to incorporate that coupon payments are\ncontingent too: their payment is conditional on the Maximum Distributable\nAmount not being exceeded. We examine the impact of CoCo design parameters,\nasset volatility and accounting noise on the price of a CoCo; and investigate\nthe interaction between CoCo design features, the capital structure of the\nissuing bank and their implications for risk taking and investment incentives.\nFinally, we use our model to explain the crash in CoCo prices after Deutsche\nBank's profit warning in February 2016.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2018 19:41:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Derksen", "Mike", ""], ["Spreij", "Peter", ""], ["van Wijnbergen", "Sweder", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.07997", "submitter": "Zbigniew Palmowski", "authors": "Krzysztof Burnecki, Mario Nicol\\'o Giuricich and Zbigniew Palmowski", "title": "Valuation of contingent convertible catastrophe bonds - the case for\n  equity conversion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Within the context of the banking-related literature on contingent\nconvertible bonds, we comprehensively formalise the design and features of a\nrelatively new type of insurance-linked security, called a contingent\nconvertible catastrophe bond (CocoCat).
