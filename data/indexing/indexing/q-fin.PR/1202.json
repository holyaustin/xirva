In\nshort, an option has a particular payout that is based on the market price for\nan asset on a given date in the future. In 1973, Black and Scholes proposed a\nvaluation model for options that essentially estimates the tail risk of the\nasset price under the assumption that the price will fluctuate according to\ngeometric Brownian motion. More recently, DeMarzo et al., among others, have\nproposed more robust valuation schemes, where we can even assume an adversary\nchooses the price fluctuations. This framework can be considered as a\nsequential two-player zero-sum game between the investor and Nature. We analyze\nthe value of this game in the limit, where the investor can trade at smaller\nand smaller time intervals. Under weak assumptions on the actions of Nature (an\nadversary), we show that the minimax option price asymptotically approaches\nexactly the Black-Scholes valuation.
