The expansion is\nbased on polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to the log-normal\ndistribution. All terms in the series are fully explicit and no numerical\nintegration nor any special functions are involved. We provide sufficient\nconditions to guarantee convergence of the series. The moment indeterminacy of\nthe log-normal distribution introduces an asymptotic bias in the series,\nhowever we show numerically that the bias can safely be ignored in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 09:26:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2018 15:37:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Willems", "Sander", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.01393", "submitter": "Lorenz Schneider", "authors": "Lorenz Schneider and Bertrand Tavin", "title": "Seasonal Stochastic Volatility and the Samuelson Effect in Agricultural\n  Futures Markets", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1506.05911", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a multi-factor stochastic volatility model for commodities that\nincorporates seasonality and the Samuelson effect.
