However, a growing body of studies\nsuggest that a simple GBM trajectory is not an adequate representation for\nasset dynamics due to irregularities found when comparing its properties with\nempirical distributions. As a solution, we develop a generalisation of GBM\nwhere the introduction of a memory kernel critically determines the behavior of\nthe stochastic process. We find the general expressions for the moments,\nlog-moments, and the expectation of the periodic log returns, and obtain the\ncorresponding probability density functions by using the subordination\napproach. Particularly, we consider subdiffusive GBM (sGBM), tempered sGBM, a\nmix of GBM and sGBM, and a mix of sGBMs. We utilise the resulting generalised\nGBM (gGBM) to examine the empirical performance of a selected group of kernels\nin the pricing of European call options. Our results indicate that the\nperformance of a kernel ultimately depends on the maturity of the option and\nits moneyness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2020 16:58:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Stojkoski", "Viktor", ""], ["Sandev", "Trifce", ""], ["Basnarkov", "Lasko", ""], ["Kocarev", "Ljupco", ""], ["Metzler", "Ralf", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.00557", "submitter": "Jaehyuk Choi", "authors": "Jaehyuk Choi, Lixin Wu", "title": "A note on the option price and 'Mass at zero in the uncorrelated SABR\n  model and implied volatility asymptotics'", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Quantitative Finance, 21:1083, 2021", "doi": "10.1080/14697688.2021.1876908", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gulisashvili et al.
