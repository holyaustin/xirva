This entails that the\nvolatility process is very rough and its autocorrelation exhibits sharp decay\nat the origin. Another classic stylistic feature often assumed for the\nvolatility is that it is mean reverting. In this paper it is shown that the\nprice impact of a rapidly mean reverting rough volatility model coincides with\nthat associated with fast mean reverting Markov stochastic volatility models.\nThis reconciles the empirical observation of rough volatility paths with the\ngood fit of the implied volatility surface to models of fast mean reverting\nMarkov volatilities. Moreover, the result conforms with recent numerical\nresults regarding rough stochastic volatility models. It extends the scope of\nmodels for which the asymptotic results of fast mean reverting Markov\nvolatilities are valid. The paper concludes with a general discussion of\nfractional volatility asymptotics and their interrelation. The regimes\ndiscussed there include fast and slow volatility factors with strong or small\nvolatility fluctuations and with the limits not commuting in general. The\nnotion of a characteristic term structure exponent is introduced, this exponent\ngoverns the implied volatility term structure in the various asymptotic\nregimes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 22:48:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2018 11:50:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Garnier", "Josselin", ""], ["Solna", "Knut", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.00807", "submitter": "Sotirios Sabanis", "authors": "Raj Kumari Bahl and Sotirios Sabanis", "title": "General Price Bounds for Guaranteed Annuity Options", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR stat.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we are concerned with the valuation of Guaranteed Annuity\nOptions (GAOs) under the most generalised modelling framework where both\ninterest and mortality rates are stochastic and correlated.
