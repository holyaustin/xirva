Trading is\nsubject to nonproportional transaction costs and portfolio constraints and full\nreplication by way of market instruments is not always possible. Rationality is\ndefined in terms of consistency with market prices and acceptable risk\nthresholds. We obtain a direct and a dual description of market-consistent\nprices with acceptable risk based on superreplication prices and pricing\ndensities. The dual characterization requires an appropriate extension of the\nclassical Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing where the role of arbitrage\nopportunities is played by acceptable deals, i.e., costless investment\nopportunities with acceptable risk-reward tradeoff. In particular, we highlight\nthe importance of scalable acceptable deals, i.e., investment opportunities\nthat are acceptable deals regardless of their volume. Our results provide a\nsystematic treatment of and new insights into the theory of good deal pricing\nin a static setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Dec 2020 15:10:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Arduca", "Maria", ""], ["Munari", "Cosimo", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.09041", "submitter": "Ricardo Cris\\'ostomo", "authors": "Ricardo Cris\\'ostomo", "title": "Estimating real-world probabilities: A forward-looking behavioral\n  framework", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We show that disentangling sentiment-induced biases from fundamental\nexpectations significantly improves the accuracy and consistency of\nprobabilistic forecasts.

In detail, we recast\nthe free boundary problem into a system of nonlinear partial differential\nequations with a multi-fixed domain. We then introduce a transformation based\non the square root function with a Lipschitz character from which a high order\nanalytical approximation is obtained to compute the derivative of the optimal\nexercise boundary in each regime. We further compute the boundary values, asset\noption, and the option Greeks for each regime using fourth-order spatial\ndiscretization and adaptive time integration. In particular, the coupled assets\noptions and option Greeks are estimated using Hermite interpolation with Newton\nbasis. Finally, a numerical experiment is carried out with two- and\nfour-regimes examples and results are compared with the existing methods.
