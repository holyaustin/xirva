Such losses can be\nincurred whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a\ndefaulting clearing member. This does not necessarily require the default of\nthe CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial\ninstitution has when facing a CCP.\n  We show that a clearing member's CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures to\neach of the other clearing members. This arises because of the implicit default\ninsurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing\ncollateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital\nstructure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member\nportfolios.\n  An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency\nwith respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of individual\nclearing members. To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical\nCCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio\nloss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined\nprobability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels.\n  A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way\nrisk, i.e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed\nmarket conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member's default\nand the losses on his portfolio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2012 20:25:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Arnsdorf", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.1966", "submitter": "S\\\"oren Christensen", "authors": "S\\\"oren Christensen, Albrecht Irle, Stephan J\\\"urgens", "title": "Optimal multiple stopping with random waiting times", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/07474946.2013.803814", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the standard models for optimal multiple stopping problems it is assumed\nthat between two exercises there is always a time period of deterministic\nlength $\\delta$, the so called refraction period.
