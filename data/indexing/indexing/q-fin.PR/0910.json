Instead, our calibration procedure amounts to a proper reweightening\nof the prior measure using the Minimum Cross Entropy method. As the latter\nproblem reduces to convex optimization in a low dimensional space, our model is\ncomputationally efficient. Both the static (one-period) and dynamic versions of\nthe model are presented.
