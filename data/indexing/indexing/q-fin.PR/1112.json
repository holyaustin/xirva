We consider\nrealistic settings and we include in our models the common market practices\nsuggested by the ISDA documentation without assuming restrictive constraints on\nmargining procedures and close-out netting rules. In particular, we allow for\nasymmetric collateral and funding rates, and exogenous liquidity policies and\nhedging strategies. Re-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount\nevaluation issues are also covered. We define a comprehensive pricing framework\nwhich allows us to derive earlier results on funding or counterparty risk. Some\nrelevant examples illustrate the non trivial settings needed to derive known\nfacts about discounting curves by starting from a general framework and without\nresorting to ad hoc hypotheses. Our main result is a bilateral collateralized\ncounterparty valuation adjusted pricing equation, which allows to price a deal\nwhile taking into account credit and debt valuation adjustments along with\nmargining and funding costs in a coherent way. We find that the equation has a\nrecursive form, making the introduction of an additive funding valuation\nadjustment difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of\niterative relationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square\nMonte Carlo techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 10:56:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2011 22:17:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pallavicini", "Andrea", ""], ["Perini", "Daniele", ""], ["Brigo", "Damiano", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.1652", "submitter": "Cyril Grunspan", "authors": "Cyril Grunspan", "title": "Asymptotic Expansions of the Lognormal Implied Volatility : A Model Free\n  Approach", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We invert the Black-Scholes formula.
