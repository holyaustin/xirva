To price an Asian option and to obtain measures of its dependence\non the parameters of time, strike price, and underlying market price, it is\nessential to have the distribution of time integral of geometric Brownian\nmotion and it is also required to have a way to manipulate its distribution.

We derive the\nMarkov property of such FBSDE and generalize results on the differentiability\nrelative to the initial value of their forward components. In this case the\noptimal hedge can be represented by the price gradient multiplied with the\ncorrelation coefficient.
