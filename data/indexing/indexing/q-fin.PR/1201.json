Under the exponential forward measure, the indifference price is\nformulated as a stochastic singular control problem. The value function is\ncharacterized as the unique solution of a partial differential equation in a\nSobolev space. Together with some regularities and estimates of the value\nfunction, the existence of the optimal strategy is also obtained. The\napplications of the characterization result includes a derivation of a dual\nrepresentation and the indifference pricing on employee stock option. As a\nbyproduct, a generalized Ito's formula is obtained for functions in a Sobolev\nspace.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 07:46:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xiaoshan", ""], ["Song", "Qingshuo", ""], ["Yi", "Fahuai", ""], ["Yin", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0111", "submitter": "Richard Martin", "authors": "Richard J Martin", "title": "A CDS Option Miscellany", "comments": "Minor corrections from 2017 version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  CDS options allow investors to express a view on spread volatility and obtain\na wider range of payoffs than are possible with vanilla CDS.

The\nmodel allows for analytic futures prices, and we apply these to model and\nestimate the whole market consistently. Besides standard parameter estimation,\nan estimation procedure is suggested, where we fit the non-stationary trend\nusing futures data with long time until delivery, and a robust $L^1$-filter to\nfind the states of the CARMA process. The procedure also involves the empirical\nand theoretical risk premiums which -- as a by-product -- are also estimated.\nWe apply this procedure to data from the German electricity exchange EEX, where\nwe split the empirical analysis into base load and peak load prices. We find an\noverall negative risk premium for the base load futures contracts, except for\ncontracts close to delivery, where a small positive risk premium is detected.\nThe peak load contracts, on the other hand, show a clear positive risk premium,\nwhen they are close to delivery, while the contracts in the longer end also\nhave a negative premium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2012 12:34:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Benth", "Fred Espen", ""], ["Kl\u00fcppelberg", "Claudia", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Gernot", ""], ["Vos", "Linda", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.1437", "submitter": "Carmelo Vaccaro", "authors": "Carmelo Vaccaro", "title": "Heat kernel methods in finance: the SABR model", "comments": "59 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The SABR model is a stochastic volatility model not admitting a closed form\nsolution.

To allow prior information about such a density to\nbe taken into account, we generalise the algorithm presented in Neri and\nSchneider (2011) to find the maximum entropy density of an asset price to the\nrelative entropy case. This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior\ndensity has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices\nare prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of\nprior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second\nscenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large\nnumber of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by\ncalibrated Heston, Schoebel-Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the\nresulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the\n(non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently\nliquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost\ncompletely. Finally, we study variance swaps and derive a simple formula\nrelating the fair variance swap rate to entropy. Then we show, again, that the\nprior loses its influence on the fair variance swap rate as the number of\nstrikes increases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 17:05:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Sep 2013 14:10:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Neri", "C.", "", "Lloyds Banking Group, London, UK"], ["Schneider", "L.", "", "EMLYON\n  Business School, Lyon, France"]]}, {"id": "1201.2899", "submitter": "Tony Sit", "authors": "Steven Kou and Tony Sit and Zhiliang Ying", "title": "Parameter Estimation using Empirical Likelihood combined with Market\n  Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  During the last decade Levy processes with jumps have received increasing\npopularity for modelling market behaviour for both derviative pricing and risk\nmanagement purposes.
