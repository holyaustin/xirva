Hence, the need for an effective weather risk management tool\n(i.e., weather derivatives) that can hedge crop yields against weather\nuncertainties. However, most smallholder farmers and agricultural stakeholders\nare unwilling to pay for the price of weather derivatives (WD) because of the\npresence of basis risks (product-design and geographical) in the pricing\nmodels. To eliminate product-design basis risks, a machine learning ensemble\ntechnique was used to determine the relationship between maize yield and\nweather variables. The results revealed that the most significant weather\nvariable that affected the yield of maize was average temperature. A\nmean-reverting model with a time-varying speed of mean reversion, seasonal\nmean, and local volatility that depended on the local average temperature was\nthen proposed. The model was extended to a multi-dimensional model for\ndifferent but correlated locations. Based on these average temperature models,\npricing models for futures, options on futures, and basket futures for\ncumulative average temperature and growing degree-days are presented. Pricing\nfutures on baskets reduces geographical basis risk, as buyers have the\nopportunity to select the most appropriate weather stations with their desired\nweight preference. With these pricing models, farmers and agricultural\nstakeholders can hedge their crops against the perils of extreme weather.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 18 May 2019 07:31:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2019 06:25:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gyamerah", "Samuel Asante", ""], ["Ngare", "Philip", ""], ["Ikpe", "Dennis", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.09474", "submitter": "Andrea Molent", "authors": "Ludovic Gouden\\`ege, Andrea Molent, Antonino Zanette", "title": "Machine Learning for Pricing American Options in High-Dimensional\n  Markovian and non-Markovian models", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.11275", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose two efficient techniques which allow one to compute\nthe price of American basket options. In particular, we consider a basket of\nassets that follow a multi-dimensional Black-Scholes dynamics. The proposed\ntechniques, called GPR Tree (GRP-Tree) and GPR Exact Integration (GPR-EI), are\nboth based on Machine Learning, exploited together with binomial trees or with\na closed formula for integration. Moreover, these two methods solve the\nbackward dynamic programming problem considering a Bermudan approximation of\nthe American option. On the exercise dates, the value of the option is first\ncomputed as the maximum between the exercise value and the continuation value\nand then approximated by means of Gaussian Process Regression. The two methods\nmainly differ in the approach used to compute the continuation value: a single\nstep of binomial tree or integration according to the probability density of\nthe process. Numerical results show that these two methods are accurate and\nreliable in handling American options on very large baskets of assets. Moreover\nwe also consider the rough Bergomi model, which provides stochastic volatility\nwith memory. Despite this model is only bidimensional, the whole history of the\nprocess impacts on the price, and handling all this information is not obvious\nat all. To this aim, we present how to adapt the GPR-Tree and GPR-EI methods\nand we focus on pricing American options in this non-Markovian framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2019 14:52:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 May 2019 16:18:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Jun 2019 10:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gouden\u00e8ge", "Ludovic", ""], ["Molent", "Andrea", ""], ["Zanette", "Antonino", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.11328", "submitter": "Alessandro Gnoatto", "authors": "Francesca Biagini and Alessandro Gnoatto and Immacolata Oliva", "title": "A unified approach to xVA with CSA discounting and initial margin", "comments": "37 pages.
