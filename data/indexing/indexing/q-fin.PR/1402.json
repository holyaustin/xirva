We do this in the context of a generalized GARCH model with\nmultiple time scales and asymmetry. It is argued that the reason for the\nobserved volatility risk premium is tail risk aversion. We parametrize such\nrisk aversion in terms of three coefficients: convexity, skew and kurtosis risk\npremium. We propose that option prices under the real-world measure are not\nmartingales, but that their drift is governed by such tail risk premia. We then\nderive a fair-pricing equation for options and show that the solutions can be\nwritten in terms of a stochastic volatility model in continuous time and under\na martingale probability measure. This gives a precise connection between the\npricing and real-world probability measures, which cannot be obtained using\nGirsanov Theorem. We find that the convexity risk premium, not only shifts the\noverall implied volatility level, but also changes its term structure.\nMoreover, the skew risk premium makes the skewness of the volatility smile\nsteeper than a pure historical estimate. We derive analytical formulas for\ncertain implied moments using the Bergomi-Guyon expansion. This allows for very\nfast calibrations of the models. We show examples of a particular model which\ncan reproduce the observed SPX volatility surface using very few parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 06:08:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Vazquez", "Samuel E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.1554", "submitter": "Kais Hamza", "authors": "Kais Hamza, Fima C.
