The most common practice to\ndeal with these issues is to use another similar or \"closely related\" asset or\nindex which is traded, for hedging purposes. Implicitly, traders assume here\nthat the higher the correlation between the traded and nontraded assets, the\nbetter the hedge is expected to perform. This raises the question as to how\n\\textquoteleft{}closely related\\textquoteright{} the assets really are. In this\npaper, the concept of twin assets is introduced, focusing the discussion\nprecisely in what does it mean for two assets to be similar. Our findings point\nto the fact that, in order to have very similar assets, for example identical\ntwins, high correlation measures are not enough. Specifically, two basic\ncriteria of similarity are pointed out: i) the coefficient of variation of the\nassets and ii) the correlation between assets. From here, a method to measure\nthe level of similarity between assets is proposed, and secondly, an option\npricing model of twin assets is developed. The proposed model allows us to\nprice an option of one nontraded asset using its twin asset, but this time\nknowing explicitly what levels of errors we are facing. Finally, some numerical\nillustrations show how twin assets behave depending upon their levels of\nsimilarities, and how their potential differences will traduce in MAPE (mean\nabsolute percentage error) for the proposed option pricing model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 04:28:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Villena", "Marcelo J.", ""], ["Araneda", "Axel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.7913", "submitter": "Lorenz Schneider", "authors": "Lorenz Schneider and Bertrand Tavin", "title": "From the Samuelson Volatility Effect to a Samuelson Correlation Effect:\n  Evidence from Crude Oil Calendar Spread Options", "comments": "32 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a multi-factor stochastic volatility model based on the\nCIR/Heston stochastic volatility process.
