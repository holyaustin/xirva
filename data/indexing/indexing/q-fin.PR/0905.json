This created the challenge of developing a pricing framework that\ncan simultaneously handle European options, forward-starts, options on the\nrealized variance and options on the VIX. In this paper we propose a new\napproach to this problem using spectral methods. We use a regime switching\nmodel with jumps and local volatility defined in \\cite{FXrev} and calibrate it\nto the European options on the S&P 500 for a broad range of strikes and\nmaturities. The main idea of this paper is to \"lift\" (i.e. extend) the\ngenerator of the underlying process to keep track of the relevant path\ninformation, namely the realized variance. The lifted generator is too large a\nmatrix to be diagonalized numerically. We overcome this difficulty by applying\na new semi-analytic algorithm for block-diagonalization. This method enables us\nto evaluate numerically the joint distribution between the underlying stock\nprice and the realized variance, which in turn gives us a way of pricing\nconsistently European options, general accrued variance payoffs and\nforward-starting and VIX options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2009 12:18:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Albanese", "Claudio", ""], ["Lo", "Harry", ""], ["Mijatovi\u0107", "Aleksandar", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2770", "submitter": "Marco Bianchetti", "authors": "Marco Bianchetti", "title": "Two Curves, One Price: Pricing & Hedging Interest Rate Derivatives\n  Decoupling Forwarding and Discounting Yield Curves", "comments": "Working paper", "journal-ref": "A short version of this paper is published in Risk Magazine,\n  August 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We revisit the problem of pricing and hedging plain vanilla single-currency\ninterest rate derivatives using multiple distinct yield curves for market\ncoherent estimation of discount factors and forward rates with different\nunderlying rate tenors.\n  Within such double-curve-single-currency framework, adopted by the market\nafter the credit-crunch crisis started in summer 2007, standard single-curve\nno-arbitrage relations are no longer valid, and can be recovered by taking\nproperly into account the forward basis bootstrapped from market basis swaps.\nNumerical results show that the resulting forward basis curves may display a\nricher micro-term structure that may induce appreciable effects on the price of\ninterest rate instruments.\n  By recurring to the foreign-currency analogy we also derive generalised\nno-arbitrage double-curve market-like formulas for basic plain vanilla interest\nrate derivatives, FRAs, swaps, caps/floors and swaptions in particular. These\nexpressions include a quanto adjustment typical of cross-currency derivatives,\nnaturally originated by the change between the numeraires associated to the two\nyield curves, that carries on a volatility and correlation dependence.\nNumerical scenarios confirm that such correction can be non negligible, thus\nmaking unadjusted double-curve prices, in principle, not arbitrage free.\n  Both the forward basis and the quanto adjustment find a natural financial\nexplanation in terms of counterparty risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 May 2009 22:21:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2010 00:27:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 02:53:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 00:27:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bianchetti", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2926", "submitter": "Louis Paulot", "authors": "Louis Paulot and Xavier Lacroze", "title": "One-Dimensional Pricing of CPPI", "comments": "19 pages; v2: improved algorithm, error analysis", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance (CPPI) is an investment strategy\ndesigned to give participation in the performance of a risky asset while\nprotecting the invested capital.
