Briefly, when we apply a classical\nnonlinear neural-network learning to a linear quantum Schr\\\"odinger equation,\nas a result we get a nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NLS), performing as a\nquantum stochastic filter. In this paper, we present a bidirectional quantum\nassociative memory model for the Black--Scholes--like option price evolution,\nconsisting of a pair of coupled NLS equations, one governing the stochastic\nvolatility and the other governing the option price, both self-organizing in an\nadaptive `market heat potential', trained by continuous Hebbian learning. This\nstiff pair of NLS equations is numerically solved using the method of lines\nwith adaptive step-size integrator.\n  Keywords: Option price modelling, Quantum neural computation, nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equations, leverage effect, bidirectional associative memory\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 02:59:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2009 02:58:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2009 02:12:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ivancevic", "Vladimir G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1643", "submitter": "Kanshukan Rajaratnam", "authors": "K.

Many institutions have relied heavily on\nthe credit ratings provided by credit agency. The relationships between\nmanagement of credit agencies and debt issuers may have resulted in conflict of\ninterest when pricing these securities which has lead to incorrect risk\nassumptions and value expectations from institutional buyers. Despite the\nexistence of sophisticated models, institutional buyers have relied on these\nratings when considering the risks involved with these products. Institutional\ninvestors interested in non-agency MBS are particularly vulnerable due to both\nthe credit risks as well as prepayment risks. This paper describes a simple\nsimulation model that model non-agency MBS and CMO. The simulation model builds\non existing models for agency MBS. It incorporates credit risks of mortgage\nbuyers using existing models used in capital requirements as specified by the\nBasel II Accord.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2009 20:12:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 20:55:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Rajaratnam", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.3657", "submitter": "Diogo Pinheiro", "authors": "Lampros Boukas, Diogo Pinheiro, Alberto Pinto, Stylianos Xanthopoulos,\n  Athanasios Yannacopoulos", "title": "Behavioural and Dynamical Scenarios for Contingent Claims Valuation in\n  Incomplete Markets", "comments": "18 pages.
