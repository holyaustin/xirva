We\npropose an explicit and consistent framework for the valuation of insurance\nliabilities which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case.\n  The proposed framework is based on dynamic replication over multiple\n(one-year) time periods by a portfolio of assets with reliable market prices,\nallowing for \"limited liability\" in the sense that the replication can in\ngeneral not always be continued. The asset portfolio consist of two parts: (1)\nassets whose market price defines the value of the insurance liabilities, and\n(2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital\nfunds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input of the framework is\nthe condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable.\n  We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of\nthe value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of\nthe lifetime of the insurance liabilities. The main question only partially\nconsidered in this paper is the uniqueness of the value. We derive upper bounds\non the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year\nzero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value.\n  Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a\nsum of a \"best estimate\" and a \"risk margin\". In our framework, it turns out\nthat this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be\nconstructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the\nvalue under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by\nexplicitly calculating the value for a simple example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 13:04:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moehr", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.0446", "submitter": "Chuancun Yin", "authors": "Ying Shen, Chuancun Yin, Kam Chuen Yuen", "title": "Alternative approach to the optimality of the threshold strategy for\n  spectrally negative Levy processes", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": "Acta Mathematicae Applicatae Sinica, English Series Vol. 29, No. 4\n  (2013) 705-716", "doi": "10.1007/s10255-013-0248-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider the optimal dividend problem for an insurance company whose\nuncontrolled surplus precess evolves as a spectrally negative Levy process.
