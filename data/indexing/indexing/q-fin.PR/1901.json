We found significant asymmetry between PMG\nand PML. PML significantly contributed to forecasting PMG but not vice versa.\nWe further explored the power of this asymmetry for predicting asset returns\nand found it could significantly improve asset return predictability in both\nin-sample and out-of-sample forecasting. Investors who incorporate this\nasymmetry into their investment decisions can get substantial utility gains.\nThis asymmetry remains significant even when controlling for macroeconomic\nvariables, technical indicators, market sentiment, and skewness. Moreover, this\nasymmetry was found to be quite general across different countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2019 14:30:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Haibin", ""], ["Wang", "Shouyang", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.02254", "submitter": "Alexander Fromm", "authors": "Alexander Fromm", "title": "Evaluation of equity-based debt obligations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a class of participation rights, i.e. obligations issued by a\ncompany to investors who are interested in performance-based compensation.\nAlbeit having desirable economic properties equity-based debt obligations\n(EbDO) pose challenges in accounting and contract pricing.

Due to the unavoidable need for the estimation of\ntrends while making decisions, the related Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation is of a degenerate parabolic type. Hence, it is very hard to obtain\nits regularity using the standard approach, making the problem different from\nthe existing optimal redeeming problems without drift uncertainty.

We deduce a simple closed formula for illiquid corporate coupon bond\nprices when liquid bonds with similar characteristics (e.g. maturity) are\npresent in the market for the same issuer. The key model parameter is the\ntime-to-liquidate a position, i.e. the time that an experienced bond trader\ntakes to liquidate a given position on a corporate coupon bond. We show that\nilliquid bonds present an additional liquidity spread that depends on the\ntime-to-liquidate aside from bond volatility.\n  We provide a detailed application for two issuers in the European market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2019 10:13:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 17:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Baviera", "Roberto", ""], ["Nassigh", "Aldo", ""], ["Nastasi", "Emanuele", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.10989", "submitter": "Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "authors": "Martin Herdegen, Johannes Muhle-Karbe, Dylan Possama\\\"i", "title": "Equilibrium Asset Pricing with Transaction Costs", "comments": "32 pages, forthcoming in 'Finance and Stochastics'", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study risk-sharing economies where heterogenous agents trade subject to\nquadratic transaction costs.
