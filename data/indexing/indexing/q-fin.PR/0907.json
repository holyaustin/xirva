We first\nderive the Markov property of a forward--backward system (FBSDE) if the\ngenerating martingale is a strong Markov process. Then we establish the\ndifferentiability of a FBSDE with respect to the initial value of its forward\ncomponent. This enables us to obtain the main result of this article, namely a\nrepresentation formula for the control component of its solution. The latter is\nrelevant in the context of securitization of random liabilities arising from\nexogenous risk, which are optimally hedged by investment in a given financial\nmarket with respect to exponential preferences. In a purely stochastic\nformulation, the control process of the backward component of the FBSDE steers\nthe system into the random liability and describes its optimal derivative hedge\nby investment in the capital market, the dynamics of which is given by the\nforward component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2009 09:31:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 14:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 10:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Imkeller", "Peter", ""], ["R\u00e9veillac", "Anthony", ""], ["Richter", "Anja", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.1221", "submitter": "Christophette Blanchet-Scalliet", "authors": "Stefan Ankirchner (Institut fur Angewandte Mathematik), Christophette\n  Blanchet-Scalliet (ICJ), Anne Eyraud-Loisel (SAF)", "title": "Credit risk premia and quadratic BSDEs with a single jump", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance (IJTAF)\n  13, 7 (2010) 1103-1129", "doi": "10.1142/10.1142/S0219024910006133", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with the determination of credit risk premia of\ndefaultable contingent claims by means of indifference valuation principles.\nAssuming exponential utility preferences we derive representations of\nindifference premia of credit risk in terms of solutions of Backward Stochastic\nDifferential Equations (BSDE).
