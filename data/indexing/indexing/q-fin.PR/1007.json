Firstly, we propose an alternative approximation scheme based on\nPicard iterations. This approach is similar in accuracy to the Euler\ndiscretization, but with the feature that each rate is evolved independently of\nthe other rates in the term structure. This enables simultaneous calculation of\nderivative prices of different maturities using parallel computing. Secondly,\nthe product terms occurring in the drift of a LIBOR market model driven by a\njump process grow exponentially as a function of the number of rates, quickly\nrendering the model intractable. We reduce this growth from exponential to\nquadratic using truncated expansions of the product terms.
