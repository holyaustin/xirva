In\nthis article, we propose an alternative approach that relies on the expected\nprofit maximization problem of an agent, producing and storing a commodity\nwhile trading in the associated futures contracts. In this framework, the\nrelation between the spot and the futures prices holds through the\nwell-posedness of the maximization problem. We show that the futures price can\nstill be seen as the risk-neutral expectation of the spot price at maturity and\nwe propose an explicit formula for the forward volatility. Moreover, we provide\nan heuristic analysis of the optimal solution for the\nproduction/storage/trading problem, in a Markovian setting. This approach is\nparticularly interesting in the case of energy commodities, like electricity:\nthis framework indeed remains suitable for commodities characterized by\nstorability constraints, when standard no-arbitrage arguments cannot be safely\napplied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jan 2015 12:19:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 15:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 24 Feb 2018 17:59:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["A\u00efd", "Ren\u00e9", ""], ["Campi", "Luciano", ""], ["Lautier", "Delphine", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01155", "submitter": "Mih\\'aly Ormos", "authors": "Mihaly Ormos, David Zibriczky", "title": "Entropy-Based Financial Asset Pricing", "comments": "21 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables and 4 supporting files", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 9(12): e115742", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0115742", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.ST", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate entropy as a financial risk measure.
