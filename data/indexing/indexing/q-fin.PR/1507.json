This\nnon-affine model is much more realistic than classical affine models like the\nHeston stochastic volatility model, even though both are as parsimonious (only\nfour stochastic parameters). Indeed, it provides more realistic volatility\ndistribution and volatility paths, which translate in practice into more robust\ncalibration and better hedging accuracy, explaining its popularity among\npractitioners. In order to price vanilla options with IGa volatility, we\npropose a closed-form volatility-of-volatility expansion. Specifically, the\nprice of a European put option with IGa volatility is approximated by a\nBlack-Scholes price plus a weighted combination of Black-Scholes greeks, where\nthe weights depend only on the four time-dependent parameters of the model.\nThis closed-form pricing method allows for very fast pricing and calibration to\nmarket data. The overall quality of the approximation is very good, as shown by\nseveral calibration tests on real-world market data where expansion prices are\ncompared favorably with Monte Carlo simulation results.
