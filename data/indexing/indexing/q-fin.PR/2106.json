These derivatives are not always available, creating a need for\nCDS approximations. This paper offers a simple, global and transparent CDS\nstructural approximation, which contrasts with more complex and proprietary\napproximations currently in use. This Equity-to-Credit formula (E2C), inspired\nby CreditGrades, obtains better CDS approximations, according to empirical\nanalyses based on a large sample spanning 2016-2018. A random forest regression\nrun with this E2C formula and selected additional financial data results in an\n87.3% out-of-sample accuracy in CDS approximations. The transparency property\nof this algorithm confirms the predominance of the E2C estimate, and the impact\nof companies' debt rating and size, in predicting their CDS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jun 2021 09:38:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Mercadier", "Mathieu", ""], ["Lardy", "Jean-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.07362", "submitter": "Len Patrick Dominic Garces", "authors": "Len Patrick Dominic M.

As the MOL, as with any\nother numerical scheme for PDEs, becomes increasingly complex when higher\ndimensions are involved, we first simplify the problem by transforming the\nexchange option into a call option written on the ratio of the yield processes\nof the two assets. This is achieved by taking the second asset yield process as\nthe numeraire. We also characterize the near-maturity behavior of the early\nexercise boundary of the American exchange option and analyze how model\nparameters affect this behavior. Using the MOL scheme, we conduct a numerical\ncomparative static analysis of exchange option prices with respect to the model\nparameters and investigate the impact of stochastic volatility and jumps to\noption prices. We also consider the effect of boundary conditions at\nfar-but-finite limits of the computational domain on the overall efficiency of\nthe MOL scheme. Toward these objectives, a brief exposition of the MOL and how\nit can be implemented on computing software are provided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jun 2021 12:43:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Garces", "Len Patrick Dominic M.", ""], ["Cheang", "Gerald H.

The standard approach to their numerical evaluation is\nvia finite differences. Most exotic derivatives are priced via Monte Carlo\nsimulation: in these cases, it is hard to find a fast and accurate\napproximation of Greeks, mainly because of the need of a tradeoff between bias\nand variance. Recent improvements in Greeks computation, such as Adjoint\nAlgorithmic Differentiation, are unfortunately uneffective on second order\nGreeks (such as Gamma), which are plagued by the most significant\ninstabilities, so that a viable alternative to standard finite differences is\nstill lacking. We apply Chebyshev interpolation techniques to the computation\nof spot Greeks, showing how to improve the stability of finite difference\nGreeks of arbitrary order, in a simple and general way.
