In the first part we consider the theory\nof time-inhomogeneous affine processes on general state spaces. We present a\nconcise setup for time-inhomogeneous Markov processes. For stochastically\ncontinuous affine processes we show that there always exists a c\\`adl\\`ag\nmodification. Afterwards we consider the regularity and the semimartingale\nproperty of affine processes. Contrary to the time-homogeneous case,\ntime-inhomogeneous affine processes are in general neither regular nor\nsemimartingales and the time-inhomogeneous case raises many new and interesting\nquestions. Assuming that an affine process is a semimartingale, we show that\neven without regularity the parameter functions satisfy generalized Riccati\nintegral equations. This generalizes an important result for time-homogeneous\naffine processes. We also show that stochastically continuous affine\nsemimartingales are essentially generated by deterministic time-changes of what\nwe call absolutely continuously affine semimartingales. These processes\ngeneralize time-homogeneous regular affine processes.\n  In the second part we consider the class of affine LIBOR market models. We\ncontribute to this class of models in two ways. First, we modify the original\nsetup of the affine LIBOR market models in such a way that next to nonnegative\naffine processes real-valued affine processes can also be used. Numerical\nexamples show that this allows for more flexible implied volatility surfaces.\nSecond, we introduce the class of affine inflation market models, an extension\nof the affine LIBOR market models. A calibration example shows that these\nmodels perform very well in fitting market-observed prices of inflation\nderivatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2015 15:44:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Waldenberger", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.04741", "submitter": "Damiano  Brigo", "authors": "Damiano Brigo, Camilla Pisani, Francesco Rapisarda", "title": "The Multivariate Mixture Dynamics Model: Shifted dynamics and\n  correlation skew", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Multi Variate Mixture Dynamics model is a tractable, dynamical,\narbitrage-free multivariate model characterized by transparency on the\ndependence structure, since closed form formulae for terminal correlations,\naverage correlations and copula function are available. It also allows for\ncomplete decorrelation between assets and instantaneous variances.

The same property holds for the multivariate process of all assets,\nwhose density is a mixture of multivariate basic densities.

We investigate whether the\nmodel is able to consistently reproduce the implied volatility of FX cross\nrates once the single components are calibrated to univariate shifted lognormal\nmixture dynamics models. We consider in particular the case of the Chinese\nrenminbi FX rate, showing that the shifted MVMD model correctly recovers the\nCNY/EUR smile given the EUR/USD smile and the USD/CNY smile, thus highlighting\nthat the model can also work as an arbitrage free volatility smile\nextrapolation tool for cross currencies that may not be liquid or fully\nobservable. We compare the performance of the shifted MVMD model in terms of\nimplied correlation with those of the shifted Simply Correlated Mixture\nDynamics model where the dynamics of the single assets are connected naively by\nintroducing correlation among their Brownian motions.

In this situation currency fluctuations clearly introduce a\nsource of risk on CDS spreads. For emerging markets, but in some cases even in\nwell developed markets, the risk of dramatic Foreign Exchange (FX) rate\ndevaluation in conjunction with default events is relevant. We address this\nissue by proposing and implementing a model that considers the risk of foreign\ncurrency devaluation that is synchronous with default of the reference entity.\n  Preliminary results indicate that perceived risks of devaluation can induce a\nsignificant basis across domestic and foreign CDS quotes. For the Republic of\nItaly, a USD CDS spread quote of 440 bps can translate into a EUR quote of 350\nbps in the middle of the Euro-debt crisis in the first week of May 2012. More\nrecently, from June 2013, the basis spreads between the EUR quotes and the USD\nquotes are in the range around 40 bps.\n  We explain in detail the sources for such discrepancies. Our modeling\napproach is based on the reduced form framework for credit risk, where the\ndefault time is modeled in a Cox process setting with explicit diffusion\ndynamics for default intensity/hazard rate and exponential jump to default. For\nthe FX part, we include an explicit default-driven jump in the FX dynamics. As\nour results show, such a mechanism provides a further and more effective way to\nmodel credit / FX dependency than the instantaneous correlation that can be\nimposed among the driving Brownian motions of default intensity and FX rates,\nas it is not possible to explain the observed basis spreads during the\nEuro-debt crisis by using the latter mechanism alone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 21:00:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Jan 2018 15:23:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Pede", "Nicola", ""], ["Petrelli", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.07337", "submitter": "Wujiang Lou", "authors": "Wujiang Lou", "title": "MVA Transfer Pricing", "comments": "18 pages, 6 tables, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Risk, July 2016, pp 72-77", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article prices OTC derivatives with either an exogenously determined\ninitial margin profile or endogenously approximated initial margin.
