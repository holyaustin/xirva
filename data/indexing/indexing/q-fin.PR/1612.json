When there is this kind of\nconcentration in the market, the position impacts the pricings of all other\nderivatives and changes the behaviour of the underlying volatility in a\nnonlinear way. We model this effect using Heston's stochastic volatility model\nmodified to take into account the impact. The impact can be incorporated into\nthe model using a special product called a market driver, potentially with a\nlarge face value, affecting the underlying volatility itself. We derive a\nrevised version of Heston's partial differential equation which is to be\nsatisfied by arbitrary derivatives products in the market. This enables us to\nobtain valuations that reflect the actual market and helps traders identify the\nrisks and hold appropriate assets to correctly hedge against the impact of the\nmarket driver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 18:12:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Maeda", "Jun", ""], ["Jacka", "Saul D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00828", "submitter": "Svetlozar Rachev", "authors": "Abootaleb Shirvani, Stoyan V.

It is\nassumed that the riskless asset and the risky asset are traded continuously in\ntime and that the market is frictionless. In this paper, we propose a new\nmethod for hedging derivatives assuming that a hedger should not always rely on\ntrading existing assets that are used to form a linear portfolio comprised of\nthe risky asset, the riskless asset, and standard derivatives, but rather\nshould design a set of specific, most-suited financial instruments for the\nhedging problem. We introduce a sequence of new financial instruments best\nsuited for hedging jump-diffusion and stochastic volatility market models. The\nnew instruments we introduce are perpetual derivatives. More specifically, they\nare options with perpetual maturities. In a financial market where perpetual\nderivatives are introduced, there is a new set of partial and partial-integro\ndifferential equations for pricing derivatives. Our analysis demonstrates that\nthe set of new financial instruments together with a risk measure called the\ntail-loss ratio measure defined by the new instrument's return series can be\npotentially used as an early warning system for a market crash.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:33:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 04:49:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Shirvani", "Abootaleb", ""], ["Stoyanov", "Stoyan V.", ""], ["Rachev", "Svetlozar T.", ""], ["Fabozzi", "Frank J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.01979", "submitter": "Svetlozar Rachev", "authors": "Y.
