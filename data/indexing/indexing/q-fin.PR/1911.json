Our newly developed model features not only in\nterms with a controlling shareholder who diverts a fraction of the output, but\nalso good (or bad) memory in his budget dynamics which can be well-calibrated\nby a pathwise way from the historical data. We find that poorer investor\nprotection leads to higher stock holdings of controlling holders, lower gross\nstock returns, lower interest rates, and lower modified stock volatilities if\nthe ownership concentration is sufficiently high. More importantly, by\nestablishing an approximation scheme for good (bad) memory of investors on the\nhistorical market information, we conclude that good (bad) memory would\nincrease (decrease) aforementioned dynamics and reveal that good (bad) memory\nstrengthens (weakens) investor protection for minority shareholder when the\nownership concentration is sufficiently high, while good (bad) memory inversely\nweakens (strengthens) investor protection for minority shareholder when the\nownership concentration is sufficiently low. Our model's implications are\nconsistent with a number of interesting facts documented in the recent\nliterature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2019 09:59:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2020 07:39:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Yue", "Jia", ""], ["Yang", "Ben-Zhang", ""], ["Wang", "Ming-Hui", ""], ["Huang", "Nan-Jing", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.02906", "submitter": "Guillaume Szulda", "authors": "Claudio Fontana, Alessandro Gnoatto, and Guillaume Szulda", "title": "Multiple yield curve modelling with CBI processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a modelling framework for multiple yield curves driven by\ncontinuous-state branching processes with immigration (CBI processes).\nExploiting the self-exciting behavior of CBI jump processes, this approach can\nreproduce the relevant empirical features of spreads between different\ninterbank rates.

The policyholder makes an upfront payment to the insurance\ncompany and, in return, the insurer is required to make a series of payments\nstarting at an agreed upon date. For a higher premium, many insurance companies\noffer additional guarantees or options which protect policyholders from various\nmarket risks. This research is centered around two of these options: the\nguaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) and the reset option. The sensitivity\nof various parameters on the value of the GMIB is explored, particularly the\nguaranteed payment rate set by the insurer. Additionally, a critical value for\nfuture interest rates is calculated to determine the rationality of exercising\nthe reset option. This will be able to provide insight to both the policyholder\nand policy writer on how their future projections on the performance of the\nstock market and interest rates should guide their respective actions of\nexercising and pricing variable annuity options. This can help provide details\ninto the value of adding options to a variable annuity for companies that are\nlooking to make variable annuity policies more attractive in a competitive\nmarket.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Nov 2019 14:30:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Riley", ""], ["Ocejo", "Adriana", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.09441", "submitter": "Olga Rozanova", "authors": "Sergey I.
