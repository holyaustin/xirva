Our approach respects the basic economic\nrequirement that LIBOR rates are non-negative, and the basic requirement from\nmathematical finance that LIBOR rates are analytically tractable martingales\nwith respect to their own forward measure. Additionally, and most importantly,\nour approach also leads to analytically tractable expressions of multi-LIBOR\npayoffs. This approach unifies therefore the advantages of well-known forward\nprice models with those of classical LIBOR rate models. Several examples are\nadded and prototypical volatility smiles are shown. We believe that the\nCIR-process based LIBOR model might be of particular interest for applications,\nsince closed form valuation formulas for caps and swaptions are derived.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Apr 2009 11:49:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2010 23:02:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 14 Feb 2010 20:20:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 5 Oct 2010 13:31:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 21 Jul 2011 19:42:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Keller-Ressel", "Martin", ""], ["Papapantoleon", "Antonis", ""], ["Teichmann", "Josef", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1074", "submitter": "Gregory Rayee RG", "authors": "Fr\\'ed\\'eric Bossens, Gr\\'egory Ray\\'ee, Nikos S.
