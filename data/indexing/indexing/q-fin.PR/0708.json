Based on a dynamic programming\nformulation and associated properties of the value function, we study in this\npaper a class of control that we call switch-over policies -- start from\naccepting only orders of the highest price, and switch to including lower\nprices as time goes by, with the switch-over times optimally decided via convex\nprogramming. We establish the asymptotic optimality of the switch-over policy,\nand develop pricing models based on this policy to optimize the price\nreductions over the decision horizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2007 16:38:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Grace", ""], ["Lu", "Yingdong", ""], ["Yao", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1568", "submitter": "Ljudmila A.
