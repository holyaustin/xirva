(2009) to compute option prices. We name it the SINC\napproach. While the COS method by Fang and Osterlee (2009) leverages the\nFourier-cosine expansion of truncated densities, the SINC approach builds on\nthe Shannon Sampling Theorem revisited for functions with bounded support. We\nprovide several results which were missing in the early derivation: i) a\nrigorous proof of the convergence of the SINC formula to the correct option\nprice when the support grows and the number of Fourier frequencies increases;\nii) ready to implement formulas for put, Cash-or-Nothing, and Asset-or-Nothing\noptions; iii) a systematic comparison with the COS formula for several\nlog-price models; iv) a numerical challenge against alternative Fast Fourier\nspecifications, such as Carr and Madan (1999) and Lewis (2000); v) an extensive\npricing exercise under the rough Heston model of Jaisson and Rosenbaum (2015);\nvi) formulas to evaluate numerically the moments of a truncated density. The\nadvantages of the SINC approach are numerous. When compared to benchmark\nmethodologies, SINC provides the most accurate and fast pricing computation.\nThe method naturally lends itself to price all options in a smile concurrently\nby means of Fast Fourier techniques, boosting fast calibration. Pricing\nrequires to resort only to odd moments in the Fourier space.
