Such models are used in financial practice\nas parametric versions of the Markov functional model, or as approximations to\nthe log-normal Libor market model. We show that the model has two distinct\nregimes, at high and low volatilities, with different qualitative behavior. The\ntwo regimes are separated by a sharp transition, which is similar to a phase\ntransition in condensed matter physics. We study the behavior of the model in\nthe large volatility phase, and discuss the implications of the phase\ntransition for the pricing of interest rate derivatives. In the large\nvolatility phase, certain expectation values and convexity adjustments have an\nexplosive behavior. For sufficiently low volatilities the caplet smile is\nlog-normal to a very good approximation, while in the large volatility phase\nthe model develops a non-trivial caplet skew. The phenomenon discussed here\nimposes thus an upper limit on the volatilities for which the model behaves as\nintended.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Apr 2011 15:44:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Apr 2011 12:15:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 00:37:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 17:34:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pirjol", "Dan", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1855", "submitter": "Masaaki Fujii", "authors": "Masaaki Fujii, Akihiko Takahashi", "title": "Collateralized CDS and Default Dependence", "comments": "16pages, 2 fugures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we have studied the pricing of a continuously collateralized\nCDS.
