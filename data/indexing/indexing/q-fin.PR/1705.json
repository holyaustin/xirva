The literature contains an\nabundant amount of research works that have studied the computation of these\nimportant values.

Moreover, to our best\nknowledge, they compute only the first order price sensitivities. Some works\nthat attempt to extend to markets affected by financial crisis appeared\nrecently. However, none of these papers deal with the calculation of the price\nsensitivities of second order. Providing second derivatives for the underlying\nprice sensitivities is an important issue in financial risk management because\nthe investor can determine whether or not each source of risk is increasing at\nan increasing rate. In this paper, we work on the computation of second order\nprices sensitivities for a market under crisis. The underlying second order\nprice sensitivities are derived explicitly. The obtained formulas are expected\nto improve on the accuracy of the hedging strategies during a financial crunch.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 May 2017 10:49:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Jan 2018 17:08:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["El-Khatib", "Youssef", ""], ["Hatemi-J", "Abdulnasser", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.02933", "submitter": "David J.
