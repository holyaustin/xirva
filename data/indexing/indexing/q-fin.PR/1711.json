Out-of-sample hedge simulations\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of real world valuation.\n  In contrast to risk neutral valuation, which is a form of relative valuation,\nthe long term average excess return of the equity market comes into play.\nInstead of the savings account, the num\\'eraire portfolio is employed as the\nfundamental unit of value in the analysis. The num\\'eraire portfolio is the\nstrictly positive, tradable portfolio that when used as benchmark makes all\nbenchmarked nonnegative portfolios supermartingales. The benchmarked real world\nvalue of a benchmarked contingent claim equals its real world conditional\nexpectation. This yields the minimal possible value for its hedgeable part and\nminimizes the fluctuations for its benchmarked hedge error. Under classical\nassumptions, actuarial and risk neutral valuation emerge as special cases of\nthe proposed real world valuation. In long term liability and asset valuation,\nthe proposed real world valuation can lead to significantly lower values than\nsuggested by classical approaches when an equivalent risk neutral probability\nmeasure does not exist.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Nov 2017 02:58:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Fergusson", "Kevin", ""], ["Platen", "Eckhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.03078", "submitter": "Antoine Jacquier Dr.", "authors": "Blanka Horvath, Antoine Jacquier, Aitor Muguruza", "title": "Functional central limit theorems for rough volatility", "comments": "30 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend Donsker's approximation of Brownian motion to fractional Brownian\nmotion with Hurst exponent $H \\in (0,1)$ and to Volterra-like processes.

In particular, curtailable block orders and the\nuniform purchase price (UPP) pose serious difficulties. A block is an order\nthat spans over multiple hours, and can be either fully accepted or fully\nrejected. The UPP prescribes that all consumers pay a common price, i.e., the\nUPP, in all the zones, while producers receive zonal prices, which can differ\nfrom one zone to another.\n  The market clearing problem in the presence of both the UPP and block orders\nis a major open issue in the European context. The UPP scheme leads to a\nnon-linear optimization problem involving both primal and dual variables,\nwhereas block orders introduce multi-temporal constraints and binary variables\ninto the problem. As a consequence, the market clearing problem in the presence\nof both blocks and the UPP can be regarded as a non-linear integer programming\nproblem involving both primal and dual variables with complementary and\nmulti-temporal constraints.\n  The aim of this paper is to present a non-iterative and heuristic-free\napproach for solving the market clearing problem in the presence of both\ncurtailable block orders and the UPP. The solution is exact, with no\napproximation up to the level of resolution of current market data. By\nresorting to an equivalent UPP formulation, the proposed approach results in a\nmixed-integer linear program, which is built starting from a non-linear integer\nbilevel programming problem. Numerical results using real market data are\nreported to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
