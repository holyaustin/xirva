To\nbetter understand the challenge in distinguishing investors' beliefs from\nrisk-adjusted discounting, we use Perron-Frobenius Theory to isolate a positive\nmartingale component of the stochastic discount factor process. This component\nrecovers a probability measure that absorbs long-term risk adjustments. When\nthe martingale is not degenerate, surmising that this recovered probability\ncaptures investors' beliefs distorts inference about risk-return tradeoffs.\nStochastic discount factors in many structural models of asset prices have\nempirically relevant martingale components.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 22:16:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jul 2015 15:38:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 4 Oct 2015 20:43:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Borovi\u010dka", "Jaroslav", ""], ["Hansen", "Lars Peter", ""], ["Scheinkman", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.0148", "submitter": "Miha Troha Mr", "authors": "Miha Troha and Raphael Hauser", "title": "The impact of startup costs and the grid operator on the power price\n  equilibrium", "comments": "Corrected paragraph style on page 16. arXiv admin note: substantial\n  text overlap with arXiv:1409.6645", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose a quadratic programming model that can be used for\ncalculating the term structure of electricity prices while explicitly modeling\nstartup costs of power plants.
