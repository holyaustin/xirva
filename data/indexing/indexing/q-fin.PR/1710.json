In particular,\nwe consider models that assume that an appropriate random time serves as a\nproxy for anything that causes the ESO's holder to exercise the option early,\nnamely, reflects the ESO holder's job termination risk as well as early\nexercise behaviour. In this context, we study the problem of ESO valuation by\nmeans of mean-variance hedging. Our analysis is based on dynamic programming\nand uses PDE techniques. We also express the ESO's value that we derive as the\nexpected discounted payoff that the ESO yields with respect to an equivalent\nmartingale measure, which does not coincide with the minimal martingale measure\nor the variance-optimal measure. Furthermore, we present a numerical study that\nillustrates aspects or our theoretical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Oct 2017 20:35:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kladivko", "Kamil", ""], ["Zervos", "Mihail", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01141", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "title": "A series representation for the Black-Scholes formula", "comments": "v1-2, 13 pages, some details added. arXiv admin note: text overlap\n  with arXiv:1609.00987", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove and test an efficient series representation for the European\nBlack-Scholes call, which generalizes and refines previously known\napproximations, and works in every market configuration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 13:24:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 14:01:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Aguilar", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.03160", "submitter": "Lingjiong Zhu", "authors": "Dan Pirjol, Jing Wang, Lingjiong Zhu", "title": "Short Maturity Forward Start Asian Options in Local Volatility Models", "comments": "43 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematical Finance 2019, Vol. 26, No. 3, 187-221", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the short maturity asymptotics for prices of forward start Asian\noptions under the assumption that the underlying asset follows a local\nvolatility model.
