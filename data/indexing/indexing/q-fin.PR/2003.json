In a\nfirst phase, the method relies on the Deep Optimal Stopping algorithm, which\nlearns the optimal stopping rule from Monte-Carlo samples of the underlying\nrisk factors. Cashflow-paths are then created by applying the learned stopping\nstrategy on a new set of realizations of the risk factors. Furthermore, in a\nsecond phase the risk factors are regressed against the cashflow-paths to\nobtain approximations of pathwise option values. The regression step is carried\nout by ordinary least squares as well as neural networks, and it is shown that\nthe latter produces more accurate approximations.\n  The expected exposure is formulated, both in terms of the cashflow-paths and\nin terms of the pathwise option values and it is shown that a simple\nMonte-Carlo average yields accurate approximations in both cases. The potential\nfuture exposure is estimated by the empirical $\\alpha$-percentile.\n  Finally, it is shown that the expected exposures, as well as the potential\nfuture exposures can be computed under either, the risk neutral measure, or the\nreal world measure, without having to re-train the neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2020 10:08:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2020 16:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2020 13:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Andersson", "Kristoffer", ""], ["Oosterlee", "Cornelis", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.03403", "submitter": "Chris Kenyon", "authors": "Chris Kenyon, Mourad Berrahoui and Benjamin Poncet", "title": "Model independent WWR for regulatory CVA and for accounting CVA and FVA", "comments": "17 pages, 4 figues, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Wrong way risk (WWR) is a consideration for regulatory capital for credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA).

The starting point is an arbitrage-free bond market\nunder volatility uncertainty. The uncertainty about the volatility is modeled\nby a G-Brownian motion, which drives the forward rate dynamics. The absence of\narbitrage is ensured by a drift condition. Such a setting leads to a sublinear\npricing measure for additional contracts, which yields either a single price or\na range of prices. Similar to the forward measure approach, we define the\nforward sublinear expectation to simplify the pricing of cashflows. Under the\nforward sublinear expectation, we obtain a robust version of the expectations\nhypothesis and we show how to price bond options. In addition, we develop\npricing methods for contracts consisting of a stream of cashflows, since the\nnonlinearity of the pricing measure implies that we cannot price a stream of\ncashflows by pricing each cashflow separately. With these tools, we derive\nrobust pricing formulas for all major interest rate derivatives. The pricing\nformulas provide a link to the pricing formulas of traditional models without\nvolatility uncertainty and show that volatility uncertainty naturally leads to\nunspanned stochastic volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2020 09:45:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Mar 2021 18:33:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["H\u00f6lzermann", "Julian", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.05095", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Willie Yu", "title": "Machine Learning Treasury Yields", "comments": "68 pages", "journal-ref": "Bulletin of Applied Economics 7(1) (2020) 1-65", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-fin.CP q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give explicit algorithms and source code for extracting factors underlying\nTreasury yields using (unsupervised) machine learning (ML) techniques, such as\nnonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and (statistically deterministic)\nclustering.
