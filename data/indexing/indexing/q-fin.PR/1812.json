As the Kirk\\'s Approximation is extremely flawed in the cases\nwhen the correlation is very high, we explore a recent development that allows\napproximating with simplicity and accuracy the option price. To assess the\ngoodness of fit of the new method, we increase dramatically the number of\nsimulations and scenarios to test the new method and compare it with the\noriginal Kirk\\'s formula. The simulations confirmed that the Modified Kirk\\'s\nApproximation method is extremely accurate, improving Kirk\\'s approach for\ntwo-asset spread options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 08:48:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Harutyunyan", "Suren", ""], ["Borr\u00c0s", "Adri\u00c0 Masip", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.05859", "submitter": "Andrew Papanicolaou", "authors": "Andrew Papanicolaou", "title": "Consistent Inter-Model Specification for Time-Homogeneous SPX Stochastic\n  Volatility and VIX Market Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper shows how to recover stochastic volatility models (SVMs) from\nmarket models for the VIX futures term structure. Market models have more\nflexibility for fitting of curves than do SVMs, and therefore they are\nbetter-suited for pricing VIX futures and derivatives. But the VIX itself is a\nderivative of the S&P500 (SPX) and it is common practice to price SPX\nderivatives using an SVM. Hence, a consistent model for both SPX and VIX\nderivatives would be one where the SVM is obtained by inverting the market\nmodel. This paper's main result is a method for the recovery of a stochastic\nvolatility function as the output of an inverse problem, with the inputs given\nby a VIX futures market model. Analysis will show that some conditions need to\nbe met in order for there to not be any inter-model arbitrage or mis-priced\nderivatives. Given these conditions the inverse problem can be solved. Several\nmodels are analyzed and explored numerically to gain a better understanding of\nthe theory and its limitations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 11:04:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Papanicolaou", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.07415", "submitter": "Konstantin E.
