Therefore, it is motivating to consider how to\nimplement more complex models used in practice in financial institutions. In\nthis paper, we then consider the local volatility (LV) model, in which the\nvolatility of the underlying asset price depends on the price and time. We\npresent two types of implementation. One is the register-per-RN way, which is\nadopted in most of previous papers. In this way, each of random numbers (RNs)\nrequired to generate a path of the asset price is generated on a separated\nregister, so the required qubit number increases in proportion to the number of\nRNs. The other is the PRN-on-a-register way, which is proposed in the author's\nprevious work. In this way, a sequence of pseudo-random numbers (PRNs)\ngenerated on a register is used to generate paths of the asset price, so the\nrequired qubit number is reduced with a trade-off against circuit depth. We\npresent circuit diagrams for these two implementations in detail and estimate\nrequired resources: qubit number and T-count.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2020 02:54:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Kaneko", "Kazuya", ""], ["Miyamoto", "Koichi", ""], ["Takeda", "Naoyuki", ""], ["Yoshino", "Kazuyoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.01511", "submitter": "Hyong-Chol O", "authors": "Hyong Chol O, Tae Song Kim", "title": "Analysis on the Pricing model for a Discrete Coupon Bond with Early\n  redemption provision by the Structural Approach", "comments": "30 pages, 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, using the structural approach is derived a mathematical model\nof the discrete coupon bond with the provision that allow the holder to demand\nearly redemption at any coupon dates prior to the maturity and based on this\nmodel is provided some analysis including min-max and gradient estimates of the\nbond price.

That is, a risk-neutralizing trading strategy\ncannot be performed. This is the case, when one is in need of a risk-free\n(default-free) discounting, but default protection on funding providers is not\ntraded. For this case, we introduce a default compensation factor\n($\\exp(+\\tilde{\\lambda} T)$) that describes the present value of a strategy to\ncompensate for default (like buying default protection would do).\n  In a second part, we introduce a model, where the survival probability\ndepends on the required notional. This model is different from the classical\nmodelling of a time-dependent survival probability ($\\exp(-\\lambda T)$). The\nmodel especially allows that large liquidity requirements are instantly more\nlikely do default than small ones.\n  Combined the two approaches build a framework in which discounting\n(valuation) is non-linear.\n  The non-linear discounting presented here has several effects, which are\nrelevant in various applications:\n  * If we consider the question of default-free valuation, i.e., factoring in\nthe cost of default protection, the framework can will lead to\nover-proportional higher values (or cost) for large projects (or damages). The\nframework can lead to the effect that discount-factors for very large liquidity\nrequirements or projects are an increasing function of time. It may even lead\nto discount factors larger than one. This may have relevance in the assessment\nof event like climate change.\n  * For the valuation of defaultable products, e.g., like a defaultable swap,\nthe framework leads to the generation of a continuum of (defaultable) par rate\ncurves (interest rate curve) and the valuation of a payer and a receiver swap\ndiffers by more than just a sign.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Jul 2020 15:57:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2020 09:21:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Fries", "Christian P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.07701", "submitter": "Alessandro Ramponi", "authors": "Fabio Antonelli, Alessandro Ramponi, Sergio Scarlatti", "title": "Approximate XVA for European claims", "comments": "24 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of computing the Value Adjustment of European\ncontingent claims when default of either party is considered, possibly\nincluding also funding and collateralization requirements.
