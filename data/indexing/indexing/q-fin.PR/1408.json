We call this market model a semi-Markov modulated market. Although a\nwellposedness result of that problem is available in the literature, but this\nrecent paper has a different proof. Here the existence of solution is\nestablished without invoking mild solution technique. We study the\nwell-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem via a Volterra integral\nequation of second kind. The method of conditioning on stopping times was used\nonly for showing uniqueness. Furthermore, in the present study we find an\nintegral representation of the PDE problem which enables us to find a robust\nnumerical scheme to compute derivative of the solution. This study paves for\naddressing many other interesting problems involving this new set of PDEs. Some\nderivations of external cash flow corresponding to an optimal strategy are\npresented. These quantities are extremely important when dealing with an\nincomplete market. Apart from these, the risk measures for discrete trading are\nformulated which may be of interest to the practitioners.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 11:15:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Goswami", "Anindya", ""], ["Patel", "Jeeten", ""], ["Sevgaonkar", "Poorva", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6513", "submitter": "Andrey Itkin", "authors": "Andrey Itkin and Alexander Lipton", "title": "Efficient solution of structural default models with correlated jumps\n  and mutual obligations", "comments": "43 pages, 18 figures, 8 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.MF q-fin.PR q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The structural default model of Lipton and Sepp, 2009 is generalized for a\nset of banks with mutual interbank liabilities whose assets are driven by\ncorrelated Levy processes with idiosyncratic and common components.

This method is\nunconditionally stable and of the second order of approximation in space and\ntime; in addition, for many popular Levy models it has linear complexity in\neach dimension.
