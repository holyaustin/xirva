In this paper we study in detail the problem of\npricing this kind of derivatives, for the most popular flavour, within a\nframework in which some of the properties |volatility and dividend policy| of\nthe underlying stock can change at a random instant of time, but in such a way\nthat we can forecast their final values. Under this assumption we can model\nactual market conditions because most relevant facts usually entail sharp\npredictable consequences. The effect of this potential risk on perpetual\nAmerican vanilla options is remarkable: the very equation that will determine\nthe fair price depends on the solution to be found. Sound results are found\nunder the optics both of finance and physics.
