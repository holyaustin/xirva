Systematic mortality risk is due to the uncertain\ndevelopment of future mortality intensities, or {\\it hazard rates}. In this\npaper, we develop a theory for pricing pure endowments when hedging with a\nmortality forward is allowed. The hazard rate associated with the pure\nendowment and the reference hazard rate for the mortality forward are\ncorrelated and are modeled by diffusion processes. We price the pure endowment\nby assuming that the issuing company hedges its contract with the mortality\nforward and requires compensation for the unhedgeable part of the mortality\nrisk in the form of a pre-specified instantaneous Sharpe ratio. The major\nresult of this paper is that the value per contract solves a linear partial\ndifferential equation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can\nrepresent the limiting price as an expectation under an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that hedging with the mortality forward\nmay raise or lower the price of this pure endowment comparing to its price\nwithout hedging, as determined in Bayraktar et al. [2009]. The market price of\nthe reference mortality risk and the correlation between the two portfolios\njointly determine the cost of hedging. We demonstrate our results using\nnumerical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 04:34:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Ting", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.0828", "submitter": "Andrea Pallavicini Mr", "authors": "Nicola Moreni and Andrea Pallavicini", "title": "Parsimonious HJM Modelling for Multiple Yield-Curve Dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For a long time interest-rate models were built on a single yield curve used\nboth for discounting and forwarding.
