In this way various types of\nbarrier options are priced, including barrier options paying rebates, and\noptions on dividend-paying-stocks. Moreover, the barriers may be monitored\neither continuously or discretely. In addition to the high-order accuracy of\nthe scheme, and the stretching effect of the coordinate transformation, the\nmain feature of this approach lies on a probability-based optimal determination\nof boundary conditions. This leads to much faster and accurate results when\ncompared with similar pricing approaches. The strength of the present scheme is\nparticularly demonstrated in the valuation of discretely monitored barrier\noptions where it yields values closest to those obtained from the only\nsemi-analytical valuation method available.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2007 12:37:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ndogmo", "J.

The problem of modelling and\npricing such an asset and associated derivatives is important, for example, in\nthe determination of optimal insurance claims reserve policies, and in the\npricing of reinsurance contracts. In the insurance setting, the aggregate\nclaims play the role of the cumulative gains, and the terminal cash flow\nrepresents the totality of the claims payable for the given accounting period.\nA similar example arises when we consider the accumulation of losses in a\ncredit portfolio, and value a contract that pays an amount equal to the\ntotality of the losses over a given time interval. An explicit expression for\nthe value process is obtained. The price of an Arrow-Debreu security on the\ncumulative gains process is determined, and is used to obtain a closed-form\nexpression for the price of a European-style option on the value of the asset.\nThe results obtained make use of various remarkable properties of the gamma\nbridge process, and are applicable to a wide variety of financial products\nbased on cumulative gains processes such as aggregate claims, credit portfolio\nlosses, defined-benefit pension schemes, emissions, and rainfall.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2007 11:12:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.2792", "submitter": "Jan Ob{\\l}\\'oj", "authors": "Mark Davis and Jan Obloj", "title": "Market completion using options", "comments": "Keywords, AMS Classification and some further specific comments about\n  results from PDEs added.
