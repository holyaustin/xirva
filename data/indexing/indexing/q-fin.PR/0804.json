In the first part,\nwe focus on the theory of L\\'{e}vy processes. We analyze a `toy' example of a\nL\\'{e}vy process, viz. a L\\'{e}vy jump-diffusion, which yet offers significant\ninsight into the distributional and path structure of a L\\'{e}vy process. Then,\nwe present several important results about L\\'{e}vy processes, such as infinite\ndivisibility and the L\\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula, the L\\'{e}vy-It\\^{o}\ndecomposition, the It\\^{o} formula for L\\'{e}vy processes and Girsanov's\ntransformation. Some (sketches of) proofs are presented, still the majority of\nproofs is omitted and the reader is referred to textbooks instead. In the\nsecond part, we turn our attention to the applications of L\\'{e}vy processes in\nfinancial modeling and option pricing. We discuss how the price process of an\nasset can be modeled using L\\'{e}vy processes and give a brief account of\nmarket incompleteness. Popular models in the literature are presented and\nrevisited from the point of view of L\\'{e}vy processes, and we also discuss\nthree methods for pricing financial derivatives. Finally, some indicative\nevidence from applications to market data is presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Apr 2008 06:47:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2008 17:57:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Papapantoleon", "Antonis", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.2561", "submitter": "Asma Meziou", "authors": "Nicole El Karoui, Asma Meziou", "title": "Max-Plus decomposition of supermartingales and convex order.
