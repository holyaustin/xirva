This is an\nincomplete market, often called a basis risk model. The market agent's risk\npreferences are modelled using a so-called forward performance process (forward\nutility), which is a time-decreasing utility of exponential type. Moreover, the\nmarket agent (investor) does not know with certainty the values of the asset\nprice drifts. This market setting with drift parameter uncertainty is the\npartial information scenario. We discuss the stochastic control problem\nobtained by setting up the hedging portfolio and derive the optimal hedging\nstrategy. Furthermore, a (dual) forward indifference price representation of\nthe claim and its PDE are obtained. With these results, the residual risk\nprocess representing the basis risk (hedging error), pay-off decompositions and\nasymptotic expansions of the indifference price in the European case are\nderived. We develop the analogous stochastic control and stopping problem with\nan American claim and obtain the corresponding forward indifference price\nvaluation formula.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2021 15:18:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tahvildari", "Mahan", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00299", "submitter": "Andrew Papanicolaou", "authors": "Andrew Papanicolaou", "title": "Extreme-Strike Comparisons and Structural Bounds for SPX and VIX Options", "comments": "Special Thank You to Roger Lee for your help in this paper", "journal-ref": "SIAM Journal on Financial Mathematics (2018) Vol. 9, No, 3, pp.\n  401-434", "doi": "10.1137/141001615", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article explores the relationship between the SPX and VIX options\nmarkets.
