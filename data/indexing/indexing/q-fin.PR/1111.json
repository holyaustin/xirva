The theory of such models simplifies considerably if one takes a\npricing kernel approach. In one dimension, once the underlying L\\'evy process\nhas been specified, the GLM has four parameters: the initial price, the\ninterest rate, the volatility, and the risk aversion. The pricing kernel is the\nproduct of a discount factor and a risk aversion martingale. For GBM, the risk\naversion parameter is the market price of risk. For a GLM, this interpretation\nis not valid: the excess rate of return is a nonlinear function of the\nvolatility and the risk aversion. It is shown that for positive volatility and\nrisk aversion the excess rate of return above the interest rate is positive,\nand is increasing with respect to these variables. In the case of foreign\nexchange, Siegel's paradox implies that one can construct foreign exchange\nmodels for which the excess rate of return is positive both for the exchange\nrate and the inverse exchange rate. This condition is shown to hold for any\ngeometric L\\'evy model for foreign exchange in which volatility exceeds risk\naversion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 10:45:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jan 2012 12:58:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Mackie", "Ewan", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.2462", "submitter": "Peter K.
