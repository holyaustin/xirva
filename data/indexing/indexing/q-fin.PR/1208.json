All investors aim to maximize the expected utility from terminal\nwealth, on a financial market where the risky asset price is exposed to a\nsudden loss at the default time of the counterparty.

In general, the insider achieves a larger value of expected\nutility than the standard investor.

The results hereafter shed new light on the connection\nbetween both the volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters\nand the behavior of ATM option prices near expiration. In the presence of a\nBrownian component, the second-order term, in time-$t$, is of the form\n$d_{2}\\,t^{(3-Y)/2}$, with $d_{2}$ only depending on $Y$, the degree of jump\nactivity, on $\\sigma$, the volatility of the continuous component, and on an\nadditional parameter controlling the intensity of the \"small\" jumps (regardless\nof their signs). This extends the well known result that the leading\nfirst-order term is $\\sigma t^{1/2}/\\sqrt{2\\pi}$. In contrast, under a\npure-jump model, the dependence on $Y$ and on the separate intensities of\nnegative and positive small jumps are already reflected in the leading term,\nwhich is of the form $d_{1}t^{1/Y}$. The second-order term is shown to be of\nthe form $\\tilde{d}_{2} t$ and, therefore, its order of decay turns out to be\nindependent of $Y$. The asymptotic behavior of the corresponding Black-Scholes\nimplied volatilities is also addressed. Our approach is sufficiently general to\ncover a wide class of L\\'{e}vy processes which satisfy the latter property and\nwhose L\\'{e}vy densitiy can be closely approximated by a stable density near\nthe origin. Our numerical results show that the first-order term typically\nexhibits rather poor performance and that the second-order term can\nsignificantly improve the approximation's accuracy, particularly in the absence\nof a Brownian component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2012 22:06:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2013 22:35:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 23:17:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 04:49:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 5 Apr 2014 21:29:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Figueroa-L\u00f3pez", "Jos\u00e9 E.", ""], ["Gong", "Ruoting", ""], ["Houdr\u00e9", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5802", "submitter": "Matthew Lorig", "authors": "Jean-Pierre Fouque, Matthew Lorig, Ronnie Sircar", "title": "Second Order Multiscale Stochastic Volatility Asymptotics: Stochastic\n  Terminal Layer Analysis & Calibration", "comments": "34 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Multiscale stochastic volatility models have been developed as an efficient\nway to capture the principle effects on derivative pricing and portfolio\noptimization of randomly varying volatility.
