Our\nvaluation formula satisfies a number of desirable properties, many of which it\nshares with the standard deviation premium principle. The major result of the\npaper is that the price per contract solves a linear partial differential\nequation as the number of contracts approaches infinity. One can interpret the\nlimiting price as an expectation with respect to an equivalent martingale\nmeasure. Another important result is that if the hazard rate is stochastic,\nthen the risk-adjusted premium is greater than the net premium, even as the\nnumber of contracts approaches infinity. We present a numerical example to\nillustrate our results, along with the corresponding algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 May 2007 14:11:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1302", "submitter": "Virginia Young", "authors": "Moshe A.
