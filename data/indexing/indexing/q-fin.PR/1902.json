We train our neural network models\nunder different number of layers, neurons per layer, and various different\nactivation functions in order to find which combinations work better\nempirically. For training, we consider various different loss functions and\noptimization routines. We demonstrate that deep neural networks exponentially\nexpedite option pricing compared to commonly used option pricing methods which\nconsequently make calibration and parameter estimation super fast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2019 13:51:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hirsa", "Ali", ""], ["Karatas", "Tugce", ""], ["Oskoui", "Amir", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06053", "submitter": "Vassilis Polimenis", "authors": "Vassilis Polimenis and Ioannis Neokosmidis", "title": "Non-Stationary Dividend-Price Ratios", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1057/s41260-019-00143-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dividend yields have been widely used in previous research to relate stock\nmarket valuations to cash flow fundamentals. However, this approach relies on\nthe assumption that dividend yields are stationary. Due to the failure to\nreject the hypothesis of a unit root in the classical dividend-price ratio for\nthe US stock market, Polimenis and Neokosmidis (2016) proposed the use of a\nmodified dividend price ratio (mdp) as the deviation between d and p from their\nlong run equilibrium, and showed that mdp provides substantially improved\nforecasting results over the classical dp ratio. Here, we extend that paper by\nperforming multivariate regressions based on the Campbell-Shiller\napproximation, by utilizing a dynamic econometric procedure to estimate the\nmodified dp, and by testing the modified ratios against reinvested\ndividend-yields. By comparing the performance of mdp and dp in the period after\n1965, we are not only able to enhance the robustness of the findings, but also\nto debunk a possible false explanation that the enhanced mdp performance in\npredicting future returns comes from a capacity to predict the risk-free return\ncomponent. Depending on whether one uses the recursive or population\nmethodology to measure the performance of mdp, the Out-of-Sample performance\ngain is between 30% to 50%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2019 06:40:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Polimenis", "Vassilis", ""], ["Neokosmidis", "Ioannis", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.08405", "submitter": "Chris Kenyon", "authors": "Mourad Berrahoui, Othmane Islah, Chris Kenyon", "title": "Revising SA-CCR", "comments": "20 pages, 13 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  From SA-CCR to RSA-CCR: making SA-CCR self-consistent and appropriately\nrisk-sensitive by cashflow decomposition in a 3-Factor Gaussian Market Model\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2019 09:03:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2019 18:29:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Berrahoui", "Mourad", ""], ["Islah", "Othmane", ""], ["Kenyon", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.08821", "submitter": "Luca Prezioso", "authors": "Luca Di Persio, Luca Prezioso, Kai Wallbaum", "title": "Closed-End Formula for options linked to Target Volatility Strategies", "comments": "21 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent years have seen an emerging class of structured financial products\nbased on options linked to dynamic asset allocation strategies.
