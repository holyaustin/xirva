Pricing algorithms\nand constructions of hedging strategies, stopping times and martingale\nrepresentations are presented for short (seller's) and long (buyer's) positions\nin an American option with an arbitrary payoff. This general approach extends\nthe special cases considered in the literature concerned primarily with\ncomputing the prices of American puts under transaction costs by relaxing any\nrestrictions on the form of the payoff, the magnitude of the transaction costs\nor the discrete market model itself. The largely unexplored case of pricing,\nhedging and stopping for the American option buyer under transaction costs is\nalso covered. The pricing algorithms are computationally efficient, growing\nonly polynomially with the number of time steps in a recombinant tree model.\nThe stopping times realising the ask (seller's) and bid (buyer's) option prices\ncan differ from one another. The former is generally a so-called mixed\n(randomised) stopping time, whereas the latter is always a pure (ordinary)\nstopping time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Sep 2007 11:44:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Roux", "Alet", ""], ["Zastawniak", "Tomasz", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.2070", "submitter": "Guangzhong Qiu", "authors": "G.

We adopt two types of\nactive traders in our MS model: speculators and arbitrageurs, and call and put\noptions on one underlying asset. Speculators make decisions based on their\nexpectations of the asset price at the option expiration time. Arbitrageurs\ntrade at different arbitrage opportunities such as violation of put-call\nparity. Difference in liquidity among options is also included. Notwithstanding\nits simplicity, our model can generate implied volatility (IV) curves similar\nto empirical observations. Our results suggest that the volatility smile is\nrelated to the competing effect of heterogeneous trading behavior and the\nimpact of differential liquidity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Sep 2007 13:19:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 14:00:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Qiu", "G.", ""], ["Kandhai", "D.", ""], ["Sloot", "P.
