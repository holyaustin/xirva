We consider two pricing approaches, the\nclassical risk-neutral approach and the benchmark approach, and we examine the\nassociated static and optimal behaviors of both the investor and insurer. The\nfirst model considered is the so-called minimal market model, where pricing is\nachieved using the benchmark approach. The benchmark approach was introduced by\nPlaten in 2001 and has received wide acceptance in the finance community. Under\nthis approach, valuing an asset involves determining the minimum-valued\nreplicating portfolio, with reference to the growth optimal portfolio under the\nreal-world probability measure, and it both subsumes classical risk-neutral\npricing as a particular case and extends it to situations where risk-neutral\npricing is impossible. The second model is the Black-Scholes model for the\nequity index, where the pricing of contracts is performed within the\nrisk-neutral framework. Crucially, we demonstrate that when the insurer prices\nand reserves using the Black-Scholes model, while the insured employs a dynamic\nwithdrawal strategy based on the minimal market model, the insurer may be\nunderestimating the value and associated reserves of the contract.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2019 10:20:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Jin", ""], ["Fergusson", "Kevin", ""], ["Platen", "Eckhard", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.01449", "submitter": "Wenyuan Wang Dr.", "authors": "Wenyuan Wang, Ping Chen, Shuanming Li", "title": "Generalized Expected Discounted Penalty Function at General Drawdown for\n  L\\'{e}vy Risk Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers an insurance surplus process modeled by a spectrally\nnegative L\\'{e}vy process.
