Funding risk breaks the bilateral\nnature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive\nform, making the introduction of a purely additive funding valuation adjustment\n(FVA) difficult. Yet, we can cast the pricing equation into a set of iterative\nrelationships which can be solved by means of standard least-square Monte Carlo\ntechniques. As a consequence, we find that identifying funding costs and debit\nvaluation adjustments is not tenable in general, contrary to what has been\nsuggested in the literature in simple cases. The assumptions under which\nfunding costs vanish are a very special case of the more general theory. We\ndefine a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on\nfunding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is more\nthan the sum of such special cases. We derive the general pricing equation by\nresorting to a risk-neutral approach where the new types of risks are included\nby modifying the payout cash flows. We consider realistic settings and include\nin our models the common market practices suggested by ISDA documentation,\nwithout assuming restrictive constraints on margining procedures and close-out\nnetting rules. In particular, we allow for asymmetric collateral and funding\nrates, and exogenous liquidity policies and hedging strategies.\nRe-hypothecation liquidity risk and close-out amount evaluation issues are also\ncovered. Finally, relevant examples of non-trivial settings illustrate how to\nderive known facts about discounting curves from a robust general framework and\nwithout resorting to ad hoc hypotheses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Oct 2012 16:27:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2012 19:43:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2012 11:45:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Pallavicini", "Andrea", ""], ["Perini", "Daniele", ""], ["Brigo", "Damiano", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.5046", "submitter": "Zorana Grbac", "authors": "St\\'ephane Cr\\'epey, R\\'emi Gerboud, Zorana Grbac and Nathalie Ngor", "title": "Counterparty Risk and Funding: The Four Wings of the TVA", "comments": "29 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The credit crisis and the ongoing European sovereign debt crisis have\nhighlighted the native form of credit risk, namely the counterparty risk.
