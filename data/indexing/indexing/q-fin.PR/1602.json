In this paper we\ndevelop a very efficient new algorithm for pricing these contracts in the case\nof stochastic interest rate not considered previously in the literature.\nPresently our method is applied to the Vasicek interest rate model, but it is\ngenerally applicable to any model when transition density or moments of the\nunderlying asset and interest rate are known in closed form or can be evaluated\nefficiently. Using bond price as a numeraire the required expectations in the\nbackward recursion are reduced to two-dimensional integrals calculated through\na high order Gauss-Hermite quadrature applied on a two-dimensional cubic spline\ninterpolation. Numerical results from the new algorithm for a series of GMWB\ncontracts for both static and optimal cases are presented. As a validation,\nresults of the algorithm are compared with the closed form solutions for simple\nvanilla options, and with Monte Carlo and finite difference results for the\nstatic GMWB. The comparison demonstrates that the new algorithm is\nsignificantly faster than finite difference or Monte Carlo for all the\ntwo-dimensional problems tested so far. For dynamic GMWB pricing, we found that\nfor positive correlation between the underlying asset and interest rate, the\nGMWB price under the stochastic interest rate is significantly higher compared\nto the case of deterministic interest rate, while for negative correlation the\ndifference is less but still significant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 01:40:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 02:28:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""], ["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.03402", "submitter": "Maren Diane Schmeck", "authors": "Maren Diane Schmeck", "title": "Pricing options on forwards in energy markets: the role of mean\n  reversion's speed", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Consider the problem of pricing options on forwards in energy markets, when\nspot prices follow a geometric multi-factor model in which several rates of\nmean reversion appear.
