For this\npurpose, we use a large database containing the balance sheets and share prices\nof 7,796 worldwide companies for the period 2004 through 2013. We develop a\npanel regression model using three financial indicators--dividends per share,\ncash flow per share, and book value per share--as explanatory variables for\nshare price. We then estimate individual company fundamentals for each year by\nremoving the time fixed effects from the two-way fixed effects model, which we\nidentified as the best of the panel regression models. One merit of our model\nis that we are able to extract unobservable factors of company fundamentals by\nusing the individual fixed effects.\n  Based on these results, we analyze the market anomaly quantitatively using\nthe divergence rate--the rate of the deviation of share price from a company's\nfundamentals. We find that share prices on average were overvalued in the\nperiod from 2005 to 2007, and were undervalued significantly in 2008, when the\nglobal financial crisis occurred. Share prices were equivalent to the\nfundamentals on average in the subsequent period.
