In option\nmarkets, the most popular way has been to extract implied volatilities to\nassess the future variability of the underlying with the use of the Black and\nScholes formula. In this manuscript, we propose a novel way to extract the\nwhole time varying distribution of the market implied asset price from option\nprices. We use a Bayesian nonparametric method that makes use of the Sethuraman\nrepresentation for Dirichlet processes to take into account the evolution of\ndistributions in time.
