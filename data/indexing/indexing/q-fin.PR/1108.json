It is shown that the presence of arbitrarily small\nstochastic deviations in the evolution of the num\\'eraire process causes\nsignificant changes in the market properties. In particular, an equivalent\nmartingale measure is not unique for this market, and there are non-replicable\nclaims. The martingale prices and the hedging error can vary significantly and\ntake extreme values, for some extreme choices of the equivalent martingale\nmeasures. Some rational choices of the equivalent martingale measures are\nsuggested and discussed, including implied measures calculated from observed\nbond prices. This allows to calculate the implied market price of risk process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 00:42:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 02:58:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 23 Apr 2014 13:52:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 12:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dokuchaev", "Nikolai", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1133", "submitter": "Agostino Capponi", "authors": "Agostino Capponi and Martin Larsson", "title": "Default and Systemic Risk in Equilibrium", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a finite horizon continuous time market model, where risk averse\ninvestors maximize utility from terminal wealth by dynamically investing in a\nrisk-free money market account, a stock written on a default-free dividend\nprocess, and a defaultable bond, whose prices are determined via equilibrium.\nWe analyze financial contagion arising endogenously between the stock and the\ndefaultable bond via the interplay between equilibrium behavior of investors,\nrisk preferences and cyclicality properties of the default intensity.
