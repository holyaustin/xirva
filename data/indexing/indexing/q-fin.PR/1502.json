Producers optionally store some production for future sale and\ngo short on forward contracts to hedge the uncertainty of the future commodity\nprice. Financial investors take positions in these contracts in order to\ndiversify their portfolios. The spot and forward equilibrium commodity prices\nare endogenously derived as the outcome of the interaction between producers\nand investors. Assuming that both are utility maximizers, we first prove the\nexistence of an equilibrium in an abstract setting. Then, in a framework where\nthe consumers' demand and the exogenously priced financial market are\ncorrelated, we provide semi-explicit expressions for the equilibrium prices and\nanalyze their dependence on the model parameters. The model can explain why\nincreased investors' participation in forward commodity markets and higher\ncorrelation between the commodity and the stock market could result in higher\nspot prices and lower forward premia.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 22:26:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jul 2016 09:37:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 21 Jan 2017 22:03:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Anthropelos", "Michail", ""], ["Kupper", "Michael", ""], ["Papapantoleon", "Antonis", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02595", "submitter": "Jose Figueroa-Lopez", "authors": "Jos\\'e E.

The case of a pure-jump stable-like L\\'evy model\nis also considered under the minimal possible conditions for the resulting\nexpansion to be well defined. Unlike recent results for \"near-the-money\" option\nprices and implied volatility, the results herein aid in understanding how the\nimplied volatility smile near expiry is affected by important features of the\ncontinuous component, such as the leverage and vol-of-vol parameters. As\nintermediary results we obtain high-order expansions for at-the-money digital\ncall option prices, which furthermore allow us to infer analogous results for\nthe delta of at-the-money options. Simulation results indicate that our\nasymptotic expansions give good fits for options with maturities up to one\nmonth, underpinning their relevance in practical applications, and an analysis\nof the implied volatility skew in recent S&P500 options data shows it to be\nconsistent with the infinite variation jump component of our models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 18:35:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 02:49:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 03:29:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Figueroa-L\u00f3pez", "Jos\u00e9 E.", ""], ["\u00d3lafsson", "Sveinn", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02963", "submitter": "Ricardo Cris\\'ostomo", "authors": "Ricardo Crisostomo", "title": "An Analysis of the Heston Stochastic Volatility Model: Implementation\n  and Calibration using Matlab", "comments": "34 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.NA math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyses the implementation and calibration of the Heston\nStochastic Volatility Model.

In this context,\nthe notion of utility indifference price has gained popularity in the academic\ncircles. Although theoretically very appealing, this pricing method remains\ndifficult to apply in practice, due to the high computational cost of solving\nthe nonlinear partial integro-differential equation associated to the\nindifference price. In this work, we develop closed form approximations to\nexponential utility indifference prices in exponential L\\'evy models. To this\nend, we first establish a new non-asymptotic approximation of the indifference\nprice which extends earlier results on small risk aversion asymptotics of this\nquantity. Next, we use this formula to derive a closed-form approximation of\nthe indifference price by treating the L\\'evy model as a perturbation of the\nBlack-Scholes model. This extends the methodology introduced in a recent paper\nfor smooth linear functionals of L\\'evy processes (A. \\v{C}ern\\'y, S. Denkl and\nJ. Kallsen, arXiv:1309.7833) to nonlinear and non-smooth functionals. Our\nclosed formula represents the indifference price as the linear combination of\nthe Black-Scholes price and correction terms which depend on the variance,\nskewness and kurtosis of the underlying L\\'evy process, and the derivatives of\nthe Black-Scholes price. As a by-product, we obtain a simple explicit formula\nfor the spread between the buyer's and the seller's indifference price. This\nformula allows to quantify, in a model-independent fashion, how sensitive a\ngiven product is to jump risk in the limit of small jump size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 Feb 2015 16:19:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 10:40:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e9nass\u00e9", "Cl\u00e9ment", ""], ["Tankov", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.05743", "submitter": "Parsiad Azimzadeh", "authors": "Parsiad Azimzadeh, Peter A.

Often, such contracts specify that the holder\nexert control at a finite number of deterministic times. The existence of an\noptimal bang-bang control, an optimal control taking on only a finite subset of\nvalues from the admissible set, is a common assumption in the literature. In\nthis case, the numerical complexity of searching for an optimal control is\nconsiderably reduced. However, no rigorous treatment as to when an optimal\nbang-bang control exists is present in the literature. We provide the reader\nwith a bang-bang principle from which the existence of such a control can be\nestablished for contracts satisfying some simple conditions. The bang-bang\nprinciple relies on the convexity and monotonicity of the solution and is\ndeveloped using basic results in convex analysis and parabolic partial\ndifferential equations. We show that a guaranteed lifelong withdrawal benefit\n(GLWB) contract admits an optimal bang-bang control. In particular, we find\nthat the holder of a GLWB can maximize a writer's losses by only ever\nperforming nonwithdrawal, withdrawal at exactly the contract rate, or full\nsurrender. We demonstrate that the related guaranteed minimum withdrawal\nbenefit contract is not convexity preserving, and hence does not satisfy the\nbang-bang principle other than in certain degenerate cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Feb 2015 23:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 20:34:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2015 12:11:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 21:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Azimzadeh", "Parsiad", ""], ["Forsyth", "Peter A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06074", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze", "title": "Coping with Negative Short-Rates", "comments": "30 pages; no changes (excepting this line); to appear in Wilmott\n  Magazine", "journal-ref": "Wilmott Magazine 2016(81) (2016) 58-68", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss a simple extension of the Ho and Lee model with generic\ntime-dependent drift in which: 1) we compute bond prices analytically; 2) the\nyield curve is sensible and the asymptotic yield is positive; and 3) our\nanalytical solution provides a clean and simple way of separating volatility\nfrom the drift in the short-rate process.
