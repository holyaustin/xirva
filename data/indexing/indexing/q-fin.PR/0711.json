With several\nnumerical examples we show that LSIS can be extremely effective in reducing the\nvariance of Monte Carlo estimators often resulting, especially when combined\nwith stratified sampling, in computational speed-ups of orders of magnitude.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2007 21:39:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Capriotti", "Luca", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.1143", "submitter": "Akihiko Inoue", "authors": "Kei Fukuda, Akihiko Inoue and Yumiharu Nakano", "title": "Optimal intertemporal risk allocation applied to insurance pricing", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.RM", "license": null, "abstract": "  We present a general approach to the pricing of products in finance and\ninsurance in the multi-period setting. It is a combination of the utility\nindifference pricing and optimal intertemporal risk allocation. We give a\ncharacterization of the optimal intertemporal risk allocation by a first order\ncondition. Applying this result to the exponential utility function, we obtain\nan essentially new type of premium calculation method for a popular type of\nmulti-period insurance contract. This method is simple and can be easily\nimplemented numerically. We see that the results of numerical calculations are\nwell coincident with the risk loading level determined by traditional\npractices.
