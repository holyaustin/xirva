This article introduces Monte Carlo Tree Search as a method\nto solve the stochastic optimal control problem behind the pricing and hedging\ntasks. As compared to $Q$-learning it combines Reinforcement Learning with tree\nsearch techniques. As a consequence Monte Carlo Tree Search has higher sample\nefficiency, is less prone to over-fitting to specific market models and\ngenerally learns stronger policies faster. In our experiments we find that\nMonte Carlo Tree Search, being the world-champion in games like Chess and Go,\nis easily capable of maximizing the utility of investor's terminal wealth\nwithout setting up an auxiliary mathematical framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 21:17:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2021 21:22:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Apr 2021 21:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Szehr", "Oleg", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.06299", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar, Nicolas Pesci and Victor James", "title": "A structural approach to default modelling with pure jump processes", "comments": "V2(revised version): we have incorporated the estimation of actual\n  (real world) default probabilities, an updated calibration procedure, some\n  convergence discussions and supplementary references. 36 pages, 7 tables, 2\n  figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a general framework for the estimation of corporate default based\non a firm's capital structure, when its assets are assumed to follow a pure\njump L\\'evy processes; this setup provides a natural extension to usual default\nmetrics defined in diffusion (log-normal) models, and allows to capture extreme\nmarket events such as sudden drops in asset prices, which are closely linked to\ndefault occurrence.
