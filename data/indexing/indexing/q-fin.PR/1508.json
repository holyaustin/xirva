Under optimal withdrawal\npolicyholder behaviour the pricing of such a product is an optimal stochastic\ncontrol problem that cannot be solved using Monte Carlo method. In low\ndimension case, it can be solved using PDE based methods such as finite\ndifference. In this paper, we develop a much more efficient Gauss-Hermite\nquadrature method with a one-dimensional cubic spline for calculation of the\nexpectation between withdrawal/reset dates, and a bi-cubic spline interpolation\nfor applying the jump conditions across withdrawal/reset dates. We show results\nfor both static and dynamic withdrawals and for both the asset accumulation and\nthe pension phases (different penalties for any excessive withdrawal) in the\nretirement investment cycle. To evaluate products with capital protection\noption, it is common industry practice to assume static withdrawals and use\nMonte Carlo method. As a result, the fair fee is underpriced if policyholder\nbehaves optimally. We found that extra fee that has to be charged to counter\nthe optimal policyholder behaviour is most significant at smaller interest rate\nand higher volatility levels, and it is sensitive to the penalty threshold. At\nlow interest rate and a moderate penalty threshold level (15% of the portfolio\nvalue per annum) typically set in practice, the extra fee due to optimal\nwithdrawal can be as high as 40% and more on top of the base case of no\nwithdrawal or the case of fixed withdrawals at the penalty threshold.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2015 05:58:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 May 2017 13:43:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Xiaolin", ""], ["Shevchenko", "Pavel V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.04321", "submitter": "Andrea Pallavicini Mr", "authors": "Nicola Moreni and Andrea Pallavicini", "title": "FX Modelling in Collateralized Markets: foreign measures, basis curves,\n  and pricing formulae", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a general derivation of the arbitrage-free pricing framework for\nmultiple-currency collateralized products.

In this model, the value of the option is\ngiven by a linear (1 + 2) evolution partial differential equation in which the\nprice of the option depends upon two independent variables, the value of the\nunderlying asset, $S$, and a new variable, $y$.

However, when\n$\\sigma(y)=\\sigma_{0}$ and as the price of the option depends upon the second\nBrownian motion in which the volatility is defined, the (1 + 2) evolution is\nnot reduced to the Black--Scholes--Merton Equation, the model admits five Lie\npoint symmetries in addition to the linear symmetry and the infinite number of\nsolution symmetries. We apply the zeroth-order invariants of the Lie symmetries\nand we reduce the (1 + 2) evolution equation to a linear second-order ordinary\ndifferential equation.
