Let $X$ be a square-integrable\n$\\mathcal{F}_\\infty$-measurable random variable, and assume the non-degeneracy\ncondition that for all $t<\\infty$ the random variable $X$ is not\n$\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Let ${\\sigma_t}$ denote the integrand appearing in\nthe representation of $X$ as a stochastic integral, write $\\pi_t$ for the\nconditional variance of $X$ at time $t$, and set $r_t = \\sigma^2_t / \\pi_t$.\nThen $\\pi_t$ is a potential, and as such can act as a model for a pricing\nkernel (or state price density), where $r_t$ is the associated interest rate.\nUnder the stated assumptions, we prove the following: (a) that the money market\naccount process defined by $B_t = \\exp (\\int_0^t r_s \\,ds)$ is finite almost\nsurely at all finite times; and (b) that the product of the money-market\naccount and the pricing kernel is a local martingale, and is a martingale\nprovided a certain integrability condition is satisfied. The fact that a\nmartingale is thus obtained shows that from any non-degenerate element of\nWiener space satisfying the integrability condition we can construct an\nassociated interest-rate model. The model thereby constructed is valid over an\ninfinite time horizon, with strictly positive interest, and satisfies the\nrelevant intertemporal relations associated with the absence of arbitrage. The\nresults thus stated pave the way for the use of Wiener chaos methods in\ninterest rate modelling, since any such square-integrable Wiener functional\nadmits a chaos expansion, the individual terms of which can be regarded as\nparametric degrees of freedom in the associated interest rate model to be fixed\nby calibration to appropriately liquid sectors of the interest rate derivatives\nmarkets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Jul 2011 12:08:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Mina", "Francesco", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.4881", "submitter": "Aleksandar Mijatovic", "authors": "Martin Forde, Antoine Jacquier and Aleksandar Mijatovic", "title": "A note on essential smoothness in the Heston model", "comments": "5 pages; a version of this note is to appear in Finance & Stochastics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This note studies an issue relating to essential smoothness that can arise\nwhen the theory of large deviations is applied to a certain option pricing\nformula in the Heston model.
