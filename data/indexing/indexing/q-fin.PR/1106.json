By treating the interested system as the linear\ndecoupled FBSDE perturbed with non-linear generator and feedback terms, we have\nshown that it is possible to carry out a recursive approximation to an\narbitrarily higher order, where the required calculations in each order are\nequivalent to those for standard European contingent claims. We have also\napplied the perturbative method to the PDE framework following the so-called\nFour Step Scheme. The method is found to render the original non-linear PDE\ninto a series of standard parabolic linear PDEs. Due to the equivalence of the\ntwo approaches, it is also possible to derive approximate analytic solution for\nthe non-linear PDE by applying the asymptotic expansion to the corresponding\nprobabilistic model. Two simple examples are provided to demonstrate how the\nperturbation works and show its accuracy relative to known numerical\ntechniques. The method presented in this paper may be useful for various\nimportant problems which have eluded analytical treatment so far.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2011 08:59:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jun 2011 05:15:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Jan 2012 03:54:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Fujii", "Masaaki", ""], ["Takahashi", "Akihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0866", "submitter": "Antonis Papapantoleon", "authors": "Antonis Papapantoleon, John Schoenmakers, David Skovmand", "title": "Efficient and accurate log-L\\'evy approximations to L\\'evy driven LIBOR\n  models", "comments": "32 pages, 21 figures.

Real-time retail pricing is characterized by\npassing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and\nis shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and\nthe market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed\ncontrol law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase\nvolatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and\ngeneration. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it\nis shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's\nmaximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the\ngeneralized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this\nratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As\nnew demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the\nprice-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to\nlead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need\nfor assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally\nstrike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system\nreliability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Jun 2011 17:53:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Roozbehani", "Mardavij", ""], ["Dahleh", "Munther A", ""], ["Mitter", "Sanjoy K", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2478", "submitter": "M.
