The model is a generalization of the celebrated\nwork of Davis, Panas and Zariphopoulou (1993), where the value of the option is\ndefined as the utility indifference price. This approach requires the solution\nof two stochastic singular control problems in finite horizon, satisfying the\nsame Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, with different terminal conditions. We\nintroduce a general formulation for these portfolio selection problems, and\nthen we focus on the special case in which the probability of default is\nignored. We solve numerically the optimization problems using the Markov chain\napproximation method and show results for diffusion, Merton and Variance Gamma\nprocesses. Option prices are computed for both the writer and the buyer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 21:02:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 07:14:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:43:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 16 Feb 2018 17:38:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 14:46:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Fri, 15 Nov 2019 11:11:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cantarutti", "Nicola", ""], ["Guerra", "Jo\u00e3o", ""], ["Guerra", "Manuel", ""], ["Grossinho", "Maria do Ros\u00e1rio", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.02026", "submitter": "Anindya Goswami Mr.", "authors": "Milan Kumar Das, Anindya Goswami and Tanmay S.

It is shown that the price function can be obtained by\nsolving a non-local B-S-M type PDE. We establish existence and uniqueness of a\nclassical solution of the Cauchy problem.
