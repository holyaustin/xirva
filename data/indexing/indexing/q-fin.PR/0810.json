Our model extends\nKabanov's currency market model by allowing for nonlinear illiquidity effects.\nWe show that an appropriate generalization of Schachermayer's robust no\narbitrage condition implies that the set of claims hedgeable with zero cost is\nclosed in probability. Combined with classical techniques of convex analysis,\nthe closedness yields a dual characterization of premium processes that are\nsufficient to superhedge a given claim process. We also extend the fundamental\ntheorem of asset pricing for general conical models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Oct 2008 09:50:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pennanen", "Teemu", ""], ["Penner", "Irina", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.5146", "submitter": "Michael Schmutz", "authors": "Michael Schmutz", "title": "Semi-static hedging for certain Margrabe type options with barriers", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It turns out that in the bivariate Black-Scholes economy Margrabe type\noptions exhibit symmetry properties leading to semi-static hedges of rather\ngeneral barrier options. Some of the results are extended to variants obtained\nby means of Brownian subordination. In order to increase the liquidity of the\nhedging instruments for certain currency options, the duality principle can be\napplied to set up hedges in a foreign market by using only European vanilla\noptions sometimes along with a risk-less bond. Since the semi-static hedges in\nthe Black-Scholes economy are exact, closed form valuation formulas for certain\nbarrier options can be easily derived.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Oct 2008 21:19:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2010 17:14:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Schmutz", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.5698", "submitter": "Hamadene Said", "authors": "Said Hamadene and Jianfeng Zhang", "title": "The Continuous Time Nonzero-sum Dynkin Game Problem and Application in\n  Game Options", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the nonzero-sum Dynkin game in continuous time which\nis a two player non-cooperative game on stopping times.
