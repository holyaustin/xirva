Probability density functions of log returns for\ndifferent periods are conveniently taken to be convolutions of the Student's\nt-distribution with three degrees of freedom. The supports of these\ndistributions are truncated in order to obtain finite values for the options.\nWithin this framework, options with different strikes and maturities for one\nstock rely on a single parameter -- the standard deviation of the Student's\nt-distribution for unit period. We provide a study which shows that the\ndistribution support width has weak influence on the option prices for certain\nrange of values of the width. It is furthermore shown that such family of\ntruncated distributions approximately satisfies the no-arbitrage principle and\nthe put-call parity. The relevance of the pricing procedure is empirically\nverified by obtaining remarkably good match of the numerically computed values\nby our scheme to real market data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2018 19:36:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 14:58:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2019 07:53:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Basnarkov", "Lasko", ""], ["Stojkoski", "Viktor", ""], ["Utkovski", "Zoran", ""], ["Kocarev", "Ljupco", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.05396", "submitter": "Elisa Al\\`os Dr", "authors": "Elisa Al\\`os and Michael Coulon", "title": "On the optimal choice of strike conventions in exchange option pricing", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An important but rarely-addressed option pricing question is how to choose\nappropriate strikes for implied volatility inputs when pricing more exotic\nmulti-asset derivatives.

For non-covered options, where impact\nat the inception and maturity dates matters, we characterize the superhedging\nprice as a viscosity solution of a degenerate semilinear pde that can have\ngradient constraints. The non-linearity of the pde is governed by the transient\nnature of impact through a resilience function.
