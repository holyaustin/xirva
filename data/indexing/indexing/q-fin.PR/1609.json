Hence we\nstart from a novel model-free worst-case approach based on static hedging of\ncounterparty exposure with liquid options. We say \"start from\" because we\ndemonstrate that a naive worst-case approach contains hidden unrealistic\nassumptions on the variance of the hazard rate (i.e. that it is infinite). We\ncorrect this by making it an explicit (finite) parameter and present an\nefficient method for solving the parametrized model optimizing the hedges. We\nalso prove that WW-CVA is theoretically, but not practically, unbounded. The\noption-based hedges serve to significantly reduce (typically halve) practical\nWW-CVA. Thus we propose a realistic and practical option-based worst case CVA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Sep 2016 11:56:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Sep 2016 18:41:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 2 Oct 2016 10:14:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""], ["Green", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.00987", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Aguilar, Cyril Coste, Jan Korbel", "title": "Non-Gaussian analytic option pricing: a closed formula for the\n  L\\'evy-stable model", "comments": "v2-2 (nov 17): theoretical details and other numerical tests added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.2139/ssrn.2828673", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We establish an explicit pricing formula for the class of L\\'evy-stable\nmodels with maximal negative asymmetry (Log-L\\'evy model with finite moments\nand stability parameter $1<\\alpha\\leq 2$) in the form of rapidly converging\nseries.

The first model is a discrete time framework with an information flow\nprocess, dealing with both permanent and temporary impact, minimizing the\nexpected cost of the trade. The second model is a continuous time framework\nwhere the objective function is the sum of the expected cost and a value at\nrisk (or expected shortfall) type risk criterion.

This indirectly confirms that in the similar framework of Almgren\nand Chriss (2000) one is fine deriving a static optimal solution, as done by\nthose authors, as opposed to a fully adapted one, since the static solution\nhappens to be tractable and known in closed form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Sep 2016 18:00:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Brigo", "Damiano", ""], ["Piat", "Clement", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.05832", "submitter": "Marcel Nutz", "authors": "Julien Guyon, Romain Menegaux, Marcel Nutz", "title": "Bounds for VIX Futures given S&P 500 Smiles", "comments": "22 pages; to appear in 'Finance&Stochastics'", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00780-017-0334-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.OC q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive sharp bounds for the prices of VIX futures using the full\ninformation of S&P 500 smiles.
