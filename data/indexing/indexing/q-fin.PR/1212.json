First, we extend the results of [33]\nconcerning the existence and uniqueness of second-order reflected 2BSDEs to the\ncase of two obstacles. Under some regularity assumptions on one of the\nbarriers, similar to the ones in [10], and when the two barriers are completely\nseparated, we provide a complete wellposedness theory for doubly reflected\nsecond-order BSDEs. We also show that these objects are related to non-standard\noptimal stopping games, thus generalizing the connection between DRBSDEs and\nDynkin games first proved by Cvitanic and Karatzas [11]. More precisely, we\nshow under a technical assumption that the second order DRBSDEs provide\nsolutions of what we call uncertain Dynkin games and that they also allow us to\nobtain super and subhedging prices for American game options (also called\nIsraeli options) in financial markets with volatility uncertainty\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Dec 2012 18:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2012 07:23:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 08:09:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Matoussi", "Anis", ""], ["Piozin", "Lambert", ""], ["Possama\u00ef", "Dylan", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0779", "submitter": "Antoine Jacquier Dr.", "authors": "Antoine Jacquier and Patrick Roome", "title": "Asymptotics of forward implied volatility", "comments": "37 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove here a general closed-form expansion formula for forward-start\noptions and the forward implied volatility smile in a large class of models,\nincluding the Heston stochastic volatility and time-changed exponential L\\'evy\nmodels.
