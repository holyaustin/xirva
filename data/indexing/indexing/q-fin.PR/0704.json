In this framework an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure.\nEach cash flow is modelled by a random variable that can be expressed as a\nfunction of a collection of independent random variables called market factors.\nWith each such \"X-factor\" we associate a market information process, the values\nof which are accessible to market agents. Each information process is a sum of\ntwo terms; one contains true information about the value of the market factor;\nthe other represents \"noise\". The noise term is modelled by an independent\nBrownian bridge. The market filtration is assumed to be that generated by the\naggregate of the independent information processes. The price of an asset is\ngiven by the expectation of the discounted cash flows in the risk-neutral\nmeasure, conditional on the information provided by the market filtration. When\nthe cash flows are the dividend payments associated with equities, an explicit\nmodel is obtained for the share-price, and the prices of options on\ndividend-paying assets are derived. Remarkably, the resulting formula for the\nprice of a European call option is of the Black-Scholes-Merton type. The\ninformation-based framework also generates a natural explanation for the origin\nof stochastic volatility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Apr 2007 10:50:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}]
