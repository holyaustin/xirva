We found the two facts by featuring the\ntime-varying nature of the market efficiency. First, the intervention with\ndiscretionary power disrupted the rice market and reduced market efficiency in\nthe exchange. Second, the market efficiency improved in accordance with\nreduction in the government's discretionary power to operate the rice policy.\nWhen the government obtained the discretionary power to operate the policy\nregarding commodity market, the market efficiency often reduced. Conversely,\neven if the government implemented a large-scale intervention, the market\nefficiency improved when the government chose a systematic rule-like behavior\nfollowing the law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 12:42:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 13:35:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 06:40:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 07:41:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 1 Oct 2017 02:38:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 9 Jan 2018 07:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Mikio", ""], ["Maeda", "Kiyotaka", ""], ["Noda", "Akihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.03110", "submitter": "Andrew Lesniewski", "authors": "Patrick S.
