They\nhave hence become interested in offsetting part of this exposure, namely buying\nback correlation. Two ways have been proposed for such a strategy : either pure\ncorrelation swaps or dispersion trades, taking position in an index option and\nthe opposite position in the components options. These dispersion trades have\nbeen set up using calls, puts, straddles, variance swaps as well as third\ngeneration volatility products. When considering a dispersion trade using\nvariance swaps, one immediately sees that it gives a correlation exposure.\nEmpirical analysis have showed that this implied correlation was not equal to\nthe strike of a correlation swap with the same maturity. The purpose of this\npaper is to theoretically explain such a spread. In fact, we prove that the P&L\nof a dispersion trade is equal to the sum of the spread between implied and\nrealised correlation - multiplied by an average variance of the components -\nand a volatility part. Furthermore, this volatility part is of second order,\nand, more precisely, is of volga order. Thus the observed correlation spread\ncan be totally explained by the volga of the dispersion trade. This result is\nto be reviewed when considering different weighting schemes for the dispersion\ntrade.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2010 13:00:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jacquier", "Antoine", ""], ["Slaoui", "Saad", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1574", "submitter": "Yan Dolinsky", "authors": "Yan Dolinsky", "title": "Shortfall Risk Approximations for American Options in the\n  multidimensional Black--Scholes Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that shortfall risks of American options in a sequence of multinomial\napproximations of the multidimensional Black--Scholes (BS) market converge to\nthe corresponding quantities for similar American options in the\nmultidimensional BS market with path dependent payoffs.

The\nstochastic recovery specification only models the first two moments of the spot\nrecovery rate as its higher moments have almost no contribution to the loss\ndistribution and CDO tranche pricing. Observing that only the joint\ndistribution of default indicators is needed to build the portfolio loss\ndistribution, we propose a generic class of default indicator copulas to model\nCDO tranches, which can be easily calibrated to index tranche prices across\nmultiple maturities. This correlation modelling framework has the unique\nadvantage that the joint distribution of default time and other dynamic\nproperties of the model can be changed separately from the loss distribution\nand tranche prices. After calibrating the model to index tranche prices,\nexisting top-down methods can be applied to the common factor process to\nconstruct very flexible systemic dynamics without changing the already\ncalibrated tranche prices. This modelling framework therefore combines the best\nfeatures of the bottom-up and top-down models: it is fully consistent with all\nthe single name market information and it admits very rich and flexible spread\ndynamics. Numerical results from a non-parametric implementation of this\nmodelling framework are also presented. The non-parametric implementation\nachieved fast and accurate calibration to the index tranches across multiple\nmaturities even under extreme market conditions. A conditional Markov chain\nmethod is also proposed to construct the systemic dynamics, which supports an\nefficient lattice pricing method for dynamic spread instruments.

In this\napproach, an asset is defined by its cash-flow structure. The market is assumed\nto have access to \"partial\" information about future cash flows. Each cash flow\nis determined by a collection of independent market factors called X-factors.\nThe market filtration is generated by a set of information processes, each of\nwhich carries information about one of the X-factors, and eventually reveals\nthe X-factor. Each information process has two terms, one of which contains a\n\"signal\" about the associated X-factor, and the other of which represents\n\"market noise\". The price of an asset is given by the expectation of the\ndiscounted cash flows in the risk-neutral measure, conditional on the\ninformation provided by the market. When the market noise is modelled by a\nBrownian bridge one is able to construct explicit formulae for asset prices, as\nwell as semi-analytic expressions for the prices and greeks of options and\nderivatives. In particular, option price data can be used to determine the\ninformation flow-rate parameters implicit in the definitions of the information\nprocesses. One consequence of the modelling framework is a specific scheme of\nstochastic volatility and correlation processes. Instead of imposing a\nvolatility and correlation model upon the dynamics of a set of assets, one is\nable to deduce the dynamics of the volatilities and correlations of the asset\nprice movements from more primitive assumptions involving the associated cash\nflows. The paper concludes with an examination of situations involving\nasymmetric information. We present a simple model for informed traders and show\nhow this can be used as a basis for so-called statistical arbitrage.
