Thus, asset prices are forced to rise when the\nrepresentative agent is more risk adverse. By disentangling risk aversion and\nintertemporal substituability, we demonstrate that the risky asset price is an\nincreasing function of the coefficient of risk aversion only if the elasticity\nof intertemporal substitution (EIS) exceeds unity.

Furthermore,\nsome sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),\nbut since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue\nregarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little\nconsensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by\nreplication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.\nHowever, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,\nhaving no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light\non the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a\nderivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into\naccount when calculating FVA.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an\ninstrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is\nimplicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to\nshow that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being\nactively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.\nCarrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the\nderivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a\ncontingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term\nbond-CDS basis.\n  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what\nis obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on\nthe recovery of the hedger's liabilities. Also, price agreement is possible for\ntwo sophisticated counterparties entering a deal if their bond-CDS bases obey a\ncertain relationship, similar to what was first obtained by Morini and\nPrampolini (2010).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 11:39:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Apr 2014 22:37:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gunnesson", "Johan", ""], ["de Morales", "Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Mu\u00f1oz", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.1183", "submitter": "Hongzhong Zhang", "authors": "David Landriault and Bin Li and Hongzhong Zhang", "title": "On the Frequency of Drawdowns for Brownian Motion Processes", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1239/jap/1429282615", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Drawdowns measuring the decline in value from the historical running maxima\nover a given period of time, are considered as extremal events from the\nstandpoint of risk management.

The banks and investors share a\ncommon belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have\ndifferent objective functions; changes to this common belief result in\nportfolio adjustments and trade. Positive belief shocks induce banks to buy\nrisky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing\nnew short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets\nin order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and\nthey supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple\nmarket-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of\nequilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe),\ncausing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent.\nSuccessive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel;\nrather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their\ninitial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the\nexpansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can\nalso force larger price declines.
