We show that they\narise as unique strong solutions of the Bachelier stochastic differential\nequation which we prove is equivalent to the drawdown equation. Solutions of\nthe latter have the drawdown property: they always stay above a given function\nof their past maximum. We then show that any process which satisfies the\ndrawdown property is in fact an Az\\'ema-Yor process. The proofs exploit group\nstructure of the set of Az\\'ema-Yor processes, indexed by functions, which we\nintroduce. We investigate in detail Az\\'ema-Yor martingales defined from a\nnonnegative local martingale converging to zero at infinity. We establish\nrelations between average value at risk, drawdown function, Hardy-Littlewood\ntransform and its inverse. In particular, we construct Az\\'ema-Yor martingales\nwith a given terminal law and this allows us to rediscover the Az\\'ema-Yor\nsolution to the Skorokhod embedding problem. Finally, we characterize\nAz\\'ema-Yor martingales showing they are optimal relative to the concave\nordering of terminal variables among martingales whose maximum dominates\nstochastically a given benchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 01:09:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2009 14:24:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 13:53:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Carraro", "Laurent", ""], ["Karoui", "Nicole El", ""], ["Ob\u0142\u00f3j", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2479", "submitter": "Erhan Bayraktar", "authors": "Erhan Bayraktar, Hao Xing", "title": "Regularity of the Optimal Stopping Problem for Jump Diffusions", "comments": "To Appear in the SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The value function of an optimal stopping problem for jump diffusions is\nknown to be a generalized solution of a variational inequality.

At the money (X= K) for American options, the expected payoff of\nboth the call and put options is zero. Shepp investigated several stochastic\noptimization problems using martingale and stopping time theories [2,5,6]. One\nof the problems he investigated was how to optimize the stock price using both\nthe Black-Scholes (multiplicative) and the Bachelier (additive) models [7,6]\nfor the American option above the strike price K (exercise price) to a stopping\npoint. In order to explore the non-relativistic quantum effect on the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money, we assumed the stock\nprice to undergo a stochastic process governed by the Bachelier (additive)\nmodel [4]. Further, using Ito calculus and martingale theory, we obtained a\ndifferential equation for the expected payoff for both the call and put options\nin terms of delta and gamma. We also obtained the solution to the\nnon-relativistic Schroedinger equation as the expected payoff for both the call\nand put options. Then, we expressed the stochastic process that is the expected\npayoff for both the call and put options at the money in terms of the solution\nto the Schroedinger equation. We concluded the stochastic process that is the\nexpected payoff at the money for both options to be an oscillatory function\nwith quantized interest rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2009 19:56:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2009 23:24:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Dieng", "L.
