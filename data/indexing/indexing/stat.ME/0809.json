Value-at-Risk is a\nstandard tool to measure and control the market risk of an asset or a\nportfolio, and it is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is\npartly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use\nof Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in\npresence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for\nValue-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a\nproduct partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition\nstructure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian\nstock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that\nProduct Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify\nmarket risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full\nagreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides\nricher information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence\nof outlying points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 13:45:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 13:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["De Giuli", "Maria Elena", ""], ["Delpini", "Danilo", ""], ["Tarantola", "Claudia", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.0660", "submitter": "Stephane Chretien", "authors": "Stephane Chretien", "title": "An Alternating l1 approach to the compressed sensing problem", "comments": "7 pages, 1 figure, presented at ICIAM 07", "journal-ref": "IEEE Signal Processing Letters, Feb. 2010 Volume : 17 , Issue: 2\n  On page(s): 181 - 184", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME stat.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Compressed sensing is a new methodology for constructing sensors which allow\nsparse signals to be efficiently recovered using only a small number of\nobservations.

Our hierarchical Bayes model is\nwell suited to such naturally sparse image applications as it seamlessly\naccounts for properties such as sparsity and positivity of the image via\nappropriate Bayes priors. We propose a prior that is based on a weighted\nmixture of a positive exponential distribution and a mass at zero. The prior\nhas hyperparameters that are tuned automatically by marginalization over the\nhierarchical Bayesian model. To overcome the complexity of the posterior\ndistribution, a Gibbs sampling strategy is proposed. The Gibbs samples can be\nused to estimate the image to be recovered, e.g. by maximizing the estimated\nposterior distribution. In our fully Bayesian approach the posteriors of all\nthe parameters are available. Thus our algorithm provides more information than\nother previously proposed sparse reconstruction methods that only give a point\nestimate. The performance of our hierarchical Bayesian sparse reconstruction\nmethod is illustrated on synthetic and real data collected from a tobacco virus\nsample using a prototype MRFM instrument.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Sep 2008 08:56:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Sep 2009 08:23:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dobigeon", "Nicolas", ""], ["Hero", "Alfred O.", ""], ["Tourneret", "Jean-Yves", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.3902", "submitter": "Stefano M.
