We demonstrate how this framework allows a new formu- lation for\nlogistic regression in network data. We develop likelihood-based inference for\nthe model and an MCMC algorithm to implement it.

In such cases mode regression\nprovides a convenient summary of how the regressors affect the conditional mode\nand is totally different from other regression models based on conditional mean\nor conditional quantile or conditional variance. Some inference methods have\nbeen used for mode regression but none of them from the Bayesian perspective.\nThis paper introduces Bayesian mode regression by exploring three different\napproaches. We start from a parametric Bayesian model by employing a likelihood\nfunction that is based on a mode uniform distribution. It is shown that\nirrespective of the original distribution of the data, the use of this special\nuniform distribution is a very natural and effective way for Bayesian mode\nregression. Posterior estimates based on this parametric likelihood, even under\nmisspecification, are consistent and asymptotically normal. We then develop a\nnonparametric Bayesian model by using Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures of mode\nuniform distributions and finally we explore Bayesian empirical likelihood mode\nregression by taking empirical likelihood into a Bayesian framework. The paper\nalso demonstrates that a variety of improper priors for the unknown model\nparameters yield a proper joint posterior.

We compare our method against frequentist\napproaches for single-cell assays including Fisher's exact test, a likelihood\nratio test, and basic log-fold changes. Using several experimental assays\nmeasuring proteins or genes at the single-cell level and simulated data, we\nshow that our method has higher sensitivity and specificity than alternative\nmethods. Additional simulations show that our framework is also robust to model\nmisspecification. Finally, we also demonstrate how our approach can be extended\nto testing multivariate differential expression across multiple biomarker\ncombinations using a Dirichlet-multinomial model and illustrate this\nmultivariate approach using single-cell gene expression data and simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 23:30:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 16:30:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Finak", "Greg", ""], ["McDavid", "Andrew", ""], ["Chattopadhyay", "Pratip", ""], ["Dominguez", "Maria", ""], ["De Rosa", "Steve", ""], ["Roederer", "Mario", ""], ["Gottardo", "Raphael", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6537", "submitter": "Matthew Johnson", "authors": "Matthew James Johnson and Alan S.

Sampling this posterior distribution is of interest\nin inference algorithms for hierarchical Bayesian models based on the Dirichlet\ndistribution or the Dirichlet process, particularly Gibbs sampling algorithms\nfor the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Semi-Markov Model. We provide a\ndata augmentation sampling algorithm that is easy to implement, fast both to\nmix and to execute, and easily scalable to many dimensions.
