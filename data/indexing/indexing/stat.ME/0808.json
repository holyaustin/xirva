Something new is happening in the\ntwenty-first century: high-throughput devices, such as microarrays, routinely\nrequire simultaneous hypothesis tests for thousands of individual cases, not at\nall what the classical theory had in mind. In these situations empirical Bayes\ninformation begins to force itself upon frequentists and Bayesians alike. The\ntwo-groups model is a simple Bayesian construction that facilitates empirical\nBayes analysis. This article concerns the interplay of Bayesian and frequentist\nideas in the two-groups setting, with particular attention focused on Benjamini\nand Hochberg's False Discovery Rate method. Topics include the choice and\nmeaning of the null hypothesis in large-scale testing situations, power\nconsiderations, the limitations of permutation methods, significance testing\nfor groups of cases (such as pathways in microarray studies), correlation\neffects, multiple confidence intervals and Bayesian competitors to the\ntwo-groups model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2008 10:04:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Efron", "Bradley", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0582", "submitter": "Yoav Benjamini", "authors": "Yoav Benjamini", "title": "Comment: Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-STS236B the Statistical\n  Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Statistical Science 2008, Vol. 23, No. 1, 23-28", "doi": "10.1214/07-STS236B", "report-no": "IMS-STS-STS236B", "categories": "stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Comment on ``Microarrays, Empirical Bayes and the Two-Groups Model''\n[arXiv:0808.0572]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2008 09:01:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Benjamini", "Yoav", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0593", "submitter": "T.

Data on symptoms\nreported by caregivers along with the cause of death are collected from a\nmedical facility, and the cause-of-death distribution is estimated in the\npopulation where only symptom data are available. Current approaches analyze\nonly one cause at a time, involve assumptions judged difficult or impossible to\nsatisfy, and require expensive, time-consuming, or unreliable physician\nreviews, expert algorithms, or parametric statistical models. By generalizing\ncurrent approaches to analyze multiple causes, we show how most of the\ndifficult assumptions underlying existing methods can be dropped. These\ngeneralizations also make physician review, expert algorithms and parametric\nstatistical assumptions unnecessary. With theoretical results, and empirical\nanalyses in data from China and Tanzania, we illustrate the accuracy of this\napproach. While no method of analyzing verbal autopsy data, including the more\ncomputationally intensive approach offered here, can give accurate estimates in\nall circumstances, the procedure offered is conceptually simpler, less\nexpensive, more general, as or more replicable, and easier to use in practice\nthan existing approaches. We also show how our focus on estimating aggregate\nproportions, which are the quantities of primary interest in verbal autopsy\nstudies, may also greatly reduce the assumptions necessary for, and thus\nimprove the performance of, many individual classifiers in this and other\nareas. As a companion to this paper, we also offer easy-to-use software that\nimplements the methods discussed herein.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2008 13:25:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Gary", ""], ["Lu", "Ying", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.0657", "submitter": "Peter J.

The states are distinct,\nin the sense that in the different states accident frequencies or severities\nare generated by separate processes (e.g., Poisson, negative binomial,\nmultinomial logit). Bayesian inference methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) simulations are used for estimation of Markov switching models. To\ndemonstrate the applicability of the approach, we conduct the following three\nstudies. In the first study, two-state Markov switching count data models are\nconsidered as an alternative to zero-inflated models for annual accident\nfrequencies, in order to account for preponderance of zeros typically observed\nin accident frequency data. In the second study, two-state Markov switching\nPoisson model and two-state Markov switching negative binomial model are\nestimated using weekly accident frequencies on selected Indiana interstate\nhighway segments over a five-year time period.

The true mixing probabilities give the highest probability to\nthe case where all variance parameters are estimated positive, and the mixing\ncomponents show severe departures from chi-square distributions. Thus, the\nasymptotic null distribution has complex features that raise challenges for the\nassessment of significance of multivariate linkage findings.

With this concern novel\nregression modelling techniques have been fashioned by data integration from\ncomputer-simulation and physical designed experiments.

The purpose of\nthis approximation is to represent adequately the true model on the considered\nregion of factor space with all advantages of theoretical modelling.
