The method, termed indirect cross-validation, or ICV, makes use of\nso-called selection kernels. Least squares cross-validation (LSCV) is used to\nselect the bandwidth of a selection-kernel estimator, and this bandwidth is\nappropriately rescaled for use in a Gaussian kernel estimator. The proposed\nselection kernels are linear combinations of two Gaussian kernels, and need not\nbe unimodal or positive. Theory is developed showing that the relative error of\nICV bandwidths can converge to 0 at a rate of $n^{-1/4}$, which is\nsubstantially better than the $n^{-1/10}$ rate of LSCV. Interestingly, the\nselection kernels that are best for purposes of bandwidth selection are very\npoor if used to actually estimate the density function. This property appears\nto be part of the larger and well-documented paradox to the effect that \"the\nharder the estimation problem, the better cross-validation performs.\" The ICV\nmethod uniformly outperforms LSCV in a simulation study, a real data example,\nand a simulated example in which bandwidths are chosen locally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Nov 2008 05:52:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Savchuk", "Olga Y.", ""], ["Hart", "Jeffrey D.", ""], ["Sheather", "Simon J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.0052", "submitter": "Olga Savchuk", "authors": "Olga Y.

This\nproblem gets further complicated in a co-clustering scenario in which one needs\nto solve multiple clustering problems simultaneously because of the presence of\ncommon centroids (e.g., ancestors) shared by clusters (e.g., possible descents\nfrom a certain ancestor) from different multiple-cluster samples (e.g.,\ndifferent human subpopulations). In this paper we present a hierarchical\nnonparametric Bayesian model to address this problem in the context of\nmulti-population haplotype inference. Uncovering the haplotypes of single\nnucleotide polymorphisms is essential for many biological and medical\napplications. While it is uncommon for the genotype data to be pooled from\nmultiple ethnically distinct populations, few existing programs have explicitly\nleveraged the individual ethnic information for haplotype inference. In this\npaper we present a new haplotype inference program, Haploi, which makes use of\nsuch information and is readily applicable to genotype sequences with thousands\nof SNPs from heterogeneous populations, with competent and sometimes superior\nspeed and accuracy comparing to the state-of-the-art programs. Underlying\nHaploi is a new haplotype distribution model based on a nonparametric Bayesian\nformalism known as the hierarchical Dirichlet process, which represents a\ntractable surrogate to the coalescent process. The proposed model is\nexchangeable, unbounded, and capable of coupling demographic information of\ndifferent populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2008 06:40:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2009 08:17:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sohn", "Kyung-Ah", ""], ["Xing", "Eric P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4699", "submitter": "Lily Wang", "authors": "Lily Wang", "title": "Single-Index Model-Assisted Estimation In Survey Sampling", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, 2009", "doi": "10.1080/10485250902773849", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A model-assisted semiparametric method of estimating finite population totals\nis investigated to improve the precision of survey estimators by incorporating\nmultivariate auxiliary information.
