Thanks to frequent\nchanges in the activity and communication patterns of individuals, the\nassociated social and communication network is subject to constant evolution.\nOur knowledge of the mechanisms governing the underlying community dynamics is\nlimited, but is essential for a deeper understanding of the development and\nself-optimisation of the society as a whole. We have developed a new algorithm\nbased on clique percolation, that allows, for the first time, to investigate\nthe time dependence of overlapping communities on a large scale and as such, to\nuncover basic relationships characterising community evolution. Our focus is on\nnetworks capturing the collaboration between scientists and the calls between\nmobile phone users. We find that large groups persist longer if they are\ncapable of dynamically altering their membership, suggesting that an ability to\nchange the composition results in better adaptability. The behaviour of small\ngroups displays the opposite tendency, the condition for stability being that\ntheir composition remains unchanged. We also show that the knowledge of the\ntime commitment of the members to a given community can be used for estimating\nthe community's lifetime. These findings offer a new view on the fundamental\ndifferences between the dynamics of small groups and large institutions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2007 15:35:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Palla", "Gergely", ""], ["Barabasi", "Albert-Laszlo", ""], ["Vicsek", "Tamas", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1466", "submitter": "Hannes Leeb", "authors": "Hannes Leeb, Benedikt M.

The method consists in sorting or\nmonotone rearranging the original estimated non-monotone curve into a monotone\nrearranged curve. We show that the rearranged curve is closer to the true\nquantile curve in finite samples than the original curve, establish a\nfunctional delta method for rearrangement-related operators, and derive\nfunctional limit theory for the entire rearranged curve and its functionals. We\nalso establish validity of the bootstrap for estimating the limit law of the\nthe entire rearranged curve and its functionals. Our limit results are generic\nin that they apply to every estimator of a monotone econometric function,\nprovided that the estimator satisfies a functional central limit theorem and\nthe function satisfies some smoothness conditions. Consequently, our results\napply to estimation of other econometric functions with monotonicity\nrestrictions, such as demand, production, distribution, and structural\ndistribution functions.
