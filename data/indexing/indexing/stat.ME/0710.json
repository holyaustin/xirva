As in other areas, microarray quality is assessed by comparing suitable\nnumerical summaries across microarrays, so that outliers and trends can be\nvisualized, and poor quality arrays or variable quality sets of arrays can be\nidentified. Since each single array comprises tens or hundreds of thousands of\nmeasurements, the challenge is to find numerical summaries which can be used to\nmake accurate quality calls. To this end, several new quality measures are\nintroduced based on probe level and probeset level information, all obtained as\na by-product of the low-level analysis algorithms RMA/fitPLM for Affymetrix\nGeneChips. Quality landscapes spatially localize chip or hybridization\nproblems. Numerical chip quality measures are derived from the distributions of\nNormalized Unscaled Standard Errors and of Relative Log Expressions. Quality of\nchip batches is assessed by Residual Scale Factors. These quality assessment\nmeasures are demonstrated on a variety of datasets (spike-in experiments, small\nlab experiments, multi-site studies).

Bill was known personally to most of an older generation of\nstatisticians as an editor and as an intellectual and professional leader. In\n1994, Statistical Science published an interview by Sandy Zabell (Vol. 9,\n285--303) in which Bill looked back on selected events in his professional\nlife.

Such data are said to follow a monotone missingness\npattern, under which the likelihood has a convenient factorization. Upon\nfurther assuming that asset returns are multivariate normally distributed, with\nhistories at least as long as the total asset count, maximum likelihood (ML)\nestimates are easily obtained by performing repeated ordinary least squares\n(OLS) regressions, one for each asset. Things get more interesting when there\nare more assets than historical returns. OLS becomes unstable due to\nrank--deficient design matrices, which is called a \"big p small n\" problem.

This enables the estimation of\ncovariances between large sets of assets with histories of essentially\narbitrary length, and offers improvements in accuracy and interpretation. We\nfurther extend the method by showing how external factors can be incorporated.\nThis allows for the adaptive use of factors without the restrictive assumptions\ncommon in factor models.
