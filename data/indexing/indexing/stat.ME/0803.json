In this paper, we propose two\nnovel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM)\nfor simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally\nrequires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax\nrule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize\nits importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with\ndifferent functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to\na penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we\npropose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on\ndifferent variables according to their relative importance. Both types of\nregularization automate variable selection in the process of building\nclassifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced\ninterpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low\nsample size data.
