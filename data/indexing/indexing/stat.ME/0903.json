Our general local parametric approach particularly applies to general\nvarying-coefficient parametric models, such as GARCH, whose coefficients may\narbitrarily vary with time. Global parametric, smooth transition, and\nchange-point models are special cases. The method is based on an adaptive\npointwise selection of the largest interval of homogeneity with a given\nright-end point by a local change-point analysis. We construct locally adaptive\nestimates that can perform this task and investigate them both from the\ntheoretical point of view and by Monte Carlo simulations. In the particular\ncase of GARCH estimation, the proposed method is applied to stock-index series\nand is shown to outperform the standard parametric GARCH model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2009 16:05:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["\u010c\u00ed\u017eek", "P.", ""], ["H\u00e4rdle", "W.", ""], ["Spokoiny", "V.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.5066", "submitter": "Namrata Vaswani", "authors": "Namrata Vaswani and Wei Lu", "title": "Modified-CS: Modifying Compressive Sensing for Problems with Partially\n  Known Support", "comments": "To Appear in IEEE Trans.

Among others,\nFan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat. Methodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] propose\nan independent screening framework by ranking the marginal correlations. They\nshowed that the correlation ranking procedure possesses a sure independence\nscreening property within the context of the linear model with Gaussian\ncovariates and responses. In this paper, we propose a more general version of\nthe independent learning with ranking the maximum marginal likelihood estimates\nor the maximum marginal likelihood itself in generalized linear models. We show\nthat the proposed methods, with Fan and Lv [J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B Stat.\nMethodol. 70 (2008) 849-911] as a very special case, also possess the sure\nscreening property with vanishing false selection rate. The conditions under\nwhich the independence learning possesses a sure screening is surprisingly\nsimple. This justifies the applicability of such a simple method in a wide\nspectrum. We quantify explicitly the extent to which the dimensionality can be\nreduced by independence screening, which depends on the interactions of the\ncovariance matrix of covariates and true parameters. Simulation studies are\nused to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. In addition, we\nestablish an exponential inequality for the quasi-maximum likelihood estimator\nwhich is useful for high-dimensional statistical learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:58:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2009 22:26:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2009 04:12:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 18 Jan 2010 17:53:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 09:49:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Song", "Rui", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.5463", "submitter": "Nicolas Stadler N.S.", "authors": "Nicolas St\\\"adler and Peter B\\\"uhlmann", "title": "Missing values: sparse inverse covariance estimation and an extension to\n  sparse regression", "comments": "The final publication is available at http://www.springerlink.com", "journal-ref": "Statistics and Computing, 2012, Volume 22, 219-235", "doi": "10.1007/s11222-010-9219-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an l1-regularized likelihood method for estimating the inverse\ncovariance matrix in the high-dimensional multivariate normal model in presence\nof missing data.
