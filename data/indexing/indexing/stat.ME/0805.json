When the OL is\nmultimodal, but the state transition pdf (STP) is narrow enough, the optimal\nimportance density is usually unimodal. Under this assumption, many techniques\nhave been proposed. But when the STP is broad, this assumption does not hold.\nWe study how existing techniques can be generalized to situations where the\noptimal importance density is multimodal, but is unimodal conditioned on a part\nof the state vector. Sufficient conditions to test for the unimodality of this\nconditional posterior are derived. The number of particles, N, to accurately\ntrack using a PF increases with state space dimension, thus making any regular\nPF impractical for large dimensional tracking problems. We propose a solution\nthat partially addresses this problem. An important class of large dimensional\nproblems with multimodal OL is tracking spatially varying physical quantities\nsuch as temperature or pressure in a large area using a network of sensors\nwhich may be nonlinear and/or may have non-negligible failure probabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2008 05:41:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Vaswani", "Namrata", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0056", "submitter": "Linglong Kong", "authors": "Linglong Kong and Ivan Mizera", "title": "Quantile tomography: using quantiles with multivariate data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Statsitica Sinica, 2012, Vol. 22, No. 4. 1589-1610", "doi": "10.5705/ss.2010.224", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The use of quantiles to obtain insights about multivariate data is addressed.\nIt is argued that incisive insights can be obtained by considering directional\nquantiles, the quantiles of projections.

A good choice is often hard\nto achieve especially for high-dimensional integration problems. Nonparametric\nestimation of the optimal importance sampling distribution (known as\nnonparametric importance sampling) is a reasonable alternative to parametric\napproaches.In this article nonparametric variants of both the self-normalized\nand the unnormalized importance sampling estimator are proposed and\ninvestigated. A common critique on nonparametric importance sampling is the\nincreased computational burden compared to parametric methods.

Mean square error convergence\nproperties are investigated leading to recommendations for the efficient\napplication of nonparametric importance sampling.

The linear blend frequency polygon outperforms kernel\nestimators in terms of certain criteria such as efficient sampling and\nevaluation. Furthermore, it is compatible with the inversion method for sample\ngeneration. This allows to combine our algorithms with other variance reduction\ntechniques such as stratified sampling.
