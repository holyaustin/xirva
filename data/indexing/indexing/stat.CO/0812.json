The kernel of the algorithm is a system of\nequations that computes, for each index i, the probability that the last (most\nrecent) change point occurred at i. We evaluate this algorithm by applying it\nto the change point detection problem and comparing it to the generalized\nlikelihood ratio (GLR) algorithm. We find that our algorithm is as good as GLR,\nor better, over a wide range of scenarios, and that the advantage increases as\nthe signal-to-noise ratio decreases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 23:45:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Downey", "Allen B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1484", "submitter": "Fabio Rigat", "authors": "Fabio Rigat", "title": "Parallel hierarchical sampling: a practical multiple-chains sampler for\n  Bayesian model selection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces the parallel hierarchical sampler (PHS), a Markov chain\nMonte Carlo algorithm using several chains simultaneously.
