When it is possible to draw from each\nfull-conditional distribution associated with the target this is just a Gibbs\nsampler. Often at least one of the Gibbs updates is replaced with a\nMetropolis-Hastings step, yielding a Metropolis-Hastings-within-Gibbs\nalgorithm. Strategies for combining component-wise updates include composition,\nrandom sequence and random scans. While these strategies can ease MCMC\nimplementation and produce superior empirical performance compared to\nfull-dimensional updates, the theoretical convergence properties of the\nassociated Markov chains have received limited attention. We present conditions\nunder which some component-wise Markov chains converge to the stationary\ndistribution at a geometric rate. We pay particular attention to the\nconnections between the convergence rates of the various component-wise\nstrategies. This is important since it ensures the existence of tools that an\nMCMC practitioner can use to be as confident in the simulation results as if\nthey were based on independent and identically distributed samples. We\nillustrate our results in two examples including a hierarchical linear mixed\nmodel and one involving maximum likelihood estimation for mixed models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2009 01:18:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 May 2011 21:43:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 23 Dec 2011 17:04:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 16:27:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 19 Mar 2013 13:07:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2013 08:25:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "Alicia A.", ""], ["Jones", "Galin L.", ""], ["Neath", "Ronald C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0837", "submitter": "Karim Benabed", "authors": "Darren Wraith (1,2), Martin Kilbinger (2), Karim Benabed (2), Olivier\n  Capp\\'e (3), Jean-Fran\\c{c}ois Cardoso (3,2), Gersende Fort (3), Simon Prunet\n  (2) and Christian P.

Most fMRI analyses via GLM\nproceed in a massively univariate fashion where the same design matrix is used\nfor analyzing data from each voxel. A major limitation of this approach is the\nlocally varying nature of signals of interest as well as associated confounds.\nThis local variability results in a potentially large bias and uncontrolled\nincrease in variance for the contrast of interest. The main contributions of\nthis paper are two fold (1) We develop a statistical framework called SMART\nthat enables estimation of an optimal design matrix while explicitly\ncontrolling the bias variance decomposition over a set of potential design\nmatrices and (2) We develop and validate a numerical algorithm for computing\noptimal design matrices for general fMRI data sets. The implications of this\nframework include the ability to match optimally the magnitude of underlying\nsignals to their true magnitudes while also matching the \"null\" signals to zero\nsize thereby optimizing both the sensitivity and specificity of signal\ndetection. By enabling the capture of multiple profiles of interest using a\nsingle contrast (as opposed to an F-test) in a way that optimizes for both bias\nand variance enables the passing of first level parameter estimates and their\nvariances to the higher level for group analysis which is not possible using\nF-tests. We demonstrate the application of this approach to in vivo\npharmacological fMRI data capturing the acute response to a drug infusion, to\ntask-evoked, block design fMRI and to the estimation of a haemodynamic response\nfunction (HRF) response in event-related fMRI.
