In such fields, the data of interest generally constitute\nweighted graphs. Analysis of such weighted graphs often require the integration\nof topological metrics with respect to the density of the graph. Here, density\nrefers to the proportion of the number of edges present in that graph. When\ntopological metrics based on shortest paths are of interest, such\ndensity-integration usually necessitates the iterative application of\nDijkstra's algorithm in order to compute the shortest path matrix at each\ndensity level. In this short note, we describe a recursive shortest path\nalgorithm based on single edge updating, which replaces the need for the\niterative use of Dijkstra's algorithm. Our proposed procedure is based on pairs\nof breadth-first searches around each of the vertices incident to the edge\nadded at each recursion. An algorithmic analysis of the proposed technique is\nprovided. When the graph of interest is coded as an adjacency list, our\nalgorithm can be shown to be more efficient than an iterative use of Dijkstra's\nalgorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2011 15:23:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ginestet", "Cedric E.", ""], ["Simmons", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4079", "submitter": "Peter Green", "authors": "Peter J.

Although these distributions are natural for modelling\naxially symmetric data (i.e., unit vectors where $\\pm \\x$ are equivalent), for\nhigh-dimensions using them can be difficult. Why so? Largely because for Watson\ndistributions even basic tasks such as maximum-likelihood are numerically\nchallenging. To tackle the numerical difficulties some approximations have been\nderived---but these are either grossly inaccurate in high-dimensions\n(\\emph{Directional Statistics}, Mardia & Jupp. 2000) or when reasonably\naccurate (\\emph{J.

Using NEUS we are able to observe extremely rare unfolding events\nthat have mean first passage times as long as 1.4 s (3.4 E13 dynamics steps).\nWe examine the unfolding process for a range of flow rates of the medium, and\nwe describe two competing pathways in which different intramolecular contacts\nare broken.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 16:21:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dickson", "Alex", ""], ["Maienschein-Cline", "Mark", ""], ["Tovo-Dwyer", "Allison", ""], ["Hammond", "Jeff R.", ""], ["Dinner", "Aaron R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5667", "submitter": "Eduardo Mendes", "authors": "Eduardo F.
