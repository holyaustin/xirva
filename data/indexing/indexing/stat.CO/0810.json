Approximate Bayesian Computation, an alternative to\ndata imputation methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo integration, is\nproposed for making inference in epidemiological models. It is a\nlikelihood-free method that relies exclusively on numerical simulations. ABC\nconsists in computing a distance between simulated and observed summary\nstatistics and weighting the simulations according to this distance. We propose\nan original extension of ABC to path-valued summary statistics, corresponding\nto the cumulated number of detections as a function of time. For a standard\ncompartmental model with Suceptible, Infectious and Recovered individuals\n(SIR), we show that the posterior distributions obtained with ABC and MCMC are\nsimilar. In a refined SIR model well-suited to the HIV contact-tracing data in\nCuba, we perform a comparison between ABC with full and binned detection times.\nFor the Cuban data, we evaluate the efficiency of the detection system and\npredict the evolution of the HIV-AIDS disease. In particular, the percentage of\nundetected infectious individuals is found to be of the order of 40%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Oct 2008 06:59:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2009 08:04:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 07:17:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 09:13:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2010 08:23:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Blum", "Michael G.

The model evidences are\ncompared using the Bayes factor, which is the ratio of evidences. The Jeffrey\nscale is used to determine the differences in the models. The Bayesian evidence\nis calculated by integrating the likelihood of the data given the model and its\nparameters over the a priori model parameter space using the new nested\nsampling algorithm. The nested algorithm samples this likelihood distribution\nby using a hard likelihood-value constraint on the sampling region while\nproviding the posterior samples of the updating model parameters as a\nby-product. This method is used to calculate the evidence of a number of\nplausible finite element models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Oct 2008 09:36:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mthembu", "Linda", ""], ["Marwala", "Tshilidzi", ""], ["Friswell", "Michael I.", ""], ["Adhikari", "Sondipon", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.4727", "submitter": "Xinjia Chen", "authors": "Xinjia Chen", "title": "Robust Estimation of Mean Values", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.SY math.PR stat.CO stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we develop a computational approach for estimating the mean\nvalue of a quantity in the presence of uncertainty.
