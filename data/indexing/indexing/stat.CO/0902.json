However, the assumptions, limitations, and utility of\nthis metric remained incompletely characterized. Here we present an exploration\nof the strengths and limitations of that method. In addition to analytical\ninvestigations of the underlying assumptions, we use both real and simulated\ngenotypes to test empirically the method's accuracy. The results reveal that,\nwhen used as a means by which to identify individuals as members of a\npopulation sample, the specificity is low in several circumstances. We find\nthat the misclassifications stem from violations of assumptions that are\ncrucial to the technique yet hard to control in practice, and we explore the\nfeasibility of several methods to improve the sensitivity. Additionally, we\nfind that the specificity may still be lower than expected even in ideal\ncircumstances. However, despite the metric's inadequacies for identifying the\npresence of an individual in a sample, our results suggest potential avenues\nfor future research on tuning this method to problems of ancestry inference or\ndisease prediction. By revealing both the strengths and limitations of the\nproposed method, we hope to elucidate situations in which this distance metric\nmay be used in an appropriate manner.

Our optimization algorithm is benchmarked via\nstandard benchmarks from GAMS performance library. We develop two different\nalgorithmic frameworks for improving the quality of local solution for BSS. Our\nalgorithm also outputs extensive convergence diagnostics that validate the\nconvergence to an optimal solution for each extracted component. The quality of\nextracted sources from ADIS is compared to other well known algorithms such as\nFixed Point ICA (FPICA), efficient Fast ICA (EFICA), Joint Approximate\nDiagonalization (JADE) and others using the ICALAB toolbox for algorithm\ncomparison. In several cases, ADIS outperforms these algorithms.
