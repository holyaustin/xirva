Uncovering this community structure is one of the most important\nproblems in the field of complex networks. Networks often show a hierarchical\norganization, with communities embedded within other communities; moreover,\nnodes can be shared between different communities. Here we present the first\nalgorithm that finds both overlapping communities and the hierarchical\nstructure. The method is based on the local optimization of a fitness function.\nCommunity structure is revealed by peaks in the fitness histogram. The\nresolution can be tuned by a parameter enabling to investigate different\nhierarchical levels of organization. Tests on real and artificial networks give\nexcellent results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2008 21:30:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 Mar 2009 09:53:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lancichinetti", "Andrea", ""], ["Fortunato", "Santo", ""], ["Kertesz", "Janos", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1357", "submitter": "Jean-Michel Marin", "authors": "Lionel Cucala, Jean-Michel Marin, Christian Robert and Mike\n  Titterington", "title": "A Bayesian reassessment of nearest-neighbour classification", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  The k-nearest-neighbour procedure is a well-known deterministic method used\nin supervised classification. This paper proposes a reassessment of this\napproach as a statistical technique derived from a proper probabilistic model;\nin particular, we modify the assessment made in a previous analysis of this\nmethod undertaken by Holmes and Adams (2002,2003), and evaluated by Manocha and\nGirolami (2007), where the underlying probabilistic model is not completely\nwell-defined. Once a clear probabilistic basis for the k-nearest-neighbour\nprocedure is established, we derive computational tools for conducting Bayesian\ninference on the parameters of the corresponding model. In particular, we\nassess the difficulties inherent to pseudo-likelihood and to path sampling\napproximations of an intractable normalising constant, and propose a perfect\nsampling strategy to implement a correct MCMC sampler associated with our\nmodel. If perfect sampling is not available, we suggest using a Gibbs sampling\napproximation. Illustrations of the performance of the corresponding Bayesian\nclassifier are provided for several benchmark datasets, demonstrating in\nparticular the limitations of the pseudo-likelihood approximation in this\nset-up.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 Feb 2008 23:28:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Cucala", "Lionel", ""], ["Marin", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Robert", "Christian", ""], ["Titterington", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.1521", "submitter": "Stephanie Allassonniere", "authors": "St\\'ephanie Allassonni\\`ere (CMAP), Estelle Kuhn (LAGA)", "title": "Stochastic Algorithm For Parameter Estimation For Dense Deformable\n  Template Mixture Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Estimating probabilistic deformable template models is a new approach in the\nfields of computer vision and probabilistic atlases in computational anatomy.
