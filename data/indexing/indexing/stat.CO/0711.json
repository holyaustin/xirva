Stat. 34 (2006) 1581--1619], Kou,\nZhou & Wong have presented a new stochastic simulation method called the\nequi-energy (EE) sampler. This technique is designed to simulate from a\nprobability measure $\\pi$, perhaps only known up to a normalizing constant. The\nauthors demonstrate that the sampler performs well in quite challenging\nproblems but their convergence results (Theorem 2) appear incomplete. This was\npointed out, in the discussion of the paper, by Atchad\\'e & Liu (2006) who\nproposed an alternative convergence proof. However, this alternative proof,\nwhilst theoretically correct, does not correspond to the algorithm that is\nimplemented. In this note we provide a new proof of convergence of the\nequi-energy sampler based on the Poisson equation and on the theory developed\nin Andrieu et al. (2007) for \\emph{Non-Linear} Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).\nThe objective of this note is to provide a proof of correctness of the EE\nsampler when there is only one feeding chain; the general case requires a much\nmore technical approach than is suitable for a short note. In addition, we also\nseek to highlight the difficulties associated with the analysis of this type of\nalgorithm and present the main techniques that may be adopted to prove the\nconvergence of it.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2007 16:59:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Andrieu", "Christophe", ""], ["Jasra", "Ajay", ""], ["Doucet", "Arnaud", ""], ["Del Moral", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.0186", "submitter": "Ajay Jasra", "authors": "Ajay Jasra, David A.

One of the main challenges in\nMCMC-based inference is that of simulating from high and trans-dimensional\ntarget measures. In such cases, MCMC methods may not adequately traverse the\nsupport of the target; the simulation results will be unreliable. We develop\npopulation methods to deal with such problems, and give a result proving the\nuniform ergodicity of these population algorithms, under mild assumptions. This\nresult is used to demonstrate the superiority, in terms of convergence rate, of\na population transition kernel over a reversible jump sampler for a Bayesian\nvariable selection problem. We also give an example of a population algorithm\nfor a Bayesian multivariate mixture model with an unknown number of components.\nThis is applied to gene expression data of 1000 data points in six dimensions\nand it is demonstrated that our algorithm out performs some competing Markov\nchain samplers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2007 18:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jasra", "Ajay", ""], ["Stephens", "David A.", ""], ["Holmes", "Chris C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.0458", "submitter": "Agostino Nobile", "authors": "Agostino Nobile", "title": "Bayesian finite mixtures: a note on prior specification and posterior\n  computation", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "Univ of Glasgow, Dept of Statistics, Tech report 05-3", "categories": "stat.ME stat.CO", "license": null, "abstract": "  A new method for the computation of the posterior distribution of the number\nk of components in a finite mixture is presented.
