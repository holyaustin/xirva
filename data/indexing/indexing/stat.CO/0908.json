The critical temperature, as well as the critical exponents, is\nevaluated from the power-law behavior of suitable physical observables when the\nsystem is quenched from uncorrelated states, corresponding to infinite\ntemperature, to the critical point. These results are compared with those\nobtained from the dynamic evolution of the system when it is suddenly annealed\nat the critical point from the ordered state. Also, the critical temperature in\nthe infinite interaction limit is obtained by means of a finite-range scaling\nanalysis of data measured with different cutoffs of the interaction range. All\nthe estimated static critical exponents ($\\gamma /\\nu $, $\\beta /\\nu $, and\n$1/\\nu $) are in good agreement with Renormalization Group (RG) predictions and\npreviously reported numerical data obtained under equilibrium conditions. It is\nfound that the dynamic exponent $z$ is different for quenching and annealing\nexperiments, most likely due to the influence of the Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition occurring at relatively similar algebraic decay of the interactions\nwith $\\sigma =1$. However, for annealing experiments the measured exponent $z$\nis close to the RG predictions. On the other hand, the relevant exponents of\nthe dynamic behavior ($z$ and $\\theta$) are slightly different than the RG\npredictions, most likely due to the fact that they may depend on the especific\ndynamics used (Metropolis in the present paper).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2009 14:37:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Apr 2011 20:29:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Rodriguez", "D.
