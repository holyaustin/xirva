A good choice is often hard\nto achieve especially for high-dimensional integration problems. Nonparametric\nestimation of the optimal importance sampling distribution (known as\nnonparametric importance sampling) is a reasonable alternative to parametric\napproaches.In this article nonparametric variants of both the self-normalized\nand the unnormalized importance sampling estimator are proposed and\ninvestigated. A common critique on nonparametric importance sampling is the\nincreased computational burden compared to parametric methods. We solve this\nproblem to a large degree by utilizing the linear blend frequency polygon\nestimator instead of a kernel estimator. Mean square error convergence\nproperties are investigated leading to recommendations for the efficient\napplication of nonparametric importance sampling. Particularly, we show that\nnonparametric importance sampling asymptotically attains optimal importance\nsampling variance. The efficiency of nonparametric importance sampling\nalgorithms heavily relies on the computational efficiency of the employed\nnonparametric estimator. The linear blend frequency polygon outperforms kernel\nestimators in terms of certain criteria such as efficient sampling and\nevaluation. Furthermore, it is compatible with the inversion method for sample\ngeneration. This allows to combine our algorithms with other variance reduction\ntechniques such as stratified sampling. Empirical evidence for the usefulness\nof the suggested algorithms is obtained by means of three benchmark integration\nproblems.

The\nlength of the LCDM distance vector provides the number of voxels (approximately\na multiple of volume (in mm^3)); median, mode, range, and variance of LCDM\ndistances are all suggestive of size, thickness, and shape differences. However\nthese measures provide a crude summary based on LCDM distances which may convey\nmuch more information about the tissue in question. To utilize more of this\ninformation, we pool (merge) the LCDM distances from subjects in the same group\nor condition.
