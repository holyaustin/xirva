In this paper we\npropose a random depth which approximates the Tukey depth. It only takes into\naccount a finite number of one-dimensional projections which are chosen at\nrandom. Thus, this random depth requires a very small computation time even in\nhigh dimensional spaces. Moreover, it is easily extended to cover the\nfunctional framework.\n  We present some simulations indicating how many projections should be\nconsidered depending on the sample size and on the dimension of the sample\nspace. We also compare this depth with some others proposed in the literature.\nIt is noteworthy that the random depth, based on a very low number of\nprojections, obtains results very similar to those obtained with other depths.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2007 08:39:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cuesta-Albertos", "J.

Typically, ST\ninvolves introducing an auxiliary variable $k$ taking values in a finite subset\nof $[0,1]$ and indexing a set of tempered distributions, say $\\pi_k(\\theta)\n\\propto \\pi(\\theta)^k$. In this case, small values of $k$ encourage better\nmixing, but samples from $\\pi$ are only obtained when the joint chain for\n$(\\theta,k)$ reaches $k=1$. However, the entire chain can be used to estimate\nexpectations under $\\pi$ of functions of interest, provided that importance\nsampling (IS) weights are calculated. Unfortunately this method, which we call\nimportance tempering (IT), can disappoint. This is partly because the most\nimmediately obvious implementation is na\\\"ive and can lead to high variance\nestimators. We derive a new optimal method for combining multiple IS estimators\nand prove that the resulting estimator has a highly desirable property related\nto the notion of effective sample size. We briefly report on the success of the\noptimal combination in two modelling scenarios requiring reversible-jump MCMC,\nwhere the na\\\"ive approach fails.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Jul 2007 15:04:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Aug 2007 19:26:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 16 Aug 2007 15:35:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 17 Sep 2007 16:21:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 8 Sep 2008 15:10:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2008 18:12:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Gramacy", "Robert B.", ""], ["Samworth", "Richard J.", ""], ["King", "Ruth", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.4558", "submitter": "Bernd Sturmfels", "authors": "Bernd Sturmfels", "title": "Open Problems in Algebraic Statistics", "comments": "13 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.AG stat.CO stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Algebraic statistics is concerned with the study of probabilistic models and\ntechniques for statistical inference using methods from algebra and geometry.\nThis article presents a list of open mathematical problems in this emerging\nfield, with main emphasis on graphical models with hidden variables, maximum\nlikelihood estimation, and multivariate Gaussian distributions.
