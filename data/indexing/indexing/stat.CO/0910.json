The number of points\nin $C$ satisfying $S=s$ is $p \\{S=s\\}\\exp (I(p))$ where $I(p)$ is the entropy\nof the density $p$. We estimate $p \\{S=s\\}$ by $p_Z(s)$, the density at $s$ of\nthe multivariate Gaussian $Z$ with the same first two moments as $S$; and when\n$d$ is large we use in addition an Edgeworth factor that requires the first\nfour moments of $S$ under $p$.
