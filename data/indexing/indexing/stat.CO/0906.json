In data analysis, such\ntransitions arise as abrupt breakdown of linear model selection, robust data\nfitting or compressed sensing reconstructions, when the complexity of the model\nor the number of outliers increases beyond a threshold. In combinatorial\ngeometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face\ncounts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in\nthese very different problems appear in the same critical locations after\nappropriate calibration of variables.\n  These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling,\nthey place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous\nhigh-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place\nhard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate\noutliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp\nboundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.\n  Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume\nthe underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid)\nGaussian elements. In applications, however, it often seems that Gaussianity is\nnot required. We conducted an extensive computational experiment and formal\ninferential analysis to test the hypothesis that these phase transitions are\n{\\it universal} across a range of underlying matrix ensembles. The experimental\nresults are consistent with an asymptotic large-$n$ universality across matrix\nensembles; finite-sample universality can be rejected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Jun 2009 12:01:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Donoho", "David L.", ""], ["Tanner", "Jared", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3215", "submitter": "Marloes Maathuis", "authors": "Marloes H.

The computation of the NPMLE consists of two steps: a parameter reduction\nstep and an optimization step. In this paper we focus on the reduction step. We\nintroduce two new reduction algorithms: the Tree algorithm and the HeightMap\nalgorithm. The Tree algorithm is only mentioned briefly. The HeightMap\nalgorithm is discussed in detail and also given in pseudo code. It is a very\nfast and simple algorithm of time complexity O(n^2). This is an order faster\nthan the best known algorithm thus far, the O(n^3) algorithm of Bogaerts and\nLesaffre (2003). We compare our algorithms with the algorithms of Gentleman and\nVandal (2001), Song (2001) and Bogaerts and Lesaffre (2003), using simulated\ndata. We show that our algorithms, and especially the HeightMap algorithm, are\nsignificantly faster. Finally, we point out that the HeightMap algorithm can be\neasily generalized to d-dimensional data with d>2. Such a multivariate version\nof the HeightMap algorithm has time complexity O(n^d).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Jun 2009 15:29:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Maathuis", "Marloes H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.3849", "submitter": "Yaming Yu", "authors": "Yaming Yu", "title": "Squeezing the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm for faster convergence", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "IEEE Trans.
