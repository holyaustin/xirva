The\nadvantage of our procedure is the flexibility of choosing different initial\nconditions so that one can adjust the performance of the test. Two examples\nhave been studied, with coverage verified via Monte Carlo simulation. One\nrelates to the ratio of two exponential means, and the other relates the\nlogistic regression model.
