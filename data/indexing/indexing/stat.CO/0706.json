This is\nespecially true in shape modelling in the computer vision community or in\nprobabilistic atlas building for Computational Anatomy (CA). A first coherent\nstatistical framework modelling the geometrical variability as hidden variables\nhas been given by Allassonni\\`ere, Amit and Trouv\\'e (JRSS 2006). Setting the\nproblem in a Bayesian context they proved the consistency of the MAP estimator\nand provided a simple iterative deterministic algorithm with an EM flavour\nleading to some reasonable approximations of the MAP estimator under low noise\nconditions. In this paper we present a stochastic algorithm for approximating\nthe MAP estimator in the spirit of the SAEM algorithm. We prove its convergence\nto a critical point of the observed likelihood with an illustration on images\nof handwritten digits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jun 2007 09:08:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jan 2009 15:47:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Allassonni\u00e8re", "St\u00e9phanie", "", "CMAP"], ["Kuhn", "Estelle", "", "LAGA"], ["Trouv\u00e9", "Alain", "", "CMLA"]]}, {"id": "0706.2281", "submitter": "Alexander Yu.
