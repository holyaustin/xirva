It combines state-of-the-art techniques in advanced\nMonte Carlo sampling with Bayesian formulations. The key departure from\nexisting works is the use of inexpensive, approximate computational models in a\nrigorous manner. Such models can readily be derived by coarsening the\ndiscretization size in the solution of the governing PDEs, increasing the time\nstep when integration of ODEs is performed, using fewer iterations if a\nnon-linear solver is employed or making use of lower order models. It is shown\nthat even in cases where the inexact models provide very poor approximations of\nthe exact response, statistics of the latter can be quantified accurately with\nsignificant reductions in the computational effort. Multiple approximate models\ncan be used and rigorous confidence bounds of the estimates produced are\nprovided at all stages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Aug 2008 23:10:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Koutsourelakis", "Phaedon-Stelios", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3466", "submitter": "S.
