It is shown how the Girsanov theorem\ncan be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling.\nIt is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models, where\nthe driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and\nthus the laws of state and noise are not absolutely continuous.\nRao-Blackwellization of conditionally Gaussian models and unknown static\nparameter models is also considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 May 2007 08:02:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2008 12:38:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["S\u00e4rkk\u00e4", "Simo", ""], ["Sottinen", "Tommi", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.2214", "submitter": "Dimitris Politis", "authors": "Dimitris N.

The separation of time-scales allows two simplifications\nthat we exploit: i) The use of the averaging principle for the dimensional\nreduction of the system needed to solve for each particle and ii) the\nfactorization of the transition probability which allows the\nRao-Blackwellization of the filtering step. Both simplifications can be\nimplemented using the coarse projective integration framework. The resulting\nparticle filter is faster and has smaller variance than the particle filter\nbased on the original system. The method is tested on a multiscale stochastic\ndifferential equation and on a multiscale pure jump diffusion motivated by\nchemical reactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 May 2007 00:46:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2007 01:41:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 4 Jun 2008 21:41:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Givon", "Dror", ""], ["Stinis", "Panagiotis", ""], ["Weare", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3851", "submitter": "Jan Mandel", "authors": "Deborah H.
