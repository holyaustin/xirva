It is of great importance for investors and regulators to\nrecognize whether there are market manipulation and its manipulation patterns.\nThis paper proposes an approach to mine the transaction networks of exchanges\nfor answering this question.By taking the leaked transaction history of Mt. Gox\nBitcoin exchange as a sample,we first divide the accounts into three categories\naccording to its characteristic and then construct the transaction history into\nthree graphs. Many observations and findings are obtained via analyzing the\nconstructed graphs. To evaluate the influence of the accounts' transaction\nbehavior on the Bitcoin exchange price,the graphs are reconstructed into series\nand reshaped as matrices. By using singular value decomposition (SVD) on the\nmatrices, we identify many base networks which have a great correlation with\nthe price fluctuation. When further analyzing the most important accounts in\nthe base networks, plenty of market manipulation patterns are found. According\nto these findings, we conclude that there was serious market manipulation in\nMt. Gox exchange and the cryptocurrency market must strengthen the supervision.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Jan 2019 11:32:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Weili", ""], ["Wu", "Jun", ""], ["Zheng", "Zibin", ""], ["Chen", "Chuan", ""], ["Zhou", "Yuren", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02869", "submitter": "Mohsen Khorasany", "authors": "Mohsen Khorasany, Yateendra Mishra, Gerard Ledwich", "title": "Two-Step market clearing for local energy trading in feeder-based\n  markets", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1049/joe.2018.9312", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent innovations in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)\nprovide new opportunities and challenges for integration of distributed energy\nresources (DERs) into the energy supply system as active market players. By\nincreasing integration of DERs, novel market platform should be designed for\nthese new market players. The designed electricity market should maximize\nmarket surplus for consumers and suppliers and provide correct incentives for\nthem to join the market and follow market rules. In this paper, a feeder-based\nmarket is proposed for local energy trading among prosumers and consumers in\nthe distribution system. In this market, market players are allowed to share\nenergy with other players in the local market and with neighborhood areas. A\nTwo-StepMarket Clearing (2SMC) mechanism is proposed for market clearing, in\nwhich in the first step, each local market is cleared independently to\ndetermine the market clearing price and in the second step, players can trade\nenergy with neighborhood areas. In comparison to a centralized market, the\nproposed method is scalable and reduces computation overheads, because instead\nof clearing market for a large number of players, the market is cleared for a\nfewer number of players. Also, by applying distributed method and Lagrangian\nmultipliers for market clearing, there is no need for a central computation\ncentre and private information of market players. Case studies demonstrate the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed market clearing method in\nincreasing social welfare and reducing computation time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2019 22:32:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Khorasany", "Mohsen", ""], ["Mishra", "Yateendra", ""], ["Ledwich", "Gerard", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.04517", "submitter": "Andrea Baronchelli", "authors": "Abeer ElBahrawy, Laura Alessandretti, Andrea Baronchelli", "title": "Wikipedia and Digital Currencies: Interplay Between Collective Attention\n  and Market Performance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Frontiers in Blockchain 2:12 (2019)", "doi": "10.3389/fbloc.2019.00012", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The production and consumption of information about Bitcoin and other\ndigital-, or 'crypto'-, currencies have grown together with their market\ncapitalisation.

Therefore, having a powerful model to describe the trend\nof the default rate in the P2P market is crucial.

Models based on the movement of a Brownian particle do not\naccount for fundamental aspects of financial markets.

When a classical particle meets an obstacle\nor a potential barrier, it may either bounce or overcome the obstacle, yet not\nboth at a time. Only a quantum particle can simultaneously reflect and transmit\nitself on a potential barrier. This is precisely what prices in a stock market\nimitate when they find a resistance level: they partially bounce against and\npartially overcome it. This can only be explained by admitting that prices\nbehave as quantum rather than as classic particles.
