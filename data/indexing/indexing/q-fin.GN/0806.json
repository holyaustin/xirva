Results\nare compared to the S&P 500, the Value Line universe itself, trading the\nuniverse of equities using the proprietary ``Value Line Ranking System'' (to\nwhich this method is in some ways similar), and to a Martingale method of\nranking the same equities. The cumulative returns generated by the network\npredictor significantly exceed those generated by the S&P 500, the overall\nuniverse, the Martingale and Value Line prediction methods and are not eroded\nby trading costs. The ANN shows significantly positive Jensen's alpha, i.e.,\nanomalous risk-adjusted expected return. A time series of its global\nperformance shows a clear antipersistence. However, its performance is\nsignificantly better than a simple one-step Martingale predictor, than the\nValue Line system itself and than a simple buy and hold strategy, even when\ntransaction costs are accounted for.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jun 2008 15:18:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Satinover", "J.

Our agents\ninvest according to their opinion on future price movements, which is based on\nthree sources of information, (i) public information, i.e. news, (ii)\ninformation from their \"friendship\" network and (iii) private information. Our\nbounded rational agents continuously adapt their trading strategy to the\ncurrent market regime by weighting each of these sources of information in\ntheir trading decision according to its recent predicting performance. We find\nthat bubbles originate from a random lucky streak of positive news, which, due\nto a feedback mechanism of these news on the agents' strategies develop into a\ntransient collective herding regime. After this self-amplified exuberance, the\nprice has reached an unsustainable high value, being corrected by a crash,\nwhich brings the price even below its fundamental value. These ingredients\nprovide a simple mechanism for the excess volatility documented in financial\nmarkets. Paradoxically, it is the attempt for investors to adapt to the current\nmarket regime which leads to a dramatic amplification of the price volatility.\nA positive feedback loop is created by the two dominating mechanisms\n(adaptation and imitation) which, by reinforcing each other, result in bubbles\nand crashes. The model offers a simple reconciliation of the two opposite\n(herding versus fundamental) proposals for the origin of crashes within a\nsingle framework and justifies the existence of two populations in the\ndistribution of returns, exemplifying the concept that crashes are\nqualitatively different from the rest of the price moves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jun 2008 13:14:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:52:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Harras", "Georges", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.3813", "submitter": "Abhijit  Kargupta", "authors": "Abhijit KarGupta", "title": "The Question of Relaxation in the Wealth Exchange Models", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.gen-ph physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We look at the meaning of 'relaxation' in the wealth exchange models that are\nrecently proposed in Econophysics to interpret the wealth distributions.
