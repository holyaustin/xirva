It turns out that for countries with a human development\nindex (HDI) below 0.7 the basic education and technology achievement indices\nare the driving force for further development, whereas for the industrialized\ncountries the knowledge index as a composite education and communication index\nhas the strongest effect on the economic strength of a country as measured by\nthe gross domestic product.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2007 17:09:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Habermeier", "H. -U.", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.2090", "submitter": "Cesar Hidalgo", "authors": "C.

The\ntechnology, capital, institutions and skills needed to make such new products\nare more easily adapted from some products than others.

We show that countries tend to move to goods\nclose to those they are currently specialized in, allowing nations located in\nmore connected parts of the product space to upgrade their exports basket more\nquickly. Most countries can reach the core only if they jump over empirically\ninfrequent distances in the product space. This may help explain why poor\ncountries have trouble developing more competitive exports, failing to converge\nto the income levels of rich countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2007 19:20:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hidalgo", "C.

The extent that investors\nprefer larger pools is determined by investment strategy denoted by a tunable\nparameter $\\alpha$, with larger $\\alpha$ corresponding to more preference to\nlarger pools.

Our study enables us to make the general\nclaim that although the fortunes of an industrial organization can rise with\nexponential rapidity on relatively short time scales, its growth will\nultimately and inevitably be saturated on long time scales by various factors\nwhich are nonlinear in character. We have mathematically demonstrated the\nlikely occurrence of this feature under various possible circumstances,\nincluding the Red Ocean and the Blue Ocean.
