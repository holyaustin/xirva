However, after decades of undisputed growth,\nthe sector appears to be at a turning point in certain geographies. This\narticle therefore proposes a simple framework to help diagnose where growth\nopportunities (if any) may lie.When applied to the US economic context, the\nmodel indicates that at a macro-economic national level the sector should\nstall, which concurs with the trend observed over the past decade. However, it\nalso highlights that a few industrial sectors (e.g. the US beverage industry)\nstill offer pockets of growth for a variety of professional expertises.\nReplicating and fine-tuning those findings could be interesting for\npractitioners to steer their marketing and business development efforts.

First, we believe that any economic averaging\nprocedure implies aggregation of corresponding time series during certain time\ninterval ${\\Delta}$ and explain the necessity to use math expectation for both\nsides of the main CAPM equation. Second, the first-order condition of utility\nmax used to derive main CAPM equation should be complemented by the second one\nthat requires negative utility second derivative. Both define the amount of\nassets ${\\xi}_{max}$ that delivers max to utility. Expansions of the utility in\na Taylor series by price and payoff variations give approximations for\n${\\xi}_{max}$ and uncover equations on price, payoff, volatility, skewness,\ntheir covariance's and etc. We discuss why market price-volume positive\ncorrelations may prohibit existence of ${\\xi}_{max}$ and main CAPM equation.\nThird, we argue that the economic sense of the conventional frequency-based\nprice probability may be poor. To overcome this trouble we propose new price\nprobability measure based on widely used volume weighted average price (VWAP).\nTo forecast price volatility one should predict evolution of squares of the\nvalue and the volume of market trades aggregated during averaging interval\n${\\Delta}$. The forecast of the new price probability measure may be the main\ntough puzzle for CAPM and finance. However investors are free to chose any\nprobability measure they prefer as ground for their investment strategies but\nshould be ready for unexpected losses due to possible distinctions with real\nmarket trade price dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 May 2021 17:22:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Olkhov", "Victor", ""]]}]
