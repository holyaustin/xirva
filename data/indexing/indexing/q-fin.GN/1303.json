Knowledge of the differences in costs per kilometre, including\nexplanations of differences and their breakdowns is currently lacking in the\nliterature. This paper aims to provide a first stage insight into how cost per\nkilometre varies across urban rail projects. The methodology applied is a\nsimple cost comparison across projects where the data collected are comparable.\nWe conclude that capital costs per route-kilometre of urban rail vary highly\nbetween projects. Looking at European projects and excluding outliers, the\ntotal capital costs per route-kilometre (including stations and rolling stock)\nlie mainly between US$50-100 million (2002 prices). Including US projects, the\nrange is US$50-150 million. The main reasons for the high variation in the\nroute-kilometre costs are differences between projects as regards the ratio of\nunderground to above-ground construction, ground conditions, station spacing,\ntype of rolling stock, environmental and safety constraints and labour costs.\nWe warn, however, that the observations used to reach the conclusions are too\nfew to obtain results with statistical significance. Our results must therefore\nbe seen as a first step towards collecting more data so that a more succinct\nstatistical analysis can be conducted.

This results in projects that are extremely risky, but where the risk\nis concealed from MPs, taxpayers and investors. The authors not only explore\nthe problems but also suggest practical solutions drawing on theory and hard,\nscientific evidence from the several hundred projects in twenty nations that\nillustrate the book. Accessibly written, it will be essential reading in its\nfield for students, scholars, planners, economists, auditors, politicians,\njournalists and interested citizens.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 10:29:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Flyvbjerg", "Bent", ""], ["Bruzelius", "Nils", ""], ["Rothengatter", "Werner", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7405", "submitter": "Bent Flyvbjerg", "authors": "Bent Flyvbjerg", "title": "How Planners Deal with Uncomfortable Knowledge: The Dubious Ethics of\n  the American Planning Association", "comments": "Flyvbjerg, Bent, 2013, \"How Planners Deal with Uncomfortable\n  Knowledge: The Dubious Ethics of the American Planning Association,\" Cities", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/J.CITIES.2012.10.016", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With a point of departure in the concept \"uncomfortable knowledge,\" this\narticle presents a case study of how the American Planning Association (APA)\ndeals with such knowledge. APA was found to actively suppress publicity of\nmalpractice concerns and bad planning in order to sustain a boosterish image of\nplanning. In the process, APA appeared to disregard and violate APA's own Code\nof Ethics. APA justified its actions with a need to protect APA members'\ninterests, seen as preventing planning and planners from being presented in\npublic in a bad light. The current article argues that it is in members'\ninterest to have malpractice critiqued and reduced, and that this best happens\nby exposing malpractice, not by denying or diverting attention from it as APA\ndid in this case. Professions, organizations, and societies that stifle\ncritique tend to degenerate and become socially and politically irrelevant\n\"zombie institutions.\" The article asks whether such degeneration has set in\nfor APA and planning. Finally, it is concluded that more debate about APA's\nethics and actions is needed for improving planning practice. Nine key\nquestions are presented to constructively stimulate such debate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 11:04:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Flyvbjerg", "Bent", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7445", "submitter": "Saad Khan", "authors": "Saad Ahmad Khan, Ladislau Boloni", "title": "Agent-based modeling of a price information trading business", "comments": "Extended version of the paper published at Computer and Information\n  Sciences, Proc. of ISCIS-26, 2011", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe an agent-based simulation of a fictional (but feasible)\ninformation trading business. The Gas Price Information Trader (GPIT) buys\ninformation about real-time gas prices in a metropolitan area from drivers and\nresells the information to drivers who need to refuel their vehicles.\n  Our simulation uses real world geographic data, lifestyle-dependent driving\npatterns and vehicle models to create an agent-based model of the drivers. We\nuse real world statistics of gas price fluctuation to create scenarios of\ntemporal and spatial distribution of gas prices. The price of the information\nis determined on a case-by-case basis through a simple negotiation model. The\ntrader and the customers are adapting their negotiation strategies based on\ntheir historical profits.\n  We are interested in the general properties of the emerging information\nmarket: the amount of realizable profit and its distribution between the trader\nand customers, the business strategies necessary to keep the market operational\n(such as promotional deals), the price elasticity of demand and the impact of\npricing strategies on the profit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Mar 2013 17:40:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Khan", "Saad Ahmad", ""], ["Boloni", "Ladislau", ""]]}]
