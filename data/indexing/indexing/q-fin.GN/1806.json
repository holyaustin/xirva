This is a fundamental problem in\nthe field of social studies of science. The paper confronts this question here\nby showing vital determinants of science to explain the sources of social power\nand wealth creation by nations. Firstly, this study suggests a new general\ndefinition of science and scientific research that synthetizes previous\nconcepts and endeavors to extend them: Science discovers the root causes of\nphenomena to explain and predict them in a context of adaptation of life to new\neconomic and social bases, whereas scientific research is a systematic process,\napplying methods of scientific inquiry, to solve consequential problems, to\nsatisfy human wants, to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to\ncope with environmental threats. In particular, science and scientific research\nare driven by an organized social effort that inevitably reflect the concerns\nand interests of nations to achieve advances and discoveries that are spread to\nthe rest of humankind. This study reveals that scientific research is produced\nfor social and economic interests of nations (power, wealth creation,\ntechnological superiority, etc.), rather than philosophical inquiries. A main\nimplication of this study is that the immense growth of science in modern\nsociety is not only due to activity of scientists but rather to general social\nefforts of nations to take advantage of important opportunities and/or to cope\nwith environmental threats, such as war. Empirical evidence endeavors to\nsupport the sources of scientific research for nations, described here.\nFinally, relationships between R&D investment and productivity, and research\npolicy implications are discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jun 2018 13:33:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Coccia", "Mario", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.05542", "submitter": "Jan Eskil Snellman Ph.D.", "authors": "Jan E.

Experiments with these games suggest that, beyond\nrational economic thinking, human decision-making processes are influenced by\nsocial preferences, such as an inclination to fairness. In this study we\nsuggest that the apparent gap between competitive and altruistic human\ntendencies can be bridged by assuming that people are primarily maximising\ntheir status, i.e., a utility function different from simple profit\nmaximisation. To this end we analyse a simple agent-based model, where\nindividuals play the repeated dictator game in a social network they can\nmodify. As model parameters we consider the living costs and the rate at which\nagents forget infractions by others. We find that individual strategies used in\nthe game vary greatly, from selfish to selfless, and that both of the above\nparameters determine when individuals form complex and cohesive social\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jun 2018 13:45:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Snellman", "Jan E.", ""], ["I\u00f1iguez", "Gerardo", ""], ["Kert\u00e9sz", "J\u00e1nos", ""], ["Barrio", "R.
