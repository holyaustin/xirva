The role of the Ising\nmodel of phase transitions to model social and financial systems is reviewed,\nwith the concepts of random utilities and the logit model as the analog of the\nBoltzmann factor in statistic physics. Recent extensions in term of quantum\ndecision theory are also covered. A wealth of models are discussed briefly that\nbuild on the Ising model and generalize it to account for the many stylized\nfacts of financial markets. A summary of the relevance of the Ising model and\nits extensions is provided to account for financial bubbles and crashes. The\nreview would be incomplete if it would not cover the dynamical field of agent\nbased models (ABMs), also known as computational economic models, of which the\nIsing-type models are just special ABM implementations. We formulate the\n``Emerging Market Intelligence hypothesis'' to reconcile the pervasive presence\nof ``noise traders'' with the near efficiency of financial markets.

More technically, during a bubble phase,\nthe price follows a faster-than-exponential power law growth process, often\naccompanied by log-periodic oscillations. This dynamic ends abruptly in a\nchange of regime that may be a crash or a substantial correction. Because they\nleave such specific traces, bubbles may be recognised in advance, that is,\nbefore they burst. In this paper, we will explain the mechanism behind\nfinancial bubbles in an intuitive way. We will show how the log-periodic power\nlaw emerges spontaneously from the complex system that financial markets are,\nas a consequence of feedback mechanisms, hierarchical structure and specific\ntrading dynamics and investment styles. We argue that the risk of a major\ncorrection, or even a crash, becomes substantial when a bubble develops towards\nmaturity, and that it is therefore very important to find evidence of bubbles\nand to follow their development from as early a stage as possible. The tools\nthat are explained in this paper actually serve that purpose.

The proposed MEIO modeling approach\ncan be seen as a realization of the Everybody-in-the-Loop (EitL) framework,\nwhich promotes a sustainable future using behaviors and actions that are aware\nof their ubiquitous eco-socio-environment impacts. In this vision, the\nbehavioral changes could be initiated by providing all actors with their\nfootprint statement, which would be estimated using the MEIO models. First, a\nnaive MEIO model is proposed in the form of a graph of actions and\nresponsibility by considering interactions and goods transfers among the\nentities and actors along four channels. Then, the unnormalized responsibility\nand also the final responsibility among the actors are introduced, and then are\nused to re-allocate immediate footprint of actors among themselves.
