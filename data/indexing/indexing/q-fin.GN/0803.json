In order to prove this, we\nintroduce the notion of perfectly balanced markets, which is an equilibrium\nstate in which the relative capitalization of each company is a martingale\nunder the physical probability.

Anderson proposed the concept of complexity in order to describe the\nemergence and growth of macroscopic collective patterns out of the simple\ninteractions of many microscopic agents. In the physical sciences this paradigm\nwas implemented systematically and confirmed repeatedly by successful\nconfrontation with reality. In the social sciences however, the possibilities\nto stage experiments to validate it are limited. During the 90's a series of\ndramatic political and economic events have provided the opportunity to do so.\nWe exploit the resulting empirical evidence to validate a simple agent based\nalternative to the classical logistic dynamics. The post-liberalization\nempirical data from Poland confirm the theoretical prediction that the dynamics\nis dominated by singular rare events which insure the resilience and\nadaptability of the system. We have shown that growth is led by few singular\n\"growth centers\" (Figure 1), that initially developed at a tremendous rate\n(Figure3), followed by a diffusion process to the rest of the country and\nleading to a positive growth rate uniform across the counties.

One important motivation for privatization is to help\ndevelop factor and product markets, as well as security markets. Progress in\nprivatization is correlated with improvements in perceived political and\ninvestment risk. Many emerging countries have gradually reduced their political\nrisks during the course of sustained privatization. In fact, most risk\nresolution seems to take place as privatization proceeds to its later stage.\nAlternative benefits of privatization are improved risk sharing and increased\nliquidity and activity of the market. One of the main methods to develop\nprivatization is entering a new stock to the markets for arising competition.\nHowever, attention to the capability of the markets to accept a new stock is\nsubstantial. Without considering the above statement, it is possible to reduce\nthe market's efficiency. In other words, introduction of a new stock to the\nmarket usually decreases the stage of development and activity and increases\nthe risk. Based on complexity theory, we quantify how the following factors:\nstage of development, activity, risk and investment horizons play roles in the\nprivatization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2008 19:17:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Vahabi", "M.", ""], ["Jafari", "G.
