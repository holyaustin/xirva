This raises the important question of how\nsensitive such models might be to real-world effects that violate the\nassumptions. We show how the consequences of rational behavior caused by\nperverse incentives, as well as various irrational tendencies identified by\nbehavioral economists, can be systematically and consistently introduced into\nan agent-based model for a financial asset. This generates a class of models\nwhich, in the special case where such effects are absent, reduces to geometric\nBrownian motion --- the usual equilibrium pricing model. Thus we are able to\nnumerically perturb a widely-used equilibrium pricing model market and\ninvestigate its stability. The magnitude of such perturbations in real markets\ncan be estimated and the simulations imply that this is far outside the\nstability region of the equilibrium solution, which is no longer observed.\nIndeed the price fluctuations generated by endogenous dynamics, are in good\ngeneral agreement with the excess kurtosis and heteroskedasticity of actual\nasset prices. The methodology is presented within the context of a financial\nmarket. However, there are close links to concepts and theories from both\nmicro- and macro-economics including rational expectations, Soros' theory of\nreflexivity, and Minsky's theory of financial instability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Sep 2010 22:23:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Lamba", "Harbir", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0208", "submitter": "Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "authors": "Xavier Calbet, Jose-Luis Lopez and Ricardo Lopez-Ruiz", "title": "Equilibrium distributions and relaxation times in gas-like economic\n  models: an analytical derivation", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.83.036108", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN nlin.AO physics.data-an q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A step by step procedure to derive analytically the exact dynamical evolution\nequations of the probability density functions (PDF) of well known kinetic\nwealth exchange economic models is shown.

We present a\nmodel of long-run competitive markets to show that the multiplicity of\nbehaviors in an economic system, over a long time scale, emerge as statistical\nregularities (perfectly competitive markets obey Bose-Einstein statistics and\npurely monopolistic-competitive markets obey Boltzmann statistics) and that how\ninteraction among firms influences the evolutionary of competitive markets. It\nhas been widely accepted that perfect competition is most efficient. Our study\nshows that the perfectly competitive system, as an extreme case of competitive\nmarkets, is most efficient but not stable, and gives rise to economic crises as\nsociety reaches full employment. In the economic crisis revealed by our model,\nmany firms condense (collapse) into the lowest supply level (zero supply,\nnamely bankruptcy status), in analogy to Bose-Einstein condensation. This\ncurious phenomenon arises because perfect competition (homogeneous\ncompetitions) equals symmetric (indistinguishable) investment direction, a fact\nabhorred by nature. Therefore, we urge the promotion of monopolistic\ncompetition (heterogeneous competitions) rather than perfect competition. To\nprovide early warning of economic crises, we introduce a resolving index of\ninvestment, which approaches zero in the run-up to an economic crisis. On the\nother hand, our model discloses, as a profound conclusion, that the\ntechnological level for a long-run social or economic system is proportional to\nthe freedom (disorder) of this system; in other words, technology equals the\nentropy of system. As an application of this new concept, we give a possible\nanswer to the Needham question: \"Why was it that despite the immense\nachievements of traditional China it had been in Europe and not in China that\nthe scientific and industrial revolutions occurred?\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Oct 2010 12:27:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Tao", "Yong", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1994", "submitter": "Marcelo B.
