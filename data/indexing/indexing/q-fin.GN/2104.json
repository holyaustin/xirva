It uses a GAD approach.\n4. chapter examines the impediments that derail the intensive uptake of\neLearning programmes in a particular higher education institution. The study\nadopted an inductive research paradigm that followed a qualitative research\nstrategy. Data were collected by means of one-on-one in-depth interviews from\nselected faculty members at a nominated institution of higher learning. 5.\nchapter investigated the role of KMS in enhancing the export performance of\nfirms operating within the manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe. The study used a\nquantitative approach in which a survey questionnaire was distributed to 555\nmanagers drawn from 185 manufacturing firms based in Harare. Data analyses\ninvolved the use of descriptive statistics, Spearman correlations and\nregression analysis. In the sixth chapter, a survey was undertaken on 131 SMEs\nfrom the Pelagonija region in order to determine the current level of SME\ndigitalization within the region. It is aimed to compare with the EU average\nand to make conclusions on the impact of the SME digitalization on region GDP\ngrowth as well as revenues collection. The last chapter s purpose was to\ndevelop a measuring and modelling framework, an instrument of IBSQ for the\nSouth African banking sector. Snowball and convenience sampling, both\nnon-probability techniques were used to recruit participants for the study.

The results suggest that\nTBNV's growth dynamics are positively and strongly correlated with its web\nsearch traffic across the sample. This correlation is more robust when a\ncompany is a) more successful (in terms of valuation achieved) - especially if\nit is a \"unicorn\"; b) consumer-oriented (i.e., b2c); and 3) develops products\nin the form of a digital platform. Further analysis based on fuzzy-set\nQualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) shows that for the most successful\ncompanies (\"unicorns\") and consumer-oriented digital platforms (i.e., b2c\ndigital platform companies) proposed approach may be extremely reliable, while\nfor other high-growth TBNVs it is useful for analyzing their growth dynamics,\nalbeit to a more limited degree.

In this study,\nwe revisit the original models using the estimates of real GDP per capita and\nunemployment rate between 2010 and 2019. The initial results show that the\nchange in unemployment rate can be accurately predicted by variations in the\nrate of real economic growth. There is a discrete version of the model which is\nrepresented by a piece wise linear dependence of the annual increment in\nunemployment rate on the annual rate of change in real GDP per capita. The\nlengths of the country-dependent time segments are defined by breaks in the GDP\nmeasurement units associated with definitional revisions to the nominal GDP and\nGDP deflator (dGDP). The difference between the CPI and dGDP indices since the\nbeginning of measurements reveals the years of such breaks. Statistically, the\nlink between the studied variables in the revised models is characterized by\nthe coefficient of determination in the range from R2=0.866 (Australia) to\nR2=0.977 (France). The residual errors can be likely associated with the\nmeasurement errors, e.g. the estimates of real GDP per capita from various\nsources differ by tens of percent.

This paper presents\nfeatures in the distributions of S\\&P500 daily closing values and the\ncorresponding daily log returns over a long time interval, [03/01/1950 -\n22/08/2014], amounting to 16265 data points. We address the frequencies of the\nfirst, second, and first two significant digits counts and explore the\nconformance to Benford's laws of these distributions at five different (equal\nsize) levels of disaggregation. The log returns are studied for either positive\nor negative cases. The results for the S&P500 daily closing values are showing\na huge lack of non-conformity, whatever the different levels of disaggregation.\nSome \"first digits\" and \"first two digits\" values are even missing. The causes\nof this non-conformity are discussed, pointing to the danger in taking\nBenford's laws for granted in huge databases, whence drawing \"definite\nconclusions\". The agreements with Benford's laws are much better for the log\nreturns. Such a disparity in agreements finds an explanation in the data set\nitself: the inherent trend in the index. To further validate this, daily\nreturns have been simulated calibrating the simulations with the observed data\naverages and tested against Benford's laws. One finds that not only the trend\nbut also the standard deviation of the distributions are relevant parameters in\nconcluding about conformity with Benford's laws.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Apr 2021 08:31:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ausloos", "Marcel", ""], ["Ficcadenti", "Valerio", ""], ["Dhesi", "Gurjeet", ""], ["Shakeel", "Muhammad", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.11783", "submitter": "Yanci Zhang", "authors": "Yanci Zhang, Tianming Du, Yujie Sun, Lawrence Donohue, Rui Dai", "title": "Form 10-Q Itemization", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, http://review10q.ddns.net/", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IR econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  The quarterly financial statement, or Form 10-Q, is one of the most\nfrequently required filings for US public companies to disclose financial and\nother important business information.
