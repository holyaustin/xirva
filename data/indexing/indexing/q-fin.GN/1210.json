Quantitatively, distances enter into the\nso-called gravity models that successfully predict the weight of non-zero trade\nflows. However, it has been recently shown that gravity models fail to\nreproduce the binary topology of the World Trade Web. In this paper a different\napproach is presented: the formalism of exponential random graphs is used and\nthe distances are treated as constraints, to be imposed on a previously chosen\nensemble of graphs. Then, the information encoded in the geographical distances\nis used to explain the binary structure of the World Trade Web, by testing it\non the degree-degree correlations and the reciprocity structure. This leads to\nthe definition of a novel null model that combines spatial and non-spatial\neffects. The effectiveness of spatial constraints is compared to that of\nnonspatial ones by means of the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian\nInformation Criterion. Even if it is commonly believed that the World Trade Web\nis strongly dependent on the distances, what emerges from our analysis is that\ndistances do not play a crucial role in shaping the World Trade Web binary\nstructure and that the information encoded into the reciprocity is far more\nuseful in explaining the observed patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Oct 2012 15:23:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Oct 2012 15:46:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Picciolo", "Francesco", ""], ["Squartini", "Tiziano", ""], ["Ruzzenenti", "Franco", ""], ["Basosi", "Riccardo", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3324", "submitter": "M\\'at\\'e Csaba S\\'andor", "authors": "Imre Kondor, Istv\\'an Csabai, G\\'abor Papp, Enys Mones, G\\'abor\n  Czimbalmos, M\\'at\\'e Csaba S\\'andor", "title": "Strong random correlations in networks of heterogeneous agents", "comments": "28 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Correlations and other collective phenomena in a schematic model of\nheterogeneous binary agents (individual spin-glass samples) are considered on\nthe complete graph and also on 2d and 3d regular lattices.

Funding risk breaks the bilateral\nnature of the valuation formula. We find that the equation has a recursive\nform, making the introduction of a purely additive funding valuation adjustment\n(FVA) difficult.

We\ndefine a comprehensive framework that allows us to derive earlier results on\nfunding or counterparty risk as a special case, although our framework is more\nthan the sum of such special cases.

Under our model\nthere is a critical threshold for leverage; below it financial networks are\nalways stable, and above it the unstable region grows as leverage increases.\nThe financial system exhibits \"robust yet fragile\" behavior, with regions of\nthe parameter space where contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it\noccurs. Our model and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and\nprovide simple yet powerful tools for macroprudential stress testing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2012 18:13:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Shrestha", "Munik", ""], ["Moore", "Cristopher", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

We make three key statements to enhance understanding and communication\nabout ethanol production's impact on the food and fuel markets: (1) The amount\nof corn used to produce the ethanol in a gallon of regular gas would feed a\nperson for a day, (2) The production of ethanol is so energy intensive that it\nuses only 20% less fossil fuel than gasoline, and (3) The cost of gas made with\nethanol is actually higher per mile because ethanol reduces gasoline's energy\nper gallon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2012 22:46:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Albino", "Dominic K.", ""], ["Bertrand", "Karla Z.", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.6197", "submitter": "Marx Boopathi", "authors": "Marx Boopathi", "title": "Game Theory in Oligopoly", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "http://www.ijascse.in/publications-2012--2", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.GT q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The game theory techniques are used to find the equilibrium of a market.
