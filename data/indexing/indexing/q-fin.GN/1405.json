However, while the valuation of derivatives under\ncollateralisation (Piterbarg 2010, Piterbarg2012), under counterparty risk with\nunsecured funding costs (FVA) (Burgard2011, Burgard2011, Burgard2013) and in\nthe presence of regulatory capital (KVA) (Green2014) are established through\nvaluation adjustments, hitherto initial margin has not been considered. This\npaper further extends the semi-replication framework of (Burgard2013a), itself\nlater extended by (Green2014), to cover the cost of initial margin, leading to\nMargin Valuation Adjustment (MVA). Initial margin requirements are typically\ngenerated through the use of VAR or CVAR models. Given the form of MVA as an\nintegral over the expected initial margin profile this would lead to excessive\ncomputational costs if a brute force calculation were to be used. Hence we also\npropose a computationally efficient approach to the calculation of MVA through\nthe use of regression techniques, Longstaff-Schwartz Augmented Compression\n(LSAC).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 May 2014 20:49:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 18:27:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-13", "authors_parsed": [["Green", "Andrew", ""], ["Kenyon", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.0585", "submitter": "Ole Peters", "authors": "Ole Peters and Murray Gell-Mann", "title": "Evaluating gambles using dynamics", "comments": "11 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Chaos 26, 023103 (2016)", "doi": "10.1063/1.4940236", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC cond-mat.stat-mech q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gambles are random variables that model possible changes in monetary wealth.\nClassic decision theory transforms money into utility through a utility\nfunction and defines the value of a gamble as the expectation value of utility\nchanges.

Expectation\nvalue maximizers are defined as rational in economics, but expectation values\nare only meaningful in the presence of ensembles or in systems with ergodic\nproperties, whereas decision-makers have no access to ensembles and the\nvariables representing wealth in the usual growth models do not have the\nrelevant ergodic properties. Simultaneously addressing the shortcomings of\nutility and those of expectations, we propose to evaluate gambles by averaging\nwealth growth over time. No utility function is needed, but a dynamic must be\nspecified to compute time averages. Linear and logarithmic \"utility functions\"\nappear as transformations that generate ergodic observables for purely additive\nand purely multiplicative dynamics, respectively.
