Traditional solutions for\nstock prediction are based on time-series models. With the recent success of\ndeep neural networks in modeling sequential data, deep learning has become a\npromising choice for stock prediction. However, most existing deep learning\nsolutions are not optimized towards the target of investment, i.e., selecting\nthe best stock with the highest expected revenue. Specifically, they typically\nformulate stock prediction as a classification (to predict stock trend) or a\nregression problem (to predict stock price). More importantly, they largely\ntreat the stocks as independent of each other. The valuable signal in the rich\nrelations between stocks (or companies), such as two stocks are in the same\nsector and two companies have a supplier-customer relation, is not considered.\nIn this work, we contribute a new deep learning solution, named Relational\nStock Ranking (RSR), for stock prediction. Our RSR method advances existing\nsolutions in two major aspects: 1) tailoring the deep learning models for stock\nranking, and 2) capturing the stock relations in a time-sensitive manner. The\nkey novelty of our work is the proposal of a new component in neural network\nmodeling, named Temporal Graph Convolution, which jointly models the temporal\nevolution and relation network of stocks. To validate our method, we perform\nback-testing on the historical data of two stock markets, NYSE and NASDAQ.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our RSR method. It\noutperforms state-of-the-art stock prediction solutions achieving an average\nreturn ratio of 98% and 71% on NYSE and NASDAQ, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2018 12:48:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Jan 2019 12:34:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Fuli", ""], ["He", "Xiangnan", ""], ["Wang", "Xiang", ""], ["Luo", "Cheng", ""], ["Liu", "Yiqun", ""], ["Chua", "Tat-Seng", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.10566", "submitter": "Mark Whitmeyer", "authors": "Isaac M.
