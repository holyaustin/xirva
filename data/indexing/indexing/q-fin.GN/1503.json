In effect this means that a growth of one\npopulation, needs to be balanced by comparable reduction in populations of\nothers. In neutral models of biodiversity all populations are assumed to change\nincrementally due to stochastic births and deaths of individuals. Here we\npropose and model another redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe\ncollapses of the entire population of a single species freeing up resources for\nthe remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant e.g. for communities of\nbacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused e.g. by invading\nbacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an\nimportant role.\n  The emergent dynamics of our system is cyclic \"diversity waves\" triggered by\ncollapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at\nthe beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species\nabundances are characterized by a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the\nlower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced\nspecies, while the upper peak - species that has not yet collapsed in the\ncurrent wave. In most waves both upper and lower peaks are composed of several\nsmaller peaks. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term\nmemory transmitted across several waves. It gives rise to a scale-free tail of\nthe time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7.\nWe show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in\nthe rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments,\nspecies-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 14:03:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2015 18:39:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Maslov", "Sergei", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00621", "submitter": "Marco D'Errico", "authors": "Stefano Battiston, Marco D'Errico, Stefano Gurciullo, Guido Caldarelli", "title": "Leveraging the network: a stress-test framework based on DebtRank", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a novel stress-test framework to monitor systemic risk in\nfinancial systems.

First,\nthe framework allows to estimate and disentangle not only first-round effects\n(i.e. shock on external assets) and second-round effects (i.e. distress induced\nin the interbank network), but also third-round effects induced by possible\nfire sales. Second, it allows to monitor at the same time the impact of shocks\non individual or groups of financial institutions as well as their\nvulnerability to shocks on counterparties or certain asset classes. Third, it\nincludes estimates for loss distributions, thus combining network effects with\nfamiliar risk measures such as VaR and CVaR. Fourth, in order to perform\nrobustness analyses and cope with incomplete data, the framework features a\nmodule for the generation of sets of networks of interbank exposures that are\ncoherent with the total lending and borrowing of each bank. As an illustration,\nwe carry out a stress-test exercise on a dataset of listed European banks over\nthe years 2008-2013.
