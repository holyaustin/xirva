We\npropose an explicit and consistent framework for the valuation of insurance\nliabilities which incorporates the Solvency II approach as a special case.\n  The proposed framework is based on dynamic replication over multiple\n(one-year) time periods by a portfolio of assets with reliable market prices,\nallowing for \"limited liability\" in the sense that the replication can in\ngeneral not always be continued. The asset portfolio consist of two parts: (1)\nassets whose market price defines the value of the insurance liabilities, and\n(2) capital funds used to cover risk which cannot be replicated. The capital\nfunds give rise to capital costs; the main exogenous input of the framework is\nthe condition on when the investment of the capital funds is acceptable.\n  We investigate existence of the value and show that the exact calculation of\nthe value has to be done recursively backwards in time, starting at the end of\nthe lifetime of the insurance liabilities. The main question only partially\nconsidered in this paper is the uniqueness of the value. We derive upper bounds\non the value and, for the special case of replication by risk-free one-year\nzero-coupon bonds, explicit recursive formulas for calculating the value.\n  Valuation in Solvency II and IFRS 4 is based on representing the value as a\nsum of a \"best estimate\" and a \"risk margin\". In our framework, it turns out\nthat this split is not natural. Nonetheless, we show that a split can be\nconstructed as a simplification, and that it provides an upper bound on the\nvalue under suitable conditions. We illustrate the general results by\nexplicitly calculating the value for a simple example.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 13:04:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moehr", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1148", "submitter": "Garfield Brown", "authors": "Winston Buckley and Garfield Brown and Mario Marshall", "title": "A Mispricing Model of Stocks Under Asymmetric Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend the theory of asymmetric information in mispricing models for\nstocks following geometric Brownian motion to constant relative risk averse\ninvestors.

Here, we deviate from this tradition and look instead at the structure\nof output embodied in the network connecting countries to the products that\nthey export.We characterize this network using four structural features: the\nnegative relationship between the diversification of a country and the average\nubiquity of its exports, and the non-normal distributions for product ubiquity,\ncountry diversification and product co-export. We model the structure of the\nnetwork by assuming that products require a large number of non-tradable\ninputs, or capabilities, and that countries differ in the completeness of the\nset of capabilities they have. We solve the model assuming that the probability\nthat a country has a capability and that a product requires a capability are\nconstant and calibrate it to the data to find that it accounts well for all of\nthe network features except for the heterogeneity in the distribution of\ncountry diversification. In the light of the model, this is evidence of a large\nheterogeneity in the distribution of capabilities across countries. Finally, we\nshow that the model implies that the increase in diversification that is\nexpected from the accumulation of a small number of capabilities is small for\ncountries that have a few of them and large for those with many. This implies\nthat the forces that help drive divergence in product diversity increase with\nthe complexity of the global economy when capabilities travel poorly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Jan 2011 05:03:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 29 Feb 2012 22:56:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hausmann", "Ricardo", ""], ["Hidalgo", "Cesar A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.3617", "submitter": "Anindya Sundar Chakrabarti", "authors": "Anindya S.
