Indeed, prominent voices have argued that the scientific\nreproducibility crisis or inaction to the threat of global warming represent\ninstances of such competition induced corruption. Moreover, competing\nindividuals often report that competitive pressures limit their ability to act\naccording to the societal goal, suggesting lock-in. However, despite the\nprofound implications, we lack a coherent theory of such a process. Here we\npropose such a theory, formalized as an agent based model, integrating insights\nfrom complex systems theory, contest theory, behavioral economics and cultural\nevolution theory.
