However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and\nanti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects\nin agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing\nmicroscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters\nfrom empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results.\n  Methods: To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility\ncorrelation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and\ncollective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based\nmodel. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and\nparticularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors' asymmetric\ntrading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we\npropose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from\nhistorical market data.\n  Results: With the model parameters determined for six representative\nstock-market indices in the world respectively, we obtain the corresponding\nleverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in\nagreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time,\nour model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail\ndistribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities.\n  Conclusions: We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both\nthe investors' asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation\nmechanisms. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the\ndetermination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems\nwith similar asymmetries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Jul 2014 09:22:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jun-jie", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""], ["Tan", "Lei", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.5305", "submitter": "Christoph Aymanns", "authors": "Christoph Aymanns, J.

The Value-at-Risk constraint implies that when perceived risk is low,\nleverage is high and vice versa, a phenomenon that has been dubbed pro-cyclical\nleverage. We show that this leads to endogenous irregular oscillations, in\nwhich gradual increases in stock prices and leverage are followed by drastic\nmarket collapses, i.e. a leverage cycle. This phenomenon is studied using\nsimplified models that give a deeper understanding of the dynamics and the\nnature of the feedback loops and instabilities underlying the leverage cycle.\nWe introduce a flexible leverage regulation policy in which it is possible to\ncontinuously tune from pro-cyclical to countercyclical leverage. When the\npolicy is sufficiently countercyclical and bank risk is sufficiently low the\nendogenous oscillation disappears and prices go to a fixed point. While there\nis always a leverage ceiling above which the dynamics are unstable,\ncountercyclical leverage can be used to raise the ceiling. We also study the\nimpact on leverage cycles of direct, temporal control of the bank's riskiness\nvia the bank's required Value-at-Risk quantile. Under such a rule the regulator\nrelaxes the Value-at-Risk quantile following a negative stock price shock and\ntightens it following a positive shock. While such a policy rule can reduce the\namplitude of leverage cycles, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the\nchoice of parameters.
