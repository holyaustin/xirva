Consequently, much research has\naimed at understanding, identifying and forecasting crashes and rebounds in\nfinancial markets. The Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model provides an\noperational framework to understand and diagnose financial bubbles from\nrational expectations and was recently extended to negative bubbles and\nrebounds. Using the JLS model, we develop an alarm index based on an advanced\npattern recognition method with the aim of detecting bubbles and performing\nforecasts of market crashes and rebounds. Testing our methodology on 10 major\nglobal equity markets, we show quantitatively that our developed alarm performs\nmuch better than chance in forecasting market crashes and rebounds. We use the\nderived signal to develop elementary trading strategies that produce\nstatistically better performances than a simple buy and hold strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jul 2011 15:15:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Wanfeng", ""], ["Rebib", "Reda", ""], ["Woodard", "Ryan", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0099", "submitter": "Vladimir Filimonov", "authors": "Vladimir Filimonov, Didier Sornette", "title": "A Stable and Robust Calibration Scheme of the Log-Periodic Power Law\n  Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Filimonov, V., Sornette, D.

The\ntransformation significantly decreases the complexity of the fitting procedure\nand improves its stability tremendously because the modified cost function is\nnow characterized by good smooth properties with in general a single minimum in\nthe case where the model is appropriate to the empirical data. We complement\nthe approach with an additional subordination procedure that slaves two of the\nnonlinear parameters to what can be considered to be the most crucial nonlinear\nparameter, the critical time $t_c$ defined as the end of the bubble and the\nmost probably time for a crash to occur. This further decreases the complexity\nof the search and provides an intuitive representation of the results of the\ncalibration. With our proposed methodology, metaheuristic searches are not\nlonger necessary and one can resort solely to rigorous controlled local search\nalgorithms, leading to dramatic increase in efficiency.

Analyzing the\nkinetic equation for the wealth distribution P(w,t), general properties are\nderived for arbitrary return distributions pi(kappa). If the geometrical\naverage of the gain is larger than one, i.e. if <ln eta> >0, in the long time\nlimit a nontrivial equilibrium wealth distribution P(w) is attained.

This concentration\nphenomenon happens even if the average return <kappa> of the poor agent is\npositive. In the stable phase, P(w) behaves as w^{(T-1)} for w -> 0, and we\nfind T exactly. This exponent is nonzero in the stable phase but goes to zero\non approach to the condensation interface. The exact wealth distribution can be\nobtained analytically for the particular case of Kelly betting, and it turns\nout to be exponential. We show, however, that our model is never reversible, no\nmatter what pi(kappa) is. In the condensing phase, the wealth of an agent with\nrelative rank x is found to be w(x,t) \\sim e^{x t <ln eta>} for finite times t.\nThe wealth distribution is consequently P(w) \\sim 1/w for finite times, while\nall wealth ends up in the hands of a single agent for large times.

In physical\nsystems, the energy exchange among molecules leads to a state of equipartition\nof the energy and to an equilibrium situation where the entropy is a maximum.\nOn the other hand, in the majority of exchange models, the system converges to\na very unequal condensed state, where one or a few agents concentrate all the\nwealth of the society while the wide majority of agents shares zero or almost\nzero fraction of the wealth. So, in those economic systems a minimum entropy\nstate is attained. We propose here an analytical model where we investigate the\neffects of a particular class of economic exchanges that minimize the entropy.\nBy solving the model we discuss the conditions that can drive the system to a\nstate of minimum entropy, as well as the mechanisms to recover a kind of\nequipartition of wealth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 19:52:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Iglesias", "J.
