The incompleteness\nfeatured in our setting - the source of which can be thought of as a credit\nevent or a catastrophe - is genuine in the sense that not only the prices, but\nalso the family of replicable claims itself is determined as a part of the\nequilibrium. Consequently, equilibrium allocations are not necessarily Pareto\noptimal and the related representative-agent techniques cannot be used.\nInstead, we follow a novel route based on new stability results for a class of\nsemilinear partial differential equations related to the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the agents' utility-maximization problems.\nThis approach leads to a reformulation of the problem where the Banach fixed\npoint theorem can be used not only to show existence and uniqueness, but also\nto provide a simple and efficient numerical procedure for its computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2009 04:17:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2010 11:41:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Zitkovic", "Gordan", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1462", "submitter": "Matteo Marsili", "authors": "Matteo Marsili", "title": "Spiraling toward market completeness and financial instability", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  I study the limit of a large random economy, where a set of consumers invests\nin financial instruments engineered by banks, in order to optimize their future\nconsumption. This exercise shows that, even in the ideal case of perfect\ncompetition, where full information is available to all market participants,\nthe equilibrium develops a marked vulnerability (or susceptibility) to market\nimperfections, as markets approach completeness and transaction costs vanish.\nThe decrease in transaction costs arises because financial institutions exploit\ntrading instruments to hedge other instruments. This entails trading volumes in\nthe interbank market which diverge in the limit of complete markets.\n  These results suggest that the proliferation of financial instruments\nexacerbates the effects of market imperfections, calling for theories of market\nas interacting systems. From a different perspective, in order to prevent an\nescalation of perverse effects, markets may necessitate institutional\nstructures which are more and more conspicuous as their complexity expands.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2009 10:28:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Marsili", "Matteo", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.1512", "submitter": "Matteo Marsili", "authors": "Davide Fiaschi and Matteo Marsili", "title": "Economic interactions and the distribution of wealth", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure.

The\nequilibrium distribution of wealth is explicitly calculated and its shape\ncrucially depends on market incompleteness. In particular, a Paretian law in\nthe top tail only arises if capital markets are incomplete. The Pareto exponent\ndepends on the saving rate, on the net return on capital, on the growth rate of\npopulation and on portfolio diversification. On the contrary, the\ncharacteristics of the labour market mostly affects the bottom tail of the\ndistribution of wealth.
