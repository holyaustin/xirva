Thus, the\nFinancial Conduct Authority (FCA) succeeded the Financial Services Authority\n(FSA). An area requiring an improvement in regulation was insider trading. Our\nstudy examines the effectiveness of the FCA in its duty of regulating insider\ntrading through utilising the event study methodology to assess abnormal\nreturns in the run-up to the first announcement of mergers. Samples of abnormal\nreturns are examined on periods, under regulation either by the FSA or by the\nFCA. Practically, stock price data on the London Stock Exchange from 2008-2012\nand 2015-2019 is investigated. The results from this study determine that\nabnormal returns are reduced after the implementation of the Financial Services\nAct 2012; prices are also found to be noisier in the period before the 2012\nAct. Insignificant abnormal returns are found in the run-up to the first\nannouncement of mergers in the 2015-2019 period.
