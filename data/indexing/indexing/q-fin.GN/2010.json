Our model is applicable to a wide range\nof base models, capable of extracting complex patterns, while mitigating the\noverfitting and instability issues for financial market prediction.

This reduces the risk of\nexposing sensitive data, but it is still possible to reverse engineer\ninformation about a client's private data set from communicated model\nparameters. Most federated learning systems therefore use differential privacy\nto introduce noise to the parameters. This adds uncertainty to any attempt to\nreveal private client data, but also reduces the accuracy of the shared model,\nlimiting the useful scale of privacy-preserving noise. A system can further\nreduce the coordinating server's ability to recover private client information,\nwithout additional accuracy loss, by also including secure multiparty\ncomputation. An approach combining both techniques is especially relevant to\nfinancial firms as it allows new possibilities for collaborative learning\nwithout exposing sensitive client data.
