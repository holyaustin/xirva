Here we study how the\nstandard scenario is affected in a mixed population game in which agents with\nthe `optimal' learning rule (i.e. the one leading to efficiency) coexist with\nones whose adaptive dynamics is sub-optimal. Our generic finding is that any\nnon-vanishing intensive fraction of optimal agents guarantees the existence of\nan efficient phase. Specifically, we calculate the dependence of the critical\npoint on the fraction $q$ of `optimal' agents focusing our analysis on three\ncases: MGs with market impact correction, grand-canonical MGs and MGs with\nheterogeneous comfort levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Dec 2007 16:25:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Galla", "Tobias", ""], ["De Martino", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2088", "submitter": "Byron Bell", "authors": "Byron E.
