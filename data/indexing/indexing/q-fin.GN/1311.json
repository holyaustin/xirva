The set of nested models starts with a simplistic\nversion without autoregressive terms and one lagged term of explanatory\nvariable. The lag is determined empirically together with all coefficients.

The rate of CPI\ninflation is predicted with RMSFE=1.5% per year. For the naive (no change)\nforecast, RMSFE at the same time horizon is 2.95% and 3.3% per year,\nrespectively. Our model outperforms the naive one by a factor of 2 to 3. The\nrelationships for inflation were successfully tested for cointegration. We have\nformally estimated several vector error correction (VEC) models for two\nmeasures of inflation. At a four year horizon, the estimated VECMs provide\nsignificant statistical improvements on the results obtained by the BEM:\nRMSFE=0.8% per year for the GDP deflator and ~1.2% per year for CPI.
