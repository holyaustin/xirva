The\nsystem is modeled in the form of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM), in which nodes\nrepresent vulnerability in segments and links their interconnectedness. A main\nproblem tackled in this paper is the aggregation of values in different\ninterrelated nodes of the network to obtain an estimate systemic risk. To this\nend, the Choquet integral is employed for aggregating expert evaluations of\nmeasures, as it allows for the integration of interrelations among factors in\nthe aggregation process. The approach is illustrated through two applications\nin a European setting. First, we provide an estimation of systemic risk with a\nof pan-European set-up.
