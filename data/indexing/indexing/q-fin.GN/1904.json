One of the key elements to answer\nthis question is to understand metastable features of the economic networks.\nIsing model has been suggested for studying such features in the literature. In\nthe homogenous networks one needs at least a minimum activation, forcing an\nIsing network to switch its local equilibria, where such minimum is independent\nof the nodes characteristics.

Despite\nregular networks, in the scale free networks, the stimulation cost depends on\nthe networks features such as assortativity.
