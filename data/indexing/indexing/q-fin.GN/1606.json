The\nmain goal of this thesis is to highlight the need for frameworks that take into\naccount the complex structure of labor market interactions. In particular, we\nexplore the benefits of leveraging tools from computational social science,\nnetwork science, and data-driven theories to measure the flow of opportunities\nand information in the context of the labor market. First, we investigate our\nkey hypothesis, which is that opportunity/information flow through weak ties,\nand this is a key determinant of the length of unemployment. We then extend the\nidea of opportunity/information flow to clusters of other economic activities,\nwhere we expect the flow within clusters of related activities to be higher\nthan within isolated activities. This captures the intuition that within\nrelated activities there are more \"capitals\" involved and that such activities\nrequire similar \"capabilities.\" Therefore, more extensive clusters of economic\nactivities should generate greater growth through exploiting the greater flow\nof opportunities and information. We quantify the opportunity/information flow\nusing a complexity measure of two economic activities (i.e. jobs and exports).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 05:35:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Almaatouq", "Abdullah", ""]]}]
