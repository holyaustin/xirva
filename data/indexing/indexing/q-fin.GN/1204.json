This event followed other recent IPOs in the world of social\nnetworking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a\nvaluation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became\none of the biggest web IPOs since Google. This recent enthusiasm for social\nnetworking companies raises the question whether they are overvalued. Indeed,\nduring the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its\nmarket capitalization going from 5.6 to 10.2 billion USD, hinting at a possible\nirrational behavior from the market. To bring substance to the debate, we\npropose a two-tiered approach to compute the intrinsic value of Zynga. First,\nwe introduce a new model to forecast its user base, based on the individual\ndynamics of its major games. Next, we model the revenues per user using a\nlogistic function, a standard model for growth in competition. This allows us\nto bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and\n4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario\nrespectively. This suggests that Zynga has been overpriced ever since its IPO.\nFinally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the\narXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this\nherding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important\ncoming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th,\n2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). On\nthe long term, our analysis indicates that Zynga's price should decrease\nsignificantly. The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24th,\n2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted\nthe downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2012 09:07:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 18:13:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 May 2012 14:03:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Forr\u00f3", "Zal\u00e1n", ""], ["Cauwels", "Peter", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0922", "submitter": "Fabio Caccioli", "authors": "Fabio Caccioli, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud, J.
