It is also often\nreferred to as the fear index or the fear gauge. The current VIX index value\nquotes the expected annualized change in the SP 500 index over the following 30\ndays, based on options-based theory and current options-market data. Despite\nits theoretical foundation in option price theory, CBOE's Volatility Index is\nprone to inadvertent and deliberate errors because it is weighted average of\nout-of-the-money calls and puts which could be illiquid. Many claims of market\nmanipulation have been brought up against VIX in recent years.\n  This paper discusses several approaches to replicate the VIX index as well as\nVIX futures by using a subset of relevant options as well as neural networks\nthat are trained to automatically learn the underlying formula. Using subset\nselection approaches on top of the original CBOE methodology, as well as\nbuilding machine learning and neural network models including Random Forests,\nSupport Vector Machines, feed-forward neural networks, and long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) models, we will show that a small number of options is sufficient\nto replicate the VIX index. Once we are able to actually replicate the VIX\nusing a small number of SP options we will be able to exploit potential\narbitrage opportunities between the VIX index and its underlying derivatives.\nThe results are supposed to help investors to better understand the options\nmarket, and more importantly, to give guidance to the US regulators and CBOE\nthat have been investigating those manipulation claims for several years.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Feb 2021 15:49:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hirsa", "Ali", ""], ["Osterrieder", "Joerg", ""], ["Misheva", "Branka Hadji", ""], ["Cao", "Wenxin", ""], ["Fu", "Yiwen", ""], ["Sun", "Hanze", ""], ["Wong", "Kin Wai", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.02176", "submitter": "Zachary Feinstein", "authors": "Zachary Feinstein", "title": "Clearing prices under margin calls and the short squeeze", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.GN q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we propose a clearing model for prices in a financial markets\ndue to margin calls on short sold assets.

Here, we use the urban scaling framework to study an important,\nbut under-explored feature in this community - income inequality. We propose a\nnew method to study the scaling of income distributions by analyzing total\nincome scaling in population percentiles. We show that income in the least\nwealthy decile (10%) scales close to linearly with city population, while\nincome in the most wealthy decile scale with a significantly superlinear\nexponent. In contrast to the superlinear scaling of total income with city\npopulation, this decile scaling illustrates that the benefits of larger cities\nare increasingly unequally distributed. For the poorest income deciles, cities\nhave no positive effect over the null expectation of a linear increase. We\nrepeat our analysis after adjusting income by housing cost, and find similar\nresults. We then further analyze the shapes of income distributions. First, we\nfind that mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of income distributions all\nincrease with city size. Second, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a\ncity's income distribution and that of the largest city decreases with city\npopulation, suggesting the overall shape of income distribution shifts with\ncity population. As most urban scaling theories consider densifying\ninteractions within cities as the fundamental process leading to the\nsuperlinear increase of many features, our results suggest this effect is only\nseen in the upper deciles of the cities. Our finding encourages future work to\nconsider heterogeneous models of interactions to form a more coherent\nunderstanding of urban scaling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2021 20:13:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mora", "Elisa Heinrich", ""], ["Jackson", "Jacob J.", ""], ["Heine", "Cate", ""], ["West", "Geoffrey B.", ""], ["Yang", "Vicky Chuqiao", ""], ["Kempes", "Christopher P.", ""]]}]
