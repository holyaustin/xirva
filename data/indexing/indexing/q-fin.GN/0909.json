We obtain new explicit optimal impulse control strategies that\naccount for these market reactions, and show that they cannot be obtained\nsimply by adjusting the intervention cost in a model without market reactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Sep 2009 05:01:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kercheval", "Alec N.", ""], ["Moreno", "Juan F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1974", "submitter": "Anirban Chakraborti", "authors": "Anirban Chakraborti, Ioane Muni Toke, Marco Patriarca and Frederic\n  Abergel", "title": "Econophysics: Empirical facts and agent-based models", "comments": "51 pages REVTeX format, review paper submitted to Quantitative\n  Finance", "journal-ref": "Quantitative Finance 11, 991-1012 (2011); Quantitative Finance 11,\n  1013-1041 (2011)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.ST q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article aims at reviewing recent empirical and theoretical developments\nusually grouped under the term Econophysics. Since its name was coined in 1995\nby merging the words Economics and Physics, this new interdisciplinary field\nhas grown in various directions: theoretical macroeconomics (wealth\ndistributions), microstructure of financial markets (order book modelling),\neconometrics of financial bubbles and crashes, etc. In the first part of the\nreview, we discuss on the emergence of Econophysics. Then we present empirical\nstudies revealing statistical properties of financial time series. We begin the\npresentation with the widely acknowledged stylized facts which describe the\nreturns of financial assets- fat tails, volatility clustering, autocorrelation,\netc.- and recall that some of these properties are directly linked to the way\ntime is taken into account. We continue with the statistical properties\nobserved on order books in financial markets. For the sake of illustrating this\nreview, (nearly) all the stated facts are reproduced using our own\nhigh-frequency financial database. Finally, contributions to the study of\ncorrelations of assets such as random matrix theory and graph theory are\npresented. In the second part of the review, we deal with models in\nEconophysics through the point of view of agent-based modelling. Amongst a\nlarge number of multi-agent-based models, we have identified three\nrepresentative areas. First, using previous work originally presented in the\nfields of behavioural finance and market microstructure theory, econophysicists\nhave developed agent-based models of order-driven markets that are extensively\npresented here. Second, kinetic theory models designed to explain some\nempirical facts on wealth distribution are reviewed. Third, we briefly\nsummarize game theory models by reviewing the now classic minority game and\nrelated problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 15:25:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 13:43:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborti", "Anirban", ""], ["Toke", "Ioane Muni", ""], ["Patriarca", "Marco", ""], ["Abergel", "Frederic", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3482", "submitter": "Stefan Thurner", "authors": "Stefan Thurner, Peter Klimek, Rudolf Hanel", "title": "Schumpeterian economic dynamics as a quantifiable minimum model of\n  evolution", "comments": "21 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/12/7/075029", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a simple quantitative model of Schumpeterian economic dynamics.\nNew goods and services are endogenously produced through combinations of\nexisting goods. As soon as new goods enter the market they may compete against\nalready existing goods, in other words new products can have destructive\neffects on existing goods. As a result of this competition mechanism existing\ngoods may be driven out from the market - often causing cascades of secondary\ndefects (Schumpeterian gales of destruction). The model leads to a generic\ndynamics characterized by phases of relative economic stability followed by\nphases of massive restructuring of markets - which could be interpreted as\nSchumpeterian business `cycles'. Model timeseries of product diversity and\nproductivity reproduce several stylized facts of economics timeseries on long\ntimescales such as GDP or business failures, including non-Gaussian fat tailed\ndistributions, volatility clustering etc. The model is phrased in an open,\nnon-equilibrium setup which can be understood as a self organized critical\nsystem. Its diversity dynamics can be understood by the time-varying topology\nof the active production networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Sep 2009 16:35:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Thurner", "Stefan", ""], ["Klimek", "Peter", ""], ["Hanel", "Rudolf", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3655", "submitter": "Roman Naryshkin", "authors": "Roman Naryshkin and Matt Davison", "title": "Utility Function and Optimum Consumption in the models with Habit\n  Formation and Catching up with the Joneses", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper analyzes popular time-nonseparable utility functions that describe\n\"habit formation\" consumer preferences comparing current consumption with the\ntime averaged past consumption of the same individual and \"catching up with the\nJoneses\" (CuJ) models comparing individual consumption with a cross-sectional\naverage consumption level.\n  Few of these models give reasonable optimum consumption time series.

As people and\nfirms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases,\nsuggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of\nindividual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the\ninteractions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and\ndevelopment that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy\nby interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are\nconnected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify\nthe complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this\nnetwork. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are\ncorrelated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this\nrelationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend\nto converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their\nproductive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on\ngenerating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge in order to\ngenerate sustained growth and prosperity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2009 02:08:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hidalgo", "Cesar A.", ""], ["Hausmann", "Ricardo", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3984", "submitter": "Subhrangshu Sekhar Manna", "authors": "Abhijit Chakraborty and S.
