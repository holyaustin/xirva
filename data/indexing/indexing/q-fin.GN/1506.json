Our hypotheses are\nthat the use of trade credit contributes to contagion (from many customers to a\nsingle supplier - \"many to one\" contagion) and amplification (through their\ninteraction with the macrocopic variables, such as interest rate) of growth\nrate. In this paper we test the contagion hypothesis, measuring empirically the\nmesoscopic \"many-to-one\" effect. The effect of amplification has been dealt\nwith in another paper.\n  Our empirical analysis is based on the delayed payments between trading\npartners across many different industrial sectors, intermediated by a large\nItalian bank during the year 2007. The data is used to create a weighted and\ndirected trade credit network. Assuming that the linkages are static, we look\nat the dynamics of the nodes/firms. On the ratio of the 2007 trade credit in\nSales and Purchases items on the profit and loss statements, we estimate the\ntrade credit in 2006 and 2008.\n  Applying the \"many to one\" approach we compare such predicted growth of trade\n(demand) aggregated per supplier, and compare it with the real growth of Sales\nof the supplier. We analyze the correlation of these two growth rates over two\nyearly periods, 2007/2006 and 2008/2007, and in this way we test our contagion\nhypotheses. We could not find strong correlations between the predicted and the\nactual growth rates. We provide an evidence of contagion only in restricted\nsub-groups of our network, and not in the whole network. We do find a strong\nmacroscopic effect of the crisis, indicated by a coincident negative drift in\nthe growth of sales of nearly all the firms in our sample.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 21:28:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Golo", "Natasa", ""], ["Kelman", "Guy", ""], ["Bree", "David S.", ""], ["Usher", "Leanne", ""], ["Lamieri", "Marco", ""], ["Solomon", "Sorin", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03414", "submitter": "Alexander Adamou", "authors": "Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou", "title": "An evolutionary advantage of cooperation", "comments": "16 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO q-bio.PE q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cooperation is a persistent behavioral pattern of entities pooling and\nsharing resources. Its ubiquity in nature poses a conundrum. Whenever two\nentities cooperate, one must willingly relinquish something of value to the\nother. Why is this apparent altruism favored in evolution? Classical solutions\nassume a net fitness gain in a cooperative transaction which, through\nreciprocity or relatedness, finds its way back from recipient to donor. We seek\nthe source of this fitness gain. Our analysis rests on the insight that\nevolutionary processes are typically multiplicative and noisy. Fluctuations\nhave a net negative effect on the long-time growth rate of resources but no\neffect on the growth rate of their expectation value. This is an example of\nnon-ergodicity. By reducing the amplitude of fluctuations, pooling and sharing\nincreases the long-time growth rate for cooperating entities, meaning that\ncooperators outgrow similar non-cooperators. We identify this increase in\ngrowth rate as the net fitness gain, consistent with the concept of geometric\nmean fitness in the biological literature. This constitutes a fundamental\nmechanism for the evolution of cooperation. Its minimal assumptions make it a\ncandidate explanation of cooperation in settings too simple for other fitness\ngains, such as emergent function and specialization, to be probable. One such\nexample is the transition from single cells to early multicellular life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 18:04:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 May 2018 15:26:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Ole", ""], ["Adamou", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.03708", "submitter": "Adri\\'an Carro", "authors": "Adri\\'an Carro, Ra\\'ul Toral, Maxi San Miguel", "title": "Markets, herding and response to external information", "comments": "30 pages, 8 figures.

This risk not only depends on the two parties involved, but also on\nthe risk from various other contracts each of these parties holds. In rather\ninformal markets, such as the OTC (over-the-counter) derivative market,\ninstitutions only report their aggregated quarterly risk exposure, but no\ndetails about their counterparties. Hence, little is known about the\ndiversification of counterparty risk. In this paper, we reconstruct the\nweighted and time-dependent network of counterparty risk in the OTC derivatives\nmarket of the United States between 1998 and 2012. To proxy unknown bilateral\nexposures, we first study the co-occurrence patterns of institutions based on\ntheir quarterly activity and ranking in the official report. The network\nobtained this way is further analysed by a weighted k-core decomposition, to\nreveal a core-periphery structure. This allows us to compare the activity-based\nranking with a topology-based ranking, to identify the most important\ninstitutions and their mutual dependencies. We also analyse correlations in\nthese activities, to show strong similarities in the behavior of the core\ninstitutions. Our analysis clearly demonstrates the clustering of counterparty\nrisk in a small set of about a dozen US banks. This not only increases the\ndefault risk of the central institutions, but also the default risk of\nperipheral institutions which have contracts with the central ones. Hence, all\ninstitutions indirectly have to bear (part of) the counterparty risk of all\nothers, which needs to be better reflected in the price of OTC derivatives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 16:49:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 15:07:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Nanumyan", "Vahan", ""], ["Garas", "Antonios", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.05418", "submitter": "Yong Tao", "authors": "Yong Tao", "title": "Universal Laws of Human Society's Income Distribution", "comments": "Newtonian equations in Economic system", "journal-ref": "Physica A 435 (2015) 89-94", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2015.05.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  General equilibrium equations in economics play the same role with many-body\nNewtonian equations in physics.

In this model, each financial agent is characterized by its\nresilience to the interest rate. Above a certain rate the interest due on the\nfirm's financial costs exceeds its earnings and the firm becomes susceptible to\nfailure (ponzi). For the interest rate levels under a certain threshold level,\nthe firm loans are smaller then its earnings and the firm becomes 'hedge.' In\nthis paper, we fit the historical data (2002-2009) on interest rate data into\nour model, in order to predict the number of the ponzi firms. We compare the\nprediction with the data taken from a large panel of Italian firms over a\nperiod of 9 years. We then use trade credit linkages to discuss the connection\nbetween the ponzi density and the network percolation.\n  We find that the 'top-down'-'bottom-up' positive feedback loop accounts for\nmost of the Minsky crisis accelerator dynamics. The peer-to-peer ponzi\ncompanies contagion becomes significant only in the last stage of the crisis\nwhen the ponzi density is above a critical value. Moreover the ponzi contagion\nis limited only to the companies that were not dynamic enough to substitute\ntheir distressed clients with new ones.
