Although\nmany academics, practitioners and policy makers have studied questions related\nto collapsing asset price bubbles, there is little consensus yet about their\ncauses and effects. This review and essay evaluates some of the hypotheses\noffered to explain the market crashes that often follow asset price bubbles.\nStarting from historical accounts and syntheses of past bubbles and crashes, we\nput the problem in perspective with respect to the development of the efficient\nmarket hypothesis. We then present the models based on heterogeneous agents and\nthe limits to arbitrage that prevent rational agents from bursting bubbles\nbefore they inflate. Then, we explore another set of explanations of why\nrational traders would be led to actually profit from and surf on bubbles, by\nanticipating the behavior of noise traders or by realizing the difficulties in\nsynchronizing their actions. We then end by discussing a complex system\napproach of social imitation leading to collective market regimes like herding\nand the phenomenon of bifurcation (or phase transition) that rationalize what\ncrash can occur in unstable market regimes. The key insight is that diagnosing\nbubbles may be feasible when taking into account the positive feedback\nmechanisms that give rise to transient \"super-exponential\" price growth, the\nbubbles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 18:25:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kaizoji", "T.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2664", "submitter": "Marcelo B.

Yearly samples available from 1978 to 2005 were studied\nand evidence was found that the complementary cumulative distribution of\npersonal income for 99% of the economically less favorable population is well\nrepresented by a Gompertz curve of the form $G(x)=\\exp [\\exp (A-Bx)]$, where\n$x$ is the normalized individual income. The complementary cumulative\ndistribution of the remaining 1% richest part of the population is well\nrepresented by a Pareto power law distribution $P(x)= \\beta x^{-\\alpha}$. This\nresult means that similarly to other countries, Brazil's income distribution is\ncharacterized by a well defined two class system. The parameters $A$, $B$,\n$\\alpha$, $\\beta$ were determined by a mixture of boundary conditions,\nnormalization and fitting methods for every year in the time span of this\nstudy. Since the Gompertz curve is characteristic of growth models, its\npresence here suggests that these patterns in income distribution could be a\nconsequence of the growth dynamics of the underlying economic system. In\naddition, we found out that the percentage share of both the Gompertzian and\nParetian components relative to the total income shows an approximate cycling\npattern with periods of about 4 years and whose maximum and minimum peaks in\neach component alternate at about every 2 years. This finding suggests that the\ngrowth dynamics of Brazil's economic system might possibly follow a\nGoodwin-type class model dynamics based on the application of the\nLotka-Volterra equation to economic growth and cycle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Dec 2008 13:04:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Moura", "Newton J.", "Jr."], ["Ribeiro", "Marcelo B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3378", "submitter": "Uwe Krey", "authors": "U.
