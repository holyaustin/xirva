Remarkably enough sensible regional aggregations show up with the\nJapanese and the US clusters dominating the community structure, although the\npresence of a geographically mixed community points to a gradual convergence of\nbanks into similar supranational practices.

In the\nNLF model the consumer price index (CPI) exhibits a finite time singularity of\nthe type $1/(t_c -t)^{(1- \\beta)/\\beta}$, with $\\beta>0$, predicting a blow up\nof the economy at a critical time $t_c$. However, this model fails in\ndetermining $t_c$ in the case of weak hyperinflation regimes like, e.g., that\noccurred in Israel. To overcome this trouble, the NLF model is extended by\nintroducing a parameter $\\gamma$, which multiplies all therms with past growth\nrate index (GRI). In this novel approach the solution for CPI is also analytic\nbeing proportional to the Gaussian hypergeometric function\n$_2F_1(1/\\beta,1/\\beta,1+1/\\beta;z)$, where $z$ is a function of $\\beta$,\n$\\gamma$, and $t_c$. For $z \\to 1$ this hypergeometric function diverges\nleading to a finite time singularity, from which a value of $t_c$ can be\ndetermined. This singularity is also present in GRI. It is shown that the\ninterplay between parameters $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ may produce phenomena of\nmultiple equilibria. An analysis of the severe hyperinflation occurred in\nHungary proves that the novel model is robust. When this model is used for\nexamining data of Israel a reasonable $t_c$ is got.
