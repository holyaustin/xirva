Asset backed securities have been\nextensively criticised for creating a moral hazard in loan issuance and an\nassociated increase in default risk, by removing the immediate lender's\nincentive to ensure that the underlying loans could be repaid. However\nsignificant monetary issues can accompany any form of increased commercial bank\nlending, and these appear to have been overlooked by this analysis. In this\npaper we propose a general explanation for credit crises based on an\nexamination of the mechanics of the banking system, and in particular its\ninternal controls on the supply of credit. We suggest that the current credit\ncrisis is the result of multiple failures in the Basel regulatory framework,\nincluding the removal of central bank reserve requirements from some classes of\ndeposit accounts within the banking system, allowing financial instruments\nrepresenting debt to be used as regulatory capital, and in particular the\nintroduction of securitized lending which effectively removed a previously\nimplicit control over the total quantity of lending originating from the\nbanking system. We further argue that the interaction of these problems has led\nto a destabilising imbalance between total money and loan supply growth, in\nthat total lending sourced from the commercial bank sector increased at a\nfaster rate than accompanying growth in the money supply. This not only created\na multi-decade macro-economic debt spiral, but by increasing the ratio of debt\nto money within the monetary system acted to increase the risk of loan\ndefaults, and consequentially reduce the overall stability of the banking\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2009 20:30:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 16:50:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 9 Jan 2011 23:41:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2012 00:31:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mallett", "Jacky", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.2113", "submitter": "Matthias Hanauske", "authors": "Matthias Hanauske, Jennifer Kunz, Steffen Bernius, and Wolfgang\n  K\\\"onig", "title": "Doves and hawks in economics revisited.

These can then be grouped into between five to seven\nclusters, each representing a different macroeconomic phase. The macroeconomic\nphases are distinguished primarily by their volatilities. We find the US\neconomy, as measured by the DJI, spends most of its time in a low-volatility\nphase and a high-volatility phase. The former can be roughly associated with\neconomic expansion, while the latter contains the economic contraction phase in\nthe standard economic cycle. Both phases are interrupted by a\nmoderate-volatility market, but extremely-high-volatility market crashes are\nfound mostly within the high-volatility phase. From the temporal distribution\nof various phases, we see a high-volatility phase from mid-1998 to mid-2003,\nand another starting mid-2007 (the current global financial crisis).\nTransitions from the low-volatility phase to the high-volatility phase are\npreceded by a series of precursor shocks, whereas the transition from the\nhigh-volatility phase to the low-volatility phase is preceded by a series of\ninverted shocks. The time scale for both types of transitions is about a year.\nWe also identify the July 1997 Asian Financial Crisis to be the trigger for the\nmid-1998 transition, and an unnamed May 2006 market event related to\ncorrections in the Chinese markets to be the trigger for the mid-2007\ntransition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2009 11:28:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Wong Jian", ""], ["Heng", "Lian", ""], ["Ann", "Cheong Siew", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.3929", "submitter": "Ammar Kessab", "authors": "Ammar Kessab (GRANEM)", "title": "La Loi organique relative aux lois de finances (LOLF) dans les\n  institutions culturelles publiques du spectacle vivant en France", "comments": "10th International Conference on Arts and Cultural Management (AIMAC\n  2009), Dallas : \\'Etats-Unis d'Am\\'erique (2009)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a crisis of public finances, France bases all its hopes on the \"evaluation\nof performance\" to moderate the effects of a complex crisis.
