Moreover, IT projects have brought down whole companies, like Kmart in\nthe US and Auto Windscreen in the UK. Software and other IT is now such an\nintegral part of most business processes and products that CEOs must know their\nIT risks, which are typically substantial and overlooked. The analysis of a\nsample of 1,471 IT projects showed that the average cost overrun was 27% - but\nthat figure masks a far more alarming 'fat tail' risk. Fully one in six of the\nprojects in the sample was a Black Swan, with a cost overrun of 200%, on\naverage, and a schedule overrun of almost 70%. This highlights the true pitfall\nof IT change initiatives: It's not that they're particularly prone to high cost\noverruns on average - it is that there are a disproportionate number of Black\nSwans. By focusing on averages instead of the more damaging outliers, most\nmanagers and consultants have been missing the real risk in doing IT.

Among many achievements as an economist\nafter his training as a physicist, Tinbergen proposed the so-called Gravity\nModel of international trade. The model predicts that the intensity of trade\nbetween two countries is described by a formula similar to Newton's law of\ngravitation, where mass is replaced by Gross Domestic Product. Since\nTinbergen's proposal, the Gravity Model has become the standard model of\nnon-zero trade flows in macroeconomics. However, its intrinsic limitation is\nthe prediction of a completely connected network, which fails to explain the\nobserved intricate topology of international trade. Recent network models\novercome this limitation by describing the real network as a member of a\nmaximum-entropy statistical ensemble. The resulting expressions are formally\nanalogous to quantum statistics: the international trade network is found to\nclosely follow the Fermi-Dirac statistics in its purely binary topology, and\nthe recently proposed mixed Bose-Fermi statistics in its full (binary plus\nweighted) structure. This seemingly esoteric result is actually a simple effect\nof the heterogeneity of world countries, that imposes strong structural\nconstraints on the network.

The quantitative study of sustainability transitions\nrequires modelling work, which necessitates a theory of technology\nsubstitution. Many, if not most, contemporary modelling approaches for future\ntechnology pathways overlook most aspects of transitions theory, for instance\ndimensions of heterogenous investor choices, dynamic rates of diffusion and the\nprofile of transitions. A significant body of literature however exists that\ndemonstrates how transitions follow S-shaped diffusion curves or Lotka-Volterra\nsystems of equations. This framework is used ex-post since timescales can only\nbe reliably obtained in cases where the transitions have already occurred,\nprecluding its use for studying cases of interest where nascent innovations in\nprotective niches await favourable conditions for their diffusion. In\nprinciple, scaling parameters of transitions can, however, be derived from\nknowledge of industrial dynamics, technology turnover rates and technology\ncharacteristics. In this context, this paper presents a theory framework for\nevaluating the parameterisation of S-shaped diffusion curves for use in\nsimulation models of technology transitions without the involvement of\nhistorical data fitting, making use of standard demography theory applied to\ntechnology at the unit level. The classic Lotka-Volterra competition system\nemerges from first principles from demography theory, its timescales explained\nin terms of technology lifetimes and industrial dynamics. The theory is placed\nin the context of the multi-level perspective on technology transitions, where\ninnovation and the diffusion of new socio-technical regimes take a prominent\nplace, as well as discrete choice theory, the primary theoretical framework for\nintroducing agent diversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Apr 2013 10:44:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Sep 2013 17:30:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 17:29:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 12:54:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mercure", "J. -F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3722", "submitter": "Krzysztof Sokalski prof", "authors": "Krzysztof Sokalski", "title": "Hierarchy of Frustrations as Supplementary Indices in Complex System\n  Dynamics, Applied to the U.S. Intermarket", "comments": "10 pages 15 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Definition of frustration is expressed by transitivity of binary entanglement\nrelation in considered complex system.

First, it is found with very high statistical significance that cost\nescalation is strongly dependent on length of implementation phase. The policy\nimplications are clear: Decision makers and planners should be highly concerned\nabout delays and long implementation phases because they translate into risks\nof substantial cost escalations. Second, it is found that projects have grown\nlarger over time and that for bridges and tunnels larger projects have larger\npercentage cost escalations. Finally, by comparing cost escalation for three\ntypes of project ownership--private, state-owned enterprise and other public\nownership--it is shown that the oft-seen claim that public ownership is\nproblematic and private ownership effective in curbing cost escalation is an\noversimplification.

The proposed framework\nsystematically addresses the challenges faced when the future value of\ncustomers is estimated based on survey data. The scarcity of the survey data\nand the sampling variance are countered by utilizing the prior information and\nquantifying the uncertainty of the CE and CLV estimates by posterior\ndistributions. Furthermore, information on the purchase behavior of the\ncustomers of competitors available in the survey data is integrated to the\nframework. The introduced approach is directly applicable in the domains where\na customer relationship can be thought to be monogamous.\n  As an example on the use of the framework, we analyze a consumer survey on\nmobile phones carried out in Finland in February 2013.
