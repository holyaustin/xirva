Our\napproximation holds under modest assumptions on the distribution of the sales\nprocess of the warranted item and the nature of arrivals of warranty claims. We\npropose a method of using historical data to statistically estimate the\nparameters of the approximate distribution. Our methodology is applied to the\nwarranty claims data from a large car manufacturer for a single car model and\nmodel year.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Aug 2010 18:01:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mitra", "Abhimanyu", ""], ["Resnick", "Sidney I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.1960", "submitter": "Caglar Tuncay", "authors": "Caglar Tuncay", "title": "Is an historical economic crisis upcoming?", "comments": "2 figs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work, the time chart of Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) index is\nanalyzed and approach of recession time term is predicted, which may be\nhallmark of a worldwide economic crisis.
