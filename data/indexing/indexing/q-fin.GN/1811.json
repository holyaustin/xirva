This indicator\nreflects the investment behavior of funds' managers as a function of the\npopularity of the assets they held. We show that $ACC$ provides useful\ninformation to discriminate between funds investing in niche markets and those\ninvesting in more popular assets. More importantly, we find that $ACC$ is able\nto provide indication on the performance of the funds. In particular, we find\nthat funds investing in less popular assets generally outperform those\ninvesting in more popular financial instruments, even when correcting for\nstandard factors. Moreover, funds with a low $ACC$ have been less affected by\nthe 2007-08 global financial crisis, likely because less exposed to fire sales\nspillovers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 11:43:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Flori", "Andrea", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Pammolli", "Fabio", ""], ["Spelta", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.05206", "submitter": "Andrea Rapisarda", "authors": "Alessandro Pluchino, Alessio.

As a consequence, IRS guidance does not calculate\nappropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain income intervals,\nadversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection procedure for\ncalculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this procedure\ncalculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax returns;\nand apparently, this procedure has already been used to prepare accepted tax\nreturns. We outline the problem of finding a procedure which calculates\nappropriate premium tax credits for models of general tax returns.

The\nlanguage of probabilities and statistics is often used to describe\ndisagreements quantitatively. In practice, however, we want much more than\nthat. We want disagreements to be resolved. This leaves us with a substantial\nknowledge gap which is often perceived as a lack of practical intuition\nregarding probabilistic and statistical concepts.\n  Take for instance the R\\'enyi divergence which is a well-known statistical\nquantity specifically designed as a measure of disagreement between\nprobabilistic models. Despite its widespread use in science and engineering,\nthe R\\'enyi divergence remains a highly abstract axiomatically-motivated\nmeasure. Certainly, it offers no practical insight as to how disagreements can\nbe resolved.\n  Here we propose to address disagreements using the methods of financial\neconomics. In particular, we show how a large class of disagreements can be\ntransformed into investment opportunities. The expected financial performance\nof such investments quantifies the amount of disagreement in a tangible way.\nThis provides intuition for statistical concepts such as the R\\'enyi divergence\nwhich becomes connected to the financial performance of optimized investments.\nInvestment optimization takes into account individual opinions as well as\nattitudes towards risk. The result is a market-like social mechanism by which\nfunds flow naturally to support a more accurate view. Such social mechanisms\ncan help us with difficult disagreements (e.g., financial arguments concerning\nthe future climate).\n  In terms of scientific validation, we used the findings of independent\nneurophysiological experiments as well as our own research on the equity\npremium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Nov 2018 15:15:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Dec 2018 08:09:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2019 14:13:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2019 14:29:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 18 Dec 2019 13:28:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 11:02:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:30:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Soklakov", "Andrei N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.10993", "submitter": "Daniil Novikov -", "authors": "Peter Shnurkov, Daniil Novikov", "title": "Analysis of the problem of intervention control in the economy on the\n  basis of solving the problem of tuning", "comments": "15 pages, 1 figure.

The essence of the phenomenon of\nintervention is described in accordance with current economic theory. A review\nof papers on intervention research has been made. A general construction of the\nstochastic intervention model was developed as a Markov process with discrete\ntime, controlled at the time it hits the boundary of a given subset of a set of\nstates. Thus, the problem of optimal control of interventions is reduced to a\ntheoretical problem of control by the specified process or the problem of\ntuning. A general solution of the tuning problem for a model with discrete time\nis obtained. It is proved that the optimal control in such a problem is\ndeterministic and is determined by the global maximum point of the function of\ntwo discrete variables, for which an explicit analytical representation is\nobtained. It is noted that the solution of the stochastic tuning problem can be\nused as a basis for solving control problems of various technical systems in\nwhich there is a need to maintain some main parameter in a given set of its\nvalues.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Nov 2018 17:29:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Shnurkov", "Peter", ""], ["Novikov", "Daniil", ""]]}]
