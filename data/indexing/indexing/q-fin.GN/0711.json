We first review the empirical results documenting\nthat in many economies the wealth distribution is described by a combination of\nlog--normal and power--law behaviours. We then focus on the Bouchaud--M\\'ezard\nmodel of wealth exchange, describing an economy of interacting agents connected\nthrough an exchange network. We report analytical and numerical results showing\nthat the system self--organises towards a stationary state whose associated\nwealth distribution depends crucially on the underlying interaction network. In\nparticular we show that if the network displays a homogeneous density of links,\nthe wealth distribution displays either the log--normal or the power--law form.\nThis means that the first--order topological properties alone (such as the\nscale--free property) are not enough to explain the emergence of the\nempirically observed \\emph{mixed} form of the wealth distribution. In order to\nreproduce this nontrivial pattern, the network has to be heterogeneously\ndivided into regions with variable density of links. We show new results\ndetailing how this effect is related to the higher--order correlation\nproperties of the underlying network. In particular, we analyse assortativity\nby degree and the pairwise wealth correlations, and discuss the effects that\nthese properties have on each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 13:25:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2008 17:33:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""], ["Loffredo", "Maria I.", ""]]}]
