Especially, how to produce these two features in one model\nremains challenging. We introduce a novel interaction mechanism, i.e., the\nmulti-level herding, in constructing an agent-based model to investigate the\nsector structure combined with volatility clustering. According to the previous\nmarket performance, agents trade in groups, and their herding behavior\ncomprises the herding at stock, sector and market levels. Further, we propose\nmethods to determine the key model parameters from historical market data,\nrather than from statistical fitting of the results. From the simulation, we\nobtain the sector structure and volatility clustering, as well as the\neigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, for the New York and\nHong Kong stock exchanges. These properties are in agreement with the empirical\nones. Our results quantitatively reveal that the multi-level herding is the\nmicroscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure, and provide new\ninsight into the spatio-temporal interactions in financial systems at the\nmicroscopic level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 02:56:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jun-Jie", ""], ["Tan", "Lei", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.02361", "submitter": "Bin Shen", "authors": "Bin Shen, Jiang Zhang, Qiuhua Zheng", "title": "Exploring multi-layer flow network of international trade based on flow\n  distances", "comments": "21 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 2015, 10(11): e0142936", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0142936", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on the approach of flow distances, the international trade flow system\nis studied from the perspective of multi-layer flow network. A model of\nmulti-layer flow network is proposed for modelling and analyzing multiple types\nof flows in flow systems. Then, flow distances are introduced, and symmetric\nminimum flow distance is presented. Subsequently, we discuss the establishment\nof the multi-layer flow networks of international trade from two coupled\nviewpoints, i.e., the viewpoint of commodity flow and that of money flow. Thus,\nthe multi-layer flow networks of international trade is explored. First,\ntrading \"trophic levels\" are adopted to depict positions that economies\noccupied in the flow network. We find that the distributions of trading\n\"trophic levels\" have the similar clustering pattern for different types of\ncommodity, and there are some regularities between money flow network and\ncommodity flow network. Second, we find that active and competitive countries\ntrade a wide spectrum of products, while inactive and underdeveloped countries\ntrade a limited variety of products. Besides, some abnormal countries import\nmany types of goods, which the vast majority of countries do not need to\nimport. It may indicate an abnormal economic status. Third, harmonic node\ncentrality is proposed and we find the phenomenon of centrality stratification.\nIt means that competitive countries tend to occupy the central positions in the\ntrading of a large variety of commodities, while underdeveloped countries\nlikely in the peripheral positions in the trading of their limited varieties of\nproducts. Fourth, we find that manufactured products have significant larger\nmean first-passage flow distances from the source to the sink than that of\nprimary products.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 16:20:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Shen", "Bin", ""], ["Zhang", "Jiang", ""], ["Zheng", "Qiuhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.02511", "submitter": "Manuel Ch\\'avez-Angeles Dr.", "authors": "Manuel G.

In micro-to-macro theoretical models of economic exchanges based\non kinetic equations, the income distribution depends only on the asymptotic\nequilibrium solutions, while mobility estimates also involve the detailed\nstructure of the transition probabilities of the model, and are thus an\nimportant tool for assessing its validity. Empirical data show a remarkably\ngeneral negative correlation between economic inequality and mobility, whose\nexplanation is still unclear. It is therefore particularly interesting to study\nthis correlation in analytical models. In previous work we investigated the\nbehavior of the Gini inequality index in kinetic models in dependence on\nseveral parameters which define the binary interactions and the taxation and\nredistribution processes: saving propensity, taxation rates gap, tax evasion\nrate, welfare means-testing etc. Here, we check the correlation of mobility\nwith inequality by analyzing the mobility dependence from the same parameters.\nAccording to several numerical solutions, the correlation is confirmed to be\nnegative.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 14:59:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bertotti", "Maria Letizia", ""], ["Modanese", "Giovanni", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.03895", "submitter": "Cyril Pitrou", "authors": "Cyril Pitrou", "title": "Graph representation of balance sheets: from exogenous to endogenous\n  money", "comments": "25 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The nature of monetary arrangements is often discussed without any reference\nto its detailed construction.

The physical capital is\nconsidered an important variable for the economic growth of a country. Here we\nuse an extension of the economic Solow model to describe how the smuggling\naffects the economic growth of the countries. In this study we rely on a\nproduction function that is non-concave instead of the classical Cobb-Douglas\nproduction function. In order to model the physical capital diffusion through\nthe borders of the country, we developed a model based on a parabolic partial\ndifferential equation that describes the dynamics of physical capital and\nboundary conditions of Neumann type. Smuggling is present in many borders\nbetween countries and may include fuel, machinery and food. This smuggling\nthrough the borders is a problematic issue for the country's economies. The\nsmuggling problem usually is related mainly to a non-official exchange rate\nthat is different than the official rate or subsides. Numerical simulations are\nobtained using an explicit finite difference scheme that shows how the physical\ncapital diffusion through the border of the countries. The study of physical\ncapital is a paramount issue for the economic growth of many countries for the\nnext years. The results show that the dynamics of the physical capital when\nboundary conditions of Neumann type are different than zero differ from the\nclassical economic behavior observed in the classical spatial Solow model\nwithout physical capital flux through the borders of countries. Finally, it can\nbe concluded that avoiding the smuggling through the frontiers is an important\nfactor that affects the economic growth of the countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 20:44:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gonz\u00e1lez-Parra", "Gilberto", ""], ["Chen-Charpentier", "Benito", ""], ["Arenas", "Abraham J.", ""], ["Diaz-Rodriguez", "Miguel", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.04819", "submitter": "Jozef Barunik", "authors": "Jozef Barunik and Barbora Malinska", "title": "Forecasting the term structure of crude oil futures prices with neural\n  networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper contributes to the rare literature modeling term structure of crude\noil markets.

In this paper we show that a thermodynamic model based on the Maximum\nEntropy Principle, with dynamical prior information, can be constructed that\nadequately describes the dynamics and distribution of firms' growth. Our\ntheoretical framework is tested against a comprehensive data-base of Spanish\nfirms, which covers to a very large extent Spain's economic activity with a\ntotal of 1,155,142 firms evolving along a full decade. We show that the\nempirical exponent of Pareto's law, a rule often observed in the rank\ndistribution of large-size firms, is explained by the capacity of the economic\nsystem for creating/destroying firms, and can be used to measure the health of\na capitalist-based economy. Indeed, our model predicts that when the exponent\nis larger that 1, creation of firms is favored; when it is smaller that 1,\ndestruction of firms is favored instead; and when it equals 1 (matching Zipf's\nlaw), the system is in a full macroeconomic equilibrium, entailing \"free\"\ncreation and/or destruction of firms. For medium and smaller firm-sizes, the\ndynamical regime changes; the whole distribution can no longer be fitted to a\nsingle simple analytic form and numerical prediction is required.
