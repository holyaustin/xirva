The risk-sharing securities and their\nprices are endogenously determined as the outcome of a strategic game played\namong all the participating agents. In the complete-market setting, each\nagent's set of strategic choices consists of the security payoffs and the\npricing kernel that are consistent with the optimal-sharing rules; while in the\nincomplete setting, agents respond via demand functions on a vector of given\ntradeable securities. It is shown that at the (Nash) risk-sharing equilibrium,\nthe sharing securities are suboptimal, since agents submit for sharing\ndifferent risk exposures than their true endowments. On the other hand, the\nNash equilibrium prices stay unaffected by the game only in the special case of\nagents with the same risk aversion. In addition, agents with sufficiently lower\nrisk aversion act as predatory traders, since they absorb utility surplus from\nthe high risk averse agents and reduce the efficiency of sharing. The main\nresults of the paper also hold under the generalized models that allow the\npresence of noise traders and heterogeneity in agents' beliefs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2012 14:01:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 11:57:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 14:11:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Anthropelos", "Michail", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0450", "submitter": "Ivan Kitov O.", "authors": "Ivan Kitov", "title": "Why price inflation in developed countries is systematically\n  underestimated", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is an extensive historical dataset on real GDP per capita prepared by\nAngus Maddison. This dataset covers the period since 1870 with continuous\nannual estimates in developed countries. All time series for individual\neconomies have a clear structural break between 1940 and 1950. The behavior\nbefore 1940 and after 1950 can be accurately (R2 from 0.7 to 0.99) approximated\nby linear time trends. The corresponding slopes of regressions lines before and\nafter the break differ by a factor of 4 (Switzerland) to 19 (Spain). We have\nextrapolated the early trends into the second interval and obtained much lower\nestimates of real GDP per capita in 2011: from 2.4 (Switzerland) to 5.0 (Japan)\ntimes smaller than the current levels. When the current linear trends are\nextrapolated into the past, they intercept the zero line between 1908\n(Switzerland) and 1944 (Japan). There is likely an internal conflict between\nthe estimating procedures before 1940 and after 1950. A reasonable explanation\nof the discrepancy is that the GDP deflator in developed countries has been\nhighly underestimated since 1950. In the USA, the GDP deflator is\nunderestimated by a factor of 1.4. This is exactly the ratio of the interest\nrate controlled by the Federal Reserve and the rate of inflation. Hence, the\nFederal Reserve actually retains its interest rate at the level of true price\ninflation when corrected for the bias in the GDP deflator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 14:32:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kitov", "Ivan", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0496", "submitter": "Andrey Korotayev", "authors": "Andrey Korotayev (Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow) and Artemy\n  Malkov (Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences)", "title": "A Compact Mathematical Model of the World System Economic and\n  Demographic Growth, 1 CE - 1973 CE", "comments": "44 pages, 25 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose an extremely simple mathematical model that is shown to be able to\naccount for more than 99 per cent of all the variation in economic and\ndemographic macrodynamics of the world for almost two millennia of its history.\nThis appears to suggest a novel approach to the formation of the general theory\nof social macroevolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 22:07:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Korotayev", "Andrey", "", "Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow"], ["Malkov", "Artemy", "", "Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences"]]}, {"id": "1206.1007", "submitter": "Dariusz Grech", "authors": "Dariusz Grech, Zygmunt Mazur", "title": "On the scaling ranges of detrended fluctuation analysis for long-memory\n  correlated short series of data", "comments": "27 pages, 17 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2013.01.049", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine the scaling regime for the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) -\nthe most popular method used to detect the presence of long memory in data and\nthe fractal structure of time series.

The standard ARCH or GARCH framework is recovered when the\nquadratic kernel is diagonal. The calibration of these models on US stock\nreturns reveals several unexpected features. The off-diagonal (non ARCH)\ncoefficients of the quadratic kernel are found to be highly significant both\nIn-Sample and Out-of-Sample, but all these coefficients turn out to be one\norder of magnitude smaller than the diagonal elements. This confirms that daily\nreturns play a special role in the volatility feedback mechanism, as postulated\nby ARCH models. The feedback kernel exhibits a surprisingly complex structure,\nincompatible with models proposed so far in the literature. Its spectral\nproperties suggest the existence of volatility-neutral patterns of past\nreturns. The diagonal part of the quadratic kernel is found to decay as a\npower-law of the lag, in line with the long-memory of volatility. Finally,\nQARCH models suggest some violations of Time Reversal Symmetry in financial\ntime series, which are indeed observed empirically, although of much smaller\namplitude than predicted.
