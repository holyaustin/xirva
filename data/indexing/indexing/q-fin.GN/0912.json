The methods are spectral analysis and factor analysis. Using\nthe random matrix theory, we show that two largest eigenvalues are significant.\nTaking advantage of the information revealed by disaggregated data, we identify\nthe first dominant factor as the aggregate demand, and the second factor as\ninventory adjustment. They cannot be reasonably interpreted as technological\nshocks. We also demonstrate that in terms of two dominant factors, shipments\nlead production by four months. Furthermore, out-of-sample test demonstrates\nthat the model holds up even under the 2008-09 recession. Because a fall of\noutput during 2008-09 was caused by an exogenous drop in exports, it provides\nanother justification for identifying the first dominant factor as the\naggregate demand. All the findings suggest that the major cause of business\ncycles is real demand shocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2009 14:01:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Nov 2010 03:52:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Iyetomi", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Nakayama", "Yasuhiro", ""], ["Yoshikawa", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Aoyama", "Hideaki", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Yoshi", ""], ["Ikeda", "Yuichi", ""], ["Souma", "Wataru", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.1037", "submitter": "Mikhail Rumyantsev", "authors": "Mikhail I.

Our\nprevious study successfully used these two modes to demonstrate the existence\nof intrinsic business cycles. Here a correlation matrix constructed from the\ntwo modes describes genuine interindustrial correlations in a statistically\nmeaningful way. Further it enables us to quantitatively discuss the\nrelationship between shipments of final demand goods and production of\nintermediate goods in a linear response framework. We also investigate\ndistinctive external stimuli for the Japanese economy exerted by the current\nglobal economic crisis. These stimuli are derived from residuals of moving\naverage fluctuations of the IIP remaining after subtracting the long-period\ncomponents arising from inherent business cycles. The observation reveals that\nthe fluctuation-dissipation theory is applicable to an economic system that is\nsupposed to be far from physical equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2009 12:29:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Nov 2010 02:42:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Iyetomi", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Nakayama", "Yasuhiro", ""], ["Aoyama", "Hideaki", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Yoshi", ""], ["Ikeda", "Yuichi", ""], ["Souma", "Wataru", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3652", "submitter": "Andrea Macrina", "authors": "Edward Hoyle, Lane P.

In\nthe BHM framework, each asset is associated with a collection of random cash\nflows. The price of the asset is the sum of the discounted conditional\nexpectations of the cash flows. The conditional expectations are taken with\nrespect to a filtration generated by a set of \"information processes\". The\ninformation processes carry imperfect information about the cash flows. To\nmodel the flow of information, we introduce in this paper a class of processes\nwhich we term Levy random bridges (LRBs). This class generalises the Brownian\nbridge and gamma bridge information processes considered by BHM. An LRB is\ndefined over a finite time horizon. Conditioned on its terminal value, an LRB\nis identical in law to a Levy bridge. We consider in detail the case where the\nasset generates a single cash flow $X_T$ occurring at a fixed date $T$. The\nflow of market information about $X_T$ is modelled by an LRB terminating at the\ndate $T$ with the property that the (random) terminal value of the LRB is equal\nto $X_T$. An explicit expression for the price process of such an asset is\nfound by working out the discounted conditional expectation of $X_T$ with\nrespect to the natural filtration of the LRB. The prices of European options on\nsuch an asset are calculated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Dec 2009 11:47:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Apr 2010 05:00:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Hoyle", "Edward", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.3771", "submitter": "Jorgen Vitting Andersen", "authors": "Jorgen Vitting Andersen, Andrzej Nowak, Giulia Rotundo and Lael\n  Parrott", "title": "Tremor price dynamics in the world's network of stock exchanges", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use insight from a model of earth tectonic plate movement to obtain a new\nunderstanding of the build up and release of stress in the price dynamics of\nthe worlds stock exchanges.
