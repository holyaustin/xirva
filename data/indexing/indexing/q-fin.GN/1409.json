Our analysis is based on the approach we have\npreviously applied to individual decision makers, which we now generalize to\nthe case of decision makers that are members of a society. The approach employs\nthe mathematical techniques that are common in quantum theory, justifying our\nnaming as Quantum Decision Theory. However, we do not assume that decision\nmakers are quantum objects. The techniques of quantum theory are needed only\nfor defining the prospect probabilities taking into account such hidden\nvariables as behavioral biases and other subconscious feelings. The approach\ndescribes an agent's choice as a probabilistic event occurring with a\nprobability that is the sum of a utility factor and of an attraction factor.\nThe attraction factor embodies subjective and unconscious dimensions in the\nmind of the decision maker. We show that the typical aggregate amplitude of the\nattraction factor is $1/4$, and it can be either positive or negative depending\non the relative attraction of the competing choices. The most efficient way of\nvarying the decision makers choice is realized by influencing the attraction\nfactor. This can be done in two ways. One method is to arrange in a special\nmanner the payoff weights, which induces the required changes of the values of\nattraction factors. We show that a slight variation of the payoff weights can\ninvert the sign of the attraction factors and reverse the decision preferences,\neven when the prospect utilities remain unchanged. The second method of\ninfluencing the decision makers choice is by providing information to decision\nmakers. The methods of influencing decision making are illustrated by several\nexperiments, whose outcomes are compared quantitatively with the predictions of\nour approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 08:53:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Yukalov", "V.

One of the main channels of shock\npropagation among countries is the International Trade Network (ITN). Two\nimportant models for the ITN structure, the classical gravity model of trade\n(more popular among economists) and the fitness model (more popular among\nnetworks scientists), are both limited to the characterization of only one\nrepresentation of the ITN. The gravity model satisfactorily predicts the volume\nof trade between connected countries, but cannot reproduce the observed missing\nlinks (i.e. the topology). On the other hand, the fitness model can\nsuccessfully replicate the topology of the ITN, but cannot predict the volumes.\nThis paper tries to make an important step forward in the unification of those\ntwo frameworks, by proposing a new GDP-driven model which can simultaneously\nreproduce the binary and the weighted properties of the ITN. Specifically, we\nadopt a maximum-entropy approach where both the degree and the strength of each\nnode is preserved. We then identify strong nonlinear relationships between the\nGDP and the parameters of the model. This ultimately results in a weighted\ngeneralization of the fitness model of trade, where the GDP plays the role of a\n`macroeconomic fitness' shaping the binary and the weighted structure of the\nITN simultaneously.

We introduce a stylized model for the build-up and\ncollapse of trust in networks, which generically displays a first order\ntransition. The basic assumption of our model is that whereas trust begets\ntrust, panic also begets panic, in the sense that a small decrease in trust may\nbe amplified and ultimately lead to a sudden and catastrophic drop of trust. We\nshow, using both numerical simulations and mean-field analytic arguments, that\nthere are extended regions of the parameter space where two equilibrium states\ncoexist: a well-connected network where confidence is high, and a poorly\nconnected network where confidence is low. In these coexistence regions,\nspontaneous jumps from the well-connected state to the poorly connected state\ncan occur, corresponding to a sudden collapse of trust that is not caused by\nany major external catastrophe. In large systems, spontaneous crises are\nreplaced by history dependence: whether the system is found in one state or in\nthe other essentially depends on initial conditions. Finally, we document a new\nphase, in which agents are connected yet distrustful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Sep 2014 15:52:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Jan 2015 14:05:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 09:15:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Batista", "Jo\u00e3o da Gama", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""], ["Challet", "Damien", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.8528", "submitter": "Goetz Seibold", "authors": "S.

In particular, we\nimplement a feedback of public goods provision on the decision-making of\nselfish agents which aim to pursue their self interest. Our results imply that\nsuch a feedback enhances the moral attitude of selfish agents thus reducing the\npercentage of tax evasion. Two parameters govern the behavior of selfish\nagents, (i) the rate of adaption to changes in public goods provision and (ii)\nthe threshold of perception of public goods provision. Furtheron we analyze the\ntax evasion dynamics for different agent co mpositions and under the feedback\nof public goods provision. We conclude that policymakers may enhance tax\ncompliance behavior via the threshold of perception by means of targeted public\nrelations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 12:59:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hokamp", "S.", ""], ["Seibold", "G.", ""]]}]
