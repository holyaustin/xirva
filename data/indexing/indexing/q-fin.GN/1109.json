Taking advantage from the Bass model for first purchase and a\nlogistic model for repurchase the entire product lifecycle of a durable can be\nestablished. For the case of a fast growing supply the model suggests that the\nmean price of the good decreases according to a logistic law. Both, the\nestablished unit sales and price evolution are in agreement with the empirical\ndata studied in this paper. The presented approach discusses further the\ninterference of the diffusion process with the supply dynamics. The model\npredicts the occurrence of lost sales in the initial stages of the lifecycle\ndue to supply constraints. They are the origin for a retarded market\npenetration. The theory suggests that the imitation rate B indicating social\ncontagion in the Bass model has its maximum magnitude for the case of a large\namount of available units at introduction and a fast output increase.

Claims that speculators cannot influence grain prices are shown to be\ninvalid by direct analysis of price setting practices of granaries.
