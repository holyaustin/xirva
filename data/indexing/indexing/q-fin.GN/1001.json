The LPPL model considers the faster-than-exponential (power\nlaw with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by\naccelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies a\npositive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative\nfeedback spirals of crash expectations. The power of the LPPL model is\nillustrated by two recent real-life predictions performed recently by our\ngroup: the peak of the Oil price bubble in early July 2008 and the burst of a\nbubble on the Shanghai stock market in early August 2009. We then present the\nconcept of \"negative bubbles\", which are the mirror images of positive bubbles.\nWe argue that similar positive feedbacks are at work to fuel these accelerated\ndownward price spirals. We adapt the LPPL model to these negative bubbles and\nimplement a pattern recognition method to predict the end times of the negative\nbubbles, which are characterized by rebounds (the mirror images of crashes\nassociated with the standard positive bubbles). The out-of-sample tests\nquantified by error diagrams demonstrate the high significance of the\nprediction performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2010 22:54:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 6 Feb 2010 22:27:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Wanfeng", ""], ["Woodard", "Ryan", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0656", "submitter": "Leilei Shi", "authors": "Leilei Shi (1), Yiwen Wang (2), Ding Chen (3), Liyan Han (2), Yan Piao\n  and Chengling Gou (4) ((1) Complex System Research Group, Department of\n  Modern Physics University of Science and Technology of China (2) Department\n  of Finance, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (3) Harvest\n  Fund Management Co.

Non-normal distributions combine the risk in the left tail\nwith the opportunities in the right tail -- unifying the \"risk premium\" with\nthe possible loss. Risk and reward must be part of the same picture and\nexpected returns must include possible losses due to risks. We reinterpret the\nBlack-Scholes pricing formulas as prices for maximum-entropy probability\ndistributions, illuminating their importance from a new angle. Using these\nideas we show how derivatives can be priced under \"uncertain uncertainty\" and\nhow this creates a skew for the implied volatilities.
