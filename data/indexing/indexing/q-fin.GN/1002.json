Both variables were represented as linear functions of the change rate\nof labor force, dLF/LF. These models provide an accurate description of\ndisinflation in the 1990s and a deflationary period in the 2000s. In Japan,\nthere exists a statistically reliable (R2=0.68) Phillips curve, which is\ncharacterized by a negative relation between inflation and unemployment and\ntheir synchronous evolution: UE(t) = -0.94p(t) + 0.045. Effectively, growing\nunemployment has resulted in decreasing inflation since 1982. A linear and\nlagged generalized relationship between inflation, unemployment and labor force\nhas been also obtained for Japan: p(t) = 2.8*dLF(t)/LF(t) + 0.9*UE(t) - 0.0392.\nLabor force projections allow a prediction of inflation and unemployment in\nJapan: CPI inflation will be negative (between -0.5% and -1% per year) during\nthe next 40 years. Unemployment will increase from ~4.0% in 2010 to 5.3% in\n2050.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2010 16:12:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kitov", "Ivan O.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.0377", "submitter": "Austin Gerig", "authors": "Austin Gerig", "title": "Universal Laws and Economic Phenomena", "comments": "3 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This is a short commentary piece that discusses how the methods used in the\nnatural sciences can apply to economics in general and financial markets\nspecifically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2010 09:33:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Jul 2010 17:01:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Gerig", "Austin", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1070", "submitter": "Pawe{\\l} Sieczka", "authors": "Pawe{\\l} Sieczka, Didier Sornette, Janusz A.

In our\nstylized description, all properties of a given firm are captured by its\neffective credit rating, which follows a simple dynamics of co-evolution with\nthe credit ratings of the other firms in our economic network. The dynamics\nresembles the evolution of Potts spin-glass with external global field\ncorresponding to a panic effect in the economy. The existence of a global phase\ntransition, between paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases, explains the large\nsusceptibility of the system to negative shocks. We show that bailing out the\nfirst few defaulting firms does not solve the problem, but does have the effect\nof alleviating considerably the global shock, as measured by the fraction of\nfirms that are not defaulting as a consequence. This beneficial effect is the\ncounterpart of the large vulnerability of the system of coupled firms, which\nare both the direct consequences of the collective self-organized endogenous\nbehaviors of the credit ratings of the firms in our economic network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 20:34:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 20:11:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sieczka", "Pawe\u0142", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""], ["Ho\u0142yst", "Janusz A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.2086", "submitter": "Rim Amami", "authors": "Rim Amami", "title": "Contr\\^ole impulsionnel appliqu\\'e \\`a la gestion de changement de\n  technologie dans une entreprise", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an impulse control problem in infinite horizon applied with\nswitching technology.
