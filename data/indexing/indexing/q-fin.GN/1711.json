This feature of derivatives\nprevents claims processing procedures that screen out ineligible claims. This,\nin turn, creates a perverse incentive for insured holders of notes to commit\nacts that result in payment. This problem first surfaced with CDS contracts,\nwhich are part of a class of loan insurance I term a default insurance note.\n  Without an address to this problem, within the average range of returns for a\nlarge venture capital portfolio, a venture-bank makes less money the better\ntheir investments do, in a continuous function. The highest rate of return is a\ntotal loss, 64% more than a top portfolio.\n  Here, a strategy for removing this perverse incentive is defined, consisting\nof a clawback lien that returns part of the payment value as a lien on the firm\nthat is the beneficiary of the insurance. This is presented as the final major\ncomponent for implementing a default insurance note system so that\nventure-banking can operate to maximum benefit. Removing the perverse incentive\nalso minimizes disincentive for underwriters to deny DIN coverage to new\nventure capital firms, or to those firms that have historical earnings which\nare below average.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 23:35:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Feb 2018 23:30:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 21:20:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hanley", "Brian P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.05289", "submitter": "Thomas Hurd", "authors": "T.

The\ncrisis literature has so far identified a number of distinct effects or\nchannels that can propagate distress contagiously both directly within the\nbanking network itself and indirectly, between the network and the external\neconomy. These contagious effects, and the potential events that trigger these\neffects, can explain most aspects of past crises, and are thought to be likely\nto dominate future financial crises. Since the current international financial\nregulatory regime based on the Basel III Accord does a good job of ensuring\nthat banks are resilient to such contagion effects taken one at a time,\nsystemic risk theorists increasingly understand that future crises are likely\nto be dominated by the spillovers between distinct contagion channels. The\npresent paper aims to provide a model for systemic risk that is comprehensive\nenough to include the important contagion channels identified in the\nliterature. In such a model one can hope to understand the dangerous spillover\neffects that are expected to dominate future crises. To rein in the number and\ncomplexity of the modelling assumptions, two requirements are imposed, neither\nof which is yet well-known or established in the main stream of systemic risk\nresearch. The first, called stock-flow consistency, demands that the financial\nsystem follows a rigorous set of rules based on accounting principles. The\nsecond requirement, called Asset-Liability symmetry, implies that every\nproposed contagion channel has a dual channel obtained by interchanging assets\nand liabilities, and that these dual channel pairs have a symmetric\nmathematical representation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Nov 2017 19:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "T.

The traditional way to group customers in securities or futures\ncompanies is simply based on their assets. However, grouping customers with\nrespect to only one dimension cannot give us a full picture about customers'\nattributions. It is hard to group customers' with similar attributions or\nvalues into one group if we just consider assets as the only grouping\ncriterion. Nowadays, securities or futures companies usually group customers\nbased on managers' experience with lack of quantitative analysis, which is not\neffective. Therefore, we use kmeans unsupervised learning methods to group\ncustomers with respect to significant dimensions so as to cluster customers\nwith similar attributions together. Grouping is our first step. It is the\nhorizontal analysis in customer study. The next step is customer ranking. It is\nthe longitudinal analysis. It ranks customers by assigning each customer with a\ncertain score given by our weighted customer value calculation formula.\nTherefore, by grouping and ranking customers, we can differentiate our\ncustomers and rank them based on values instead of blindly reaching everyone.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 16:50:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-16", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Bowen", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.05784", "submitter": "Giorgio Fagiolo", "authors": "Sofia Torreggiani, Giuseppe Mangioni, Michael J.
