Empirical study of the Japanese data shows that they all obey the\nPareto law, and also that the Pareto index decreases with the level of\naggregation. In order to explain these two stylized facts, we propose a\ntheoretical framework built upon the basic principle of statistical physics. In\nthis framework, we employ the concept of superstatistics which accommodates\nfluctuations of aggregate demand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 May 2008 07:12:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Aoyama", "Hideaki", ""], ["Yoshikawa", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Iyetomi", "Hiroshi", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Yoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3071", "submitter": "Marcel Ausloos", "authors": "Mircea Gligor and Marcel Ausloos", "title": "Convergence and cluster structures in EU area according to fluctuations\n  in macroeconomic indices", "comments": "31 pages, 57 references,4 Tables, 7 figures; submitted to J.

The statistical distances between countries are\ncalculated for various moving time windows, and the time variation of the mean\nstatistical distance is investigated. The decreasing of the mean statistical\ndistance between EU countries is reflected in the correlated fluctuations of\nthe basic ME indicators: GDP, GDP/capita, Consumption and Investments. This\nempirical evidence can be seen as an economic aspect of globalization. The\nMoving Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) algorithm allows to search for a\ncluster-like structures derived both from the hierarchical organization of\ncountries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy. It is found\nthat the strongly correlated countries with respect to GDP fluctuations can be\npartitioned into stable clusters. Some of the highly correlated countries, with\nrespect to GDP fluctuations, display strong correlations also in the Final\nConsumption Expenditure, while others are strongly correlated in Gross Capital\nFormation. On the other hand, one notices the similitude of the classifications\nregarding GDP and Net Exports fluctuations as concerns the squared sum of the\ncorrelation coefficients (so called country sensitivity). The final structure\nproves to be robust against the constant size time window moving over the\nscanned time interval. The policy implications of the above empirical results\nconcern the economic clusters arising in the presence of Marshallian\nexternalities and the relationships between trade barriers, R&D incentives and\ngrowth that must be accounted in elaborating a cluster-promotion policy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2008 13:06:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Gligor", "Mircea", ""], ["Ausloos", "Marcel", ""]]}]
