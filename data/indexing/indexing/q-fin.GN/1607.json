Treating a stock market as a self-organized system governed by a fast\npurchase process and slow variations of demand and supply the model suggests\nthat the short term price distribution has the form a logistic (Laplace)\ndistribution. The long term return can be described by Laplace-Gaussian mixture\ndistributions. The long term mean price evolution is governed by a Walrus\nequation, which can be transformed into a replicator equation. This allows\nquantifying the evolutionary price competition between stocks. The theory\nsuggests that stock prices scaled by the price over all stocks can be used to\ninvestigate long-term trends in a Fisher-Pry plot. The price competition that\nfollows from the model is illustrated by examining the empirical long-term\nprice trends of two stocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2015 09:22:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kaldasch", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.02349", "submitter": "Marie Doumic", "authors": "Marie Doumic (LJLL), Beno\\^it Perthame (LJLL), Edouard Ribes (IRSEM),\n  Delphine Salort (UPMC), Nathan Toubiana (LJLL)", "title": "Toward an integrated workforce planning framework using structured\n  equations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Strategic Workforce Planning is a company process providing best in class,\neconomically sound, workforce management policies and goals.

One of the most\nimportant issues encountered when modeling bipartite networks is devising a way\nto obtain a (monopartite) projection on the layer of interest, which preserves\nas much as possible the information encoded into the original bipartite\nstructure. In the present paper we propose an algorithm to obtain\nstatistically-validated projections of bipartite networks, according to which\nany two nodes sharing a statistically-significant number of neighbors are\nlinked. Since assessing the statistical significance of nodes similarity\nrequires a proper statistical benchmark, here we consider a set of four null\nmodels, defined within the exponential random graph framework. Our algorithm\noutputs a matrix of link-specific p-values, from which a validated projection\nis straightforwardly obtainable, upon running a multiple hypothesis testing\nprocedure. Finally, we test our method on an economic network (i.e. the\ncountries-products World Trade Web representation) and a social network (i.e.\nMovieLens, collecting the users' ratings of a list of movies). In both cases\nnon-trivial communities are detected: while projecting the World Trade Web on\nthe countries layer reveals modules of similarly-industrialized nations,\nprojecting it on the products layer allows communities characterized by an\nincreasing level of complexity to be detected; in the second case, projecting\nMovieLens on the films layer allows clusters of movies whose affinity cannot be\nfully accounted for by genre similarity to be individuated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 18:22:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 22:34:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 21:01:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 17 May 2017 16:42:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Saracco", "Fabio", ""], ["Straka", "Mika J.", ""], ["Di Clemente", "Riccardo", ""], ["Gabrielli", "Andrea", ""], ["Caldarelli", "Guido", ""], ["Squartini", "Tiziano", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.03205", "submitter": "Taisei Kaizoji", "authors": "Taisei Kaizoji and Michiko Miyano", "title": "Stock Market Market Crash of 2008: an empirical study of the deviation\n  of share prices from company fundamentals", "comments": "11 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/13504851.2018.1486004", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PR q-fin.RM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this study is to investigate quantitatively whether share prices\ndeviated from company fundamentals in the stock market crash of 2008. For this\npurpose, we use a large database containing the balance sheets and share prices\nof 7,796 worldwide companies for the period 2004 through 2013. We develop a\npanel regression model using three financial indicators--dividends per share,\ncash flow per share, and book value per share--as explanatory variables for\nshare price. We then estimate individual company fundamentals for each year by\nremoving the time fixed effects from the two-way fixed effects model, which we\nidentified as the best of the panel regression models. One merit of our model\nis that we are able to extract unobservable factors of company fundamentals by\nusing the individual fixed effects.\n  Based on these results, we analyze the market anomaly quantitatively using\nthe divergence rate--the rate of the deviation of share price from a company's\nfundamentals. We find that share prices on average were overvalued in the\nperiod from 2005 to 2007, and were undervalued significantly in 2008, when the\nglobal financial crisis occurred. Share prices were equivalent to the\nfundamentals on average in the subsequent period.
