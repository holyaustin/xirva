The contributions of each factor to the bid-offer adjustment are computed\nseparately and then consolidated to produce a very adaptive bid-offer\nquotation. The author uses the currency markets to build the sample model\nbecause they are extremely liquid and trading in them is not as transparent as\nother financial instruments, such as equities. Simulating the number of trades\nand the average size of trades from a lognormal distribution, the parameters of\nthe lognormal distributions are chosen such that the total volume in a certain\ninterval matches the volume publicly mentioned by currency trading firms. This\nmethodology can easily be extended to other financial instruments and possibly\nto any product with the ability to make electronic price quotations, or can\neven be used to periodically perform manual price updates on products that are\ntraded non-electronically.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2016 15:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 05:29:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00092", "submitter": "Leszek Szybisz", "authors": "M.A. Szybisz and L.

This new analysis of data indicates that the episodes\noccurred in Brazil and Nicaragua can be understood within the frame of the\nmodel available in the literature, which is based on a nonlinear feedback (NLF)\ncharacterized by an exponent $\\beta>0$. In the NLF model the accumulated\nconsumer price index carries a finite time singularity of the type\n$1/(t_c-t)^{(1- \\beta)/\\beta}$ determining a critical time $t_c$ at which the\neconomy would crash. It is shown that in the case of Brazil the entire episode\ncannot be described with a unique set of parameters because the time series was\nstrongly affected by a change of policy. This fact gives support to the \"so\ncalled\" Lucas critique, who stated that model's parameters usually change once\npolicy changes. On the other hand, such a model is not able to provide any\n$t_c$ in the case of the weaker hyperinflation occurred in Israel. It is shown\nthat in this case the fit of data yields $\\beta \\to 0$. This limit leads to the\nlinear feedback formulation which does not predict any $t_c$.
