We\nextrapolate to other cancer sites by using estimated national expenditures and\nincidence rates. A rough estimate for the U.S. national annual treatment\ncost-savings from early cancer diagnosis is in 11 digits.

Our study identifies the conditions that real-time prices may lead to\nhigher electricity costs, which in turn contradicts the usual claim that such a\npricing scheme reduces cost. We show that such undesirable behavior is in fact\nsystemic. Due to the existing structure of the wholesale market, the predicted\ndemand that is used in the formation of the price is never realized since the\nflexible users will change their demand according to such established price. As\nthe demand is never correctly predicted, the volume traded through the\nbalancing markets increases, leading to higher overall costs. In this case, the\nsystem can sustain, and even benefit from, a small number of flexible users,\nbut this solution can never upscale without increasing the total costs. To\navoid this problem, we implement the so-called \"exclusive groups.\" Our results\nillustrate the importance of rethinking the current practices so that\nflexibility can be successfully integrated considering scenarios with and\nwithout intermittent renewable sources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 12:10:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Feb 2018 12:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["K\u00fchnlenz", "Florian", ""], ["Nardelli", "Pedro H.

In retirement, surveys suggest the greatest\nfear is running out of money and as retirement decumulation models become\nincreasingly sophisticated, large financial firms and robo-advisors may\nguarantee their success.

It\nwould be desirable to have a foundation able to support the increased\ncomplexity before it forms however the industry currently relies upon similar\nGaussian (or lognormal) dependence structures. We propose a multivariate\ndensity model having fixed marginals that is tractable and fits data which are\nskewed, heavy-tailed, multimodal, i.e., of arbitrary complexity allowing for a\nrich correlation structure. It is also ideal for stress-testing a retirement\nplan by fitting historical data seeded with black swan events. A preliminary\nsection reviews all concepts before they are used and fully documented C/C++\nsource code is attached making the research self-contained.

At the microscopic level, firms\nare growing at different rates while also being exposed to idiosyncratic shocks\nat the firm and sector level. We describe such fluctuations as independent\nL\\'evy-stable fluctuations, varying over multiple orders of magnitude. These\nfluctuations are aggregated and measured at the macroscopic level in averaged\neconomic output quantities such as GDP. A fundamental question is thereby to\nwhat extend individual firm size fluctuations can have a noticeable impact on\nthe overall economy. We argue that this question can be answered by considering\nthe L\\'evy fluctuations as embedded in a steep confining potential well,\nensuring nonlinear mean-reversal behavior, without having to rely on\nmicroscopic details of the system. The steepness of the potential well directly\ncontrols the extend towards which idiosyncratic shocks to firms and sectors are\ndamped at the level of the economy. Additionally, the theory naturally accounts\nfor business cycles, represented in terms of a bimodal economic output\ndistribution, and thus connects two so far unrelated fields in economics. By\nanalyzing 200 years of US GDP growth rates, we find that the model is in good\nagreement with the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Aug 2017 02:49:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lera", "Sandro Claudio", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06480", "submitter": "Marcelo Tragtenberg Dr.", "authors": "Igor D.
