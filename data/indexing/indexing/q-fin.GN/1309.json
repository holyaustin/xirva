As\nwill be demonstrated, the well known scientific method to define abstract and\ncomplex issues by their negation, satisfies these requirements. Following this\nnew approach, it also becomes possible to decide if proposed and actual\npolicies changes will make our way of life less unsustainable, and thus move us\npotentially into the direction of sustainability. Furthermore, if potentially\ndangerous tipping points are to be avoided, the transition roadmap must include\nsome minimal speed requirements. Combining the negation method and the time\nevolution of that remaining natural capital in different domains, the\ntransition speed for a \"development towards sustainability\" can be quantified\nat local, regional and global scales.\n  The presented ideas allow us to measure the rate of natural capital depletion\nand the rate of restoration that will be required if humanity is to avoid\nreaching a sustainable future by a collapse transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 10:07:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dittmar", "Michael", "", "Institute of Particle Physics, ETH Zurich,\n  Switzerland"]]}, {"id": "1309.0491", "submitter": "Lukas Vacha", "authors": "Jozef Barunik, Lukas Vacha", "title": "Contagion among Central and Eastern European stock markets during the\n  financial crisis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper contributes to the literature on international stock market\ncomovements and contagion.

This flattening of the distribution\ncontrasts with a large body of empirical literature which finds a Pareto\ndistribution for firm sizes both across countries and over time. Pareto\ndistributions are generally traced back to a mechanism of proportional random\ngrowth, based on a regime of constant returns to scale.

In our main results, we prove with both spectral and probabilistic\nmethods that this rate is almost proportional to the turning frequency {\\omega}\nof the model and provide some explicit bounds. In the continuity of this\nresult, we build some estimators of {\\omega} and of the pseudo-period of the\nprices. At last, we end the paper by a proof of the quasi-stationary\ndistribution of the process, as well as the existence of its persistence rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Sep 2013 08:32:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gadat", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Miclo", "Laurent", ""], ["Panloup", "Fabien", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6929", "submitter": "Ventura Charlin", "authors": "Ventura Charlin (VC Consultants, Santiago, Chile) and Arturo Cifuentes\n  (Financial Regulation Center, Faculty of Economics and Business, University\n  of Chile, Santiago, Chile)", "title": "A new financial metric for the art market", "comments": "36 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper introduces a new financial metric for the art market.

In recent research\nthe impact of stochastic order lead time on the bullwhip effect is\ninvestigated, but the effect of needing to predict / estimate the lead time is\nnot considered in the supply chain models. Under uncertainty conditions it is\nnecessary to estimate the lead time for a member of the supply chain to place\nan order. We find a new cause of the bullwhip effect in the form of lead time\nforecasting and we give an exact form of the bullwhip effect measure (the ratio\nof variances) when demands and lead times are predicted by moving averages. In\nthe bullwhip effect measure we discover two terms amplifying the effect which\nare the result of lead time estimation\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2013 21:44:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 14:19:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 11:20:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Michna", "Zbigniew", ""], ["Nielsen", "Peter", ""]]}]
