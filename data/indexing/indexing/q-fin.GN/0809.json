This model allows us\nto determine which parameters are most effective to smoothen the severity of a\npotential market crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has issued\nsevere warnings about the current real-state bubble in the United States, the\nUnited Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands, Australia and Spain in the last\nyears. Madrid (Spain), in particular, is an extreme case of this bubble. It is,\ntherefore, an excellent test case to analyze housing dynamics in the context of\nthe empirical data provided by the Spanish National Institute of Statistics and\nother sources of data. The model is able to predict the mean house occupancy,\nand shows that i) the house market conditions in Madrid are unstable but not\ncritical; and ii) the regulation of the construction rate is more effective\nthan interest rate changes. Our results indicate that to accommodate the\nconstruction rate to the total population of first-time buyers is the most\neffective way to maintain the system near equilibrium conditions. In addition,\nwe show that to raise interest rates will heavily affect the poorest housing\nbands of the population while the middle class layers remain nearly unaffected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Sep 2008 08:51:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Huerta", "Ramon", ""], ["Corbacho", "Fernando", ""], ["Lago-Fernandez", "Luis F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.1534", "submitter": "Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron", "authors": "Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron, Rafa{\\l} Weron and Maja W{\\l}oszczowska", "title": "Outflow Dynamics in Modeling Oligopoly Markets: The Case of the Mobile\n  Telecommunications Market in Poland", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2008/11/P11018", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we introduce two models of opinion dynamics in oligopoly\nmarkets and apply them to a situation, where a new entrant challenges two\nincumbents of the same size. The models differ in the way the two forces\ninfluencing consumer choice -- (local) social interactions and (global)\nadvertising -- interact. We study the general behavior of the models using the\nMean Field Approach and Monte Carlo simulations and calibrate the models to\ndata from the Polish telecommunications market. For one of the models\ncriticality is observed -- below a certain critical level of advertising the\nmarket approaches a lock-in situation, where one market leader dominates the\nmarket and all other brands disappear. Interestingly, for both models the best\nfits to real data are obtained for conformity level $p \\in (0.3,0.4)$. This\nagrees very well with the conformity level found by Solomon Asch in his famous\nsocial experiment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Sep 2008 11:04:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sznajd-Weron", "Katarzyna", ""], ["Weron", "Rafa\u0142", ""], ["W\u0142oszczowska", "Maja", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.3060", "submitter": "Masashi Tomoyose", "authors": "Masashi Tomoyose, Shouji Fujimoto and Atushi Ishikawa", "title": "Non-Gibrat's law in the middle scale region", "comments": "8 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1143/PTPS.179.114", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.CP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By using numerical simulation, we confirm that Takayasu--Sato--Takayasu (TST)\nmodel which leads Pareto's law satisfies the detailed balance under Gibrat's\nlaw.
