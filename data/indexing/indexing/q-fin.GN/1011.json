A\nrepurchase agreement is a financial instrument where a security is sold\nsimultaneously with an agreement to buy it back at a later date. Repurchase\nagreements (repos) market size is a very important element in calculating the\noverall leverage in a financial market. Therefore, studying the behavior of\nrepos market size can help to understand a process that can contribute to the\nbirth of a financial crisis. We hypothesize that herding behavior among large\ninvestors led to massive over-leveraging through the use of repos, resulting in\na bubble (built up over the previous years) and subsequent crash in this market\nin early 2008. We use the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model of rational\nexpectation bubbles and behavioral finance to study the dynamics of the repo\nmarket that led to the crash. The JLS model qualifies a bubble by the presence\nof characteristic patterns in the price dynamics, called log-periodic power law\n(LPPL) behavior. We show that there was significant LPPL behavior in the market\nbefore that crash and that the predicted range of times predicted by the model\nfor the end of the bubble is consistent with the observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 22:15:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Nov 2010 16:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Wanfeng", ""], ["Woodard", "Ryan", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5343", "submitter": "Wanfeng Yan", "authors": "Wanfeng Yan, Ryan Woodard, Didier Sornette", "title": "Inferring Fundamental Value and Crash Nonlinearity from Bubble\n  Calibration", "comments": "23 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble in an asset price remains\nan unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches.\nA large part of the problem is that the fundamental value of an asset is, in\ngeneral, not directly observable and it is poorly constrained to calculate.\nFurther, it is not possible to distinguish between an exponentially growing\nfundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price. We present a\nseries of new models based on the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model, which\nis a flexible tool to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in financial\nmarkets. Our new models identify the fundamental value of an asset price and\ncrash nonlinearity from a bubble calibration. In addition to forecasting the\ntime of the end of a bubble, the new models can also estimate the fundamental\nvalue and the crash nonlinearity. Besides, the crash nonlinearity obtained in\nthe new models presents a new approach to possibly identify the dynamics of a\ncrash after a bubble. We test the models using data from three historical\nbubbles ending in crashes from different markets. They are: the Hong Kong Hang\nSeng index 1997 crash, the S&P 500 index 1987 crash and the Shanghai Composite\nindex 2009 crash. All results suggest that the new models perform very well in\ndescribing bubbles, forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental\nvalue and the crash nonlinearity. The performance of the new models is tested\nunder both the Gaussian and non-Gaussian residual assumption. Under the\nGaussian residual assumption, nested hypotheses with the Wilks statistics are\nused and the p-values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary.\nUnder non-Gaussian residual assumption, we use a bootstrap method to get type I\nand II errors of the hypotheses. All tests confirm that the generalized JLS\nmodels provide useful improvements over the standard JLS model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 11:32:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Wanfeng", ""], ["Woodard", "Ryan", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5714", "submitter": "Perry Nicolas", "authors": "Nicolas Perry (IRCCyN), Alain Bernard (IRCCyN)", "title": "Cost objective PLM and CE", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Concurrent Engineering 2003: the Vision for the Future Generation\n  in Research and Applications, Ricardo Jardim-Goncalves, Jianzhong Chia,\n  Adolfo Steiger-Garcao (Ed.)

This approach is based on a\ncomplete numerical traceability and control of the processes (design and\nmanufacturing of the parts and tools, mass production). This is possible due to\nnumerical models and to feedback loops for cost indicator analysis at design\nand production levels. Quotation is also the base for the design requirements\nand for the choice and the configuration of the production process. The\nreference values of the quotation generate the base reference parameters of the\nprocess steps and operations. The traceability of real values (real time\nconsuming, real consumable) is mainly used for a statistic feedback to the\nquotation application. The industrial environment is a steel sand casting\ncompany with a wide mix product and the application concerns both design and\nmanufacturing.
