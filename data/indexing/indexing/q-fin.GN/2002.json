Regulatory uncertainty is modeled with a Poisson\nprocess, whereby a jump event may reduce the tariff before the signature of the\ncontract. Using a semi-analytical real options framework, we derive the project\nvalue, the optimal investment threshold, and the value of the investment\nopportunity for these schemes. Taking into consideration the optimal investment\nthreshold, we also compare the two aforementioned FITs with the fixed-price FIT\nand the fixed-premium FIT, which are policy schemes that have been extensively\nstudied in the literature. Our results show that increasing the likelihood of a\njump event lowers the investment threshold for all the schemes; moreover, the\ninvestment threshold also decreases when the tariff reduction increases. We\nalso compare the four schemes in terms of the corresponding optimal investment\nthresholds. For example, we find that the investment threshold of the sliding\npremium is lower than the minimum price guarantee. This result suggests that\nthe first regime is a better policy than the latter because it accelerates the\ninvestment while avoiding excessive earnings to producers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Feb 2020 10:43:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Barbosa", "Luciana", ""], ["Nunes", "Cl\u00e1udia", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Artur", ""], ["Sardinha", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.04067", "submitter": "Adnan Malik", "authors": "Adnan Malik, Karim Ullah, and Shakir Ullah", "title": "Knowledge Diffusion Process & Common Islamic Banking Governance\n  Principles: Integrative Perspective (s) of Managers and Shariah Scholars", "comments": "38 pages, 01 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Islamic banks being commercial entities strive to earn profit within shariah\nambit.

Correlated generation from variable renewable sources\ndepresses market prices, which can cause wind and solar to cannibalise their\nown revenues and prevent them from covering their costs from the market. This\ncannibalisation appears to set limits on the integration of wind and solar, and\nthus to contradict studies that show that high shares are cost effective. Here\nwe show from theory and with simulation examples how market incentives interact\nwith prices, revenue and costs for renewable electricity systems. The decline\nin average revenue seen in some recent literature is due to an implicit policy\nassumption that technologies are forced into the system, whether it be with\nsubsidies or quotas. This decline is mathematically guaranteed regardless of\nwhether the subsidised technology is variable or not. If instead the driving\npolicy is a carbon dioxide cap or tax, wind and solar shares can rise without\ncannibalising their own market revenue, even at penetrations of wind and solar\nabove 80%. The strong dependence of market value on the policy regime means\nthat market value needs to be used with caution as a measure of market\nintegration. Declining market value is not necessarily a sign of integration\nproblems, but rather a result of policy choices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2020 11:34:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:57:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 30 May 2021 17:29:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Brown", "T.", ""], ["Reichenberg", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.06555", "submitter": "Marco Pangallo", "authors": "Marco Pangallo", "title": "Synchronization of endogenous business cycles", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN nlin.AO q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Comovement of economic activity across sectors and countries is a defining\nfeature of business cycles.

These models generate stronger comovement, because they\ncombine shock propagation with synchronization of endogenous dynamics. In\nparticular, we study a demand-driven model in which business cycles emerge from\nstrategic complementarities across sectors in different countries,\nsynchronizing their oscillations through input-output linkages. We first use a\ncombination of analytical methods and extensive numerical simulations to\nestablish a number of theoretical results. We show that the importance that\nsectors or countries have in setting the common frequency of oscillations\ndepends on their eigenvector centrality in the input-output network, and we\ndevelop an eigendecomposition that explores the interplay between non-linear\ndynamics, shock propagation and network structure. We then calibrate our model\nto data on 27 sectors and 17 countries, showing that synchronization indeed\nproduces stronger comovement, giving more flexibility to match the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 16 Feb 2020 11:26:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Pangallo", "Marco", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.07116", "submitter": "Dahang Li", "authors": "Dahang Li", "title": "A New Pricing Theory That Solves the St. Petersburg Paradox", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The St. Petersburg Paradox, an important topic in probability theory, has not\nbeen solved in the last 280 years.
