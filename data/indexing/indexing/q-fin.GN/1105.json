The winner is\nwhoever places the \\emph{lowest} bid, provided that it is also unique. We use a\ngrand canonical approach to derive an analytical expression for the equilibrium\ndistribution of strategies. We then study the properties of the solution as a\nfunction of the mean number of players, and compare them with a large dataset\nof internet auctions. The theory agrees with the data with striking accuracy\nfor small population size $N$, while for larger $N$ a qualitatively different\ndistribution is observed. We interpret this result as the emergence of two\ndifferent regimes, one in which adaptation is feasible and one in which it is\nnot. Our results question the actual possibility of a large population to adapt\nand find the optimal strategy when participating in a collective game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Apr 2011 10:09:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 12:15:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 25 Feb 2012 15:03:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pigolotti", "Simone", ""], ["Bernhardsson", "Sebastian", ""], ["Juul", "Jeppe", ""], ["Galster", "Gorm", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1812", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "Contextual Risk and Its Relevance in Economics", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review, 4, pp.\n  241-245, 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Uncertainty in economics still poses some fundamental problems illustrated,\ne.g., by the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes. To overcome these difficulties,\neconomists have introduced an interesting distinction between 'risk' and\n'ambiguity' depending on the existence of a (classical Kolmogorovian)\nprobabilistic structure modeling these uncertainty situations. On the other\nhand, evidence of everyday life suggests that 'context' plays a fundamental\nrole in human decisions under uncertainty. Moreover, it is well known from\nphysics that any probabilistic structure modeling contextual interactions\nbetween entities structurally needs a non-Kolmogorovian quantum-like framework.\nIn this paper we introduce the notion of 'contextual risk' with the aim of\nmodeling a substantial part of the situations in which usually only 'ambiguity'\nis present. More precisely, we firstly introduce the essentials of an\noperational formalism called 'the hidden measurement approach' in which\nprobability is introduced as a consequence of fluctuations in the interaction\nbetween entities and contexts. Within the hidden measurement approach we\npropose a 'sphere model' as a mathematical tool for situations in which\ncontextual risk occurs. We show that a probabilistic model of this kind is\nnecessarily non-Kolmogorovian, hence it requires either the formalism of\nquantum mechanics or a generalization of it. This insight is relevant, for it\nexplains the presence of quantum or, better, quantum-like, structures in\neconomics, as suggested by some authors, and can serve to solve the\naforementioned paradoxes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 22:33:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1814", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "A Contextual Risk Model for the Ellsberg Paradox", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Journal of Engineering Science and Technology Review, 4, pp.\n  246-250, 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes show that the expected utility hypothesis\nand Savage's Sure-Thing Principle are violated in real life decisions.

Situations in which contextual risk occurs cannot be\nmodeled by Kolmogorovian classical probabilistic structures, but a\nnon-Kolmogorovian framework with a quantum-like structure is needed. We prove\nin this paper that the contextual risk approach can be applied to the Ellsberg\nparadox, and elaborate a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement\nformalism' which reveals that it is the overall conceptual landscape that is\nresponsible of the disagreement between actual human decisions and the\npredictions of expected utility theory, which generates the paradox. This\nresult points to the presence of a 'quantum conceptual layer' in human thought\nwhich is superposed to the usually assumed 'classical logical layer'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 22:39:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2122", "submitter": "Geoff Willis", "authors": "Geoff Willis", "title": "Why Money Trickles Up - Wealth & Income Distributions", "comments": "45 pages of text, 36 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper combines ideas from classical economics and modern finance with\nthe general Lotka-Volterra models of Levy & Solomon to provide straightforward\nexplanations of wealth and income distributions.
