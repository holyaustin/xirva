We attempt to lay down some aspects of interest prohibition theory\nwrapped in a larger framework of informal logic. The reason for this is that\ninterest prohibition theory has to deal with a variety of arguments which is so\nwide that a limitation to so-called correct arguments in advance is\ncounterproductive. We suggest that an application specific informal logic must\nbe developed for dealing with the principles of interest prohibition theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Apr 2011 10:35:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstra", "J.

In this paper we set out to analyze and characterize this network, as\ncaptured by the IMF Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), in two\nways. First, through an adaptation of the \"error and attack\" methodology [1],\nwe show that the network is of the \"robust-yet-fragile\" type, a topology found\nin a wide variety of evolved networks. We compare these results against four\ncommon null-models, generated only from first-order statistics of the empirical\ndata. In addition, we suggest a fifth, log-normal model, which generates\nnetworks that seem to match the empirical one more closely. Still, this model\ndoes not account for several higher order network statistics, which reenforces\nthe added value of the higher-order analysis. Second, using loss-given-default\ndynamics [2], we model financial interdependence and potential cascading of\nfinancial distress through the network. Preliminary simulations indicate that\ndefault by a single relatively small country like Greece can be absorbed by the\nnetwork, but that default in combination with defaults of other PIGS countries\n(Portugal, Ireland, and Spain) could lead to a massive extinction cascade in\nthe global economy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2011 12:44:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 22:34:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dette", "Tilman", ""], ["Pauls", "Scott", ""], ["Rockmore", "Daniel N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.4380", "submitter": "Daniel Rockmore", "authors": "N.

In this paper we introduce to this macroeconomic system the\nnotion of extinction analysis, a technique often used in the analysis of\necosystems, for the purposes of investigating the robustness of this network.\nIn particular, we subject the WTW to a principled set of in silico \"knockout\nexperiments,\" akin to those carried out in the investigation of food webs, but\nsuitably adapted to this macroeconomic network. Broadly, our experiments show\nthat over time the WTW moves to a \"robust yet fragile\" configuration where it\nis robust to random failures but fragile under targeted attack. This change in\nstability is highly correlated with the connectance (edge density) of the\nnetwork. Moreover, there is evidence of a sharp change in the structure of the\nnetwork in the 1960s and 1970s, where most measures of robustness rapidly\nincrease before resuming a declining trend. We interpret these results in the\ncontext in the post-World War II move towards globalization. Globalization\ncoincides with the sharp increase in robustness but also with a rise in those\nmeasures (e.g., connectance and trade imbalances) which correlate with\ndecreases in robustness. The peak of robustness is reached after the onset of\nglobalization policy but before the negative impacts are substantial. These\nanalyses depend on a simple model of dynamics that rebalances the trade flow\nupon network perturbation, the most dramatic of which is node deletion. More\nsubtle and textured forms of perturbation lead to the definition of other\nmeasures of node importance as well as vulnerability. We anticipate that\nexperiments and measures like these can play an important role in the\nevaluation of the stability of economic systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Apr 2011 03:02:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2011 10:42:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Foti", "N.", ""], ["Pauls", "S.", ""], ["Rockmore", "Daniel N.", ""]]}]
