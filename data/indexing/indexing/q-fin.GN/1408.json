This is of\nparticular interest in finance, as the increasing complexity of financial\nsystems is coupled with information overload. Opinion formation, therefore, is\nnot always the result of optimal information processing. On the contrary,\nagents are boundedly rational and naturally tend to observe and imitate others\nin order to gain further insights. Hence, a certain degree of interaction,\nwhich can be envisioned as a network, occurs within the system. Opinions, the\ninteraction network and prices in financial markets are then heavily\nintertwined and influence one another. We build on previous contributions on\nadaptive systems, where agents have hetereogenous beliefs, and introduce a\ndynamic confidence network that captures the interaction and shapes the opinion\npatterns. The analytical framework we adopt for modeling the interaction is\nrooted in the opinion dynamics problem. This will allow us to introduce a\nnonlinear model where the confidence network, opinion dynamics and price\nformation coevolve in time. A key aspect of the model is the classification of\nagents according to their topological role in the network, therefore showing\nthat topology matters in determining how of opinions and prices will coevolve.\nWe illustrate the dynamics via simulations, discussing the stylized facts in\nfinance that the model is able to capture. Last, we propose an empirical\nvalidation and calibration scheme that makes use of social network data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 21:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["D'Errico", "Marco", ""], ["Muradoglu", "Gulnur", ""], ["Stefani", "Silvana", ""], ["Zambruno", "Giovanni", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.0440", "submitter": "Christoph Aymanns", "authors": "Christoph Aymanns, Co-Pierre Georg", "title": "Contagious Synchronization and Endogenous Network Formation in Financial\n  Networks", "comments": "41 pages, 10 figures, Journal of Banking & Finance 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jbankfin.2014.06.030", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.CP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When banks choose similar investment strategies the financial system becomes\nvulnerable to common shocks. We model a simple financial system in which banks\ndecide about their investment strategy based on a private belief about the\nstate of the world and a social belief formed from observing the actions of\npeers. Observing a larger group of peers conveys more information and thus\nleads to a stronger social belief. Extending the standard model of Bayesian\nupdating in social networks, we show that the probability that banks\nsynchronize their investment strategy on a state non-matching action critically\ndepends on the weighting between private and social belief.

This framework was successfully adapted to modeling of wealth\ndistributions in the early 2000's.

Therefore, a key stability question that has been\nunder-investigated is how strong the conditions of a system itself can change\nbefore the system moves to a qualitatively different behavior, i.e., how\nstructurally stable the systems is. Here, we introduce a framework to\ninvestigate the structural stability of socioeconomic systems formed by the\nnetwork of interactions among agents competing for resources. We measure the\nstructural stability of the system as the range of conditions in the\ndistribution and availability of resources compatible with the qualitative\nbehavior in which all the constituent agents can be self-sustained across time.\nTo illustrate our framework, we study an empirical representation of the global\nsocioeconomic system formed by countries sharing and competing for\nmultinational companies used as proxy for resources. We demonstrate that the\nstructural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of\ncompetition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources.\nImportantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global\nsocioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of\nresources.
