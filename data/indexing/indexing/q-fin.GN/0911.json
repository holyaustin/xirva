Because of the heterogeneity of the\nrational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the\noptimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the\nsurvival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The\nexplicit exact analytical solutions of the two models provide nonlinear\ntransformations which allow us to develop novel tests for the presence of\nbubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter\nestimation of the stochastic differential equation describing the price\ndynamics, the derived operational procedures allow us to diagnose bubbles that\nare in the making and to forecast their termination time. The tests performed\non three financial markets, the US S&P500 index from 1 February 1980 to 31\nOctober 2008, the US NASDAQ composite index from 1 January 1980 to 31 July 2008\nand the Hong Kong Hang Seng index from 1 December 1986 to 30 November 2008,\nsuggest the feasibility of advance bubble warning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Nov 2009 15:00:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Li", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3099", "submitter": "Kartik Anand", "authors": "Kartik Anand, Prasanna Gai, Matteo Marsili", "title": "Financial crises and the evaporation of trust", "comments": "21 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Trust lies at the crux of most economic transactions, with credit markets\nbeing a notable example.

From the temporal distributions of clustered\nsegments, we find that the US economy took one and a half years to recover from\nthe mid-1998-to-mid-2003 financial crisis, but only two months to completely\nenter the present financial crisis. We also find the oil & gas and basic\nmaterials sectors leading the recovery from the previous financial crisis,\nwhile the consumer goods and utilities sectors led the descent into the present\nfinancial crisis. On a macroscopic level, we find sectors going earlier into a\ncrisis emerge later from it, whereas sectors going later into the crisis emerge\nearlier. On the mesoscopic level, we find leading sectors experiencing stronger\nand longer volatility shocks, while trailing sectors experience weaker and\nshorter volatility shocks. In our shock-by-shock causal-link analysis, we also\nfind shorter delays between corresponding shocks in more closely related\neconomic sectors. In addition, our analysis reveals evidences for complex\nsectorial structures, as well as nonlinear amplification in the propagating\nvolatility shocks. From a perspective relevant to public policy, our study\nsuggests an endogeneous sectorial dynamics during the mid-2003 economic\nrecovery, in contrast to strong exogeneous driving by Federal Reserve interest\nrate cuts during the mid-2007 onset. Most interestingly, we find for the\nsequence of closely spaced interest rate cuts instituted in 2007/2008, the\nfirst few cuts effectively lowered market volatilities, while the next few cuts\ncounter-effectively increased market volatilities. Subsequent cuts evoked\nlittle response from the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Nov 2009 05:22:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 10:10:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 25 Feb 2011 06:25:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Gladys Hui Ting", ""], ["Zhang", "Yiting", ""], ["Wong", "Jian Cheng", ""], ["Prusty", "Manamohan", ""], ["Cheong", "Siew Ann", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5503", "submitter": "Constantinos Kardaras", "authors": "Constantinos Kardaras", "title": "Finitely additive probabilities and the Fundamental Theorem of Asset\n  Pricing", "comments": "14 pages.
