Agents populating the stock market are assumed\nto be not able to observe the true underlying fundamental, and their beliefs\nare biased by either optimism or pessimism. Depending on the relevance they\ngive to beliefs, they select the best performing strategy in an evolutionary\nperspective. The real side of the economy is described within a\nmultiplier-accelerator framework with a nonlinear, bounded investment function.\nWe show that strongly polarized beliefs in an evolutionary framework can\nintroduce multiplicity of steady states, which, consisting in enhanced or\ndepressed levels of income, reflect and reproduce the optimistic or pessimistic\nnature of the agents' beliefs. The polarization of these steady states, which\ncoexist with an unbiased steady state, positively depends on that of the\nbeliefs and on their relevance. Moreover, with a mixture of analytical and\nnumerical tools, we show that such static characterization is inherited also at\nthe dynamical level, with possibly complex attractors that are characterized by\nendogenously fluctuating pessimistic and optimistic levels of national income\nand price. This framework, when stochastic perturbations are included, is able\nto account for stylized facts commonly observed in real financial markets, such\nas fat tails and excess volatility in the returns distributions, as well as\nbubbles and crashes for stock prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Apr 2018 14:02:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Cavalli", "Fausto", ""], ["Naimzada", "Ahmad", ""], ["Pecora", "Nicol\u00f2", ""], ["Pireddu", "Marina", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.01019", "submitter": "Joel Nishimura", "authors": "Joel Nishimura", "title": "When a `rat race' implies an intergenerational wealth trap", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Two critical questions about intergenerational outcomes are: one, whether\nsignificant barriers or traps exist between different social or economic\nstrata; and two, the extent to which intergenerational outcomes do (or can be\nused to) affect individual investment and consumption decisions.

Their unique technology content, the type of founders and managers\nthey have, the amount of venture capital they raise, the time it takes them to\nreach an exit as well as the technology clusters they belong to are seen as\nsuch unique features. Based on extensive research from new databases, the\nauthor claims that the biotechnology startups are not as different as it might\nhave been claimed: the amount of venture capital raised, the time to exit,\ntheir geography are indeed similar and even their equity structure to founders\nand managers have similarities. The differences still exist, for example the\nexperience of the founders, the revenue and profit level at exit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Apr 2018 07:21:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Lebret", "Herv\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12109", "submitter": "Thi Huong Tran", "authors": "Thi Huong Tran", "title": "Critical factors and enablers of food quality and safety compliance risk\n  management in the Vietnamese seafood supply chain", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.5121/ijmvsc.2018.9101", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, along with the emergence of food scandals, food supply chains have\nto face with ever-increasing pressure from compliance with food quality and\nsafety regulations and standards. This paper aims to explore critical factors\nof compliance risk in food supply chain with an illustrated case in Vietnamese\nseafood industry. To this end, this study takes advantage of both primary and\nsecondary data sources through a comprehensive literature research of\nindustrial and scientific papers, combined with expert interview. Findings\nshowed that there are three main critical factor groups influencing on\ncompliance risk including challenges originating from Vietnamese food supply\nchain itself, characteristics of regulation and standards, and business\nenvironment. Furthermore, author proposed enablers to eliminate compliance\nrisks to food supply chain managers as well as recommendations to government\nand other influencers and supporters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2018 03:08:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Tran", "Thi Huong", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12110", "submitter": "Sina Aghaei", "authors": "Sina Aghaei", "title": "A Data-Driven Approach for Modeling Stochasticity in Oil Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  Global oil price is an important factor in determining many economic\nvariables in the world's economy. It is generally modeled as a stochastic\nprocess and have been studied through different techniques by comparing the\nhistoric time series of demand, supply and the price itself. However, there are\nmany historic events where the demand or supply changes are not sufficient in\nexplaining the price changes. In such cases, it is the expectations on the\nfuture changes of demand or supply that causes heavy and quick influences on\nthe price. There are many parameters and variables that shape these\nexpectations, and are usually neglected in traditional models. In this paper,\nwe have proposed a model based on System Dynamics approach that takes into\naccount these non-traditional factors. The validity of the proposed model is\nthen evaluated using real and potential scenarios in which the proposed model\nfollows the trend of the real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Apr 2018 05:45:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Aghaei", "Sina", ""]]}]
