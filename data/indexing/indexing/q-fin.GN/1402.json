This paper analyses the impact of heterogeneous\nTAs, and their interaction with domestic institutions, on FDI inflows.\nStatistical analyses for 122 developing countries from 1970 to 2005 support\nthis argument.

Claims about causes are made\nwithout actual information, and accepted or dismissed based upon poor or\nnon-existent evidence. Here we investigate the price movements that ended with\nApple stock closing at \\$500.00 on January 18, 2013. There is a ready\nexplanation for this price movement: market manipulation by those who sold\nstock options, who stood to directly benefit from this closing price. Indeed,\none web commentator predicted this otherwise unlikely event publicly. This\nexplanation was subsequently dismissed by press articles that claim that stock\nprices end near such round numbers based upon legitimate hedging activity. But\nhow can we know? We show that the accepted model that points to hedging as the\ndriving cause of prices is not quantitatively consistent with the price\nmovement on that day. The price moved upward too quickly over a period in which\nthe hedgers' position would require selling rather than buying. Under these\nconditions hedgers would have driven the price away from the strike price\nrather than toward it. We also show that a long published theory of the role of\nhedging is incomplete mathematically, and that the correct theory results in\nmuch weaker price movements. This evidence substantially weakens the case of\nthose who claim hedging as cause of anomalous market price movements. The\nexplanation that market manipulation is responsible for the final close cannot\nbe dismissed based upon unsubstantiated, even invalid, hedging claims.
