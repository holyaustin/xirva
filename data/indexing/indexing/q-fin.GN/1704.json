The proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio\nvalue bounded within a targeted range, composed of a conservative lower target\nrepresenting a need for capital protection and a desired upper target\nrepresenting an investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire\nprobability distribution of returns, as it simultaneously seeks a desired\nexpected return, cuts off downside risk and implicitly caps volatility and\nhigher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of this investment strategy, we\nstudy a multiperiod portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs and\ndevelop a two-stage regression approach that improves the classical least\nsquares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm when dealing with difficult payoffs, such\nas highly concave, abruptly changing or discontinuous functions. Our numerical\nresults show substantial improvements over the classical LSMC algorithm for\nboth the constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility approach and the\nproposed skewed target range strategy (STRS). Our numerical results illustrate\nthe ability of the STRS to contain the portfolio value within the targeted\nrange. When compared with the CRRA utility approach, the STRS achieves a\nsimilar mean-variance efficient frontier while delivering a better downside\nrisk-return trade-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 03:50:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 06:21:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 02:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rongju", ""], ["Langren\u00e9", "Nicolas", ""], ["Tian", "Yu", ""], ["Zhu", "Zili", ""], ["Klebaner", "Fima", ""], ["Hamza", "Kais", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01028", "submitter": "Matthias Raddant", "authors": "Matthias Raddant and Dror Y.

Prior theory indicates that such differing rates\nshould influence the relative speed of diffusion of the products embodying the\ndifferent technologies since improvement in performance during the diffusion\nprocess increases the desirability of the product diffusing. However, there has\nnot been a broad empirical attempt to examine this effect and to clarify the\nunderlying cause. Therefore, this paper reviews the theoretical basis and\nfocuses upon empirical tests of this effect across multiple products and their\nunderlying technologies. The results for 18 different diffusing products show\nthe expected relationship-faster diffusion for products based on more rapidly\nimproving technological domains- between technological improvement and\ndiffusion with strong statistical significance. The empirical examination also\ndemonstrates that technological improvement does not slow down in the latter\nparts of diffusion when penetration does slow down. This finding indicates that\ndiffusion slow down in the latter stages is due to market saturation effects\nand is not due to slowdown of performance improvement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 02:07:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 16:28:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 04:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Woo", "JongRoul", ""], ["Magee", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04979", "submitter": "Vahid Moosavi", "authors": "Vahid Moosavi", "title": "Urban Data Streams and Machine Learning: A Case of Swiss Real Estate\n  Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY q-fin.GN stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we show how using publicly available data streams and machine\nlearning algorithms one can develop practical data driven services with no\ninput from domain experts as a form of prior knowledge.
