This is exactly what we did, gathering\n61 young, quantitatively trained men and women to play this game. The results,\nin a nutshell, were that the majority of these 61 players did not place their\nbets very well, displaying a broad panoply of behaviorial and cognitive biases.\nAbout 30% of the subjects actually went bust, losing their full \\$25 stake. We\nalso discuss optimal betting strategies, valuation of the opportunity to play\nthe game and its similarities to investing in the stock market. The main\nimplication of our study is that people need to be better educated and trained\nin how to approach decision making under uncertainty. If these quantitatively\ntrained players, playing the simplest game we can think of involving\nuncertainty and favourable odds, did not play well, what hope is there for the\nrest of us when it comes to playing the biggest and most important game of all:\ninvesting our savings?

The failure to predict recessions is a persistent theme in\neconomic forecasting. The Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) provides\ndata on predictions made for the growth of total output, GDP, in the United\nStates for one, two, three and four quarters ahead since the end of the 1960s.\nOver a three quarters ahead horizon, the mean prediction made for GDP growth\nhas never been negative over this period. The correlation between the mean SPF\nthree quarters ahead forecast and the data is very low, and over the most\nrecent 25 years is not significantly different from zero.\n  Here, we show that the machine learning technique of random forests has the\npotential to give early warning of recessions. We use a small set of\nexplanatory variables from financial markets which would have been available to\na forecaster at the time of making the forecast. We train the algorithm over\nthe 1970Q2-1990Q1 period, and make predictions one, three and six quarters\nahead. We then re-train over 1970Q2-1990Q2 and make a further set of\npredictions, and so on. We did not attempt any optimisation of predictions,\nusing only the default input parameters to the algorithm we downloaded in the\npackage R.\n  We compare the predictions made from 1990 to the present with the actual\ndata. One quarter ahead, the algorithm is not able to improve on the SPF\npredictions. Three and six quarters ahead, the correlations between actual and\npredicted are low, but they are very significantly different from zero.\nAlthough the timing is slightly wrong, a serious downturn in the first half of\n2009 could have been predicted six quarters ahead in late 2007. The algorithm\nnever predicts a recession when one did not occur.\n  We obtain even stronger results with random forest machine learning\ntechniques in the case of the United Kingdom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 14:19:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nyman", "Rickard", ""], ["Ormerod", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.02182", "submitter": "Refk Selmi", "authors": "Jamal Bouoiyour (CATT), Refk Selmi (CATT)", "title": "Political elections and uncertainty -Are BRICS markets equally exposed\n  to Trump's agenda?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There certainly is little or no doubt that politicians, sometimes consciously\nand sometimes not, exert a significant impact on stock markets.

The present paper seeks to address\nwhether BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) stock markets\nequally vulnerable to Trump's plans. For this purpose, two methods were\nadopted. The first presents an event-study methodology based on regression\nestimation of abnormal returns. The second is based on vote intentions by\nintegrating data from social media (Twitter), search queries (Google Trends)\nand public opinion polls. Our results robustly reveal that although some\nmarkets emerged losers, others took the opposite route. China took the biggest\nhit with Brazil, while the damage was much more limited for India and South\nAfrica. These adverse responses can be explained by the Trump's\nneo-mercantilist attitude revolving around tearing up trade deals, instituting\ntariffs, and labeling China a \"currency manipulator\". However, Russia looks to\nbe benefiting due to Trump's sympathetic attitude towards Vladimir Putin and\nexpectations about the scaling down of sanctions imposed on Russia over its\nrole in the conflict in Ukraine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 14:11:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bouoiyour", "Jamal", "", "CATT"], ["Selmi", "Refk", "", "CATT"]]}, {"id": "1701.02647", "submitter": "Wesley Boyce", "authors": "Wesley S.

Suppose that we know for the coming years, economy\nof the US will experience a real growth rate equal to \\%3 and economy of China\nwill experience a real growth as of \\%6. Now, the question is how long does it\ntake for economy of China to catch the economy of the United States. The early\nimpression is that the desired time is the answer of the equation\n$11\\times1.06^X=18\\times1.03^X$. The correct answer however is quite different.\nGDP is not a simple number and the gap between two countries can not be\naddressed simply through their sizes. It is rather a geometrical object.\nCountries pass different paths in the space of production. The gaps between GDP\nof different countries depend on the path that each country passes through and\nlocal metric. To address distance between economies of China and of the US we\nneed to know their utility preferences and the path that China passes to reach\nthe US size. The true gap then can be found if we calculate local metric along\nthis path. It resembles impressions about measurements in the General Theory of\nRelativity. Path dependency of aggregate indexes is widely discussed in the\nIndex Number Theory. Our aim is to stick to the geometrical view presented in\nthe General Relativity to provide a visual understanding of the matter. We show\nthat different elements in the general relativity have their own counterparts\nin economics. We claim that national agencies who provide aggregate data\nresemble falling observers into a curved space time. It is while the World Bank\nor international organizations are outside observers. The vision provided here,\nleaves readers with a clear conclusion. If China keeps its growth rate, then\nthe economy of China should catch the economy of the United States sooner than\nwhat we expect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 11:20:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Apr 2019 10:09:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Hosseiny", "Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.06624", "submitter": "Amita Gajewar", "authors": "Amita Gajewar, Gagan Bansal", "title": "Revenue Forecasting for Enterprise Products", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For any business, planning is a continuous process, and typically\nbusiness-owners focus on making both long-term planning aligned with a\nparticular strategy as well as short-term planning that accommodates the\ndynamic market situations.
