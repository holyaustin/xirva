The\nextensions of quantum mechanics to statistical physics and information theory\nlet us use some of their definitions for the best understanding of the behavior\nof economics and biology. The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is\nthe von Neumann equation. A system in where all its members are in Nash\nequilibrium is equivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state. Nature is a\ngame in where its players compete for a common welfare and the equilibrium of\nthe system that they are members. They act as a whole besides individuals like\nthey obey a rule in where they prefer to work for the welfare of the collective\nbesides the individual welfare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2007 22:14:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Guevara", "Esteban", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.0161", "submitter": "Jia Shao", "authors": "Jia Shao, Plamen Ch.

We find similar results for\ntwo independent indices of corruption, suggesting that the relation between\ncorruption and wealth does not depend on the specific measure of corruption.\nThe functional relations we report have implications when assessing the\nrelative level of corruption for two countries with comparable wealth, and for\nquantifying the impact of corruption on economic growth and foreign\ninvestments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 19:56:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Shao", "Jia", ""], ["Ivanov", "Plamen Ch.", ""], ["Podobnik", "Boris", ""], ["Stanley", "H.

Firstly, the probability density function of\nprofits growth rate is described as a tent-shaped exponential function.\nSecondly, the value of the origin of the growth rate distribution divided into\nbins is constant. The derivation is confirmed in the database consistently.\n  This static procedure is applied to a quasi-static system.

In\nthe derivation, a Non-Gibrat's law under the detailed quasi-balance is adopted\ntogether with two approximations confirmed in the static system. The resultant\ndistribution is power-law with varying Pareto index in the large scale region\nand the quasi-static log-normal distribution in the middle scale region. In the\ndistribution, not only the change of Pareto index but also the change of the\nvariance of the log-normal distribution depends on the parameter of the\ndetailed quasi-balance.
