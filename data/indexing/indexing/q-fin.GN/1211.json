Although\nevidence suggests that HFT contributes to the efficiency of markets, there are\nconcerns it also adds to market instability, especially during times of stress.\nCurrently, it is unclear how or why HFT produces these outcomes. In this paper,\nI use data from NASDAQ to show that HFT synchronizes prices in financial\nmarkets, making the values of related securities change contemporaneously. With\na model, I demonstrate how price synchronization leads to increased efficiency:\nprices are more accurate and transaction costs are reduced. During times of\nstress, however, localized errors quickly propagate through the financial\nsystem if safeguards are not in place. In addition, there is potential for HFT\nto enforce incorrect relationships between securities, making prices more (or\nless) correlated than economic fundamentals warrant. This research highlights\nan important role that HFT plays in markets and helps answer several puzzling\nquestions that previously seemed difficult to explain: why HFT is so prevalent,\nwhy HFT concentrates in certain securities and largely ignores others, and\nfinally, how HFT can lower transaction costs yet still make profits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2012 17:44:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Gerig", "Austin", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.1938", "submitter": "Liviu-Adrian Cotfas", "authors": "Liviu-Adrian Cotfas", "title": "A quantum mechanical model for the rate of return", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Romanian Reports in Physics 65 (2013) 327-333", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math-ph math.MP quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In their activity, the traders approximate the rate of return by integer\nmultiples of a minimal one.

Power\nproduction and wealth rise equally quickly because civilization, like any other\nsystem in the universe, must consume and dissipate its energy reserves in order\nto sustain its current size. One perspective might be that financial wealth\nmust ultimately collapse as we deplete our energy reserves. However, we can\nalso expect that highly aggregated quantities like global wealth have inertia,\nand that growth rates must persist. Exceptionally rapid innovation in the two\ndecades following 1950 allowed for unprecedented acceleration of\ninflation-adjusted rates of return. But today, real innovation rates are more\nstagnant. This means that, over the coming decade or so, global GDP and wealth\nshould rise fairly steadily at an inflation-adjusted rate of about 2.2% per\nyear.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 20:39:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Garrett", "Timothy J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.4108", "submitter": "Ledenyov Oleg Pavlovich", "authors": "Dimitri O.

Moreover, the resulting inference procedures are also more\npowerful than the structured projection methods, which rely upon building\nconfidence sets for the frontier-determining sufficient parameters (e.g.\nfrontier-spanning portfolios), and then projecting them to obtain confidence\nsets for HJ sets or MF sets.
