The evolution is driven by multiplicative stochastic\nfluctuations governed by the law of proportionate growth and interactions\nbetween agents. We are mainly interested in interactions increasing wealth\ninequality that is in a local implementation of the accumulated advantage\nprinciple. Such interactions destabilise the system. They are confronted in the\nmodel with a global regulatory mechanism which reduces wealth inequality. There\nare different scenarios emerging as a net effect of these two competing\nmechanisms. When the effect of the global regulation (economic interventionism)\nis too weak the system is unstable and it never reaches equilibrium. When the\neffect is sufficiently strong the system evolves towards a limiting stationary\ndistribution with a Pareto tail. In between there is a critical phase. In this\nphase the system may evolve towards a steady state with a multimodal wealth\ndistribution. The corresponding cumulative density function has a\ncharacteristic stairway pattern which reflects the effect of economic\nstratification. The stairs represent wealth levels of economic classes\nseparated by wealth gaps. As we show, the pattern is typical for macro-economic\nsystems with a limited economic freedom. One can find such a multimodal pattern\nin empirical data, for instance, in the highest percentile of wealth\ndistribution for the population in urban areas of China.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Feb 2018 16:55:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Jun 2019 13:16:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Burda", "Zdzislaw", ""], ["Wojcieszak", "Pawel", ""], ["Zuchniak", "Konrad", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.03376", "submitter": "Christopher Cameron", "authors": "Christopher Cameron", "title": "Visualizing Treasury Issuance Strategy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.EC q-fin.GN q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce simple cost and risk proxy metrics that can be attached to\nTreasury issuance strategy to complement analysis of the resulting portfolio\nweighted-average maturity (WAM).

In the second section, the report discusses how Small Modular\nReactors (SMRs) might address these issues. Megaprojects are extremely risky\nand often implemented after a sub-optimal phase of project planning leading to\nunderestimations of the costs and overestimation of short-term benefits. When\nconsidering adherence to schedule and budget, often megaprojects might be\nconsidered a failure, and optimism bias, strategic mis-rapresentation,\ncomplexity, poor planning, poor risk allocation, poor scope management are all\nreasons to explain their over budget and delay. For megaprojects, especially in\nthe nuclear field, a key strategy to achieve good performances appears to be\nthe standardization. This standardization needs to be twofold: (i) technical\nstandardisation, i.e. the construction of very similar design over and over,\nand (ii) the project delivery chain standardisation, i.e. the same stakeholders\ninvolved in the delivery of a project that is replicable multiple times. Under\nthis perspective, given their size and standardisation potential, SMRs, might\nbe a suitable class of NPP for several countries. Yet, if the economy of scale\nis the only driver considered, SMRs are hardly competitive with large NPPs (or\neven with gas or coal power plants). However, a fleet of standard SMRs might\nbalance the lack of economy of scale with the economy of multiples, and the\ndelivery of several standardised SMR projects might be the key to achieve good\nproject management performances in the nuclear sector. However, the deployment\nof SMRs faces a number of challenges from several perspectives, such as the\nlicencing, supply chain and financing ones. These challenges might be enormous,\nbut so are the potential rewards too.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Feb 2018 10:46:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Locatelli", "Giorgio", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.07422", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Ronald P.
