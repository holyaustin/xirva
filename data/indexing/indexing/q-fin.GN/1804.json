In the best-case scenario of a two-headed coin, we show that the goal\nof attaining the Cash-In event in a finite lifetime is precisely the goal,\ndescribed more than two thousand years ago in Zeno's Paradox of the Dichotomy,\nof obtaining the sum of an infinite geometric series with only a finite number\nof terms. In the worst-case scenario of a two-tailed coin, we prove that the\nCash-Out event occurs in exactly ten tosses.\n  If the coin is fair, we show that if a CPDO were allowed to toss the coin\nwithout regard for the Cash-Out rule then the CPDO eventually has a high\nprobability of attaining large net capital levels; however, hundreds of\nthousands of tosses may be needed to do so. Moreover, if after many tosses the\nCPDO shows a loss then the probability is high that it will Cash-Out on the\nvery next toss. If a CPDO experiences a tail on the first toss or on an early\ntoss, we show that, with high probability, the CPDO will have capital losses\nthereafter for hundreds of tosses; moreover, its sequence of net capital levels\nis a martingale. When the Cash-Out rule holds, we modify the Cash-In rule to\nmean that the CPDO attains a profit of 90 percent on its capital; then we prove\nthat the CPDO game, almost surely, will end in finitely many tosses and the\nprobability of Cash-Out is at least 89 percent.\n  In light of our results, our fears about the durability of worldwide\nfinancial crises are heightened by the existence of other financial derivatives\nmore arcane than CPDOs. In particular, we view askance all later-generation\nCPDOs that depend mean-reversion assumptions or use a betting strategy similar\nto their first-generation counterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2018 23:56:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Richards", "Donald", ""], ["Hundal", "Hein", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.00825", "submitter": "Donald Richards", "authors": "Gilna K.
