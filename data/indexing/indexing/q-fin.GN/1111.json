For example, in the case of a smooth parametric\nfamily of probability distributions on the real line, the parameter space has a\nRiemannian structure induced by the embedding of the family into the Hilbert\nspace of square-integrable functions, and is characterised by the Fisher-Rao\nmetric. In the nonparametric case the relevant geometry is determined by the\nspherical distance function of Bhattacharyya. In the context of term structure\nmodelling, we show that minus the derivative of the discount function with\nrespect to the maturity date gives rise to a probability density. This follows\nas a consequence of the positivity of interest rates. Therefore, by mapping the\ndensity functions associated with a given family of term structures to Hilbert\nspace, the resulting metrical geometry can be used to analyse the relationship\nof yield curves to one another. We show that the general arbitrage-free yield\ncurve dynamics can be represented as a process taking values in the convex\nspace of smooth density functions on the positive real line. It follows that\nthe theory of interest rate dynamics can be represented by a class of processes\nin Hilbert space. We also derive the dynamics for the central moments\nassociated with the distribution determined by the yield curve.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Nov 2011 10:42:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Brody", "Dorje C.", ""], ["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.3885", "submitter": "Nicolas Perkowski", "authors": "Peter Imkeller and Nicolas Perkowski", "title": "The Existence of Dominating Local Martingale Measures", "comments": "32 pages; revised version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove that, for locally bounded processes, absence of arbitrage\nopportunities of the first kind is equivalent to the existence of a dominating\nlocal martingale measure.

First, we analysed the\nrelationships between sales and sales of nearest neighbourhoods from which we\nobtain a simple linear relationship between sales and the weighted sum of sales\nof nearest neighbourhoods (i.e., customers). In addition, we introduce a simple\nmoney transport model that is coherent with this empirical observation. In this\nmodel, a firm (i.e., customer) distributes money to its out-edges (suppliers)\nproportionally to the in-degree of destinations. From intensive numerical\nsimulations, we find that the steady flows derived from these models can\napproximately reproduce the distribution of sales of actual firms.
