The\nconventional wisdom is that the free market for labor, which determines the pay\npackages, cares only about efficiency and not fairness. We present an\nalternative theory that shows that an ideal free market environment also\npromotes fairness, as an emergent property resulting from the self-organizing\nmarket dynamics. Even though an individual employee may care only about his or\nher salary and no one else's, the collective actions of all the employees,\ncombined with the profit maximizing actions of all the companies, in a free\nmarket environment under budgetary constraints, lead towards a more fair\nallocation of wages, guided by Adam Smith's invisible hand of\nself-organization. By exploring deep connections with statistical\nthermodynamics, we show that entropy is the appropriate measure of fairness in\na free market environment which is maximized at equilibrium to yield the\nlognormal distribution of salaries as the fairest inequality of pay in an\norganization under ideal conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Jun 2010 21:36:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Venkatasubramanian", "Venkat", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4595", "submitter": "Sidney Redner", "authors": "P.
