In\nrecent years, the econophysical literature has proposed a large amount of\npapers and models justifying the presence of power laws in economic data. Most\nof the times, this Paretianity is inferred from the observation of some plots,\nsuch as the Zipf plot and the mean excess plot. If the Zipf plot looks almost\nlinear, then everything is ok and the parameters of the Pareto distribution are\nestimated. Often with OLS. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, these\nheuristic graphical tools are not reliable. To be more exact, we show that only\na combination of plots can give some degree of confidence about the real\npresence of Paretianity in the data. We start by reviewing some of the most\nimportant plots, discussing their points of strength and weakness, and then we\npropose some additional tools that can be used to refine the analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 12:45:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Cirillo", "Pasquale", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0215", "submitter": "Andreas Joseph Mr.", "authors": "Andreas Joseph, Stephan Joseph and Guanrong Chen", "title": "Cross-border Portfolio Investment Networks and Indicators for Financial\n  Crises", "comments": "21 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports (4), 3991, 2014", "doi": "10.1038/srep03991", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.data-an", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cross-border equity and long-term debt securities portfolio investment\nnetworks are analysed from 2002 to 2012, covering the 2008 global financial\ncrisis.

Replacement purchase causes periodic variations of the sales\ndetermined by the finite lifetime of the good (Juglar cycles).

The theory contains the standard equilibrium\nview of a market as a special case. It depends on the time scale, whether an\nequilibrium or evolutionary description is more appropriate. The evolutionary\nframework is used to derive also the size, growth rate and price distribution\nof manufacturing business units. It predicts that the size distribution of the\nbusiness units (products) is lognormal, while the growth rates exhibit a\nLaplace distribution. Large price deviations from the mean price are also\ngoverned by a Laplace distribution (fat tails). These results are in agreement\nwith empirical findings.
