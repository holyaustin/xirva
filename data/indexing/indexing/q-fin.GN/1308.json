This paper shows that quarterly inventory\nchanges of wheat in the global market, during 1974-2012, follow a nonlinear\ndeterministic process. Lyapunov exponents of these fluctuations are computed\nusing sliding time windows each of length 131 quarters. Weakly chaotic behavior\nalternates with non-chaotic behavior over the entire period of analysis. More\nimportantly, in this paper, a cubic dependence of price changes on inventory\nchanges leads to establishment of deterministic Duffing-Oscillator-Model(DOM)\nas a suitable candidate for examining inventory fluctuations of wheat. DOM\nrepresents the interaction of commodity production cycle with an external\nintervention in the market. Parameters obtained for shifting time zones by\nfitting the Fourier estimated time signals to DOM are able to generate\nresponses that reproduce the true chaotic nature exhibited by the empirical\nsignal at that time. Endowing the parameters with suitable meanings, one may\ninfer that temporary changes in speculation reflect the pattern of inventory\nvolatility that drives the transitions between chaotic and non-chaotic\nbehavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 15:57:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Kulkarni", "Varsha S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2172", "submitter": "Rene Carmona", "authors": "Rene Carmona, Jean-Pierre Fouque, Li-Hsien Sun", "title": "Mean Field Games and Systemic Risk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a simple model of inter-bank borrowing and lending where the\nevolution of the log-monetary reserves of $N$ banks is described by a system of\ndiffusion processes coupled through their drifts in such a way that stability\nof the system depends on the rate of inter-bank borrowing and lending.
