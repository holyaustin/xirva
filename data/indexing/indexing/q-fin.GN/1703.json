A strong (weak) safe haven is defined as\nan asset that has a significant positive (negative) return in periods where\nanother asset is in distress, while hedge has to be negatively correlated\n(uncorrelated) on average. The Bitcoin's surge alongside the aftermath of\nTrump's win in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections has strengthened its status\nas the modern safe haven. This paper uses a truly noise-assisted data analysis\nmethod, termed as Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition-based approach, to\nexamine whether Bitcoin can act as a hedge and safe haven for U.S. stock price\nindex. The results document that the Bitcoin's safe-haven property is\ntime-varying and that it has primarily been a weak safe haven in the short term\nand the long-term. We also demonstrate that precious metals lost their safe\nhaven properties over time as the correlation between gold/silver and U.S.\nstock price declines from short-to long-run horizons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 14:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bouoiyour", "Jamal", "", "CATT"], ["Selmi", "Refk", "", "CATT"]]}, {"id": "1703.01505", "submitter": "Alexander Lipton", "authors": "Alexander Lipton", "title": "Blockchains and Distributed Ledgers in Retrospective and Perspective", "comments": "Accepted for publication in the special issue \"Digital currencies\" of\n  the Journal of Risk Finance, 27 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce blockchains and distributed ledgers and describe their potential\napplications to money and banking.

Offshore Financial\nCenters (OFCs) facilitate these structures through low taxation and lenient\nregulation, but are increasingly under scrutiny, for instance for enabling tax\navoidance. Therefore, the identification of OFC jurisdictions has become a\npoliticized and contested issue. We introduce a novel data-driven approach for\nidentifying OFCs based on the global corporate ownership network, in which over\n98 million firms (nodes) are connected through 71 million ownership relations.\nThis granular firm-level network data uniquely allows identifying both\nsink-OFCs and conduit-OFCs. Sink-OFCs attract and retain foreign capital while\nconduit-OFCs are attractive intermediate destinations in the routing of\ninternational investments and enable the transfer of capital without taxation.\nWe identify 24 sink-OFCs. In addition, a small set of five countries -- the\nNetherlands, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Singapore and Switzerland -- canalize\nthe majority of corporate offshore investment as conduit-OFCs. Each conduit\njurisdiction is specialized in a geographical area and there is significant\nspecialization based on industrial sectors. Against the idea of OFCs as exotic\nsmall islands that cannot be regulated, we show that many sink and conduit-OFCs\nare highly developed countries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 20:02:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 May 2017 15:57:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia-Bernardo", "Javier", ""], ["Fichtner", "Jan", ""], ["Heemskerk", "Eelke M.", ""], ["Takes", "Frank W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.07513", "submitter": "Leonardo dos Santos Pinheiro", "authors": "Leonardo dos Santos Pinheiro and Flavio Codeco COelho", "title": "An Agent-based Model of Contagion in Financial Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This work develops an agent-based model for the study of how the leverage\nthrough the use of repurchase agreements can function as a mechanism for the\npropagation and amplification of financial shocks in a financial system.
