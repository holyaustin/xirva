Most existing demand\nforecasting techniques in literature are designed to manage and forecast this\ntype of demand functions. However, if the demand function is lumpy in nature,\nthen the general demand forecasting techniques may fail given the unusual\ncharacteristics of the function. Proper identification of the underlying demand\nfunction and using the most appropriate forecasting technique becomes critical.\nIn this paper, we will attempt to explore the key characteristics of the\ndifferent types of demand function and relate them to known statistical\ndistributions. By fitting statistical distributions to actual past demand data,\nwe are then able to identify the correct demand functions, so that the the most\nappropriate forecasting technique can be applied to obtain improved forecasting\nresults.

We argue that a stock market is an intrinsically contextual\nsystem where agents' decisions globally influence the market system and stocks\nprices, determining a nonclassical behavior. More specifically, we maintain\nthat a given stock does not generally have a definite value, e.g., a price, but\nits value is actualized as a consequence of the contextual interactions in the\ntrading process. This contextual influence is responsible of the\nnon-Kolmogorovian quantum-like behavior of the market at a statistical level.\nThen, we propose a 'sphere model' within our 'hidden measurement formalism'\nthat describes a buying/selling process of a stock and shows that it is\nintuitively reasonable to assume that the stock has not a definite price until\nit is traded.
