We develop and analyze a monetary policy for\nPoPCoin that embodies these equitability goals in two basic rules that maybe\nsummarized as supporting equal opportunity in \"space\" and \"time\": the first by\nregularly distributing new money equally to all participants much like a basic\nincome, the second by holding the aggregate value of these distributions to a\nconstant and non-diminishing portion of total money supply through demurrage.\nThrough preliminary economic analysis, we find that these rules in combination\nyield a unique form of money with numerous intriguing and promising properties,\nsuch as a quantifiable and provable upper bound on monetary inequality, a\nnatural \"early adopter's reward\" that could incentivize rapid growth while\ntapering off as participation saturates, resistance to the risk of deflationary\nspirals, and migration incentives opposite those created by conventional basic\nincomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2020 13:57:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Haoqian", ""], ["Basescu", "Cristina", ""], ["Ford", "Bryan", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.02776", "submitter": "Jan Motl", "authors": "Jan Motl, Pavel Kord\\'ik", "title": "Fast and exact audit scheduling optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is concerned with the cost and time effective scheduling of\nfinancial auditors with Integer Linear Programming.

This paper takes a\ndifferent approach, and tries to abstract away from the interpretation of the\ncontent information, while only focus on measuring the quantity of information\ncontained. We extend the concept of Shannon entropy in information theory to\nthe painting's scenario, and suggest using the variances of a painting's\ncomposing elements, i.e., line, color, value, shape/form and space, to measure\nthe amount of information in the painting. These measures are calculated at the\npixel level based on a picture's digital image. We include them into the\ntraditional hedonic regression model to test their significance based on the\nauction samples from two famous artists (Picasso and Renoir). We find that all\nthe variance measurements can significantly explain the sales price either at\n1% or 5% level. The adjusted R square is also increased by more than ten\npercent.
