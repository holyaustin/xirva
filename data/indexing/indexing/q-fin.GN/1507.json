We investigate a simple dynamical model\nfor understanding this tradeoff, consisting of a bank with a leverage target\nand an unleveraged fundamental investor subject to exogenous noise with\nclustered volatility. The parameter space has three regions: (i) a stable\nregion, where the system always reaches a fixed point equilibrium; (ii) a\nlocally unstable region, characterized by cycles and chaotic behavior; and\n(iii) a globally unstable region. A crude calibration of parameters to data\nputs the model in region (ii). In this region there is a slowly building price\nbubble, resembling a \"Great Moderation\", followed by a crash, with a period of\napproximately 10-15 years, which we dub the \"Basel leverage cycle\". We propose\na criterion for rating macroprudential policies based on their ability to\nminimize risk for a given average leverage. We construct a one parameter family\nof leverage policies that allows us to vary from the procyclical policies of\nBasel II or III, in which leverage decreases when volatility increases, to\ncountercyclical policies in which leverage increases when volatility increases.\nWe find the best policy depends critically on three parameters: The average\nleverage used by the bank; the relative size of the bank and the\nfundamentalist, and the amplitude of the exogenous noise. Basel II is optimal\nwhen the exogenous noise is high, the bank is small and leverage is low; in the\nopposite limit where the bank is large or leverage is high the optimal policy\nis closer to constant leverage. We also find that systemic risk can be\ndramatically decreased by lowering the leverage target adjustment speed of the\nbanks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jul 2015 09:14:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Aymanns", "Christoph", ""], ["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
