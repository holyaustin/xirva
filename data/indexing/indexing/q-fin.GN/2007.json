Among all the energy storage technologies, battery systems may provide\nflexibility to the power grid in a more distributed and decentralized way. In\ncountries with deregulated electricity markets, grid-connected battery systems\nshould be operated under the specific market design of the country. In this\nwork, using the Spanish electricity market as an example, the barriers to\ngrid-connected battery systems are investigated using utilization analysis. The\nconcept of \"potentially profitable utilization time\" is proposed and introduced\nto identify and evaluate future potential grid applications for battery\nsystems. The numerical and empirical analysis suggests that the high cycle cost\nfor battery systems is still the main barrier for grid-connected battery\nsystems. In Spain, for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market, it is\nrequired that the battery wear cost decreases to 15 Euro/MWh to make the\npotentially profitable utilization rate higher than 20%. Nevertheless, the\npotentially profitable utilization of batteries is much higher in the\napplications when higher flexibility is demanded. The minimum required battery\nwear cost corresponding to 20% potentially profitable utilization time\nincreases to 35 Euro/MWh for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market and\nancillary services, and 50 Euro/MWh for upward secondary reserve. The results\nof this study contribute to the awareness of battery storage technology and its\nflexibility in grid applications. The findings also have significant\nimplications for policy makers and market operators interested in promoting\ngrid-connected battery storage under a deregulated power market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2020 13:08:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2020 09:58:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Yu", ""], ["Soneira", "David Soler", ""], ["S\u00e1nchez", "Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.01194", "submitter": "Qingyin Ge", "authors": "Qingyin Ge, Yunuo Ma, Yuezhi Liao, Rongyu Li, Tianle Zhu", "title": "Risk Management and Return Prediction", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/", "abstract": "  With the good development in the financial industry, the market starts to\ncatch people's eyes, not only by the diversified investing choices ranging from\nbonds and stocks to futures and options but also by the general \"high-risk,\nhigh-reward\" mindset prompting people to put money in the financial market.\nPeople are interested in reducing risk at a given level of return since there\nis no way of having both high returns and low risk.

The scheme purports to assist\ndry-land crop farmers who have taken loans with participating banks or lending\ninstitutions to help them meet their debt obligations in case of crop failure\ndue to drought, floods, frost or hailstorm. Nonetheless, to date, the scheme\nhas focused solely on drought. The scheme has placed an unsustainable financial\nburden on Government because it is not based on sound actuarial principles.\nThis paper argues that the level of Government subsidies should take into\naccount the gains made by farmers during non-drought years. It is an attempt to\ncircumvent the challenges of correlated climate risks and recommends a quasi\nself-financing mechanism, assuming that the major driver of crop yield failure\nis drought. Moreover, it provides a novel subsidy and premium rate setting\nmethod.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2020 18:28:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2020 14:49:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2020 10:24:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2020 11:45:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Machete", "Reason Lesego", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.11877", "submitter": "Thomas Ankenbrand", "authors": "Thomas Ankenbrand, Denis Bieri, Roland Cortivo, Johannes Hoehener,\n  Thomas Hardjono", "title": "Proposal for a Comprehensive (Crypto) Asset Taxonomy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "2020 Crypto Valley Conference on Blockchain Technology (CVCBT)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Developments in the distributed ledger technology have led to new types of\nassets with a broad range of purposes.

The network statistics and\nstructures are examined and shown to be similar to those of a nationwide\nproduction network. Specifically, the bowtie analysis indicates what we refer\nto as a \"walnut\" structure with core and upstream/downstream components. To\nquantify the location of an individual account in the network, we used the\nHodge decomposition method and found that the Hodge potential of the account\nhas a significant correlation to its position in the bowtie structure as well\nas to its net flow of incoming and outgoing money and links, namely the net\ndemand/supply of individual accounts. In addition, we used non-negative matrix\nfactorization to identify important factors underlying the entire flow of\nmoney; it can be interpreted that these factors are associated with regional\neconomic activities.One factor has a feature whereby the remittance source is\nlocalized to the largest city in the region, while the destination is\nscattered.
