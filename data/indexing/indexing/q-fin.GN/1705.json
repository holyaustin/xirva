In this paper we\ninvestigate the effects of FDI on trade from a network perspective, since FDI\ntakes not only direct but also indirect channels from origin to destination\ncountries because of firms' incentive to reduce tax burden, to minimize\ncoordination costs, and to break barriers to market entry. We use a unique data\nset of international corporate control as a measure of stock FDI to construct a\ncorporate control network (CCN) where the nodes are the countries and the edges\nare the corporate control relationships. Based on the CCN, the network\nmeasures, i.e., the shortest path length and the communicability, are computed\nto capture the indirect channel of FDI. Empirically we find that corporate\ncontrol has a positive effect on trade both directly and indirectly. The result\nis robust with different specifications and estimation strategies. Hence, our\npaper provides strong empirical evidence of the indirect effects of FDI on\ntrade. Moreover, we identify a number of interplaying factors such as regional\ntrade agreements and the region of Asia. We also find that the indirect effects\nare more pronounced for manufacturing sectors than for primary sectors such as\noil extraction and agriculture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 12:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sgrignoli", "Paolo", ""], ["Metulini", "Rodolfo", ""], ["Zhu", "Zhen", ""], ["Riccaboni", "Massimo", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03458", "submitter": "Alberto Hernando", "authors": "A.
