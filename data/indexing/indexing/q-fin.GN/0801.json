We consider a combination of social interaction within peer\ngroups and individually heterogeneous fundamentalist trading decisions which\ntake into account the market price and the perceived fundamental value of the\nasset. The resulting excess demand is coupled to the market price. Rigorous\nanalysis reveals that this feedback may lead to price oscillations, a single\nbounce, or monotonic price behaviour. The model is a rare example of an\nanalytically tractable interacting-agent model which allows us to deduce in\ndetail the origin of these different collective patterns. For a natural choice\nof initial distribution the results are independent of the graph structure that\nmodels the peer network of agents whose decisions influence each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2007 21:01:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2009 16:10:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00fctz", "Gunter M.", ""], ["Prado", "Fernando Pigeard de Almeida", ""], ["Harris", "Rosemary J.", ""], ["Belitsky", "Vladimir", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.0969", "submitter": "Javier Gonz\\'alez Est\\'evez", "authors": "J.

Several economists discussed the concept of a\nfirm, as opposed to an open labour market where entrepreneurs would recrute\nworkers on the occasion of each business opportunity. Coase \\cite{Coase} is one\nof them, who explains the existence of firms as institution because they reduce\nthe transaction costs with respect to an open labour market. Whatever the\nrationale proposed by economists to account for the existence of firms, their\nperspective is based on efficiency and cost analysis. Little attention is paid\nto the dynamics of emergence and evolution of firms. The aim of the present\nmanuscript is to check the global dynamical properties of a very simple model\nbased on bounded rationality and reinforcement learning.\n  Workers and managers are localised on a lattice and they choose collaborators\non the basis of the success of previous work relations. The choice algorithm is\nlargely inspired rom the observation and modeling of long term customer/sellers\nrelationships observed on perishable goods markets discussed in Weisbuch\netal\\cite{Weisbuch} and Nadal etal\\cite{Nadal}. The model presented here is in\nno way an alternative to Coase. We describe the build-up of long term\nrelationships which do reduce transaction costs, and we deduce the dynamical\nproperties of networks built from our simple assumptions.\n  In conclusion, the present model explains the metastability of employment\nrelations in the firm, but something has to be added to it to explain the more\nefficient workload repartition observed in real firms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jan 2008 17:10:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Weisbuch", "G.", ""], ["Stauffer", "D.", ""], ["Mangalagiu", "D.", ""], ["Ben-Av", "R.", ""], ["Solomon", "S.", ""]]}]
