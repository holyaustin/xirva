A\nsignificant anti-correlation between dispersion and cross-sectional kurtosis is\nfound such that dispersion is high but kurtosis is low in panic times, and the\nopposite in normal times. The co-movement of stock returns also increases in\npanic times. We define a simple statistic $s$, the normalized sum of signs of\nreturns on a given day, to capture the degree of correlation in the system. $s$\ncan be seen as the order parameter of the system because if $s= 0$ there is no\ncorrelation (a disordered state), whereas for $s \\ne 0$ there is correlation\namong stocks (an ordered state). We make an analogy to non-equilibrium phase\ntransitions and hypothesize that financial markets undergo self-organization\nwhen the external volatility perception rises above some critical value.\nIndeed, the distribution of $s$ is unimodal in normal times, shifting to\nbimodal in times of panic. This is consistent with a second order phase\ntransition. Simulations of a joint stochastic process for stocks use a multi\ntimescale process in the temporal direction and an equation for the order\nparameter $s$ for the dynamics of the cross-sectional correlation. Numerical\nresults show good qualitative agreement with the stylized facts of real data,\nin both normal and panic times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2009 09:27:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2009 03:50:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Borland", "Lisa", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.0348", "submitter": "Massimo Riccaboni", "authors": "Massimo Riccaboni, Stefano Schiavo", "title": "The Structure and Growth of Weighted Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1367-2630/12/2/023003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.data-an physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a simple theoretical framework for the evolution of weighted\nnetworks that is consistent with a number of stylized features of real-world\ndata.

We show that link-weight distributions of\ncommodity-specific networks are extremely heterogeneous and (quasi) log\nnormality of aggregate link-weight distribution is generated as a sheer outcome\nof aggregation. Commodity-specific networks also display average connectivity,\nclustering, and centrality levels very different from their aggregate\ncounterpart. We also find that ITN complete connectivity is mainly achieved\nthrough the presence of many weak links that keep commodity-specific networks\ntogether and that the correlation structure existing between topological\nstatistics within each single network is fairly robust and mimics that of the\naggregate network. Finally, we employ cross-commodity correlations between link\nweights to build hierarchies of commodities. Our results suggest that on the\ntop of a relatively time-invariant ``intrinsic\" taxonomy (based on inherent\nbetween-commodity similarities), the roles played by different commodities in\nthe ITN have become more and more dissimilar, possibly as the result of an\nincreased trade specialization. Our approach is general and can be used to\ncharacterize any multinetwork emerging as a nontrivial aggregation of several\ninterdependent layers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Aug 2009 12:15:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 11:53:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2009 12:51:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 20 Jun 2010 09:35:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Barigozzi", "Matteo", ""], ["Fagiolo", "Giorgio", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2086", "submitter": "Giorgio Fagiolo", "authors": "Giorgio Fagiolo", "title": "The International-Trade Network: Gravity Equations and Topological\n  Properties", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper begins to explore the determinants of the topological properties\nof the international - trade network (ITN).
