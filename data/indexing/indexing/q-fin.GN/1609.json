China is\nespecially held up as a model to emulate. Based on the largest dataset of its\nkind, this paper punctures the twin myths that, first, infrastructure creates\neconomic value, and, second, China has a distinct advantage in its delivery.\nFar from being an engine of economic growth, the typical infrastructure\ninvestment fails to deliver a positive risk adjusted return. Moreover, China's\ntrack record in delivering infrastructure is no better than that of rich\ndemocracies. Where investments are debt-financed, overinvesting in unproductive\nprojects results in the buildup of debt, monetary expansion, instability in\nfinancial markets, and economic fragility, exactly as we see in China today. We\nconclude that poorly managed infrastructure investments are a main explanation\nof surfacing economic and financial problems in China. We predict that, unless\nChina shifts to a lower level of higher-quality infrastructure investments, the\ncountry is headed for an infrastructure-led national financial and economic\ncrisis, which is likely also to be a crisis for the international economy.\nChina's infrastructure investment model is not one to follow for other\ncountries but one to avoid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 22:18:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ansar", "Atif", ""], ["Flyvbjerg", "Bent", ""], ["Budzier", "Alexander", ""], ["Lunn", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.01900", "submitter": "Claudiu Albulescu", "authors": "Claudiu Albulescu (CRIEF), Dominique P\\'epin (CRIEF)", "title": "The loss of interest for the euro in Romania", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We generalize a money demand micro-founded model to explain Romanians' recent\nloss of interest for the euro.

Consequently, the interest in identifying the factors\nsupporting the commercial integration process is high. Recent findings in the\nnew trade theory suggest that FDI influence the trade intensity but the studies\napproaching this relationship for the CEE countries present mixed evidence, and\ninvestigate the commercial integration of CEE countries with the old EU\nmembers. Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to assess the\nCEE countries' intra-integration, focusing on the Czech Republic, Hungary,\nPoland and the Slovak Republic. For each country we employ a panel\ngravitational model for the bilateral trade and FDI, considering its\ninteractions with the other three countries in the sample on the one hand, and\nwith the three EU main commercial partners on the other hand. We investigate\ndifferent facets of the trade -- FDI nexus, resorting to a fixed effects model,\na random effects model, as well as to an instrumental variable estimator, over\nthe period 2000-2013. Our results suggest that outward FDI sustains the CEE\ncountries' commercial integration, while inward FDI has no significant effect.\nIn all the cases a complementarity effect between trade and FDI is documented,\nwhich is stronger for the CEE countries' historical trade partners.\nConsequently, these findings show that CEE countries' policymakers are\ninterested in encouraging the outward FDI toward their neighbour countries in\norder to increase the commercial integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 09:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Albulescu", "Claudiu Tiberiu", "", "UPT"], ["Goyeau", "Daniel", "", "CRIEF"]]}, {"id": "1609.04629", "submitter": "S Levine", "authors": "Sheen S.
