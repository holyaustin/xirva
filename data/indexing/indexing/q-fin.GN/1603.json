One of his\nself-created mysteries is the mystery of the alleged sudden spurt in the growth\nrate of income per capita. This sudden spurt never happened. In order to\nunderstand the growth rate of income per capita, its mathematical properties\nare now explored and explained. The explanation is illustrated using the\nhistorical world economic growth. Galor also wonders about the sudden spurt in\nthe growth rate of population. We show that this sudden spurt was also created\nby the distorted presentation of data.

However, the problem is much deeper than just the\nexamination of this theory.

Economic growth in\nvarious regions is at different levels of development but it follows similar,\nnon-divergent trajectories. Unified Growth Theory is shown yet again to be\nincorrect and scientifically unacceptable. It promotes incorrect and even\npotentially dangerous concepts. The distorted presentation of data supporting\nthe concept of the great divergence shows that economic growth is now\ndeveloping along moderately-increasing trajectories but mathematical analysis\nof the same data and even their undistorted presentation shows that these\ntrajectories are now increasing approximately vertically with time. So, while\nthe distorted presentation of data used in the Unified Growth Theory suggests\ngenerally sustainable and secure economic growth, the undistorted presentation\nof data demonstrates that the growth is unsustainable and insecure. The concept\nof takeoffs from stagnation to the sustained-growth regime promoted in the\nUnified Growth Theory is also dangerously misleading because it suggests a\nsustainable and prosperous future while the mathematical analysis of data shows\nthat the current economic growth is insecure and unsustainable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 09:00:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2016 00:27:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Nielsen", "Ron W", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.08383", "submitter": "Elvis Oltean", "authors": "Elvis Oltean", "title": "Modelling income, wealth, and expenditure data by use of Econophysics", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:0709.3662 by other authors", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the present paper, we identify several distributions from Physics and\nstudy their applicability to phenomena such as distribution of income, wealth,\nand expenditure. Firstly, we apply logistic distribution to these data and we\nfind that it fits very well the annual data for the entire income interval\nincluding for upper income segment of population. Secondly, we apply\nFermi-Dirac distribution to these data. We seek to explain possible\ncorrelations and analogies between economic systems and statistical\nthermodynamics systems. We try to explain their behavior and properties when we\ncorrelate physical variables with macroeconomic aggregates and indicators. Then\nwe draw some analogies between parameters of the Fermi-Dirac distribution and\nmacroeconomic variables. Thirdly, as complex systems are modeled using\npolynomial distributions, we apply polynomials to the annual sets of data and\nwe find that it fits very well also the entire income interval. Fourthly, we\ndevelop a new methodology to approach dynamically the income, wealth, and\nexpenditure distribution similarly with dynamical complex systems. This\nmethodology was applied to different time intervals consisting of consecutive\nyears up to 35 years. Finally, we develop a mathematical model based on a\nHamiltonian that maximizes utility function applied to Ramsey model using\nFermi-Dirac and polynomial utility functions. We find some theoretical\nconnections with time preference theory. We apply these distributions to a\nlarge pool of data from countries with different levels of development, using\ndifferent methods for calculation of income, wealth, and expenditure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 14:05:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Oltean", "Elvis", ""]]}]
