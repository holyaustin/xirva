The problem whether and how volatilities\naffect the price movement draws much attention. Although many efforts have been\nmade, it remains challenging. Physicists usually apply the concepts and methods\nin statistical physics, such as temporal correlation functions, to study\nfinancial dynamics. However, the usual volatility-return correlation function,\nwhich is local in time, typically fluctuates around zero. Here we construct\ndynamic observables nonlocal in time to explore the volatility-return\ncorrelation, based on the empirical data of hundreds of individual stocks and\n25 stock market indices in different countries. Strikingly, the correlation is\ndiscovered to be non-zero, with an amplitude of a few percent and a duration of\nover two weeks. This result provides compelling evidence that past volatilities\nnonlocal in time affect future returns. Further, we introduce an agent-based\nmodel with a novel mechanism, that is, the asymmetric trading preference in\nvolatile and stable markets, to understand the microscopic origin of the\nvolatility-return correlation nonlocal in time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 12:03:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Lei", ""], ["Zheng", "Bo", ""], ["Chen", "Jun-Jie", ""], ["Jiang", "Xiong-Fei", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02083", "submitter": "Kasper Larsen", "authors": "Jin Hyuk Choi, Kasper Larsen, Duane J.
