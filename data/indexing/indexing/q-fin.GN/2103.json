From the point of view of modern\nlogistics, the key functions of money are the store of value and low logistics\n(circulation and warehouse) cost. Although commodity money (such as gold and\nsilver) has the advantages of a wealth store, its disadvantage is the high\nlogistics cost. In comparison to commodity money, credit currency and digital\ncurrency cannot protect wealth from loss over a long period while their\nlogistics costs are negligible. We proved that there is not such honest money\nfrom the perspective of logistics costs, which is both the store of value like\nprecious metal and without logistics costs in circulation like digital\ncurrency. The reason hidden in the back of the depreciation of banknotes is the\nblack hole of storage charge of the anchor overtime after digitizing commodity\nmoney. Accordingly, it is not difficult to infer the inevitable collapse of the\nBretton woods system.
