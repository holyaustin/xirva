Prices adjust sluggishly to both changes in labour costs and inventory.\nDisequilibrium between expected sales and demand is absorbed by unplanned\nchanges in inventory. This results in a five-dimensional dynamical system for\nwage share, employment rate, private debt ratio, expected sales, and capacity\nutilization.

Most previous\nwork on random financial networks assumes independent connections between\nbanks, whereas our framework explicitly allows for (dis)assortative edge\nprobabilities (e.g., a tendency for small banks to link to large banks). We\nanalyze default cascades triggered by shocking the network and find that the\ncascade can be understood as an explicit iterated mapping on a set of edge\nprobabilities that converges to a fixed point. We derive a cascade condition\nthat characterizes whether or not an infinitesimal shock to the network can\ngrow to a finite size cascade, in analogy to the basic reproduction number\n$R_0$ in epidemic modelling. The cascade condition provides an easily computed\nmeasure of the systemic risk inherent in a given banking network topology.\nUsing the percolation theory for random networks we also derive an analytic\nformula for the frequency of global cascades. Although the analytical methods\nare derived for infinite networks, we demonstrate using Monte Carlo simulations\nthe applicability of the results to finite-sized networks. We show that\nedge-assortativity, the propensity of nodes to connect to similar nodes, can\nhave a strong effect on the level of systemic risk as measured by the cascade\ncondition. However, the effect of assortativity on systemic risk is subtle, and\nwe propose a simple graph theoretic quantity, which we call the\ngraph-assortativity coefficient, that can be used to assess systemic risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 04:23:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Gleeson", "James P.", ""], ["Melnik", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.05494", "submitter": "Tiziano Squartini", "authors": "Tiziano Squartini, Giulio Cimini, Andrea Gabrielli, Diego Garlaschelli", "title": "Network reconstruction via density sampling", "comments": "8 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables", "journal-ref": "App. Netw.

They\npromised enormous rewards to the last survivors at the expense of those died\nearly. And, while this design appealed to the gambling instinc}, it is a\nsuboptimal way to generate retirement income. Indeed, actuarially-fair life\nannuities making constant payments -- where the insurance company is exposed to\nlongevity risk -- induce greater lifetime utility. However, tontines do not\nhave to be structured the historical way, i.e. with a constant cash flow shared\namongst a shrinking group of survivors. Moreover, insurance companies do not\nsell actuarially-fair life annuities, in part due to aggregate longevity risk.\n  We derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime utility.

We examine how the optimal tontine varies with $\\gamma$ and\n$n$, and prove some qualitative theorems about the optimal payout.\nInterestingly, Lorenzo de Tonti's original structure is optimal in the limit as\nlongevity risk aversion $\\gamma \\to \\infty$.
