First, we use the World\nInput-Output Database (WIOD) to construct both the upstream and downstream\nglobal value networks, where the nodes are individual sectors in different\ncountries and the links are the value-added contribution relationships. Second,\nwe introduce a network-based measure of node similarity to compare the GVCs\nbetween any pair of countries for each sector and each year available in the\nWIOD. Our network-based similarity is a better measure for node comparison than\nthe existing ones because it takes into account all the direct and indirect\nrelationships between country-sector pairs, is applicable to both directed and\nweighted networks with self-loops, and takes into account externally defined\nnode attributes. As a result, our measure of similarity reveals the most\nintensive interactions among the GVCs across countries and over time. From 1995\nto 2011, the average similarity between sectors and countries have clear\nincreasing trends, which are temporarily interrupted by the recent economic\ncrisis. This measure of the similarity of GVCs provides quantitative answers to\nimportant questions about dependency, sustainability, risk, and competition in\nthe global production system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Aug 2015 17:32:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Zhen", ""], ["Morrison", "Greg", ""], ["Puliga", "Michelangelo", ""], ["Chessa", "Alessandro", ""], ["Riccaboni", "Massimo", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.05357", "submitter": "Paul Ormerod", "authors": "Paul Ormerod, Rickard Nyman, David Tuckett", "title": "Measuring Financial Sentiment to Predict Financial Instability: A New\n  Approach based on Text Analysis", "comments": "14 pages plus Supplementary Material", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Following the financial crisis of the late 2000s, policy makers have shown\nconsiderable interest in monitoring financial stability.
