In other words, how\nrecessions arising in one or more countries might percolate across a network of\nconnected economies. A heterogeneous agent based model is set up in which the\nagents are Western economies. A country has a probability of entering a\nrecession in any given year and one of emerging from it the next. In addition,\nthe agents have a unique threshold propensity to import a recession from the\nagents with which they have the strongest connections. They are connected on a\nsmall world topology, and an agent's neighbours at any time are either in\n(state 1) or out (state 0) of recession. If the weighted sum exceeds the\nthreshold, the agent goes into recession. Annual real GDP growth for 17 Western\ncountries 1871-2006 is used as the data set. The distribution of the number of\ncountries in recession in any given year is exponential, as is the duration of\nrecessions within individual countries. The model is calibrated against these\ntwo facts, plus the 'wait time' between recessions. It is able to replicate\nthem successfully. The network structure is essential for the agents to\nreplicate the stylised facts. The country-specific probabilities of entering\nand emerging from recession by themselves give results very different to the\nactual data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Jul 2008 12:52:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ormerod", "Paul", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1823", "submitter": "Gur Yaari", "authors": "Gur Yaari and Sorin Solomon", "title": "Cooperation Evolution in Random Multiplicative Environments", "comments": "20 pages 7 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.bio-ph physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Most real life systems have a random component: the multitude of endogenous\nand exogenous factors influencing them result in stochastic fluctuations of the\nparameters determining their dynamics.

While in an additive context the emergence and survival of\ncooperation requires special conditions (especially some level of reward,\npunishment, reciprocity), we find that in the multiplicative random context the\nemergence of cooperation is much more natural and effective.
