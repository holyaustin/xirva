It is crucial to\nidentify how network connectivity impacts both the emergent production and risk\nof collapse of economic systems. In this paper we propose a model to study the\neffects of network structure on the behavior of economic systems by varying the\ndensity and centralization of connections among agents. The complexity of\nproduction increases with connectivity given the combinatorial explosion of\nparts and products. Emergent systemic risks arise when interconnections\nincrease vulnerabilities. Our results suggest a universal description of\neconomic collapse given in the emergence of tipping points and phase\ntransitions in the relationship between network structure and risk of\nindividual failure. This relationship seems to follow a sigmoidal form in the\ncase of increasingly denser or centralized networks. The model sheds new light\non the relevance of policies for the growth of economic complexity, and\nhighlights the trade-off between increasing the potential production of the\nsystem and its robustness to collapse.

Each agent is represented by a spin having a\nnumber of discrete states $q$ or continuous states, describing the tendency of\nthe agent for buying or selling. The market ambiance is represented by a\nparameter $T$ which plays the role of the temperature in physics. We show that\nthere is a critical value of $T$, say $T_c$, where strong fluctuations between\nindividual states lead to a disordered situation in which there is no majority:\nthe numbers of sellers and buyers are equal, namely the market clearing. We\nhave considered three models: $q=3$ ( sell, buy, wait), $q=5$ (5 states between\nabsolutely buy and absolutely sell), and $q=\\infty$. The specific measure, by\nthe government or by economic organisms, is parameterized by $H$ applied on the\nmarket at the time $t_1$ and removed at the time $t_2$. We have used Monte\nCarlo simulations to study the time evolution of the price as functions of\nthose parameters. Many striking results are obtained. In particular we show\nthat the price strongly fluctuates near $T_c$ and there exists a critical value\n$H_c$ above which the boosting effect remains after $H$ is removed. This\nhappens only if $H$ is applied in the critical region. Otherwise, the effect of\n$H$ lasts only during the time of the application of $H$. The second party of\nthe paper deals with the price variation using a time-dependent mean-field\ntheory.

The stock price\ndata is analyzed with an unconventional tool, Weibull distribution and\nobservations confirmed the presence of either a reverse trend in franchised\nbusiness than what is observed for non-franchised or the franchised stock\nfollowed large food suppliers. There is a layered ownership and cash flow in a\nfranchised business model. The parent company run by franchiser depends on the\nperformance of child companies run by franchisees. Both parent and child\ncompanies are run as independent businesses but only the parent company is\nlisted as a stock ticker in stock exchange. Does this double layer of vertical\noperation, cash reserve, and cash flow protect them better in recession? The\ndata analyzed in this paper indicates that the recession effect can be more\nsevere; and if it dives with the average market, expect a slower recovery of\nstock prices in a franchised business model. This paper characterizes the\ndifferences and explains the natural experiment with available financial data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2019 14:29:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Dutta", "Sandip", ""], ["Prabhu", "Vignesh", ""]]}]
