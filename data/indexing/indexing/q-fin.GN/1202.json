We provide empirical evidence for, and an\naccompanying theory of, an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed\nhuman-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized by frequent black\nswan events with ultrafast durations (<650ms for crashes, <950ms for spikes).\nOur theory quantifies the systemic fluctuations in these two distinct phases in\nterms of the diversity of the system's internal ecology and the amount of\nglobal information being processed. Our finding that the ten most susceptible\nentities are major international banks, hints at a hidden relationship between\nthese ultrafast 'fractures' and the slow 'breaking' of the global financial\nsystem post-2006.

In this paper, we analyse a dataset\nreceived from the Reserve Bank of Australia that includes all interbank\ntransactions settled in RITS on an RTGS basis during five consecutive weekdays\nfrom 19 February 2007 inclusive, a week of relatively quiescent market\nconditions.

We\nconduct a novel analysis of the flow stability and examine the connection\nbetween loan and nonloan flows. Our aim is to understand the underlying causal\nmechanism connecting loan and nonloan flows. We find that the imbalances in the\nbanks' exchange settlement funds resulting from the daily flows of nonloan\ntransactions are almost exactly counterbalanced by the flows of overnight\nloans. The correlation coefficient between loan and nonloan imbalances is about\n-0.9 on most days. Some flows that persist over two consecutive days can be\nhighly variable, but overall the flows are moderately stable in value. The\nnonloan network is characterised by a large fraction of persistent flows,\nwhereas only half of the flows persist over any two consecutive days in the\nloan network.
