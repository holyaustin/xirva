Initially, each agent decides\nto buy or sell according to its personal opinion, which results from the\ncombination of its own private information, the public information and its own\nanalysis. It then adjusts such opinion through the market as it observes\nsequentially the behavior of a group of random selection of other agents. Its\nchoice is then determined by a local majority rule including itself. Whenever\nthe selected group is at a tie, i.e., it is undecided on what to do, the choice\nis determined by the local group belief with respect to the anticipated trend\nat that time. These local adjustments create a dynamic that leads the market\nprice formation. In case of balanced anticipations the market is found to be\nefficient in being successful to make the \"right price\" to emerge from the\nsequential aggregation of all the local individual informations which all\ntogether contain the fundamental value. However, when a leading optimistic\nbelief prevails, the same efficient market mechanisms are found to produce a\nbullish dynamic even though most agents have bearish private informations. The\nmarket yields then a wider and wider discrepancy between the fundamental value\nand the market value, which in turn creates a speculative bubble. Nevertheless,\nthere exists a limit in the growing of the bubble where private opinions take\nover again and at once invert the trend, originating a sudden bearish trend.\nMoreover, in the case of a drastic shift in the collective expectations, a huge\ndrop in price levels may also occur extremely fast and puts the market out of\ncontrol, it is a market crash.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jun 2011 14:58:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Galam", "Serge", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2342", "submitter": "Edward Hoyle", "authors": "Edward Hoyle and Levent Ali Menguturk", "title": "Archimedean Survival Processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Archimedean copulas are popular in the world of multivariate modelling as a\nresult of their breadth, tractability, and flexibility.

The aim of the paper is: 1. to meet the demand for\nillustrative examples suitable for presenting the background of the highly\nexpanding research field of econophysics even on the undergraduate level and 2.\nto enable the students to understand deeper the principles and methods\nroutinely used in mechanics by looking at the well known methodology from the\ndifferent perspective of economics. Two constrained dynamic economic problems\nare presented using the economic terminology in an intuitive way. First, the\nPhillips model of business cycle is presented as a system of forced\noscillations and the general problem of two interacting economies is solved by\nthe nonholonomic dynamics approach. Second, the Cass-Koopmans-Ramsey model of\neconomical growth is solved as a variational problem with a velocity dependent\nconstraint using the vakonomic approach. The specifics of the solution\ninterpretation in economics compared to mechanics is discussed in detail, a\ndiscussion of the nonholonomic and vakonomic approaches to constrained problems\nin mechanics and economics is provided and an economic interpretation of the\nLagrange multipliers (possibly surprising for the students of physics) is\ncarefully explained.
