A systemic crisis is pictured as\ntriggered by a shock to banks' balance sheets, which then leads to the\npropagation of damaging shocks and the potential for amplification of the\ncrisis, ending with the system in a cascade equilibrium.

Each agent is described by his production,\nconsumption, stock of capital, as well as the position he occupies in this\nabstract space. Each agent produces one differentiated good whose price is\nfixed by market clearing conditions. Production functions are Cobb-Douglas, and\ncapital stocks follow the standard capital accumulation dynamic equation.\nAgents consume all goods but have a preference for goods produced by their\nclosest neighbors. Agents in the exchange space are subject both to attractive\nand repulsive forces. Exchanges drive agents closer, but beyond a certain level\nof proximity, agents will tend to crowd out more distant agents. The present\nmodel uses a formalism based on statistical field theory developed earlier by\nthe authors. This approach allows the analytical treatment of economic models\nwith an arbitrary number of agents, while preserving the system's interactions\nand complexity at the individual level. Our results show that the dynamics of\ncapital accumulation and agents' position in the exchange space are correlated.\nInteractions in the exchange space induce several phases of the system. A first\nphase appears when attractive forces are limited. In this phase, an initial\ncentral position in the exchange space favors capital accumulation in average\nand leads to a higher level of capital, while agents far from the center will\nexperience a slower accumulation process. A high level of initial capital\ndrives agents towards a central position, i.e. improve the terms of their\nexchanges: they experience a higher demand and higher prices for their product.\nAs usual, high capital productivity favors capital accumulation, while higher\nrates of capital depreciation reduce capital stock. In a second phase,\nattractive forces are predominant. The previous results remain, but an\nadditional threshold effect appears. Even though no restriction was imposed\ninitially on the system, two types of agents emerge, depending on their initial\nstock of capital. One type of agents will remain above the capital threshold\nand occupy and benefit from a central position. The other type will remain\nbelow the threshold, will not be able to break it and will remain at the\nperiphery of the exchange space. In this phase, capital distribution is less\nhomogenous than in the first phase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2019 08:25:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Gosselin", "Pierre", "", "IF"], ["Lotz", "A\u00efleen", "", "IRMA"], ["Wambst", "Marc", "", "IRMA"]]}, {"id": "1909.12542", "submitter": "Dr. Banasri Basu", "authors": "Abhik Ghosh, Preety Shreya, Banasri Basu", "title": "Maximum Entropy Framework for a Universal Rank Order distribution with\n  Socio-economic Applications", "comments": "Pre-print, Under review", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph physics.data-an q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we derive the maximum entropy characteristics of a particular\nrank order distribution, namely the discrete generalized beta distribution,\nwhich has recently been observed to be extremely useful in modelling many\nseveral rank-size distributions from different context in Arts and Sciences, as\na two-parameter generalization of Zipf's law.
