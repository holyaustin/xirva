At the local\nlevel, we find that the interplay between trade and financial interactions\ninfluences the vulnerabilities of countries to shocks. At the large scale, we\nfind a simple linear relation between the relative magnitude of a shock in a\ncountry and its global impact on the whole economic system, albeit the strength\nof internal contagion is country-dependent and the intercountry propagation\ndynamics is non-linear.
