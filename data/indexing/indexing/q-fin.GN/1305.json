Can we still rely on conventional economic\nthinking or do we need a new approach?\n  I argue that, as the complexity of socio-economic systems increases,\nnetworked decision-making and bottom-up self-regulation will be more and more\nimportant features. It will be explained why, besides the \"homo economicus\"\nwith strictly self-regarding preferences, natural selection has also created a\n\"homo socialis\" with other-regarding preferences. While the \"homo economicus\"\noptimizes the own prospects in separation, the decisions of the \"homo socialis\"\nare self-determined, but interconnected, a fact that may be characterized by\nthe term \"networked minds\". Notably, the \"homo socialis\" manages to earn higher\npayoffs than the \"homo economicus\".\n  I show that the \"homo economicus\" and the \"homo socialis\" imply a different\nkind of dynamics and distinct aggregate outcomes. Therefore, next to the\ntraditional economics for the \"homo economicus\" (\"economics 1.0\"), a\ncomplementary theory must be developed for the \"homo socialis\". This economic\ntheory might be called \"economics 2.0\" or \"socionomics\". The names are\njustified, because the Web 2.0 is currently promoting a transition to a new\nmarket organization, which benefits from social media platforms and could be\ncharacterized as \"participatory market society\". To thrive, the \"homo socialis\"\nrequires suitable institutional settings such a particular kinds of reputation\nsystems, which will be sketched in this paper.
