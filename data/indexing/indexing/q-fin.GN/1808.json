How does the migration of workers among firms and industries\ncontribute to the diffusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,\noccupation, and location-specific knowledge carried by workers from one\nestablishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work\nhistory for an entire country. We study pioneer firms--firms operating in an\nindustry that was not present in a region--because the success of pioneers is\nthe basic unit of regional economic diversification. We find that the growth\nand survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are\nworkers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the\nsame location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare\nthese results with new firms that are not pioneers and find that\nindustry-specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than\nnon-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which\nleverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for\nlocal labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding\nthat industry-related knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of\npioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of the micro-mechanisms\nunderlying regional economic diversification events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2018 04:04:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Jara-Figueroa", "C.", ""], ["Jun", "Bogang", ""], ["Glaeser", "Edward", ""], ["Hidalgo", "Cesar", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.01261", "submitter": "Jun Zhang", "authors": "Jun Zhang and Fei-Yue Wang and Siyuan Chen", "title": "Token Economics in Energy Systems: Concept, Functionality and\n  Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Traditional centralized energy systems have the disadvantages of difficult\nmanagement and insufficient incentives.

The bipartition of the\nlabor force is random, and we characterize it by an axiom of equal employment\nopportunity. We value each employed individual by his or her marginal\ncontribution to the production function; we also value each unemployed\nindividual by the potential marginal contribution the person would make if the\nmarket hired the individual. We then use the aggregate individual value to\ndistribute the net production to the unemployment welfare and the employment\nbenefits. Using real-time balanced-budget rule as a constraint and policy\nstability as an objective, we derive a scientific formula which describes a\nfair, debt-free, and asymptotic risk-free tax rate for any given unemployment\nrate and national spending level. The tax rate minimizes the asymptotic mean,\nvariance, semi-variance, and mean absolute deviation of the underlying\nposterior unemployment rate. The allocation rule stimulates employment and\nboosts productivity. Under some symmetry assumptions, we even find that an\nunemployed person should enjoy equivalent employment benefits, and the tax rate\ngoes with this welfare equality. The tool employed is the cooperative game\ntheory in which we assume many players. The players are randomly bipartitioned,\nand the payoff varies with the partition. One could apply the fair distribution\nrule and valuation approach to other profit-sharing or cost-sharing situations\nwith these characteristics. This framework is open to alternative\nidentification strategies and other forms of equal opportunity axiom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 26 Aug 2018 14:41:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Oct 2018 18:15:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 15 Jan 2019 19:23:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 10 Jun 2019 16:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Xingwei", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.09279", "submitter": "Bikas K.
