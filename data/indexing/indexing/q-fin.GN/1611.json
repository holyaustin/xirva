Employing a spatial public goods game, we study the\ninfluence of income redistribution on the evolution of cooperation. Two kinds\nof evolutionary models are constructed, which describe local and global\nredistribution of income respectively. In the local model, players have to pay\npart of their income after each PGG and the accumulated income is redistributed\nto the members. While in the global model, all the players pay part of their\nincome after engaging in all the local PGGs, which are centered on himself and\nhis nearest neighbours, and the accumulated income is redistributed to the\nwhole population. We show that the cooperation prospers significantly with\nincreasing income expenditure proportion in the local redistribution of income,\nwhile in the global model the situation is opposite. Furthermore, the\ncooperation drops dramatically from the maximum curvature point of income\nexpenditure proportion. In particular, the intermediate critical points are\nclosely related to the renormalized enhancement factors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 05:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Pei", "Zhenhua", ""], ["Wang", "Baokui", ""], ["Du", "Jinming", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.01771", "submitter": "Wolfgang Kuhle", "authors": "Wolfgang Kuhle", "title": "An Equilibrium Model with Computationally Constrained Agents", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a large economy in which firms cannot compute exact solutions to the\nnon-linear equations that characterize the equilibrium price at which they can\nsell future output.

The difference\nin optimal drawdown between the old and new policy are only noticeable early in\nretirement until regulatory minimum withdrawal rates are enforced.
