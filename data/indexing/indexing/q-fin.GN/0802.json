It is\nsuggested to express the price index evolution explicitly in terms of the\nparameters introduced along the theoretical formulation avoiding any\ncombination of them used in the original work. This procedure allows to study\nunambiguously the uncertainties of such parameters when an error is assigned to\nthe measurement of the price index. In this way, it is possible to determine an\nuncertainty in the critical time at which the singularity occurs. For this\npurpose, Monte Carlo simulation techniques are applied. The hyperinflation\nepisodes of Peru (1969-90) and Weimar Germany (1920-3) are reexamined. The\nfirst analyses performed within this framework of the very extreme\nhyper-inflations occurred in Greece (1941-4) and Yugoslavia (1991-4) are\nreported. The study of the hyperinflation spiral experienced just nowadays in\nZimbabwe predicts a singularity, i.e., a complete economic crash within two\nyears.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2008 01:33:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Szybisz", "Martin A.", ""], ["Szybisz", "Leszek", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4064", "submitter": "Caglar Tuncay", "authors": "Caglar Tuncay", "title": "A theoretical approach for Pareto-Zipf law", "comments": "6 pages 2 figures and dated for IJMPC Volume 19 presumably issue 8", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1142/S0129183108012790", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  We suggest an analytical approach for Pareto-Zipf law, where we assume random\nmultiplicative noise and fragmentation processes for the growth of the number\nof citizens of each city and the number of the cities, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2008 18:28:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Tuncay", "Caglar", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4410", "submitter": "Marco Patriarca", "authors": "Anirban Chakraborti and Marco Patriarca", "title": "Gamma-distribution and wealth inequality", "comments": "Presented to the International Workshop and Conference on:\n  Statistical Physics Approaches to Multi-disciplinary Problems, January 07-13,\n  2008, IIT Guwahati, India", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12043-008-0156-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss the equivalence between kinetic wealth-exchange models, in which\nagents exchange wealth during trades, and mechanical models of particles,\nexchanging energy during collisions.
