Because regulations reduce profits to those possessing unfair\nadvantage, these advantaged corporations (whether individuals, companies, or\nother collective organizations) are motivated to influence regulators.\nRegulatory bodies created to protect the market are instead co-opted to advance\nthe interests of the corporations they are charged to regulate. This\nwide-spread influence, known as \"regulatory capture,\" has been recognized for\nover 100 years, and according to expectations of rational behavior, will exist\nwherever it is in the mutual self-interest of corporations and regulators. Here\nwe model the interaction between corporations and regulators using a new game\ntheory framework explicitly accounting for players' mutual influence, and\ndemonstrate the incentive for collusion. Communication between corporations and\nregulators enables them to collude and split the resulting profits. We identify\nwhen collusion is profitable for both parties. The intuitive results show that\ncapture occurs when the benefits to the corporation outweigh the costs to the\nregulator. Under these conditions, the corporation can compensate the regulator\nfor costs incurred and, further, provide a profit to both parties. In the real\nworld, benefits often far outweigh costs, providing large incentives to collude\nand making capture likely. Regulatory capture is inhibited by decreasing the\ninfluence between parties through strict separation, independent market\nknowledge and research by regulators, regulatory and market transparency,\nregulatory accountability for market failures, widely distributed regulatory\ncontrol, and anti-corruption enforcement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 21:13:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Albino", "Dominic K.", ""], ["Hu", "Anzi", ""], ["Bar-Yam", "Yaneer", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.1142", "submitter": "Jun Deng", "authors": "Anna Aksamit, Tahir Choulli, Jun Deng, and Monique Jeanblanc", "title": "Non-Arbitrage up to Random Horizon for Semimartingale Models", "comments": "40 pages.

Then we collected data on the stocks of companies in the\nfinancial sector of some countries that are suffering the most with the current\ncredit crisis: Greece, Cyprus, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, and assess,\nalso using transfer entropy, which companies from the largest 197 are most\naffected by the stocks of these countries in crisis. The intention is to map a\nnetwork of influences that may be used in the study of possible contagions\noriginating in those countries in financial crisis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 00:19:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Junior", "Leonidas Sandoval", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6320", "submitter": "Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre", "authors": "Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre, Herv\\'e Monod, Christopher A.

Epidemiological models\nincreasingly account for reductions in infectious contact, such as\nrisk-aversion behaviour in response to pathogen outbreaks. However, market\ndynamics clearly differ from simple risk-aversion, as are driven by different\nmotivation and conditioned by trade constraints, known in economics as\nfriction, that arise because exchanges are costly. Here we develop a novel\neconomic-market model where transient and long-term market dynamics are\ndetermined by trade friction and agent adaptation, and can influence disease\ntransmission. We specify the participants, frequency, volume, and price in\ntrade transactions, and investigate, using analytical insights and simulation,\nhow trade friction affects joint market and epidemiological dynamics. The\nfriction values explored encompass estimates from French cattle and pig\nmarkets. We show that, when trade is the dominant route of transmission, market\nfriction can be a significantly stronger determinant of epidemics than\nrisk-aversion behaviour. In particular, there is a critical friction level\nabove which epidemics do not occur. For a given level of friction, open\nunregulated markets can boost epidemics compared with closed or tightly\nregulated markets. Our results are robust to model specificities and can hold\nin the presence of non-trade disease-transmission routes. In particular, we try\nto explain why outbreaks in French livestock markets appear more frequently in\ncattle than swine despite swine trade-flow being larger. To minimize contagion\nin markets, safety policies could generate incentives for larger-volume,\nless-frequent transactions, increasing trade friction without necessarily\naffecting overall trade flow.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Oct 2013 18:28:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Moslonka-Lefebvre", "Mathieu", ""], ["Monod", "Herv\u00e9", ""], ["Gilligan", "Christopher A.", ""], ["Vergu", "Elisabeta", ""], ["Filipe", "Jo\u00e3o A.

Banking regulation has not kept pace with all the complexities\nof financial innovation. The academic literature on systemic risk is rapidly\nexpanding. The majority of papers analyse a single source or a consolidated\nsource of risk and its effect. A fraction of publications quantify systemic\nrisk measures or formulate penalties for systemically important financial\ninstitutions that are of practical regulatory relevance. The challenges facing\nsystemic risk evaluation and regulation still persist, as the definition of\nsystemic risk is somewhat unsettled and that affects attempts to provide\nsolutions. Our understanding of systemic risk is evolving and the awareness of\ndata relevance is rising gradually; this challenge is reflected in the focus of\nmajor international research initiatives. There is a consensus that the direct\nand indirect costs of a systemic crisis are enormous as opposed to preventing\nit, and that without regulation the externalities will not be prevented; but\nthere is no consensus yet on the extent and detail of regulation, and research\nexpectations are to facilitate the regulatory process. This report outlines an\nintegrated approach for systemic risk evaluation based on multiple types of\ninterbank exposures through innovative modelling approaches as tensorial\nmultilayer networks, suggests how to relate underlying economic data and how to\nextend the network to cover financial market information. We reason about data\nrequirements and time scale effects, and outline a multi-model hypernetwork of\nsystemic risk knowledge as a scenario analysis and policy support tool. The\nargument is that logical steps forward would incorporate the range of risk\nsources and their interrelated effects as contributions towards an overall\nsystemic risk indicator, would perform an integral analysis of ...\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 05:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sergueiva", "Antoaneta", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6822", "submitter": "Yiran Sheng", "authors": "Yiran Sheng, Ruokun Huang", "title": "Optimal Choice under Short Sell Limit with Sharpe Ratio as Criterion\n  among Multiple Assets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article is the term paper of the course Investments.

This paper introduces a\nfinancial network model that combines the default and liquidity stress\nmechanisms into a \"double cascade mapping\". The progress and eventual result of\nthe crisis is obtained by iterating this mapping to its fixed point. Unlike\nsimpler models, this model can therefore quantify how illiquidity or default of\none bank influences the overall level of liquidity stress and default in the\nsystem. Large-network asymptotic cascade mapping formulas are derived that can\nbe used for efficient network computations of the double cascade. Numerical\nexperiments then demonstrate that these asymptotic formulas agree qualitatively\nwith Monte Carlo results for large finite networks, and quantitatively except\nwhen the initial system is placed in an exceptional \"knife-edge\" configuration.\nThe experiments clearly support the main conclusion that when banks respond to\nliquidity stress by hoarding liquidity, then in the absence of asset fire\nsales, the level of defaults in a financial network is negatively related to\nthe strength of bank liquidity hoarding and the eventual level of stress in the\nnetwork.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2013 10:39:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 17:41:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 15:25:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 23:03:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "Thomas R.", ""], ["Cellai", "Davide", ""], ["Melnik", "Sergey", ""], ["Shao", "Quentin", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7280", "submitter": "Dmitry Kramkov", "authors": "Peter Bank and Dmitry Kramkov", "title": "The stochastic field of aggregate utilities and its saddle conjugate", "comments": "62 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1110.3224, arXiv:1110.3229", "journal-ref": "Tr.
