Following [1] a Time-Varying Parameter Vector\nAutoRegressive (TVP-VAR) approach on stock market returns to retrieve\nunobserved directed links among financial institutions, we reconstruct a fully\ndynamic network in the sense that connections are let to evolve through time.\nThe financial system analysed consists of a large set of $155$ financial\ninstitutions that are all the banks, broker-dealers, insurance and real estate\ncompanies listed in the Standard & Poor's $500$ index over the period $1993 -\n2014$. Looking alternatively at the individual, then sector-, community- and\nsystem-wide levels, we show that network science's tools are able to support\nwell known features of the financial markets such as the dramatic fall of\nconnectivity following Lehman Brothers' collapse. More importantly, by means of\nless traditional metrics, such as sectoral interface or measurements based on\ncontagion processes, our results document the co-existence of both\nfragmentation and integration phases between firms independently from the\nsector they belong to, and in doing so, question the relevance of existing\nmacroprudential surveillance frameworks which have been mostly developed on a\nsectoral basis. Overall, our results improve our understanding of the US\nfinancial landscape and may have important implications for risk monitoring as\nwell as macroprudential policy design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Jul 2017 14:25:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 13:42:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 20:09:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 29 Jan 2018 16:07:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gandica", "Y\u00e9rali", ""], ["Geraci", "Marco Valerio", ""], ["B\u00e9reau", "Sophie", ""], ["Gnabo", "Jean-Yves", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.00529", "submitter": "Jake Billings", "authors": "Jake Billings and Sebastian Del Barco", "title": "An Investigation into Laboucheres Betting System to Improve Odds of\n  Favorable Outcomes to Generate a Positive Externality Empirically", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Labouchere gambling system is hypothesized to increase the probability of\nwinning a predetermined arbitrary profit in a gambling system such as a coin\nflip or a roulette game in which both payouts and odds are 1:1.

In\nparticular, we would like to assess how much the links building such business\nnetworks are shaped by the structure of big-size industrial conglomerates of\nfirms headquartered in Japan, also described as HK.

Miwa\nand Ramseyer (Miwa and Ramseyer 2002; Ramseyer 2006) challenge this claim and\nargue that the evidence supporting the existence of HK is weak. So far,\nquantitative empirical investigation has been conducted exclusively using data\nfor firms incorporated in Japan.

This concept rests on obtaining default swap instruments on loans\nin order to create the capital required, and expand Tier 1 and 2 base capital.\nProfitability depends on overall portfolio performance, availability of equity\ndefault swaps, cost of default swap, and the multiple of original capital (MOC)\nadopted by the venture bank. A new derivative financial instrument, the equity\ndefault swap (EDS), to cover loans made as venture investments. An EDS is\nsimilar to a credit default swap (CDS) but with some unique features. The\nfeatures and operation of these new derivative instruments are outlined along\nwith audit requirements. This instrument would be traded on open-outcry\nexchanges with special features to ensure orderly operation of the market. It\nis the creation of public markets for EDSs that makes possible the use of\npublic market pricing to indirectly provide a potential market capitalization\nfor the underlying venture-bank investment. Full coverage insulates the\nventure-bank from losses in most situations, and multiplies profitability quite\ndramatically in all scenarios. Ten year returns above 20X are attainable.\nFurther, a new feature for EDS derivatives, a clawback lien, closes out the\nequity default swap. Here it is optimized at 77%, and is to be paid back to the\nunderwriter at a future date to prevent perverse incentive to deliberately\nfail. This new feature creates an Equity Default Clawback Swap (EDCS) which can\nbe used safely. This proposal also solves an old problem in banking, because it\nmatches the term of the loan with the term of the investment. I show that the\nventure-bank investment and the EDCS underwriting business are profitable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Jul 2017 22:35:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:27:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Oct 2017 20:10:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 23:18:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2018 04:31:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2018 07:53:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Mon, 10 Dec 2018 02:35:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2019 21:45:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2020 23:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hanley", "Brian P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09203", "submitter": "Roberto De Luca", "authors": "Roberto De Luca, Marco Di Mauro, Angelo Falzarano, Adele Naddeo", "title": "A hydrodynamic model for cooperating solidary countries", "comments": "8 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Eur.
