When evasion occurs, both individuals involved in a binary\ninteraction take advantage of it, while the rest of the society is deprived of\na part of the planned redistribution. In general, the effect of evasion on the\nincome distribution is to decrease the population of the middle classes and\nincrease that of the poor and rich classes. We study the dependence of the Gini\nindex on several parameters (mainly taxation rates and evasion rates), also in\nthe case when the evasion rate increases proportionally to a taxation rate\nwhich is perceived by citizens as unfair.

Third,\nconsidering the flow-network of goods traded between G-20 economies, network\nstatistics provide better proxies for key economic measures than conventional\nindicators.

Furthermore,\nsome sophisticated banks are including an FVA (Funding Valuation Adjustment),\nbut since DVA can be interpreted as a funding benefit the oft-debated issue\nregarding a possible double-counting of funding benefits arises, with little\nconsensus as to its resolution. One possibility is to price the derivative by\nreplication, guaranteeing a consistent inclusion of costs and benefits.\nHowever, as has recently been noted, DVA is (at least partially) unhedgeable,\nhaving no exact market hedge. Furthermore, current frameworks shed little light\non the controversial question, raised by Hull (2012), of whether the effect a\nderivative has on the riskiness of an institution's debt should be taken into\naccount when calculating FVA.\n  In this paper we propose a solution to these two problems by identifying an\ninstrument, a fictitious CDS written on the hedging counterparty which is\nimplicitly contained in any given derivatives transaction. This allows us to\nshow that the hedger's unhedged jump-to-default risk has, despite not being\nactively managed, a well defined value associated to a funding benefit.\nCarrying out the replication including such a CDS, we obtain a price for the\nderivative consisting of its collateralized equivalent, a contingent CVA, a\ncontingent DVA, and an FVA, coupled to the price via the hedger's short-term\nbond-CDS basis.\n  The resulting funding cost is non-zero, but substantially smaller than what\nis obtained in alternative approaches due to the effect the derivative has on\nthe recovery of the hedger's liabilities.

The banks and investors share a\ncommon belief about the future value of certain long-term assets, but they have\ndifferent objective functions; changes to this common belief result in\nportfolio adjustments and trade. Positive belief shocks induce banks to buy\nrisky assets from investors, and the banks finance those purchases by issuing\nnew short-term liabilities. Negative belief shocks induce banks to sell assets\nin order to reduce their chance of insolvency to a tolerably low level, and\nthey supply more assets at lower prices, which can result in multiple\nmarket-clearing prices. A sufficiently severe negative shock causes the set of\nequilibrium prices to contract (in a manner given by a cusp catastrophe),\ncausing prices to plummet discontinuously and banks to become insolvent.\nSuccessive positive and negative shocks of equal magnitude do not cancel;\nrather, a banking catastrophe can occur even if beliefs simply return to their\ninitial state. Capital requirements can prevent crises by curtailing the\nexpansion of balance sheets when beliefs become more optimistic, but they can\nalso force larger price declines.

Studying the players' positions within their\nsocial networks, we find that the local position in the trade network is most\nrelevant for wealth. Wealthy people have high in- and out-degree in the trade\nnetwork, relatively low nearest-neighbor degree and a low clustering\ncoefficient. Wealthy players have many mutual friendships and are socially well\nrespected by others, but spend more time on business than on socializing. We\nfind that players that are not organized within social groups with at least\nthree members are significantly poorer on average. We observe that high\n`political' status and high wealth go hand in hand. Wealthy players have few\npersonal enemies, but show animosity towards players that behave as public\nenemies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 13:40:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Fuchs", "Benedikt", ""], ["Thurner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6378", "submitter": "Stefan Bornholdt", "authors": "Stefan Bornholdt, Kim Sneppen", "title": "Do Bitcoins make the world go round?

To answer this question, we\nmust consider whether the value of objects is inherent, is a product of social\ninteraction, or involves other mechanisms. Economic theory predicts that there\nis an optimal price for any market transaction, and can be observed during\nauctions or other bidding processes. However, there are also social, cultural,\nand cognitive components to the assignation of value, which can be observed in\nboth human and non-human Primate societies. While behaviors related to these\nfactors are embedded in market interactions, they also involve a biological\nsubstrate for the assignation of value (valuation). To synthesize this\ndiversity of perspectives, we will propose that the process of valuation can be\nmodeled computationally and conceived of as a set of interrelated cultural\nevolutionary, cognitive, and neural processes. To do this, contextual geometric\nstructures (CGS) will be placed in an agent-based context (minimal and\ncompositional markets). Objects in the form of computational propositions can\nbe acquired and exchanged, which will determine the value of both singletons\nand linked propositions. Expected results of this model will be evaluated in\nterms of their contribution to understanding human economic phenomena. The\npaper will focus on computational representations and how they correspond to\nreal-world concepts. The implications for evolutionary economics and our\ncontemporary understanding of valuation and market dynamics will also be\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 19:22:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Alicea", "Bradly", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7179", "submitter": "Menelaos Karanasos", "authors": "Menelaos Karanasos, Alexandros Paraskevopoulos, Faek Menla Ali,\n  Michail Karoglou, Stavroula Yfanti", "title": "Modelling Returns and Volatilities During Financial Crises: a Time\n  Varying Coefficient Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine how the most prevalent stochastic properties of key financial time\nseries have been affected during the recent financial crises.

The model\nconsiders a system of rational agents interacting in a game theoretical\nframework. This evolution drives the dynamic of the agents in both wealth and\neconomic configuration variables. The cost function is chosen to represent a\nrisk averse strategy of each agent. That is, the agent is more likely to\ninteract with the market, the more predictable the market, and therefore the\nsmaller its individual risk. This yields a kinetic equation for an effective\nsingle particle agent density with a Nash equilibrium serving as the local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. We consider a regime of scale separation where the\nlarge scale dynamics is given by a hydrodynamic closure with this local\nequilibrium. A class of generalized collision invariants (GCIs) is developed to\novercome the difficulty of the non-conservative property in the hydrodynamic\nclosure derivation of the large scale dynamics for the evolution of wealth\ndistribution. The result is a system of gas dynamics-type equations for the\ndensity and average wealth of the agents on large scales. We recover the\ninverse Gamma distribution, which has been previously considered in the\nliterature, as a local equilibrium for particular choices of the cost function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Mar 2014 18:48:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Degond", "Pierre", ""], ["Liu", "Jian-Guo", ""], ["Ringhofer", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.8125", "submitter": "Jaehyung Choi", "authors": "Jaehyung Choi", "title": "Maximum drawdown, recovery and momentum", "comments": "28 pages, 6 subfigures; minor revision", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We test predictability on asset price using stock selection rules based on\nmaximum drawdown and consecutive recovery.
