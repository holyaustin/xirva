One reason for the difficulty to overcome the\ncontroversy is the lack of a universal, but also precise, quantitative\ndefinition of efficiency that is able to graduate between different states of\nefficiency. The main purpose of this article is to fill this gap by developing\na measure for the efficiency of markets that fulfill all the stated\nrequirements. It is shown that the new definition of efficiency, based on\ninformational-entropy, is equivalent to the two most used definitions of\nefficiency from Fama and Jensen. The new measure therefore enables steps to\nsettle the dispute over the state of efficiency in markets. Moreover, it is\nshown that inefficiency in a market can either arise from the possibility to\nuse information to predict an event with higher than chance level, or can\nemerge from wrong pricing/ quotes that do not reflect the right probabilities\nof possible events. Finally, the calculation of efficiency is demonstrated on a\nsimple game (of coin tossing), to show how one could exactly quantify the\nefficiency in any market-like system, if all probabilities are known.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 06:56:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Rothenstein", "Roland", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02842", "submitter": "Andres Gomez-Lievano", "authors": "Andres Gomez-Lievano and Oscar Patterson-Lomba", "title": "The drivers of urban economic complexity and their connection to urban\n  economic performance", "comments": "43 pages, 14 figures, 4 tables, 11 appendices", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph nlin.AO q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Is urban economic performance driven by a few factors?
