Several models have been proposed for predicting\ntechnological improvement, but how well do these models perform? An early\nhypothesis made by Theodore Wright in 1936 is that cost decreases as a power\nlaw of cumulative production. An alternative hypothesis is Moore's law, which\ncan be generalized to say that technologies improve exponentially with time.\nOther alternatives were proposed by Goddard, Sinclair et al., and Nordhaus.\nThese hypotheses have not previously been rigorously tested. Using a new\ndatabase on the cost and production of 62 different technologies, which is the\nmost expansive of its kind, we test the ability of six different postulated\nlaws to predict future costs. Our approach involves hindcasting and developing\na statistical model to rank the performance of the postulated laws. Wright's\nlaw produces the best forecasts, but Moore's law is not far behind. We discover\na previously unobserved regularity that production tends to increase\nexponentially. A combination of an exponential decrease in cost and an\nexponential increase in production would make Moore's law and Wright's law\nindistinguishable, as originally pointed out by Sahal. We show for the first\ntime that these regularities are observed in data to such a degree that the\nperformance of these two laws is nearly tied. Our results show that\ntechnological progress is forecastable, with the square root of the logarithmic\nerror growing linearly with the forecasting horizon at a typical rate of 2.5%\nper year. These results have implications for theories of technological change,\nand assessments of candidate technologies and policies for climate change\nmitigation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2012 21:12:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Nagy", "Bela", ""], ["Farmer", "J.
