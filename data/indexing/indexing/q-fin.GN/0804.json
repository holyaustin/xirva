On\nthe one hand, the common parametric assumptions on the customer demand\ndistribution in the literature could not at all be supported in our real-world\ndata set. On the other hand, a reasonably-looking non-parametric approach to\nestimate the demand distribution for the different branches directly from the\nsales distribution could only provide us with statistically weak and unreliable\nestimates for the future demand. Based on real-world sales data from our\nindustry partner we provide evidence that our Top-Dog-Index is statistically\nrobust. Using the Top-Dog-Index, we propose a heuristics to improve the\nbranch-dependent proportion between supply and demand. Our approach cannot\nestimate the branch-dependent demand directly. It can, however, classify the\nbranches into a given number of clusters according to an historic oversupply or\nundersupply. This classification of branches can iteratively be used to adapt\nthe branch distribution of supply and demand in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Apr 2008 06:42:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kurz", "Sascha", ""], ["Rambau", "Joerg", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.1837", "submitter": "Tetsuya Hattori", "authors": "Kumiko Hattori, Tetsuya Hattori", "title": "Mathematical analysis of long tail economy using stochastic ranking\n  processes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.ST stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a new method of estimating the distribution of sales rates of,\ne.g., book titles at an online bookstore, from the time evolution of ranking\ndata found at websites of the store.

The\nreason lies in a misunderstanding of peculiarities of the analysis of\ninfinitesimal quantities. However, even those types of solutions that are\nenvisaged by the above-mentioned models are nonrepresentative in the sense of\nthe reflection of realities. It became obvious that the techniques of the\ntheory of linear differential equations were insufficient here. Accordingly,\nthe scientists' attention switched to the theory of nonlinear differential\nequations. At the same time, balance and, accordingly, the model with matrix\nproperties are objectively inherent in the economic system. For the reduction\nof this model to a differential form, there exist rather elementary means that\nproved to be unclaimed. Macroeconomic rhetoric - the power of the accelerator,\na lag on the part of demand, etc. - accompanied by the use of a lot of abstract\ncoefficients prevailed. However, there is no organic interrelation between\nmatrix and nonlinear differential equations. On the contrary, it can be said\nthat linear theory of integral equations originated in matrix analysis. The\nFredholm linear integral equation of the second kind with a parameter-dependent\nkernel proves to be rather representative with regard to the class of possible\nsolutions. It seems that it can be used for the description of any zigzags of\nthe economy. The price one has to pay for this is the nontriviality of existing\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Apr 2008 08:13:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Jul 2008 09:43:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Chernyshov", "S.
