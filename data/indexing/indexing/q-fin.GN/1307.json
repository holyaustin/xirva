The\nshort answer to this is: No, they are not failing. Energy-based power markets\nare, however, facing several market distortions, namely from the gap between\nthe electricity volume traded at day-ahead markets versus the overall\nelectricity consumption as well as the (wrong) regulatory assumption that\nvariable RES generation, i.e., wind and photovoltaic (PV), truly have zero\nmarginal operation costs. In this paper we show that both effects over-amplify\nthe well-known merit-order effect of RES power feed-in beyond a level that is\nexplainable by underlying physical realities, i.e., thermal power plants being\nwilling to accept negative electricity prices to be able to stay online due to\nconsiderations of wear & tear and start-stop constraints. We analyze the\nimpacts of wind and PV power feed-in on the day-ahead market for a region that\nis already today experiencing significant feed-in tariff (FIT)-subsidized RES\npower feed-in, the EPEX German-Austrian market zone ($\\approx\\,$20% FIT share).\nOur analysis shows that, if the necessary regulatory adaptations are taken,\ni.e., increasing the day-ahead market's share of overall load demand and using\nthe true marginal costs of RES units in the merit-order, energy-based power\nmarkets can remain functional despite high RES power feed-in.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 17:27:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 14:11:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 21:35:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hildmann", "Marcus", ""], ["Ulbig", "Andreas", ""], ["Andersson", "G\u00f6ran", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0785", "submitter": "Junfeng Ma", "authors": "Tahir Choulli and Junfeng Ma", "title": "Explicit Description of HARA Forward Utilities and Their Optimal\n  Portfolios", "comments": "39 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with forward performances of HARA type.

Lock-in can occur both at the\ndecision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level\n(after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in two\nways. The first involves the methodology of calculating cost overruns according\nto the formal decision to build. Due to lock-in, however, the real decision to\nbuild is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costs\nestimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at a\nlater stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. The\nsecond way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through practice. Although\ndecisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made,\nlock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs\n(in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalating\ncommitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators of\nlock-in. In this paper, two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the HSL-South\nprojects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and its\ninfluence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making and\nproject levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation for\ncost overruns significantly contributes to the understanding of the inadequate\nplanning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 17:20:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cantarelli", "Chantal C.", ""], ["Flybjerg", "Bent", ""], ["van Wee", "Bert", ""], ["Molin", "Eric J.

While this design appealed to the gambling\ninstinct, it is a suboptimal way to manage longevity risk during retirement.\nThis is why fair life annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance\ncompany is exposed to the longevity risk -- induces greater lifetime utility.\nHowever, tontines do not have to be designed using a winner-take-all approach\nand insurance companies do not actually sell fair life annuities, partially due\nto aggregate longevity risk.\n  In this paper we derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime\nutility, but doesn't expose the sponsor to any longevity risk.

The optimal tontine varies with the\nindividual's longevity risk aversion $\\gamma$ and the number of participants\n$n$, which is problematic for product design.

We introduce a simpler framework that allows us to show\nthat this transition is robust against many modifications of the model, and is\ngenerically induced by an asymmetry between the rate of hiring and the rate of\nfiring of the firms. The unemployment level remains small until a tipping\npoint, beyond which the economy suddenly collapses. If the parameters are such\nthat the system is close to this transition, any small fluctuation is amplified\nas the system jumps between the two equilibria. We have explored several\nnatural extensions of the model. One is to introduce a bankruptcy threshold,\nlimiting the leverage of firms. This leads to a rich phase diagram with, in\nparticular, a region where acute endogenous crises occur, during which the\nunemployment rate shoots up before the economy can recover. We also introduce\nsimple wage policies. This leads to inflation (in the 'good' phase) or\ndeflation (in the 'bad' phase), but leaves the overall phase diagram of the\nmodel essentially unchanged. We have also started exploring the effect of\nsimple monetary policies that attempt to contain rising unemployment and defang\ncrises. We end the paper with general comments on the usefulness of ABMs to\nmodel macroeconomic phenomena, in particular in view of the time needed to\nreach a steady state that raises the issue of ergodicity in these models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:51:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 16:28:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 08:27:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 08:56:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Gualdi", "Stanislao", ""], ["Tarzia", "Marco", ""], ["Zamponi", "Francesco", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.5602", "submitter": "Yaroslav Ivanenko", "authors": "Yaroslav Ivanenko and Illya Pasichnichenko", "title": "Uncertainty and absence of arbitrage opportunity", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is shown that absence of arbitrage opportunity in financial markets is a\nparticular case of existence of uncertainty in decision system.

The motivation for this approach is a well known paradox in\nmultimarket Cournot competition, where a positive price shock on a monopoly\nmarket may actually reduce the monopolist's profit. We use our approach to\nquantify for the first time the worst case profit reduction for multimarket\noligopolies exposed to arbitrary positive price shocks. For markets with affine\nprice functions and firms with convex cost technologies, we show that the\nrelative profit loss of any firm is at most 25% no matter how many firms\ncompete in the oligopoly. We further investigate the impact of positive price\nshocks on total profit of all firms as well as on social welfare. We find tight\nbounds also for these measures showing that total profit and social welfare\ndecreases by at most 25% and 16.6%, respectively. Finally, we show that in our\nmodel, mixed, correlated and coarse correlated equilibria are essentially\nunique, thus, all our bounds apply to these game solutions as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Jul 2013 08:13:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 26 Sep 2013 10:14:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 15:50:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 11:29:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Harks", "Tobias", ""], ["von Falkenhausen", "Philipp", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.5975", "submitter": "Ovidiu Racorean Mr", "authors": "Ovidiu Racorean", "title": "Correct usage of transmission coefficient for timing the market", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Traders and investors involved in an option contract having the underlying\nstock in range bound are likely to lose their initial investment.

We generate the threshold networks (TN), the minimal spanning tees\n(MST), and the hierarchical network (HN) from the fully connected\ncross-correlation networks. By assigning a threshold value of the\ncross-correlation coefficient, we obtain the threshold networks. We observe the\npower law of the degree distribution in the limited range of the threshold. The\ndegree distribution of the largest cluster in the threshold networks during the\ncrisis is fatter than other periods. The clustering coefficient of the\nthreshold networks follows the power law in the scaling range. We also generate\nthe minimal spanning trees from the fully connected correlation networks. The\nMST during the crisis period shrinks in comparison to the periods before and\nafter the crisis. The cophenetic correlation coefficient increases during the\ncrisis, indicating that the hierarchical structure increases during this\nperiod.
