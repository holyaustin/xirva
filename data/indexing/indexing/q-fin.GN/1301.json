We argue that cash flows can be linked to\nprobabilities of finding a currency unit in a given cash flow. We then use the\ninformation entropy as a natural measure of diversity. This leads to a\nhirarchical inequality measure, which includes the well-known Theil index as a\nspecial case, and a constraint on agent entropy differentials, i.e., the\ndifference between cash inflow and outflow entropies. The last result is\nparticularly intriguing as it formalises the fact that an economy must contain\nboth, cash flow aggregating and cash flow diversifying agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 14:01:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kirchner", "Ulrich", ""], ["Moolman", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.5568", "submitter": "Friedrich Penkner", "authors": "Beatrice Acciaio, Mathias Beiglb\\\"ock, Friedrich Penkner, Walter\n  Schachermayer", "title": "A model-free version of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing and the\n  super-replication theorem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We propose a Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing and a Super-Replication\nTheorem in a model-independent framework.

It is shown that to\nimplement the possible effect of space weather on the terrestrial harvests and\nprices, a simultaneous fulfillment of three conditions is required: 1)\nsensitivity of local weather (cloud cover, atmospheric circulation) to the\nstate of space weather; 2) sensitivity of the area of specific agricultural\ncrops to the weather anomalies (belonging to the area of risk farming); 3)\nrelative isolation of the market, making it difficult to damp the price hikes\nby the external food supplies. Four possible scenarios of the market response\nto the modulations of local terrestrial weather via the solar activity are\ndescribed. The data sources and analysis methods applied to detect this\nrelationship are characterized. We describe the behavior of 22 European markets\nduring the medieval period, in particular, during the Maunder minimum\n(1650-1715). We demonstrate a reliable manifestation of the influence of space\nweather on prices, discovered in the statistics of intervals between the price\nhikes and phase price asymmetry. We show that the effects of phase price\nasymmetry persist even during the early modern period in the U.S. in the\nproduction of the durum wheat. Within the proposed approach, we analyze the\nstatistics of depopulation in the eighteenth and nineteenth century Iceland,\ninduced by the famine due to a sharp livestock reduction owing to, in its turn,\nthe lack of foodstuff due to the local weather anomalies. A high statistical\nsignificance of temporal matching of these events with the periods of extreme\nsolar activity is demonstrated. We discuss the possible consequences of the\nobserved global climate change in the formation of new areas of risk farming,\nsensitive to space weather.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jan 2013 09:17:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pustilnik", "Lev", ""], ["Din", "Gregory Yom", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.6415", "submitter": "Tom Fischer Prof. Dr.", "authors": "Tom Fischer", "title": "A primer on reflexivity and price dynamics under systemic risk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple quantitative example of a reflexive feedback process and the\nresulting price dynamics after an exogenous price shock to a financial network\nis presented.
