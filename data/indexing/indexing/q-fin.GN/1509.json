But, we also see an emergent\nmetric of inequality: the larger the population size and densities of a city,\nhigher incomes grow more quickly than lower, suggesting a disproportionate\nagglomeration of incomes in the highest income categories in big cities.\nBecause there are many more people on lower incomes that scale sublinearly as\ncompared to the highest that scale superlinearly, these findings suggest a\nscaling of inequality: the larger the population, the greater the inequality.\nUrban and economic planning will need to examine ways in which larger cities\ncan be made more equitable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 07:15:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sarkar", "Somwrita", ""], ["Phibbs", "Peter", ""], ["Simpson", "Roderick", ""], ["Wasnik", "Sachin", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.01157", "submitter": "Anthony J  Webster", "authors": "Anthony J.

Insurance provides a financial mechanism that mitigates some of the\nconsequences of climate change, allowing damage from increasingly frequent\nevents to be repaired. We observe that the insurance industry could reclaim any\nincrease in claims due to climate change, by increasing the insurance premiums\non energy producers for example, without needing government intervention or a\nnew tax. We argue that this insurance-led levy must acknowledge both present\ncarbon emissions and a modern industry's carbon inheritance, that is, to\nrecognise that fossil-fuel driven industrial growth has provided the\ninnovations and conditions needed for modern civilisation to exist and develop.\nA tax or levy on energy production is one mechanism that would recognise carbon\ninheritance through the increased (energy) costs for manufacturing and using\nmodern technology, and can also provide an incentive to minimise carbon\nemissions, through higher costs for the most polluting industries. The\nnecessary increases in insurance premiums would initially be small, and will\nrequire an event attribution (EA) methodology to determine their size. We\npropose that the levies can be phased in as the science of event attribution\nbecomes sufficiently robust for each claim type, to ultimately provide a global\ninsurance-led response to climate change.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 16:51:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 20:04:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 20:19:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Webster", "Anthony J.", ""], ["Clarke", "Richard H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.01213", "submitter": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "authors": "Tshilidzi Marwala", "title": "Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Economic Theory", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Artificial intelligence has impacted many aspects of human life.
