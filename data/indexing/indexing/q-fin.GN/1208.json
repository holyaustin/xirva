In this paper we question the assumption that GDP\nmeasures production, and suggest that in reality it merely captures changes in\nthe rate of expansion of the money supply used to measure the price data it is\nderived from. We first review the Quantity Theory of Money $MV=PT$, and show\nthat the Velocity of Circulation of Money(V) does not affect the price level as\nclaimed, as it is also a factor of the quantity of transactions(T). It then\nfollows directly that attempts to measure total production from any form of\nprice data as the GDP measurement does, will necessarily be confounded by the\ninverse relationship between prices and the quantity of production, which\nrequires that as the total quantity of production increases, prices will drop.\nFinally, in support of this claim we present an empirical analysis of the GDP\nof nine countries and one currency union, showing that when normalized for\nmoney supply growth GDP measures have been uniformly shrinking over the last 20\nyears, and discuss the possible reasons for this behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2012 01:56:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mallett", "Jacky", ""], ["Keen", "Charles", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.1123", "submitter": "Joachim Kaldasch", "authors": "Joachim Kaldasch", "title": "Evolutionary Model of the Growth and Size of Firms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2012.01.027", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The key idea of this model is that firms are the result of an evolutionary\nprocess.

It is discussed that the rapid change in global\nconsumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in\nbusiness and management. For policy making under complexity, following\nprinciples are offered: openness and international competition, tolerance and\nvariety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence on external help. The\nchapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation of\ncomplexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small\neconomies have good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if\nthey can demonstrate production flexibility, reliable business ethics and good\nrisk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses the\nopportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and\nmicro economic perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate\nmanagement are being also permanently changed: the balance between short term\nnoise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers, shareholders and\nemployees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is\ndemonstrated by a simple system of differential equations that relate the\nstakeholders described above. The chapter concludes with two financial\napplications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium economic\nestablishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing;\nunexpected downturns in economy can more easily kill companies.
