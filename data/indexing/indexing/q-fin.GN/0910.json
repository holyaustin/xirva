The proliferation of financial\ninstruments apparently provides more means for risk diversification, making the\nmarket more efficient and complete. In the simple market of interacting traders\ndiscussed here, the proliferation of financial instruments erodes systemic\nstability and it drives the market to a critical state characterized by large\nsusceptibility, strong fluctuations and enhanced correlations among risks. This\nsuggests that the hypothesis of APT may not be compatible with a stable market\ndynamics. In this perspective, market stability acquires the properties of a\ncommon good, which suggests that appropriate measures should be introduced in\nderivative markets, to preserve stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 12:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Caccioli", "Fabio", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0236", "submitter": "Vincent Lemaire", "authors": "Noufel Frikha (PMA), Vincent Lemaire (PMA)", "title": "Joint Modelling of Gas and Electricity spot prices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematical Finance, Taylor & Francis (Routledge): SSH\n  Titles, 2012, 20 (1), pp.69-93", "doi": "10.1080/1350486X.2012.658220", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST math.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The recent liberalization of the electricity and gas markets has resulted in\nthe growth of energy exchanges and modelling problems. In this paper, we\nmodelize jointly gas and electricity spot prices using a mean-reverting model\nwhich fits the correlations structures for the two commodities. The dynamics\nare based on Ornstein processes with parameterized diffusion coefficients.\nMoreover, using the empirical distributions of the spot prices, we derive a\nclass of such parameterized diffusions which captures the most salient\nstatistical properties: stationarity, spikes and heavy-tailed distributions.\nThe associated calibration procedure is based on standard and efficient\nstatistical tools. We calibrate the model on French market for electricity and\non UK market for gas, and then simulate some trajectories which reproduce well\nthe observed prices behavior. Finally, we illustrate the importance of the\ncorrelation structure and of the presence of spikes by measuring the risk on a\npower plant portfolio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2009 19:24:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2009 19:17:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Oct 2010 13:00:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Frikha", "Noufel", "", "PMA"], ["Lemaire", "Vincent", "", "PMA"]]}, {"id": "0910.1671", "submitter": "Simone Farinelli", "authors": "Simone Farinelli", "title": "Geometric Arbitrage Theory and Market Dynamics Reloaded", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.DG math.PR q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We have embedded the classical theory of stochastic finance into a\ndifferential geometric framework called Geometric Arbitrage Theory and show\nthat it is possible to:\n  --Write arbitrage as curvature of a principal fibre bundle.\n  --Parameterize arbitrage strategies by its holonomy.\n  --Give the Fundamental Theorem of Asset Pricing a differential homotopic\ncharacterization.\n  --Characterize Geometric Arbitrage Theory by five principles and show they\nthey are consistent with the classical theory of stochastic finance.\n  --Derive for a closed market the equilibrium solution for market portfolio\nand dynamics in the cases where:\n  -->Arbitrage is allowed but minimized.\n  -->Arbitrage is not allowed.\n  --Prove that the no-free-lunch-with-vanishing-risk condition implies the zero\ncurvature condition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2009 08:22:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Mon, 5 Jul 2021 12:26:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Feb 2012 10:36:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 20 May 2012 17:08:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2014 15:07:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 18 Jul 2015 19:35:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2020 08:21:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2020 17:14:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Sun, 23 Aug 2020 10:19:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sat, 26 Dec 2020 13:32:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Farinelli", "Simone", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.3695", "submitter": "Janusz Mi\\'skiewicz Dr", "authors": "Janusz Miskiewicz, Marcel Ausloos", "title": "Has the world economy reached its globalization limit?", "comments": "Presented at THIC & APFA7 Submitted to Physica A", "journal-ref": "Physica A 389 (2010) 797-806", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2009.10.029", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The economy globalization measure problem is discussed.
