Understanding the origin of these\nevents is arguably one of the most important problems in economic theory. In\nthis paper, we review recent efforts to include heterogeneities and\ninteractions in models of decision. We argue that the Random Field Ising model\n(RFIM) indeed provides a unifying framework to account for many collective\nsocio-economic phenomena that lead to sudden ruptures and crises. We discuss\ndifferent models that can capture potentially destabilising self-referential\nfeedback loops, induced either by herding, i.e. reference to peers, or\ntrending, i.e. reference to the past, and account for some of the phenomenology\nmissing in the standard models. We discuss some empirically testable\npredictions of these models, for example robust signatures of RFIM-like herding\neffects, or the logarithmic decay of spatial correlations of voting patterns.\nOne of the most striking result, inspired by statistical physics methods, is\nthat Adam Smith's invisible hand can badly fail at solving simple coordination\nproblems. We also insist on the issue of time-scales, that can be extremely\nlong in some cases, and prevent socially optimal equilibria to be reached. As a\ntheoretical challenge, the study of so-called \"detailed-balance\" violating\ndecision rules is needed to decide whether conclusions based on current models\n(that all assume detailed-balance) are indeed robust and generic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2012 16:37:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Dec 2012 15:52:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", "", "Capital Fund Management"]]}, {"id": "1209.0708", "submitter": "Jean-Francois Mercure", "authors": "Jean-Francois Mercure and Pablo Salas", "title": "On the global economic potentials and marginal costs of non-renewable\n  resources and the price of energy commodities", "comments": "18 pages, 7 figures, 8 pages of supplementary information", "journal-ref": "Energy Policy 63 469-483 (2013)", "doi": "10.1016/j.enpol.2013.08.040", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.DS physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A model is presented in this work for simulating endogenously the evolution\nof the marginal costs of production of energy carriers from non-renewable\nresources, their consumption, depletion pathways and timescales.

In practice, general equilibrium\ntreats economies as being always in equilibrium, albeit in a sequence of\nequilibria as driven by external changes in parameters. This view is sometimes\ndefended on the grounds that internal dynamics are fast, while external changes\nare slow, so that the economy can be viewed as adjusting instantaneously to any\nchanged conditions. However, the argument has not been presented in a rigorous\nway. In this paper we show that when conditions are such that: a) economies do\nrespond essentially instantaneously to external influences; b) the external\nchanges are small compared to the values that characterize the economy; and c)\nthe economy's dynamics are continuous and first-order in time (as for Walrasian\ntatonnement), the resulting economic theory is equivalent to a topological\nfield theory. Because it is a topological theory it has no dynamics in a strict\nsense, and so perturbatively---that is, when examining dynamics in the region\nof a critical point---the field theory behaves as general equilibrium posits.\nHowever, the field-theoretic form of the theory admits non-perturbative\ninstanton solutions that link different critical points. Thus, in this theory,\nand in contrast to general equilibrium, the internal dynamics of the model\noccasionally make an appearance in the form of abrupt, noise-driven transitions\nbetween critical points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Sep 2012 11:22:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kemp-Benedict", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1903", "submitter": "Sergei Manzhos", "authors": "Sergei Manzhos", "title": "Roles of discount rate, risk premium, and device performance in\n  estimating the cost of energy for photovoltaics", "comments": "10 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Int.

In response to the crisis, drastic actions have been\ntaken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because\ninterest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates\nimply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates\nalso increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If\nthere is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute\nto---rather than be caused by---default risk. Here we build a quantitative\nequilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able\nto determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show\nthat over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates\nof Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The\nrelationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the\nGreek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude\nnon-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find\nevidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According\nto the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March\n2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of\ndefault by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and\ninternational interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be\nreduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to\nprevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of\nprojected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy\nto be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively.
