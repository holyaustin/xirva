We consider two representative investors in a market\nholding different opinions about the public available information. The\ndeleveraging shock forces the high confidence investors to liquidate their\nrisky assets to pay back their margin loans. When short sales are constrained,\nthe deleveraging shock creates a liquidity vacuum in which no trades can occur\nbetween the two representative investors until the price drop to a threshold\nbelow which low confidence investors take over the reduced demands. There are\ntwo roles short sellers could play to stabilize the market. First, short\nsellers provide extra supply in a bullish market so that the price of the asset\nis settled lower than otherwise. Second, short sellers catch the falling price\nearlier in the deleveraging process if they are previously allowed to hold a\nlarger short position. We apply our model to explain the recent deleveraging\ncrisis of the Chinese market with great success.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 05:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Liang", ""], ["Zhang", "Lei", ""], ["Fu", "Zhiming", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.06734", "submitter": "Sandro Sozzo", "authors": "Emmanuel Haven and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "A Generalized Probability Framework to Model Economic Agents' Decisions\n  Under Uncertainty", "comments": "13 pages, standard Latex. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:1302.3850", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The applications of techniques from statistical (and classical) mechanics to\nmodel interesting problems in economics and finance has produced valuable\nresults.
