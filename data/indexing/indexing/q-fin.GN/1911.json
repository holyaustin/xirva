However, this is not as simple\nas instantaneously closing down all fossil fuel energy generation and replacing\nthem with renewable sources -- careful decisions need to be taken to ensure\nrapid but stable progress. To aid decision makers, we present a new tool,\nElecSim, which is an open-sourced agent-based modelling framework used to\nexamine the effect of policy on long-term investment decisions in electricity\ngeneration. ElecSim allows non-experts to rapidly prototype new ideas.\n  Different techniques to model long-term electricity decisions are reviewed\nand used to motivate why agent-based models will become an important strategic\ntool for policy. We motivate why an open-source toolkit is required for\nlong-term electricity planning.\n  Actual electricity prices are compared with our model and we demonstrate that\nthe use of a Monte-Carlo simulation in the system improves performance by\n$52.5\\%$. Further, using ElecSim we demonstrate the effect of a carbon tax to\nencourage a low-carbon electricity supply. We show how a {\\pounds}40 ($\\$50$)\nper tonne of CO2 emitted would lead to 70% renewable electricity by 2050.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Oct 2019 10:55:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kell", "Alexander J.

We offer a statistical model within the context of rational finance\nwhich can be used without relying on behavioral finance assumptions to model\nthe predictability of stock returns. We incorporate the predictability of stock\nreturns into the well-known Black-Scholes option pricing formula. Empirically,\nwe analyze the option and spot trader's market predictability of stock prices\nby defining a forward-looking measure which we call \"implied excess\npredictability\". The empirical results indicate the effect of option trader's\npredictability of stock returns on the price of stock options is an increasing\nfunction of moneyness, while this effect is decreasing for spot traders. These\nempirical results indicate potential asymmetric predictability of stock prices\nby spot and option traders. We show in pricing options with the strike price\nsignificantly higher or lower than the stock price, the predictability of the\nunderlying stock's return should be incorporated into the option pricing\nformula. In pricing options that have moneyness close to one, stock return\npredictability is not incorporated into the option pricing model because stock\nreturn predictability is the same for both types of traders. In other words,\nspot traders and option traders are equally informed about the future value of\nthe stock market in this case. Comparing different volatility measures, we find\nthat the difference between implied and realized variances or variance risk\npremium can potentially be used as a stock return predictor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Nov 2019 04:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Shirvani", "Abootaleb", ""], ["Rachev", "Svetlozar T.", ""], ["Fabozzi", "Frank J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.02449", "submitter": "Zoltan Neda", "authors": "Zoltan Neda, Istvan Gere, Tamas S.
