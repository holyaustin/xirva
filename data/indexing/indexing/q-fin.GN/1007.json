From his extensive scientific contributions,\nboth theoretical and experimental, we expand here the discussion of his\ncontributions to mathematical economy. He is mainly celebrated as the first\npersons to define correctly net yield and describe method for its optimization,\nwhich was considered \"strikingly modern\" still in 1950. Buquoy's program was\n\"systematic overview of all theorems which affect maintenance and increase of\nnational wealth\" for which he correctly defined and mathematically expressed\nmany economic terms. The most striking feature of Buquoy's writing is that he\nwas also a very influential economic practitioner. He governed one of the\nwealthiest possessions in Bohemia, and perhaps in Austria, of his time. Thus\nhis economical thinking expands from the \"political part\", which is economy in\nmodern sense, to \"...sources of national wealth, or the technical part of\nnational economy ...\". The complexity of Buquoy's view has little match in\nmodern literature namely because the extent of data sources is hardly available\nin modern times. The article puts Buquoy's mathematical economy contributions\nin context to his mathematical physics thoughts and approaches. The last direct\ncitation of Buquoy's work comes from the year 2008.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Jul 2010 06:56:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Stys", "Dalibor", ""], ["Valcihova", "Miroslav", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.4361", "submitter": "Matthew Lorig", "authors": "Jean-Pierre Fouque, Sebastian Jaimungal, Matthew Lorig", "title": "Spectral Decomposition of Option Prices in Fast Mean-Reverting\n  Stochastic Volatility Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "SIAM J.

The resulting pricing formulas are\nsemi-analytic, in the sense that they can be expressed as integrals.\nDifficulties associated with the numerical evaluation of these integrals are\ndiscussed, and techniques for avoiding these difficulties are provided.\nOverall, it is shown that computational complexity for our model is comparable\nto the case of a pure Heston model, but our correction brings significant\nflexibility in terms of fitting to the implied volatility surface. This is\nillustrated numerically and with option data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2010 01:35:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 22:31:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Fouque", "Jean-Pierre", ""], ["Lorig", "Matthew", ""]]}]
