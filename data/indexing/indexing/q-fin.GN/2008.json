Using data from\nProsper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts\nlisting default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The dominance\nof the machine over the crowd is more pronounced for highly risky listings.

We propose a\ngeneral and effective \"debasing\" method that can be applied to any prediction\nfocused ML applications, and demonstrate its use in our context.

Finally, we combine the results by\ndistributing the detected changepoints over the identified capital flows. The\nresults reveal that the stock indices have been rarely pushed further during\nthe entire surge episodes identified by both approaches, and thus surges of\ncapital flows do not necessarily lead to further appreciation of stock prices.\nIn the meantime, a significant appreciation of stock prices is observed during\nthe normal state of capital flows. On the other hand, it is noticed that the\nstock prices have not often depreciated during the episodes of foreign capital\noutflows in all the selected EMEs, which means that stock prices have been less\nvulnerable to reversals of foreign capital flows\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 10:27:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Baba", "Boubekeur", ""], ["Sevil", "Guven", ""]]}]
