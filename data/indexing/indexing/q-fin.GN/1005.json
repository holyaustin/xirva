Under our framework, all price\ndeviations from the linear trend are transient and the price must promptly\nreturn to the trend. Specifically, the model predicted that \"the price for\nmotor fuel in the US will also grow by 50% by the end of 2009. Oil price is\nexpected to rise by ~50% as well, from its current value of ~$50 per barrel\".\nThe behavior of actual price has shown that this prediction is accurate in both\namplitude and trajectory shape. Hence, one can conclude that the concept of\nprice decomposition into a short-term (oscillating) and long-term (linear\ntrend) components is valid. According to the model, the price of motor fuel and\ncrude oil will be falling to the level of $30 per barrel during the next 5 to 8\nyears.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 May 2010 07:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kitov", "Ivan O.", ""], ["Kitov", "Oleg I.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0221", "submitter": "Jean-Claude Juhel", "authors": "Jean-Claude Juhel (CRIFP), Dominique Dufour (CRIFP)", "title": "A discussion of stock market speculation by Pierre-Joseph Proudhon", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "12th World Congress of Accounting Historians, Istanbul : Turkey\n  (2008)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The object of this contribution is to present the ideas behind the thinking\nof the French economist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) in relation to the\ncauses and effects of Stock market speculation. It is based upon the works of\nthis author but particularly on his \"Manuel du sp\\'eculateur \\`a la Bourse\"\n(Stock Market Speculator Manual) edited in 1857 in Paris. Compared to the\nmarkets of today, however, the stock market described by Proudhon appears\nembryonic. Nevertheless it represents the location for transactions in\nfinancial assets, commodities, precious metals and even some transactions\ninvolving options. This contribution is organised in the following manner - the\nfirst section is devoted to the development of Proudhon's thought in relation\nto speculation. It is divided into two parts. The first part is dedicated to\nPierre-Joseph Proudhon's definitions of stock market speculation or gambling\nwith shares that for him served no purpose either from a human or economic\nperspective and was therefore condemnable and to be contrasted with\nentrepreneurial speculation that, even though it is a highly-risky activity,\ninvolves the spirit of enterprise and provides the lifeblood of economic\ngrowth. The second part allows us to present Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's\npropositions in relation to restricting the speculation that he considers\nobnoxious. The second section has two objectives: one part places in\nperspective the views of Proudhon and the characteristics of stock market\nactivity under the Second Empire whilst the other part examines current-day\naspects of the characteristics evoked by Proudhon. We are interested especially\nin the question of the regulation and that of the relevance today of certain\naccounting practices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2010 07:49:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Juhel", "Jean-Claude", "", "CRIFP"], ["Dufour", "Dominique", "", "CRIFP"]]}, {"id": "1005.0279", "submitter": "Vladimir Vovk", "authors": "Vladimir Vovk", "title": "Rough paths in idealized financial markets", "comments": "21 pages, this version adds (in Appendix C) a reference to new\n  results in the foundations of game-theoretic probability based on Hardin and\n  Taylor's work on hat puzzles", "journal-ref": "Lithuanian Mathematical Journal 51(2):274-285, 2011", "doi": "10.1007/s10986-011-9125-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers possible price paths of a financial security in an\nidealized market.

Taking an\ninformation-based approach to the reserving problem, we derive the process of\nthe conditional distribution of the ultimate loss.

We\nderive explicit expressions for the best-estimate ultimate loss process, and\nfor expected recoveries arising from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance\ntreaties. Use of a deterministic time change allows for the matching of any\ninitial (increasing) development pattern for the paid claims. We show that\nthese methods are well-suited to the modelling of claims where there is a\nnon-trivial probability of catastrophic loss. The generalized inverse-Gaussian\n(GIG) distribution is shown to be a natural choice for the a priori ultimate\nloss distribution. For particular GIG parameter choices, the best-estimate\nultimate loss process can be written as a rational function of the paid-claims\nprocess. We extend the model to include a second paid-claims process, and allow\nthe two processes to be dependent. The results obtained can be applied to the\nmodelling of multiple lines of business or multiple origin years. The\nmulti-dimensional model has the property that the dimensionality of\ncalculations remains low, regardless of the number of paid-claims processes.
