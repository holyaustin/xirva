In this study, we applied the\nlog-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) methodology based on multilevel time\nseries to unravel the underlying mechanisms of the 2020 global stock market\ncrash by analyzing the trajectories of 10 major stock market indexes from both\ndeveloped and emergent stock markets, including the S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ,\nFTSE, DAX, NIKKEI, CSI 300, HSI, BSESN, and BOVESPA. In order to effectively\ndistinguish between endogenous crash and exogenous crash, we proposed using the\nLPPLS confidence indicator as a classification proxy. The results show that the\napparent LPPLS bubble patterns of the super-exponential increase, corrected by\nthe accelerating logarithm-periodic oscillations, have indeed presented in the\nprice trajectories of the seven indexes: S&P 500, DJIA, NASDAQ, DAX, CSI 300,\nBSESN, and BOVESPA, indicating that the large positive bubbles have formed\nendogenously prior to the 2020 stock market crash, and the subsequent crashes\nfor the seven indexes are endogenous, stemming from the increasingly systemic\ninstability of the stock markets, while the well-known external shocks such as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic etc. only acted as sparks during the 2020 global stock\nmarket crash. In contrast, the obvious signatures of the LPPLS model have not\nbeen observed in the price trajectories of the three remaining indexes: FTSE,\nNIKKEI, and HSI, signifying that the crashes in these three indexes are\nexogenous, stemming from external shocks. The novel classification method of\ncrash types proposed in this study can also be used to analyze regime changes\nof any price trajectories in global financial markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jan 2021 22:31:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Ruiqiang", ""], ["Shu", "Min", ""], ["Zhu", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00719", "submitter": "Sridhar Ravula", "authors": "Sridhar Ravula", "title": "Bankruptcy prediction using disclosure text features", "comments": "36 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.LG", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  A public firm's bankruptcy prediction is an important financial research\nproblem because of the security price downside risks.
