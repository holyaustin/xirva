For example, as we consider here, some products might\ncarry environmental or `green' benefits. Some consumers might value these\nbenefits while others do not. However, as evidenced by myriad failed attempts\nof environmental products to maintain even a niche market, such benefits do not\nnecessarily outweigh the extra purchasing cost. The question we pose is, how\ncan such an initially economically-disadvantaged green product evolve to hold\nthe greater share of the market? We present a simple mathematical model for the\ndynamics of product competition in a heterogeneous consumer population. Our\nmodel preassigns a hierarchy to the products, which designates the consumer\nchoice when prices are comparable, while prices are dynamically rescaled to\nreflect increasing returns to scale. Our approach allows us to model many\nscenarios of technology substitution and provides a method for generalizing\nmarket forces. With this model, we begin to forecast irreversible trends\nassociated with consumer dynamics as well as policies that could be made to\ninfluence transitions\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Jun 2007 12:38:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Weisbuch", "G\u00e9rard", ""], ["Buskens", "Vincent", ""], ["Vuong", "Luat", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.1839", "submitter": "Didier Sornette", "authors": "Didier Sornette (ETH Zurich)", "title": "Nurturing Breakthroughs: Lessons from Complexity Theory", "comments": "14 pages, Invited talk at the workshop Trans-disciplinary Research\n  Agenda for Societal Dynamics (http://www.uni-lj.si/trasd in Ljubljana),\n  organized by J.

We relate the learning model from\nthe minority game literature to standard game-theoretic learning models, and\nshow that in fact it shares many features with these models.
