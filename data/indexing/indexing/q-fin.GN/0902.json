A new distribution function, having its\nroots in the framework of k-generalized statistics, is derived that is\nparticularly suitable to describe the whole spectrum of incomes, from the\nlow-middle income region up to the high-income Pareto power-law regime.\nAnalytical expressions for the shape, moments and some other basic statistical\nproperties are given. Furthermore, several well-known econometric tools for\nmeasuring inequality, which all exist in a closed form, are considered. A\nmethod for parameter estimation is also discussed. The model is shown to fit\nremarkably well the data on personal income for the United States, and the\nanalysis of inequality performed in terms of its parameters reveals very\npowerful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2009 16:16:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2009 10:12:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Clementi", "F.", ""], ["Gallegati", "M.", ""], ["Kaniadakis", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0100", "submitter": "J.

It is a game of chance in which the\nprobabilities for different objective outcomes (e.g., heads or tails in a coin\ntoss) depend on the amount wagered on those outcomes. By varying the `reality\nmap', which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is\npossible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which\nprobabilities have no dependence on wagers to a purely subjective game in which\nprobabilities equal the amount wagered. We study self-reinforcing games, in\nwhich betting more on an outcome increases its odds, and self-defeating games,\nin which the opposite is true. This is investigated in and out of equilibrium,\nwith and without rational players, and both numerically and analytically. We\nintroduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game, similar to\nmeasuring the magnitude of the arbitrage opportunities in a financial market.\nWe prove that convergence to equilibrium is is a power law with an extremely\nslow rate of convergence: The more subjective the game, the slower the\nconvergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Feb 2009 01:24:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 05:34:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2009 17:16:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cherkashin", "Dmitriy", ""], ["Farmer", "J.

On the other hand, it also reveals that in the same\ncountries, control is found to be highly concentrated at the global level,\nnamely, lying in the hands of very few important shareholders. Interestingly,\nthe exact opposite is observed for European countries.

Accordingly the new emerging discipline requires one to replace\nthe production function, one of key ideas in the conventional economics, by an\nalternative which can take an explicit account of distribution of firms'\nproduction activities. In this paper we propose a new idea referred to as\nproduction copula; a copula is an analytic means for modeling dependence among\nvariables. Such a production copula predicts value added yielded by firms with\ngiven capital and labor in a probabilistic way. It is thereby in sharp contrast\nto the production function where the output of firms is completely\ndeterministic. We demonstrate empirical construction of a production copula\nusing financial data of listed firms in Japan. Analysis of the data shows that\nthere are significant correlations among their capital, labor and value added\nand confirms that the values added are too widely scattered to be represented\nby a production function. We employ four models for the production copula, that\nis, trivariate versions of Frank, Gumbel and survival Clayton and\nnon-exchangeable trivariate Gumbel; the last one works best.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2009 03:46:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2009 05:10:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 22 Nov 2010 02:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Iyetomi", "H.", ""], ["Aoyama", "H.", ""], ["Fujiwara", "Y.", ""], ["Ikeda", "Y.", ""], ["Souma", "W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4274", "submitter": "Lee Smolin", "authors": "Lee Smolin", "title": "Time and symmetry in models of economic markets", "comments": "41 pages, one figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  These notes discuss several topics in neoclassical economics and\nalternatives, with an aim of reviewing fundamental issues in modeling economic\nmarkets.

I then argue that symmetries due to similarly endowed individuals\nand similar products are generically broken by the constraints of scarcity,\nleading to the existence of multiple equilibria.\n  This is followed by an evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the\nmodel generally. Several of the weaknesses are concerned with the treatments of\ntime and contingency. To address these we discuss a class of agent based\nmodels.\n  Another set of issues has to do with the fundamental meaning of prices and\nthe related question of what the observables of a non-equilibrium, dynamic\nmodel of an economic market should be. We argue that these issues are addressed\nby formulating economics in the language of a gauge theory, as proposed\noriginally by Malaney and Weinstein.
