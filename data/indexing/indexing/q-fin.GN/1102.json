Computer simulations track\nweekly sales, loans, account balances, commercial bank profits, solvency and\ncompliance with reserve requirements, and government debt.\n  The model of this economy is fully specified by a computer program. The\nprogram allows the user to explore the effects of parameter changes. Monetary\nand fiscal policies are implemented by choices of parameters such as interest\nrates and reserve requirements, and government tax and spending rates. Credit\nsupply, consumer confidence, and loan default rates strongly affect the\nbehavior of the economy in terms of sales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Feb 2011 22:29:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Easton", "Robert W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.1713", "submitter": "Alfredo Sandoval-Villalbazo", "authors": "J.

We highlight various aspects of three types of\nuncertainties embedded in different construction methods: 1) the available\nhistorical data and the bank's rating philosophy; 2) the merger of one-year\nBasel PD and the chosen Moody's TPMs; and 3) deriving a monthly or quarterly\nTPM when the generator matrix does not exist.
