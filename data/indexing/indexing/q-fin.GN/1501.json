These savings are typically grown during the accumulation phase\nthen spent during the retirement decumulation phase. Extensive research into\ninvest-and-harvest decumulation strategies has been conducted, but\nrecommendations differ markedly. This has likely been a source of concern and\nconfusion for the retiree. Our goal is to find what has heretofore been\nelusive, namely an optimal decumulation strategy. Optimality implies that no\nalternate strategy exists or can be constructed that delivers a lower\nprobability of ruin, given a fixed inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 14:55:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Rook", "Christopher J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00434", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "authors": "Stanislao Gualdi, Marco Tarzia, Francesco Zamponi, Jean-Philippe\n  Bouchaud", "title": "Monetary Policy and Dark Corners in a stylized Agent-Based Model", "comments": "Contribution to the CRISIS project, 25 pages, 21 figures, pseudo-code\n  of the model, revised and improved version", "journal-ref": "Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination 12, 507-537\n  (2017)", "doi": "10.1007/s11403-016-0174-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend in a minimal way the stylized model introduced in in \"Tipping\nPoints in Macroeconomic Agent Based Models\" [JEDC 50, 29-61 (2015)], with the\naim of investigating the role and efficacy of monetary policy of a `Central\nBank' that sets the interest rate such as to steer the economy towards a\nprescribed inflation and employment level. Our major finding is that provided\nits policy is not too aggressive (in a sense detailed in the paper) the Central\nBank is successful in achieving its goals. However, the existence of different\nequilibrium states of the economy, separated by phase boundaries (or \"dark\ncorners\"), can cause the monetary policy itself to trigger instabilities and be\ncounter-productive. In other words, the Central Bank must navigate in a narrow\nwindow: too little is not enough, too much leads to instabilities and wildly\noscillating economies. This conclusion strongly contrasts with the prediction\nof DSGE models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 16:31:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 19:33:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gualdi", "Stanislao", ""], ["Tarzia", "Marco", ""], ["Zamponi", "Francesco", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.04992", "submitter": "Franco Ruzzenenti", "authors": "Franco Ruzzenenti, Andreas Joseph, Elisa Ticci, Pietro Vozzella,\n  Giampaolo Gabbi", "title": "Interactions between financial and environmental networks in OECD\n  countries", "comments": "Supplementary Information provided", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0136767", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyse a multiplex of networks between OECD countries during the decade\n2002-2010, which consists of five financial layers, given by foreign direct\ninvestment, equity securities, short-term, long-term and total debt securities,\nand five environmental layers, given by emissions of N O x, P M 10 SO 2, CO 2\nequivalent and the water footprint associated with international trade. We\npresent a new measure of cross-layer correlations between flows in different\nlayers based on reciprocity. For the assessment of results, we implement a null\nmodel for this measure based on the exponential random graph theory. We find\nthat short-term financial flows are more correlated with environmental flows\nthan long-term investments. Moreover, the correlations between reverse\nfinancial and environmental flows (i.e. flows of different layers going in\nopposite directions) are generally stronger than correlations between synergic\nflows (flows going in the same direction). This suggests a trade-off between\nfinancial and environmental layers, where, more financialised countries display\nhigher correlations between outgoing financial flows and incoming environmental\nflows from lower financialised countries, which could have important policy\nimplications. Five countries are identified as hubs in this finance-environment\nmultiplex: The United States, France, Germany, Belgium-Luxembourg and the\nUnited Kingdom.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 20:49:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Apr 2015 08:14:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ruzzenenti", "Franco", ""], ["Joseph", "Andreas", ""], ["Ticci", "Elisa", ""], ["Vozzella", "Pietro", ""], ["Gabbi", "Giampaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05400", "submitter": "Teruyoshi Kobayashi", "authors": "Charles D.

We capture seniority of debt in a multiplex network, a graph of\nnodes connected by multiple types of edges. Here, an edge between banks denotes\na debt contract of a certain level of seniority. Next we study cascading\ndefault. There exist multiple kinds of bankruptcy, indexed by the highest level\nof seniority at which a bank cannot repay all its debts. Self-interested banks\nwould prefer that all their loans be made at the most senior level. However,\nmixing debts of different seniority levels makes the system more stable, in\nthat it shrinks the set of network densities for which bankruptcies spread\nwidely. We compute the optimal ratio of senior to junior debts, which we call\nthe optimal seniority ratio, for two uncorrelated Erdos-Renyi networks. If\ninstitutions erode their buffer against insolvency, then this optimal seniority\nratio rises; in other words, if default thresholds fall, then more loans should\nbe senior. We generalize the analytical results to arbitrarily many levels of\nseniority and to heavy-tailed degree distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 05:45:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 01:12:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2015 02:50:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Brummitt", "Charles D.", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Teruyoshi", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.05751", "submitter": "Leonardo Bargigli", "authors": "Leonardo Bargigli, Giovanni di Iasio, Luigi Infante, Fabrizio Lillo\n  and Federico Pierobon", "title": "Interbank markets and multiplex networks: centrality measures and\n  statistical null models", "comments": "To appear in the book \"Interconnected Networks\", A.
