We find that (i) the Japanese rice markets\nhad been integrated in the 1910s; (ii) increasing use of telegraphs had\naccelerated rice market integration from the Meiji period in Japan; and (iii)\nlocal telephone system, which reduced the time spent by urban users sending and\nreceiving telegrams, promoted market integration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 06:29:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 06:12:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 08:24:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 15:53:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 11:47:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 1 Oct 2017 02:20:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ito", "Mikio", ""], ["Maeda", "Kiyotaka", ""], ["Noda", "Akihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00283", "submitter": "Juan C.

Striking visual and empirical\nvalidation is observed for a broad, global macroeconomic sigma-convergence in\nthe period immediately following the end of the Cold War.

Nevertheless, analysis of both cross-country and cross-state samples\nindicates that, globally, disproportionately high growth levels and excessively\nhigh decay levels have become rarer over time. We also see that urban areas,\nespecially concentrated within short distances of major capital cities were\nmore likely than rural or suburban areas to see relatively high growth in the\naftermath of the financial crisis. Observed changes in growth polarity can be\nattributed plausibly to post-crisis government intervention and subsidy\npolicies introduced around the world.
