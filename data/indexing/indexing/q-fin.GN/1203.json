In this article we explore\nthis question by using the Product Space to study the productive structure of\nfive south-east African countries: Kenya, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and\nZambia. The Product Space is a network connecting products that tend to be\nexported by the same sets of countries. Since countries are more likely to\ndevelop products that are close by in the Product Space to the ones that they\nalready produce, the Product Space can be used to help anticipate a country's\nindustrial opportunities.\n  Our results suggest that the most natural avenue for future product\ndiversification for these five south-east African nations resides in the\nagricultural sector, since all of these nations appear to have productive\nstructures that are pre-adapted to the production of many agricultural products\nthat none of them are currently exporting.\n  We conclude this paper by exploring the potential benefits of further\nregional economic integration by doing an exercise in which we pull together\nthe productive structures of these five countries. This exercise shows that the\nproducts that become more accessible in the combined economy are once again\npredominantly agricultural. These results suggest that while diversification\ninto all sectors should remain an important long-term goal of the region, the\npath towards increased diversification in the near future may well lie in a\nmore empowered and diverse agricultural sector.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 12:04:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hidalgo", "Cesar A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.0643", "submitter": "Santanu Dey", "authors": "Santanu Dey and Sandeep Juneja", "title": "Incorporating fat tails in financial models using entropic divergence\n  measures", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.GN q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the existing financial literature, entropy based ideas have been proposed\nin portfolio optimization, in model calibration for options pricing as well as\nin ascertaining a pricing measure in incomplete markets. The abstracted problem\ncorresponds to finding a probability measure that minimizes the relative\nentropy (also called $I$-divergence) with respect to a known measure while it\nsatisfies certain moment constraints on functions of underlying assets. In this\npaper, we show that under $I$-divergence, the optimal solution may not exist\nwhen the underlying assets have fat tailed distributions, ubiquitous in\nfinancial practice. We note that this drawback may be corrected if\n`polynomial-divergence' is used. This divergence can be seen to be equivalent\nto the well known (relative) Tsallis or (relative) Renyi entropy. We discuss\nexistence and uniqueness issues related to this new optimization problem as\nwell as the nature of the optimal solution under different objectives. We also\nidentify the optimal solution structure under $I$-divergence as well as\npolynomial-divergence when the associated constraints include those on marginal\ndistribution of functions of underlying assets. These results are applied to a\nsimple problem of model calibration to options prices as well as to portfolio\nmodeling in Markowitz framework, where we note that a reasonable view that a\nparticular portfolio of assets has heavy tailed losses may lead to fatter and\nmore reasonable tail distributions of all assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Mar 2012 11:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Santanu", ""], ["Juneja", "Sandeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1311", "submitter": "Ian Wilkinson", "authors": "Ian Wilkinson (The University of Sydney)", "title": "The evolvability of business and the role of antitrust", "comments": "37 pages, 1 table, 1 Figure", "journal-ref": "Ian Wilkinson \"The Evolvability of Business and the Role of\n  Antitrust\" Antitrust Bulletin 51 (1) 2006, 111-141", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN nlin.AO physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, based on theories of complex adaptive systems, I argue that\nthe main case for antitrust policy should be extended to include the criteria\nof \"evolvability.\" To date, the main case focuses on economizing, including\nmarket power as a key filter for identifying suspect cases.

Explicitly derived is Gibrat's law from an\nevolutionary market dynamics of short term fluctuations. The total private\nincome distribution is shown to consist of four main parts. From capital income\nof private firms the income distribution contains a lognormal distribution for\nsmall and a Pareto tail for large incomes. Labour income contributes an\nexponential distribution. Also included is the income from a social insurance\nsystem, approximated by a Gaussian peak. The evolutionary model is able to\nreproduce the stylized facts of the income distribution, shown by a comparison\nwith empirical data of a high resolution income distribution.
