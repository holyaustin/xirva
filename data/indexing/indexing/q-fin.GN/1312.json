The completed database which we\nhave constructed using this matching emphasises the significance of the\nhigh-income society class in the analysis of all household incomes. For\ninstance, the Pareto exponent, which characterises this class, defines the Zipf\nlaw having an exponent much lower than the one characterising the medium-income\nsociety class. This result makes it possible to clearly distinguish between\nmedium- and high-income society classes. By using our approach, we found that\nthe high-income society class almost disappeared in 2009, which defines this\nyear as the most difficult for the EU. To our surprise, this is a contrast with\n2008, considered the first year of a worldwide financial crisis, when the\nstatus of the high-income society class was similar to that of 2010.
