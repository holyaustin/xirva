In\npractice this often means identifying a constant known as the doubling time,\ndescribing the time period over which the technology roughly doubles in some\nmeasure of performance or of performance per dollar. Moore's law is,\nclassically, the empirical observation that the number of electronic components\nthat can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months to 2 years. Today it is\nfrequently stated as the number of computations available per unit of cost.\nGeneralized to the appropriate doubling time, it describes the rate of\nadvancement in many technologies. A frequently noted competitor to Moore's law\nis known as Wright's law, which has aeronautical roots. Wright's law (also\ncalled power law, experience curve and Henderson's law) relates some quality of\na manufactured unit (for Wright, airplanes) to the volume of units\nmanufactured. The Wright's law equation expresses the idea that performance -\nprice or a quality metric - improves according to a power of the number\nproduced, or alternatively stated, improves by a constant percentage for every\ndoubling of the total number produced.\n  Does exploration of outer space conform to Moore's law or Wright's law-like\nbehavior? Our results below are broadly consistent with these laws. This is\ntrue for many technologies. Although the two laws can make somewhat different\npredictions, Sahal found that they converge to the same predictions when\nmanufacturing volume increases exponentially over time. When space exploration\ntransitions into an independent commercial sector, as many people hope and\nexpect, spacecraft technology will then likely enter an era of unambiguously\nexponential advancement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2021 03:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Berleant", "Daniel", ""], ["Kodali", "Venkat", ""], ["Segall", "Richard", ""], ["Aboudja", "Hyacinthe", ""], ["Howell", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.10001", "submitter": "Evan Hurwitz", "authors": "Evan Hurwitz, George Cevora", "title": "Forecasting performance of workforce reskilling programmes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Estimating success rates for programmes aiming to reintegrate theunemployed\ninto the workforce is essential for good stewardship of publicfinances.
