Reduction in the supply of credit affects firms as debtor, and failure\nof a firm influences banks as creditor. To quantify the dependency and\ninfluence between banks and firms, we propose a set of scores of banks and\nfirms, which can be calculated by solving an eigenvalue problem determined by\nthe weight of the credit network.
