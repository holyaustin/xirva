Analysis of resilient market performance, therefore, becomes\nuseful for investors. From a systems perspective, this paper proposes a novel\nfunction-based resilience metric that considers the effect of two\nfault-tolerance thresholds: the Robustness Range (RR) and the Elasticity\nThreshold (ET). We examined the consecutive resilience cycles and their\ndynamics in the performance of two stock markets, NASDAQ and SSE. The proposed\nmetric was also compared with three well-documented resilience models. The\nresults showed that this new metric could satisfactorily quantify the\ntime-varying resilience cycles in the multi-cycle volatile performance of stock\nmarkets while also being more feasible in comparative analysis. Furthermore,\nanalysis of dynamics revealed that those consecutive resilience cycles in\nmarket performance were distributed non-linearly, following a power-law\nbehavior in the upper tail. Finally, sensitivity tests demonstrated the\nlarge-value resilience cycles were relatively sensitive to changes in RR. In\npractice, RR could indicate investors' psychological capability to withstand\ndownturns. It supports the observation that perception on the market's\nresilient responses may vary among investors.
