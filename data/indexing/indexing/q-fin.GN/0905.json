The conditional expected returns exhibit\nfaster-than-exponential acceleration decorated by accelerating oscillations,\ncalled \"log-periodic power law.\" Tests on residuals show a remarkable low rate\n(0.2%) of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the\nS&P500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly\nidentifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, in Aug. 1998 and the\nITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests\nconfirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides\na diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before Oct.\n1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4 years\nearlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined\nLPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the\nlast two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical\npreference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction\nwith Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2009 17:48:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "L.", ""], ["E", "Ren R.", ""], ["Sornette", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.0129", "submitter": "Alexander Gorban", "authors": "A.

This model is quite simple and can be treated\nanalytically since the buyers evaluate the quality of a certain good taking\ninto account only the quality of the last good purchased plus her perceptive\ncapacity \\beta . As a consequence the system evolves according to a stationary\nMarkovian stochastic process. The value of a product offered by the seller\nincreases with quality according to the exponent \\alpha, which is a measure of\ntechnology. It incorporates all the technological capacity of production\nsystems such as education, scientific development and techniques that change\nthe productivity growth. The technological level plays an important role to\nexplain how the asymmetry of information may affect the market evolution in\nthis model. We observe that, for high technological levels, the market can\ncontrol adverse selection. The model allows us to compute the maximum\nasymmetric information degree before market collapse. Below this critical point\nthe market evolves during a very limited time and then dies out completely.\nWhen \\beta is closer to 1(symmetric information), the market becomes more\nprofitable for high quality goods, although high and low quality markets\ncoexist. All the results we obtained from the model are analytical and the\nmaximum asymmetric information level is a consequence of an ergodicity\nbreakdown in the process of quality evaluation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2009 19:34:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tilles", "Paulo F.

These assumptions lead to a Langevin model with\nmultiplicative noise, from which we derive a Fokker-Planck (FP) equation for\nthe income probability density function (IPDF) and its variation in time.
