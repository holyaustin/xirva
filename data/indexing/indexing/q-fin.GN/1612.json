Analyzing polls data, we find that over the last\nthree years in a group of EU countries affected by the recent migrant crisis,\nthe percentage of right-wing (RW) populist voters in a given country depends on\nthe prevalence of immigrants in this country's population and the total\nimmigration inflow into the entire EU. The latter is likely due to the EU\nresembling a supranational state, where the lack of inner borders causes that\n\"somebody else's problem\" easily turns into \"my problem\". We further find that\nthe increase in the percentage of RW voters substantially surpasses the\nimmigration inflow, implying that if this process continues, RW populism may\ndemocratically prevail and eventually lead to a demise of globalization.

Although several\nstudies have examined the association between presidential elections and stock\nreturns, very little attention has been given to the impacts of elections and\nelection induced uncertainty on stock markets. This paper explores, at sectoral\nlevel, the uncertain information hypothesis (UIH) as a means of explaining the\nreaction of markets to the arrival of unanticipated information. This\nhypothesis postulates that political uncertainty is greater prior to the\nelections (relative to pre-election period) but is resolved once the outcome of\nthe elections is determined (relative to post-election period). To this end, we\nadopt an event-study methodology that examines abnormal return behavior around\nthe election date. We show that collapsing stock returns around the election\nresult is reversed by positive abnormal return on the next day, except some\ncases where we note negative responses following the vote count. Although\nTrump's win plunges US into uncertain future, positive reactions of abnormal\nreturn are found. Therefore, our results do not support the UIH hypothesis.\nBesides, the effect of political uncertainty is sector-specific. While some\nsectors emerged winners (healthcare, oil and gas, real estate, defense,\nfinancials and consumer goods and services), others took the opposite route\n(technology and utilities).

These\nreports, the so-called \"Form 10-Ks,\" contain a characterization of a company's\nfinancial performance and its risks, including the regulatory environment in\nwhich a company operates. In this paper, we analyze over 4.5 million references\nto U.S. Federal Acts and Agencies contained within these reports to build a\nmean-field measurement of temperature and diversity in this regulatory\necosystem, where companies are organisms inhabiting the regulatory environment.\nWhile individuals across the political, economic, and academic world frequently\nrefer to trends in this regulatory ecosystem, far less attention has been paid\nto supporting such claims with large-scale, longitudinal data. In this paper,\nwe document an increase in the regulatory energy per filing, i.e., a warming\n\"temperature.\" We also find that the diversity of the regulatory ecosystem has\nbeen increasing over the past two decades, as measured by the dimensionality of\nthe regulatory space and distance between the \"regulatory bitstrings\" of\ncompanies. These findings support the claim that regulatory activity and\ncomplexity are increasing, and this measurement framework contributes an\nimportant step towards improving academic and policy discussions around legal\ncomplexity and regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2016 18:51:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 22:55:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["Bommarito", "Michael J", "II"], ["Katz", "Daniel Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09553", "submitter": "Demian Pouzo", "authors": "Ulrike Malmendier and Demian Pouzo and Victoria Vanasco", "title": "Investor Experiences and Financial Market Dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.EC q-fin.GN q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  How do macro-financial shocks affect investor behavior and market dynamics?\nRecent evidence on experience effects suggests a long-lasting influence of\npersonally experienced outcomes on investor beliefs and investment, but also\nsignificant differences across older and younger generations. We formalize\nexperience-based learning in an OLG model, where different cross-cohort\nexperiences generate persistent heterogeneity in beliefs, portfolio choices,\nand trade. The model allows us to characterize a novel link between investor\ndemographics and the dependence of prices on past dividends, while also\ngenerating known features of asset prices, such as excess volatility and return\npredictability. The model produces new implications for the cross-section of\nasset holdings, trade volume, and investors' heterogenous responses to recent\nfinancial crises, which we show to be in line with the data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 18:37:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2019 20:01:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 01:34:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Malmendier", "Ulrike", ""], ["Pouzo", "Demian", ""], ["Vanasco", "Victoria", ""]]}]
