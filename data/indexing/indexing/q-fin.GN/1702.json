One of the possible approaches to this problem is to\nenrich these methods (which are almost exclusively based on statistical\nalgorithms) with some intrinsically deterministic add-ons borrowed from\ntheoretical physics. The idea proposed in this note is to divide the set of Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) characterizing an individual business into the\nfollowing two distinct groups: 1) highly volatile KPIs mostly determined by\nexternal factors and thus poorly controllable by a business, and 2) relatively\nstable KPIs identified and controlled by a business itself. It looks like,\nwhereas the dynamics of the first group can, as before, be studied using\nstatistical methods, for studying and optimizing the dynamics of the second\ngroup it is better to use deterministic principles similar to the Principle of\nLeast Action of classical mechanics. Such approach opens a whole bunch of new\ninteresting opportunities in business analytics, with numerous practical\napplications including diverse aspects of operational and strategic planning,\nchange management, ROI optimization, etc. Uncovering and utilizing dynamical\nlaws of the controllable KPIs would also allow one to use dynamical invariants\nof business as the most natural sets of risk and performance indicators, and\nfacilitate business growth by using effects of parametric resonance with\nnatural business cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Feb 2017 04:11:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ushveridze", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.04642", "submitter": "Zhibin Niu", "authors": "Dawei Cheng, Zhibin Niu, Yi Tu, Liqing Zhang", "title": "Prediction defaults for networked-guarantee loans", "comments": "6 pages,7 figures", "journal-ref": "2018 24th International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)", "doi": "10.1109/ICPR.2018.8545474", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.SI q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Networked-guarantee loans may cause the systemic risk related concern of the\ngovernment and banks in China. The prediction of default of enterprise loans is\na typical extremely imbalanced prediction problem, and the networked-guarantee\nmake this problem more difficult to solve. Since the guaranteed loan is a debt\nobligation promise, if one enterprise in the guarantee network falls into a\nfinancial crisis, the debt risk may spread like a virus across the guarantee\nnetwork, even lead to a systemic financial crisis. In this paper, we propose an\nimbalanced network risk diffusion model to forecast the enterprise default risk\nin a short future. Positive weighted k-nearest neighbors (p-wkNN) algorithm is\ndeveloped for the stand-alone case -- when there is no default contagious; then\na data-driven default diffusion model is integrated to further improve the\nprediction accuracy. We perform the empirical study on a real-world three-years\nloan record from a major commercial bank. The results show that our proposed\nmethod outperforms conventional credit risk methods in terms of AUC. In\nsummary, our quantitative risk evaluation model shows promising prediction\nperformance on real-world data, which could be useful to both regulators and\nstakeholders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 15:00:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 10:17:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2020 07:45:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2020 08:18:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 6 Jun 2020 12:35:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cheng", "Dawei", ""], ["Niu", "Zhibin", ""], ["Tu", "Yi", ""], ["Zhang", "Liqing", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07423", "submitter": "Lixin Zhong", "authors": "Li-Xin Zhong, Wen-Juan Xu, Yun-Xin He, Chen-Yang Zhong, Rong-Da Chen,\n  Tian Qiu, Yong-Dong Shi, Fei Ren", "title": "A generalized public goods game with coupling of individual ability and\n  project benefit", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2017.05.025", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Facing a heavy task, any single person can only make a limited contribution\nand team cooperation is needed. As one enjoys the benefit of the public goods,\nthe potential benefits of the project are not always maximized and may be\npartly wasted. By incorporating individual ability and project benefit into the\noriginal public goods game, we study the coupling effect of the four\nparameters, the upper limit of individual contribution, the upper limit of\nindividual benefit, the needed project cost and the upper limit of project\nbenefit on the evolution of cooperation. Coevolving with the individual-level\ngroup size preferences, an increase in the upper limit of individual benefit\npromotes cooperation while an increase in the upper limit of individual\ncontribution inhibits cooperation. The coupling of the upper limit of\nindividual contribution and the needed project cost determines the critical\npoint of the upper limit of project benefit, where the equilibrium frequency of\ncooperators reaches its highest level. Above the critical point, an increase in\nthe upper limit of project benefit inhibits cooperation. The evolution of\ncooperation is closely related to the preferred group-size distribution.
