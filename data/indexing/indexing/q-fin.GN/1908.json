We analyze this model from a game-theoretic point of view. Every\nfirm is a rational agent in a directed graph that has an incentive to allocate\npayments in order to clear as much of its debt as possible. Each edge is\nweighted and describes a liability between the firms. We consider several\nvariants of the game that differ in the permissible payment strategies. We\nstudy the existence and computational complexity of pure Nash and strong\nequilibria, and we provide bounds on the (strong) prices of anarchy and\nstability for a natural notion of social welfare. Our results highlight the\npower of financial regulation -- if payments of insolvent firms can be\ncentrally assigned, a socially optimal strong equilibrium can be found in\npolynomial time. In contrast, worst-case strong equilibria can be a factor of\n$\\Omega(n)$ away from optimal, and, in general, computing a best response is an\nNP-hard problem. For less permissible sets of strategies, we show that pure\nequilibria might not exist, and deciding their existence as well as computing\nthem if they exist constitute NP-hard problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2019 16:38:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Sep 2019 17:16:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bertschinger", "Nils", ""], ["Hoefer", "Martin", ""], ["Schmand", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.02591", "submitter": "Mark Weber", "authors": "Mark Weber, Giacomo Domeniconi, Jie Chen, Daniel Karl I.

The advent\nof cryptocurrency has introduced an intriguing paradox: pseudonymity allows\ncriminals to hide in plain sight, but open data gives more power to\ninvestigators and enables the crowdsourcing of forensic analysis. Meanwhile\nadvances in learning algorithms show great promise for the AML toolkit. In this\nworkshop tutorial, we motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety\nwith that of financial inclusion. We contribute the Elliptic Data Set, a time\nseries graph of over 200K Bitcoin transactions (nodes), 234K directed payment\nflows (edges), and 166 node features, including ones based on non-public data;\nto our knowledge, this is the largest labelled transaction data set publicly\navailable in any cryptocurrency. We share results from a binary classification\ntask predicting illicit transactions using variations of Logistic Regression\n(LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Convolutional\nNetworks (GCN), with GCN being of special interest as an emergent new method\nfor capturing relational information. The results show the superiority of\nRandom Forest (RF), but also invite algorithmic work to combine the respective\npowers of RF and graph methods. Lastly, we consider visualization for analysis\nand explainability, which is difficult given the size and dynamism of\nreal-world transaction graphs, and we offer a simple prototype capable of\nnavigating the graph and observing model performance on illicit activity over\ntime. With this tutorial and data set, we hope to a) invite feedback in support\nof our ongoing inquiry, and b) inspire others to work on this societally\nimportant challenge.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2019 22:10:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Mark", ""], ["Domeniconi", "Giacomo", ""], ["Chen", "Jie", ""], ["Weidele", "Daniel Karl I.", ""], ["Bellei", "Claudio", ""], ["Robinson", "Tom", ""], ["Leiserson", "Charles E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.03206", "submitter": "Sebastian Frischbier", "authors": "Sebastian Frischbier, Mario Paic, Alexander Echler, Christian Roth", "title": "Managing the Complexity of Processing Financial Data at Scale -- an\n  Experience Report", "comments": "12 pages, 2 figures, to be published in the proceedings of the 10th\n  Complex Systems Design & Management conference (CSD&M'19) by Springer", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/978-3-030-34843-4_2", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB cs.DC q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial markets are extremely data-driven and regulated.
