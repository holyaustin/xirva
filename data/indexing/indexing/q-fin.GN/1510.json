We study the\ninterplay of power, satisfaction and frustration in distribution,\nconcentration, and inequality of wealth. Our framework allows us to compare\nsubjective measures of frustration and satisfaction to collective measures of\nfairness in wealth distribution, such as the Lorenz curve and the Gini index.\nWe find that a completely libertarian, law-of-the-jungle setting, where every\nagent can acquire wealth from, or lose wealth to, anybody else invariably leads\nto a complete polarization of the distribution of wealth vs. opportunity. The\npicture is however dramatically modified when hard constraints are imposed over\nagents, and they are limited to share wealth with neighbors on a network. We\nthen propose an out of equilibrium dynamics {\\it of} the networks, based on a\ncompetition between power and frustration in the decision-making of agents that\nleads to network coevolution. We show that the ratio of power and frustration\ncontrols different dynamical regimes separated by kinetic transitions and\ncharacterized by drastically different values of the indices of equality. The\ninterplay of power and frustration leads to the emergence of three\nself-organized social classes, lower, middle, and upper class, whose\ninteractions drive a cyclical regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 19:37:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mahault", "Benoit", ""], ["Saxena", "Avadh", ""], ["Nisoli", "Cristiano", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02752", "submitter": "Ivan Kitov O.", "authors": "Ivan Kitov, Oleg Kitov", "title": "Gender income disparity in the USA: analysis and dynamic modelling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze and develop a quantitative model describing the evolution of\npersonal income distribution, PID, for males and females in the U.S. between\n1930 and 2014. The overall microeconomic model, which we introduced ten years\nago, accurately predicts the change in mean income as a function of age as well\nas the dependence on age of the portion of people distributed according to the\nPareto law. As a result, we have precisely described the change in Gini ratio\nsince the start of income measurements in 1947. The overall population consists\nof two genders, however, which have different income distributions. The\ndifference between incomes earned by male and female population has been\nexperiencing dramatic changes over time. Here, we model the internal dynamics\nof men and women PIDs separately and then describe their relative contribution\nto the overall PID. Our original model is refined to match all principal\ngender-dependent observations. We found that women in the U.S. are deprived of\nhigher job positions. This is the cause of the long term income inequality\nbetween males and females in the U.S. It is unjust to women and has a negative\neffect on real economic growth. Women have been catching up since the 1960s and\nthat improves the performance of the U.S. economy. It will take decades,\nhowever, to full income equality between genders. There are no new defining\nparameters included in the model except the critical age, when people start to\nlose their incomes, was split into two critical ages for low-middle incomes and\nthe highest incomes, which obey a power law distribution. Such an extension\nbecomes necessary in order to match the observation that the female population\nin the earlier 1960s was practically not represented in the highest incomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2015 18:07:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kitov", "Ivan", ""], ["Kitov", "Oleg", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.02754", "submitter": "Ivan Kitov O.", "authors": "Ivan Kitov, Oleg Kitov", "title": "How universal is the law of income distribution?

We have\nrevealed precise match in the shape of two age-dependent features of the PID:\nmean income and the portion of people with the highest incomes (2 to 5% of the\nworking age population). Because of the U.S. economic superiority, as expressed\nby real GDP per head, the curves of mean income and the portion of rich people\ncurrently observed in three chasing countries one-to-one reproduce the curves\nmeasured in the USA 15 to 25 years before. This result of cross country\ncomparison implies that the driving force behind the PID evolution is the same\nin four studied countries. Our parsimonious microeconomic model, which links\nthe change in PID only with one exogenous parameter - real GDP per capita,\naccurately predicts all studied features for the U.S. This study proves that\nour quantitative model, based on one first-order differential equation, is\nuniversal.

The modeling involves the construction of a computational\nalgorithm, which includes citizens, bounded into families; firms and\ngovernments; all of them interacting in markets for goods, labor and real\nestate. The real estate market allows families to move to dwellings with higher\nquality or lower price when the families capitalize property values. The goods\nmarket allows consumers to search on a flexible number of firms choosing by\nprice and proximity. The labor market entails a matching process between firms\n(location) and candidates (qualification). The government may be configured\ninto one, four or seven distinct sub-national governments. The role of\ngovernment is to collect taxes on the value added of firms in its territory and\ninvest the taxes into higher levels of quality of life for residents.
