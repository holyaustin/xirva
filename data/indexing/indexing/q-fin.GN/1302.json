At the first, the axiomatic financial arithmetic theory\nwas proposed by Peccati who has introduced the axiomatic definition of the\nfuture value. This theory has been extensively developed in past years.\nProposed approach to financial arithmetic is based on the financial flow\nutility concept. This utility function is defined as linear extension of\nmulticriteria comparison determined by the time preference and the capital\npreference. Then the present value is equal to financial flow utility.\nTherefore, the law of diminishing marginal wealth utility has been considered\nas additional feature of the present value. The future value is defined as the\ninverse of utility function. This definition is a generalization of the Peccati\none. The net present value is given as the unique additive extension of\nfinancial flow utility. Moreover, the synergy effect and the diversification\neffect will be discussed. At the end, the axiomatic present value definition\nwill be specified in three ways.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Feb 2013 21:36:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Piasecki", "Krzysztof", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0538", "submitter": "Krzysztof Maciej Piasecki", "authors": "Krzysztof Piasecki", "title": "On return rate implied by behavioural present value", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The future value of a security is described as a random variable.\nDistribution of this random variable is the formal image of risk uncertainty.\nOn the other side, any present value is defined as a value equivalent to the\ngiven future value.

The loans were part of a general government policy which used\nindexation to the CPI to address the economic consequences of the\nhyperinflation. Although most other forms of indexation were subsequently\nremoved, loan indexation has remained, and these loans now comprise the\nmajority of mortgages in Iceland.

On\nthe contrary: our research shows that the bookkeeping treatment of these loans\nwithin the banking system directly contributes to the banking system's monetary\nexpansion rate, and hence index-linked loans act to increase the inflation rate\nto which they are linked, rather than reducing it. They consequently create a\npositive feedback loop within the banking system's monetary regulation\noperating directly on the money supply. Since the feedback into monetary\nexpansion only occurs at annual CPI rates above approximately 2%, we suggest\none solution would be to stabilise the money supply to 0% growth, and we\nexplore some ways this could be achieved by modifying the Basel Regulatory\nFramework within the Icelandic Banking System.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Feb 2013 19:43:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Apr 2014 01:08:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Mallett", "Jacky", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.4595", "submitter": "Chris Kenyon", "authors": "Chris Kenyon and Andrew Green", "title": "Collateral-Enhanced Default Risk", "comments": "12 pages; 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Changes in collateralization have been implicated in significant default (or\nnear-default) events during the financial crisis, most notably with AIG.

Every ballooning A of a structure of linearly\nordered set I is a set of preferences whose preference relation (not\nnecessarily complete) is negatively transitive and every such structure on a\ngiven set A can be obtained by ballooning of certain structure of a linearly\nordered set I, intrinsically encoded in A. In other words, the difference\nbetween linearity and negative transitivity is constituted of balloons. As a\nconsequence of this characterization, under certain natural topological\nconditions on the set of preferences A furnished with its interval topology,\nthe existence of a continuous generalized utility function on A is proved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Feb 2013 16:57:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2013 11:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Droganova", "Maria Viktorovna", ""], ["Iliev", "Valentin Vankov", ""]]}]
