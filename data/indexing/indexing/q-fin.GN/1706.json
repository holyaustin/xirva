A large fraction (~40%) of firms with\nrelatively small in- or out-degrees have customers or suppliers solely from\nwithin their own communities, indicating interactions of a highly local nature.\nThe interaction strengths between communities as measured by the\ninter-community link weights follow a highly heterogeneous distribution.

The energy transition thus discourages the\ninvestments that are required for its own harmonious expansion. To investigate\nhow this paradox can be overcome, we argue that, under certain assumptions,\nfuture electricity prices are rather accurately modeled from the residual load\nobtained by subtracting non-flexible productions from the load. Armed with the\nresulting economic indicator, we investigate future revenues for European power\nplants with various degree of flexibility. We find that, if neither carbon\ntaxes nor fuel prices change, flexible productions would be financially\nrewarded better and sooner if the energy transition proceeds faster but at more\nor less constant total production, i.e. by reducing the production of thermal\npower plants at the same rate as the RES production increases. Less flexible\nproductions, on the other hand, would see their revenue grow more moderately.\nOur results indicate that a faster energy transition with a quicker withdrawal\nof thermal power plants would reward flexible productions faster.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 14:55:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2018 09:06:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Pagnier", "Laurent", ""], ["Jacquod", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01666", "submitter": "Laurent Pagnier", "authors": "Laurent Pagnier and Philippe Jacquod", "title": "A predictive pan-European economic and production dispatch model for the\n  energy transition in the electricity sector", "comments": "6 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "2017 IEEE Manchester PowerTech", "doi": "10.1109/PTC.2017.7980982", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The energy transition is well underway in most European countries. It has a\ngrowing impact on electric power systems as it dramatically modifies the way\nelectricity is produced. To ensure a safe and smooth transition towards a\npan-European electricity production dominated by renewable sources, it is of\nparamount importance to anticipate how production dispatches will evolve, to\nunderstand how increased fluctuations in power generations can be absorbed at\nthe pan-European level and to evaluate where the resulting changes in power\nflows will require significant grid upgrades. To address these issues, we\nconstruct an aggregated model of the pan-European transmission network which we\ncouple to an optimized, few-parameter dispatch algorithm to obtain time- and\ngeographically-resolved production profiles. We demonstrate the validity of our\ndispatch algorithm by reproducing historical production time series for all\npower productions in fifteen different European countries. Having calibrated\nour model in this way, we investigate future production profiles at later\nstages of the energy transition - determined by planned future production\ncapacities - and the resulting interregional power flows. We find that large\npower fluctuations from increasing penetrations of renewable sources can be\nabsorbed at the pan-European level via significantly increased electricity\nexchanges between different countries. We identify where these increased\nexchanges will require additional power transfer capacities. We finally\nintroduce a physically-based economic indicator which allows to predict future\nfinancial conditions in the electricity market. We anticipate new economic\nopportunities for dam hydroelectricity and pumped-storage plants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 09:18:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Pagnier", "Laurent", ""], ["Jacquod", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.02795", "submitter": "Thai Pham", "authors": "Thai T.
