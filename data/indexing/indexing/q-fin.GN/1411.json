Indeed, in the short run, changes in\nsocial capital predict a much smaller portion of the changes in subjective\nwell-being than over longer periods.

In recent years, different non-parametric estimators of\nthe variation of a log-price process have appeared. These were developed by\nmany authors and were motivated by the existence of complete records of price\ndata. Among them are the realized quadratic (co-)variation which is perhaps the\nmost well known example, providing a consistent estimator of the integrated\n(co-)volatility when the logarithmic price process is continuous. Limit results\nsuch as the weak law of large numbers or the central limit theorem have been\nproved in different contexts. In this paper, we propose to study the large\ndeviation properties of realized (co-)volatility (i.e., when the number of high\nfrequency observations in a fixed time interval increases to infinity. More\nspecifically, we consider a bivariate model with synchronous observation\nschemes and correlated Brownian motions of the following form: $dX\\_{\\ell,t} =\n\\sigma\\_{\\ell,t}dB\\_{\\ell,t}+b\\_{\\ell}(t,\\omega)dt$ for $\\ell=1,2$, where\n$X\\_{\\ell}$ denotes the log-price, we are concerned with the large deviation\nestimation of the vector $V\\_t^n(X)=(Q\\_{1,t}^n(X), Q\\_{2,t}^n(X),\nC\\_{t}^n(X))$ where $Q\\_{\\ell,t}^n(X)$ and $C\\_{t}^n(X)$ represente the\nestimator of the quadratic variational processes\n$Q\\_{\\ell,t}=\\int\\_0^t\\sigma\\_{\\ell,s}^2ds$ and the integrated covariance\n$C\\_t=\\int\\_0^t\\sigma\\_{1,s}\\sigma\\_{2,s}\\rho\\_sds$ respectively, with\n$\\rho\\_t=cov(B\\_{1,t}, B\\_{2,t})$. Our main motivation is to improve upon the\nexisting limit theorems. Our large deviations results can be used to evaluate\nand approximate tail probabilities of realized (co-)volatility. As an\napplication we provide the large deviation for the standard dependence measures\nbetween the two assets returns such as the realized regression coefficients up\nto time $t$, or the realized correlation. Our study should contribute to the\nrecent trend of research on the (co-)variance estimation problems, which are\nquite often discussed in high-frequency financial data analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Nov 2014 09:42:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Djellout", "Hac\u00e8ne", ""], ["Guillin", "Arnaud", ""], ["Samoura", "Yacouba", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.7593", "submitter": "Rafael Diaz", "authors": "Rafael Diaz, Laura Gomez", "title": "Indirect Influences in International Trade", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Networks and Heterogenous Media 10 (2015) 149-165", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SI physics.soc-ph q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We address the problem of gauging the influence exerted by a given country on\nthe global trade market from the viewpoint of complex networks.
