Over history money\nhas become increasingly abstract, it used to be hardware, gold coins and the\nlike, now it is mostly software, data structures located in banks. Here I\npropose the logical conclusion of the abstraction of money: to use as money the\nmost general form of information - computer programs. The key advantage that\nusing programs for money (program-money) adds to the technology of money is\nagency. Program-money is active and thereby can fully participate in economics\nas economic agents. I describe the three basic technologies required to\nimplement program-money: computational languages/logics to unambiguously\ndescribe the actions and interactions of program-money; computational\ncryptography to ensure that only the correct actions and interactions are\nperformed; and a distributed computational environment in which the money can\nexecute. I demonstrate that most of the technology for program-money has\nalready been developed. The adoption of program-money transfers responsibility\nfrom human economic agents to money itself and has great potential economic\nadvantages over the current passive form of money. For example in\nmicroeconomics, adding agency to money will simplify the exchange of ownership,\nensure money is only used legally, automate the negotiation and forming of\ncontracts, etc. Similar advantages occur in macroeconomics, where for example\nthe control of the money supply could be transferred from central banks to\nmoney. It is also possible to envisage money that is not owned by any external\nhuman agent or corporation. One motivation for this is to force economic\nsystems to behave more rationally and/or more like a specific economic theory,\nthereby increasing the success of economic forecasting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 15:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["King", "Ross D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.01365", "submitter": "Kazuhiko Nishimura", "authors": "Jiyoung Kim, Satoshi Nakano, Kazuhiko Nishimura", "title": "Multifactor CES General Equilibrium: Models and Applications", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.econmod.2017.01.024", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sector specific multifactor CES elasticity of substitution and the\ncorresponding productivity growths are jointly measured by regressing the\ngrowths of factor-wise cost shares against the growths of factor prices.

Yet despite steady advances in our\nunderstanding of evolution, what drives innovation remains elusive. On the one\nhand, organizations invest heavily in systematic strategies to drive\ninnovation. On the other, historical analysis and individual experience suggest\nthat serendipity plays a significant role in the discovery process. To unify\nthese two perspectives, we analyzed the mathematics of innovation as a search\nprocess for viable designs across a universe of building blocks. We then tested\nour insights using historical data from language, gastronomy and technology. By\nmeasuring the number of makeable designs as we acquire more components, we\nobserved that the relative usefulness of different components is not fixed, but\ncross each other over time. When these crossovers are unanticipated, they\nappear to be the result of serendipity. But when we can predict crossovers\nahead of time, they offer an opportunity to strategically increase the growth\nof our product space.

Our results reveal that such CD-dynamics reduces the threshold level of\nconsumption of basic necessities, suggesting a possible dietary transition in\nterms of lower saturation level of food-grain consumption.
