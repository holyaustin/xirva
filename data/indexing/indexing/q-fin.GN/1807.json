Governments can drive research,\nprovide environmental regulation, and accelerate global development, but the\nnecessary low-carbon investments of 2-3% GDP have yet to materialise. A new\nstrategy to tackle climate change through consumer and government action is\noutlined. It relies on ethical investments for sustainable development and\nlow-carbon energy, and a voluntarily financed low-carbon fund for adaptation to\nclimate change. Together these enable a global response through individual\nactions and investments. With OECD savings exceeding 5% of disposable household\nincome, ethical savings alone have considerable potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 19:59:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2018 08:28:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Webster", "Anthony J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.06546", "submitter": "Gayatri Pradhan", "authors": "Gayatri Pradhan", "title": "Analysis of Advisor Portfolio using Multivariate Time Series and Cosine\n  Similarity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In mutual fund, an investment adviser gives advice to clients about investing\nin securities such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or exchange traded funds.\nSome investment advisers manage portfolios of securities.

We argue that extreme value statistics provide the answer.\nWe demonstrate that the level and timing of investments allow to be forecasting\nsmall and medium size enterprises (SME) performance, - at financial crisis\ntimes. The \"investment level\" is taken as the yearly total tangible asset\n(TTA). The financial/economic performance indicators defining growth are the\nsales or total assets variations; profitability is defined from returns on\ninvestments or returns on sales. Companies on the Italian Stock Exchange STAR\nMarket serve as example. It is found from the distributions extreme values that\noutlier companies (with positive performance) are those with the lowest but\ngrowing TTA. In contrast, the SME with low TTA, but which did not increase its\nTTA, before the crisis, became a negative outlier.

This leads researchers to\nconsider that the evolution of security prices is basically random, and, thus,\ninherently not predictable. We show that the evolution of security prices is\nnot a stochastic process but largely deterministic and governed by a physical\nlaw. The law takes the form of a physicomathematical theory centered around a\npurely mathematical function, unrelated to models and statistical methods. It\ncan be described as an \"isodense\" network of moving regression curves of an\norder greater than or equal to 1. The salient aspect of the function is that,\nwhen inputting a time series of any security into the function, new\nmathematical objects emerge spontaneously, and these objects exhibit the unique\nproperty of attracting and repelling the quantity. The graphical representation\nof the function is called a \"topological network\" due to the preeminence of\nshapes over metrics, and the emergent objects are called \"characteristic\nfigures\" (mainly \"cords\"). The attraction and repulsion of the price by the\ncords results in the price bouncing from cord to cord. Thus, the price has to\nbe considered as driven by the cords in a semi-deterministic manner (leaning\ntowards deterministic). With a function that describes the evolution of the\nprice, we now understand the reason behind each price movement and can also\npredict prices both qualitatively and quantitatively. The function is\nuniversal, does not rely on any fitting, and, due to its extreme sensitivity,\nreveals the hidden order in financial time series data that existing research\nnever uncovered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Jul 2018 20:22:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Aug 2018 16:42:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 02:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tzara", "Wally", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.10115", "submitter": "Sergey Shvydun", "authors": "Fuad Aleskerov, Natalia Meshcheryakova, Alisa Nikitina, Sergey Shvydun", "title": "Key Borrowers Detection by Long-Range Interactions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "National research university Higher School of economics.
