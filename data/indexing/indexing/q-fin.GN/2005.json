The complete historical bookkeeping and its\nwide availability opens up an unprecedented possibility, i.e. that of\nunderstanding the evolution of their network structure while gaining useful\ninsight on the relationships between user' behaviour and cryptocurrency pricing\nin exchange markets. In this contribution we review some of the most recent\nresults concerning the structural properties of Bitcoin Transaction Networks, a\ngeneric name referring to a set of different constructs: the Bitcoin Address\nNetwork, the Bitcoin User Network and the Bitcoin Lightning Network. The\npicture that emerges is that of system growing over time, which becomes\nincreasingly sparse and whose mesoscopic structural organization is\ncharacterised by the presence of an increasingly significant core-periphery\nstructure. Such a peculiar topology is matched by a highly uneven distribution\nof bitcoins, a result suggesting that Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly\ncentralized system at different levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:34:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2020 14:56:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Vallarano", "Nicol\u00f2", ""], ["Tessone", "Claudio", ""], ["Squartini", "Tiziano", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.00399", "submitter": "Martin Keller-Ressel", "authors": "Martin Keller-Ressel, Stephanie Nargang", "title": "The hyperbolic geometry of financial networks", "comments": "corrected typo in author's name", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on data from the European banking stress tests of 2014, 2016 and the\ntransparency exercise of 2018 we demonstrate for the first time that the latent\ngeometry of financial networks can be well-represented by geometry of negative\ncurvature, i.e., by hyperbolic geometry.

It is\ncontinuously widening, as the wealth of a relatively small group increases and,\ntherefore, the rest of the world shares a shrinking fraction of resources. This\nsituation has been predicted and denounced by economists and econophysicists.\nThe latter ones have widely used models of market dynamics which consider that\nwealth distribution is the result of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A\nsimple analogy relates the wealth in a society with the kinetic energy of the\nmolecules in a gas, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between\nthe molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems, thanks to\nthe equipartition of energy, the gas eventually arrives at an equilibrium\nstate, in many exchange models the economic system never equilibrates. Instead,\nit moves toward a \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all\nthe wealth of the society and the rest of agents shares zero or a very small\nfraction of the total wealth. Here we discuss two ways of avoiding the\n\"condensed\" state. On one hand, we consider a regulatory policy that favors the\npoorest agent in the exchanges, thus increasing the probability that the wealth\ngoes from the richest to the poorest agent. On the other hand, we study a tax\nsystem and its effects on wealth distribution. We compare the redistribution\nprocesses and conclude that complete control of the inequalities can be\nattained with simple regulations or interventions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2020 01:37:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Iglesias", "Jos\u00e9 Roberto", ""], ["Cardoso", "Ben-Hur Francisco", ""], ["Gon\u00e7alves", "Sebasti\u00e1n", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.06461", "submitter": "Amarendra Das", "authors": "Amarendra Das, Subhankar Mishra", "title": "India Growth Forecast for 2020-21", "comments": "9 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  COVID-19 has put a severe dent on the global economy and Indian Economy.\nInternational Monetary Fund has projected 1.9 percent for India.

Through case studies on China, US and Eurozone,\nthis study explores how those limited & partial exogenous inputs or abundant &\ncomprehensive exogenous inputs, a small set of most relevant exogenous inputs\nor a large set of exogenous inputs covering all major aspects of the macro\neconomy, whole area related exogenous inputs or both whole area and subdivision\narea related exogenous inputs specifically affect the forecasting performance\nof NARX neural networks for specific macroeconomic indicators or indices.\nThrough the case study on Russia this paper explores how the limited & most\nrelevant exogenous inputs set or the abundant & comprehensive exogenous inputs\nset specifically influences the prediction performance of those specific NARX\nneural networks for national goal setting. Finally, comparative studies on the\napplication of NARX neural networks for the forecasts of Global Competitiveness\nIndices (GCIs) of various economies are conducted, in order to explore whether\nthe specific NARX neural network trained on the basis of the GCI related data\nof some economies can make sufficiently accurate predictions about GCIs of\nother economies, and whether the specific NARX neural network trained on the\nbasis of the data of some type of economies can give more accurate predictions\nabout GCIs of the same type of economies than those of different type of\neconomies. Based on all of the above successful application, this paper\nprovides policy recommendations on applying fully trained NARX neural networks\nthat are assessed as qualified to assist or even replace the deductive and\ninductive abilities of the human brain in a variety of appropriate tasks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2020 12:23:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Tang", "Liyang", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.08759", "submitter": "Nusrat Jahan", "authors": "Nusrat Jahan", "title": "Determinants of Profitability of Banks: Evidence from Islamic Banks of\n  Bangladesh", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  This empirical study is conducted on randomly selected six Islamic banks of\nBangladesh.
