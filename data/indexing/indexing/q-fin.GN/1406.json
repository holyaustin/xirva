In the sector mode, the average correlation inside the sectors is\npositive, while that between the sectors is negative. Further, we explore the\ntime evolution of the interaction structure of the business sectors, and\nobserve that the local interaction structure changes dramatically during a\nfinancial bubble or crisis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 11:34:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "X.
