In a previous\nstudy using numerical simulations, we found that this scaling can be explained\nby both the money-transport model, where a firm (i.e. customer) distributes\nmoney to its out-edges (suppliers) in proportion to the in-degree of\ndestinations, and by the correlations among the Japanese inter-firm trading\nnetwork. However, in this previous study, we could not specifically identify\nwhat types of structure properties (or correlations) of the network determine\nthe 1.3 exponent. In the present study, we more clearly elucidate the\nrelationship between this nonlinear scaling and the network structure by\napplying mean-field approximation of the diffusion in a complex network to this\nmoney-transport model. Using theoretical analysis, we obtained the mean-field\nsolution of the model and found that, in the case of the Japanese firms, the\nscaling exponent of 1.3 can be determined from the power law of the average\ndegree of the nearest neighbours of the network with an exponent of -0.7.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 10:25:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 08:07:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Watanabe", "Hayafumi", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0301", "submitter": "Reza Farrahi Moghaddam", "authors": "Reza Farrahi Moghaddam, Fereydoun Farrahi Moghaddam, and Mohamed\n  Cheriet", "title": "IIGHGINT: A generalization to the modified GHG intensity universal\n  indicator toward a production/consumption insensitive border carbon tax", "comments": "17 pages, 3 figures.

In this\ncontext, the detection of explosive behaviors in the financial market and the\nimplementation of early warning diagnosis tests are of critical importance. The\nrecent increase in Brazilian housing prices has risen concerns that the\nBrazilian economy may have a speculative housing bubble. In the present paper,\nwe employ a recently proposed recursive unit root test in order to identify\npossible speculative bubbles in data from the Brazilian residential real-estate\nmarket. The empirical results show evidence for speculative price bubbles both\nin Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the two main Brazilian cities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 18:25:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["de Oliveira", "Marcelo M.", ""], ["Almeida", "Alexandre C.
