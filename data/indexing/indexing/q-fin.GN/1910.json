We emphasize two of his contributions to the financial industry that\nhave grown in importance over the years. One was the impetus given to the\nPrivate Equity industry and the use of LBOs. The second was the realization\nthat thorough research was the key to success, financial and otherwise. Perhaps\nan unintended consequence of the growth in junk bonds and tailored financing\nwas the growth of Silicon valley and technology powerhouses in the California\nbay area. Investors witnessed that there was a possibility for significant\nreturns and that financial success could be had due to the risk mitigation that\nMilken demonstrated by investing in portfolios of so called high risk and low\nprofile companies. We point out the current trend in many regions of the world,\nwhich is the birth of financial and technology firms and we suggest that\nfinding innovative ways of financing could be the key to the sustained growth\nof these eco-systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:38:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}]
