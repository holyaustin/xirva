Richard Nelson and Sidney Winter have argued that while\nevolutionary thinking was prevalent in prewar economics, the postwar\nNeoclassical school became almost entirely preoccupied with equilibrium\nconditions and their mathematical conditions. One of the problems with the\neconomic interpretation of firm selection through competition has been a weak\ngrasp on an incomplete scientific paradigm. As I.F. Price notes, \"The\nbiological metaphor has long lurked in the background of management theory\nlargely because the message of 'survival of the fittest' (usually wrongly\nattributed to Charles Darwin rather than Herbert Spencer) provides a seemingly\nnatural model for market competition (e.g. Alchian 1950, Merrell 1984,\nHenderson 1989, Moore 1993), without seriously challenging the underlying\nparadigms of what an organisation is.\" In this paper we examine the application\nof dynamic fitness landscape models to economic theory, particularly the theory\nof technology substitution, drawing on recent work by Kauffman, Arthur,\nMcKelvey, Nelson and Winter, and Windrum and Birchenhall. In particular we use\nProfessor Post's early work with John Holland on the genetic algorithm to\nexplain some of the key differences between static and dynamic approaches to\neconomic modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jul 2007 18:47:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Fellman", "Philip V.", ""], ["Post", "Jonathan Vos", ""], ["Wright", "Roxana", ""], ["Dasari", "Usha", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.1897", "submitter": "Esteban Guevara Hidalgo", "authors": "Esteban Guevara Hidalgo", "title": "Maximum Entropy, the Collective Welfare Principle and the Globalization\n  Process", "comments": "Econophysics Colloquium & Beyond (Ancona, Italy, 2007), 7 pages.\n  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:0705.0029,\n  arXiv:physics/0609088, arXiv:physics/0609245; text overlap with\n  arXiv:quant-ph/0510238", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although both systems analyzed are described through two theories apparently\ndifferent (quantum mechanics and game theory) it is shown that both are\nanalogous and thus exactly equivalents. The quantum analogue of the replicator\ndynamics is the von Neumann equation. Quantum mechanics could be used to\nexplain more correctly biological and economical processes. It could even\nencloses theories like games and evolutionary dynamics. We can take some\nconcepts and definitions from quantum mechanics and physics for the best\nunderstanding of the behavior of economics and biology. Also, we could maybe\nunderstand nature like a game in where its players compete for a common welfare\nand the equilibrium of the system that they are members. All the members of our\nsystem will play a game in which its maximum payoff is the equilibrium of the\nsystem. They act as a whole besides individuals like they obey a rule in where\nthey prefer to work for the welfare of the collective besides the individual\nwelfare. A system where its members are in Nash Equilibrium (or ESS) is exactly\nequivalent to a system in a maximum entropy state. A system is stable only if\nit maximizes the welfare of the collective above the welfare of the individual.\nIf it is maximized the welfare of the individual above the welfare of the\ncollective the system gets unstable an eventually collapses. The results of\nthis work shows that the \"globalization\" process has a behavior exactly\nequivalent to a system that is tending to a maximum entropy state and predicts\nthe apparition of big common markets and strong common currencies that will\nfind its \"equilibrium\" by decreasing its number until they get a state\ncharacterized by only one common currency and only one common market around the\nworld.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Jul 2007 22:29:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 23:48:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hidalgo", "Esteban Guevara", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.2341", "submitter": "Amac Herdagdelen", "authors": "Amac Herdagdelen, Haluk Bingol", "title": "A Cultural Market Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Modern Physics C Vol. 19, No. 2, 271-282\n  (2008)", "doi": "10.1142/S012918310801208X", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.CY nlin.AO physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  Social interactions and personal tastes shape our consumption behavior of\ncultural products.

Using a detailed analysis of the real data of the International\nTrade Network we argue that the scaled link weight distribution has an\napproximate log-normal distribution which remains robust over a period of 53\nyears. Another universal feature is observed in the power-law growth of the\ntrade strength with gross domestic product, the exponent being similar for all\ncountries. Using the 'rich-club' coefficient measure of the weighted networks\nit has been shown that the size of the rich-club controlling half of the\nworld's trade is actually shrinking. While the gravity law is known to describe\nwell the social interactions in the static networks of population migration,\ninternational trade, etc, here for the first time we studied a non-conservative\ndynamical model based on the gravity law which excellently reproduced many\nempirical features of the ITN.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2007 06:29:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Mar 2008 10:15:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bhattacharya", "K.", ""], ["Mukherjee", "G.", ""], ["Saramaki", "J.", ""], ["Kaski", "K.", ""], ["Manna", "S.
