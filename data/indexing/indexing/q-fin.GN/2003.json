The purpose\nof this work was the study of the viability of the introduction of new non food\ncrops in marginal areas of real farms. This study compares the profit margin\nand the energy and environmental performance of growing tall wheatgrass, in the\nmarginal area of a rainfed farm versus rye, the annual crop sowed traditionally\nin the marginal area of the farm. The cited farm owned 300 ha of which about 13\npercent was marginal. The methodology was based on the use of the profit margin\nof the crops as indicator for the economic assessment and Life Cycle Assessment\nLCA as technique for the energy and the environmental evaluations. Results of\nthe economic analysis showed a slight enhancement of the profit margin for tall\nwheatgrass 156 Euro ha-1 y-1 compared to rye 145 Euro ha-1 y-1. Environmental\nLCA was driven by CO2 fixation due to soil organic matter increase and reduced\ninputs consumption for tall wheatgrass that produced a Global Warming Potential\nGWP of -1.9 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 versus 1.6 Mg CO2 eq ha-1 y-1 obtained for rye.\nTall wheatgrass cultivation primary energy consumption was less than 40 percent\nof rye s consumption. According to the results achieved it was concluded that\ntall wheatgrass is better option than rye from the energy and the environmental\npoint of views and slight better option from the economic view. Considering\nthese results, monetarization of the CO2 eq reductions of tall wheatgrass\ncompared to rye is essential to improve its profit margin and promote the\nimplantation of this new crop in marginal areas of farms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2020 16:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Ciria", "Carlos S.", ""], ["Sastre", "Carlos M.", ""], ["Carrasco", "Juan", ""], ["Ciria", "Pilar", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13414", "submitter": "Michael Filletti", "authors": "Michael Filletti and Aaron Grech", "title": "Using News Articles and Financial Data to predict the likelihood of\n  bankruptcy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN cs.CL cs.SI", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Over the past decade, millions of companies have filed for bankruptcy.

The results of the comparison of the\nbanks studied by each country disclosed that the sustainability of the\nNorwegian and German banks business models is higher than in other counties.\nThe studied banks of Hungary and Spain came in second, the banks of the UK,\nPoland, and France ranked third, and finally, the Italian banks ranked fourth\nin the sustainability of their business models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2020 17:59:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Nosratabadi", "Saeed", ""], ["Pinter", "Gergo", ""], ["Mosavi", "Amir", ""], ["Semperger", "Sandor", ""]]}]
