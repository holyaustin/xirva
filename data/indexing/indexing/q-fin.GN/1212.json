We document strong evidence that, since the early\n1980s, consumption has been increasingly funded by smaller savings, booming\nfinancial profits, wealth extracted from house price appreciation and explosive\ndebt. This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was\nseen in the 1950s and 1960s. This transition, starting in the early 1980s, was\nfurther supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in\nfinancial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally. The\nresult has been a succession of bubbles and crashes, including the worldwide\nstock market bubble and great crash of October 1987, the savings and loans\ncrisis of the 1980s, the burst in 1991 of the enormous Japanese real estate and\nstock market bubbles, the emerging markets bubbles and crashes in 1994 and\n1997, the LTCM crisis of 1998, the dotcom bubble bursting in 2000, the recent\nhouse price bubbles, the financialization bubble via special investment\nvehicles, the stock market bubble, the commodity and oil bubbles and the debt\nbubbles, all developing jointly and feeding on each other. Rather than still\nhoping that real wealth will come out of money creation, we need fundamentally\nnew ways of thinking. In uncertain times, it is essential, more than ever, to\nthink in scenarios: what can happen in the future, and, what would be the\neffect on your wealth and capital? How can you protect against adverse\nscenarios?
