This process of market centralization/product\nstandardization culminated in the nineteenth century when London became the\nglobal centre for international trade finance and the sterling bill of exchange\nemerged as the most widely used trade finance instrument. The structure of the\ntrade finance market then evolved considerably following the First World War\nand disintegrated during the interwar de-globalization and Bretton Woods\nperiod.

To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the\nefficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved\nsignificantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being\nimmediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of\nsecurity fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial\nstablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound\nparticipants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2020 12:00:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Oct 2020 14:38:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2021 20:15:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2021 15:53:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 5 Apr 2021 07:52:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Perez", "Daniel", ""], ["Werner", "Sam M.", ""], ["Xu", "Jiahua", ""], ["Livshits", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.14278", "submitter": "Victor Olkhov", "authors": "Victor Olkhov", "title": "Price, Volatility and the Second-Order Economic Theory", "comments": "32 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce the price probability measure {\\eta}(p;t) that defines the mean\nprice p(1;t), mean square price p(2;t), price volatility {\\sigma}p2(t)and all\nprice n-th statistical moments p(n;t) as ratio of sums of n-th degree values\nC(n;t) and volumes U(n;t) of market trades aggregated during certain time\ninterval {\\Delta}.

Average sports-related costs of hosting\nare $12.0 billion. Non-sports-related costs are typically several times that.\nEvery Olympics since 1960 has run over budget, at an average of 172 percent in\nreal terms, the highest overrun on record for any type of megaproject. The\npaper tests theoretical statistical distributions against empirical data for\nthe costs of the Games, in order to explain the cost risks faced by host cities\nand nations. It is documented, for the first time, that cost and cost overrun\nfor the Games follow a power-law distribution. Olympic costs are subject to\ninfinite mean and variance, with dire consequences for predictability and\nplanning. We name this phenomenon \"regression to the tail\": it is only a matter\nof time until a new extreme event occurs, with an overrun larger than the\nlargest so far, and thus more disruptive and less plannable. The generative\nmechanism for the Olympic power law is identified as strong convexity prompted\nby six causal drivers: irreversibility, fixed deadlines, the Blank Check\nSyndrome, tight coupling, long planning horizons, and an Eternal Beginner\nSyndrome. The power law explains why the Games are so difficult to plan and\nmanage successfully, and why cities and nations should think twice before\nbidding to host. Based on the power law, two heuristics are identified for\nbetter decision making on hosting. Finally, the paper develops measures for\ngood practice in planning and managing the Games, including how to mitigate the\nextreme risks of the Olympic power law.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2020 20:56:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Flyvbjerg", "Bent", ""], ["Budzier", "Alexander", ""], ["Lunn", "Daniel", ""]]}]
