Our goal is to study the simplest possible model in\nwhich every term has a clear meaning and which demonstrates several key\nbehaviors. The main factors that enter are tendency of mean reversion to a\nstable value, speculative social response triggered by trend following and\nrandom fluctuations. The interplay of these three forces may lead to bubble\nformation and collapse. Numerical simulations show that the equation has\ndistinct regimes depending on the values of the parameters.

The unified picture of CVA and liquidity introduced by Morini &\nPrampolini 2010 has contributed to understanding this. However, there are two\nsignificant omissions for practical implementation that come from the same\nsource, i.e. positions not booked in usual position-keeping systems. The first\nomission is firm-level positions that change value upon firm default. An\nexample is Goodwill which is a line item on balance sheets and typically\nwritten down to zero on default. Another example would be firm Equity. The\nsecond omission relates to collateralized positions. When these positions are\nout of the money in future, which has a positive probability, they will require\nfunding that cannot be secured using the position itself. These contingent\nfuture funding positions are usually not booked in any position-keeping system.\nWe show here how to include these two types of positions and thus help to\ncomplete the unified picture of CVA and liquidity.\n  For a particular large complex financial institution that profited $2.5B from\nspread widening we show that including Goodwill would have resulted in a $4B\nloss under conservative assumptions. Whilst we cannot make a similar assessment\nfor its collateralized derivative portfolio we calculate both the funding costs\nand the CVA from own default for a range of swaps and find that CVA was a\npositive contribution in the examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Sep 2010 08:20:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3479", "submitter": "Kasper Larsen", "authors": "Peter Ove Christensen and Kasper Larsen", "title": "Incomplete Continuous-time Securities Markets with Stochastic Income\n  Volatility", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an incomplete continuous-time securities market with uncertainty generated\nby Brownian motions, we derive closed-form solutions for the equilibrium\ninterest rate and market price of risk processes.
