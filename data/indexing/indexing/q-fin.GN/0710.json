To do this, we introduce a parameter BETA that limits\nthe range on the wealth of a partner with which an agent is allowed to\ninteract. We show that this wealth-limited interaction is enough to distribute\nwealth in a purely power law trend. If the interaction is not wealth limited,\nthe wealth distribution is expectedly Gibbsian. The value of BETA where the\ntransition from a purely Gibbsian law to a purely power law distribution\nhappens depends on whether the choice of interaction partner is mutual nor not.\nFor a non-mutual choice, where the richer agent gets to decide, the transition\nhappens at BETA=1.0. For a mutual choice, the transition is at BETA= 0.60. In\norder to generate a mixed Gibbs-Pareto distribution, we apply another\nwealth-based rule that depends on the parameter w_limit. An agent whose wealth\nis below w_limit can choose any partner to interact with, while an agent whose\nwealth is above w_limit is subject to the wealth-limited range in his choice of\npartner. A Gibbs-Pareto distribution appears if both these wealth-based rules\nare applied.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Oct 2007 14:15:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Palima", "Marisciel L.", ""], ["David", "Eduardo J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.1139", "submitter": "Wan Ahmad Tajuddin Wan Abdullah", "authors": "Wan Ahmad Tajuddin Wan Abdullah and Sidiq Mohamad Khidzir (Universiti\n  Malaya)", "title": "Kinetic Economies", "comments": "Presented at the 10th Asia-Pacific Physics Conference, Pohang, South\n  Korea, August 2007", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN physics.soc-ph", "license": null, "abstract": "  We study a minimalist kinetic model for economies.

The paper begins with an axiomatic scheme for asset\npricing and interest rate theory in a discrete-time setting. The first axiom\nintroduces a \"risk-free\" asset, and the second axiom determines the\nintertemporal pricing relations that hold for dividend-paying assets. The\nnominal and real pricing kernels, in terms of which the price index can be\nexpressed, are then modelled by introducing a Sidrauski-type utility function\ndepending on (a) the aggregate rate of consumption, and (b) the aggregate rate\nof real liquidity benefit conferred by the money supply. Consumption and money\nsupply policies are chosen such that the expected joint utility obtained over a\nspecified time horizon is maximised subject to a budget constraint that takes\ninto account the \"value\" of the liquidity benefit associated with the money\nsupply. For any choice of the bivariate utility function, the resulting model\ndetermines a relation between the rate of consumption, the price level, and the\nmoney supply. The model also produces explicit expressions for the real and\nnominal pricing kernels, and hence establishes a basis for the valuation of\ninflation-linked securities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Oct 2007 17:28:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hughston", "Lane P.", ""], ["Macrina", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.3645", "submitter": "Fabio Clementi", "authors": "F.
