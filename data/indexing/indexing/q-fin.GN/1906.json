If we live in the Black-Scholes world, the brokers\nare presumably making arbitrage profits by shorting dynamically precise amounts\nof their clients' portfolios. First, we extend Fortune's (2000) application of\nMerton's (1974) no-arbitrage approach to allow for brokers that can only revise\ntheir hedges finitely many times during the term of the loan.

Closer inspection of the\ninferred maturity bins associated with the optimal maturity granularity reveals\nspecific economic functions, from liquidity intermediation to financing.\nCollapsing a network with multiple underlying maturity layers or extracting one\nsuch layer, common in economic research, is therefore not only an incomplete\nrepresentation of the ILN's mesoscale structure, but also conceals existing\neconomic functions. This holds important insights and opportunities for\ntheoretical and empirical studies on interbank market functioning, contagion,\nstability, and on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2019 14:22:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Van Soom", "Marnix", ""], ["Heuvel", "Milan van den", ""], ["Ryckebusch", "Jan", ""], ["Schoors", "Koen", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.08933", "submitter": "Aurelio Fernandez Bariviera", "authors": "Ignasi Merediz-Sol\\`a, Aurelio F.

Call money is assumed to supply itself perfectly\ninelastically, and to continuously reinvest all principal and interest. I show\nthat the relative size of the money market (that is, relative to the Kelly\nbankroll) is a martingale that nonetheless converges in probability to zero.\nThe margin loan interest rate is a submartingale that converges in mean square\nto the choke price $r_\\infty:=\\nu-\\sigma^2/2$, where $\\nu$ is the asymptotic\ncompound growth rate of the stock market and $\\sigma$ is its annual volatility.\nIn this environment, the gambler no longer beats the market asymptotically a.s.\nby an exponential factor (as he would under perfectly elastic supply). Rather,\nhe beats the market asymptotically with very high probability (think 98%) by a\nfactor (say 1.87, or 87% more final wealth) whose mean cannot exceed what the\nleverage ratio was at the start of the model (say, $2:1$). Although the ratio\nof the gambler's wealth to that of an equivalent buy-and-hold investor is a\nsubmartingale (always expected to increase), his realized compound growth rate\nconverges in mean square to $\\nu$. This happens because the equilibrium\nleverage ratio converges to $1:1$ in lockstep with the gradual rise of margin\nloan interest rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Jun 2019 17:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Garivaltis", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11023", "submitter": "Stefano Ugolini", "authors": "Stefano Ugolini (LEREPS)", "title": "The Coevolution of Banks and Corporate Securities Markets: The Financing\n  of Belgium's Industrial Take-Off in the 1830s", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Business History, Taylor & Francis (Routledge), 2019, pp.1-22", "doi": "10.1080/00076791.2019.1621293", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent developments in the literature on financial architecture suggest that\nbanks and markets not only coexist, but also coevolve in ways that are\nnon-neutral from the viewpoint of optimality.
