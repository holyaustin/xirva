In qBitcoin, the\ndouble-spending problem never happens and its security is guaranteed\ntheoretically by virtue of quantum information theory.

We find that in the context\nof the global conflicts that characterized the first half of the twentieth\ncentury and involved mainly large economies, the well-known negative scale\nrelation between volatility and size of countries is not significant.

They show that fundamental postulates of the\ndemographic and economic research are contradicted by data, even by precisely\nthe same data, which are used in this research. The generally accepted\npostulates are based on the incorrect understanding of hyperbolic\ndistributions, which characterise the historical growth of population and the\nhistorical economic growth. In particular, data used, but never analysed,\nduring the formulation of the Unified Growth Theory show that this theory is\nbased on fundamentally incorrect premises and thus is fundamentally defective.\nApplication of this simple method of analysis points to new directions in the\ndemographic and economic research.
