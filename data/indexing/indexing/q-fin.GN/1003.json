Here we concentrate on simple cases, which\nallow to understand the effects of multiple concurrent production paths as well\nas the presence of stochasticity in the path time lengths or in the network\nstructure.\n  In absence of flexibility, the shortening of production of a single firm in\nan isolated network with multiple connections usually ends up by attaining a\nfinite fraction of the firms or the whole economy, whereas the interactions\nwith the outside allow a partial recovering of the activity, giving rise to\nperiodic solutions with waves of damage which propagate across the structure.\nThe damage propagation speed is strongly dependent upon the topology. The\nexistence of multiple concurrent production paths does not necessarily imply a\nslowing down of the propagation, which can be as fast as the shortest path.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2010 12:57:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Coluzzi", "B.", ""], ["Ghil", "M.", ""], ["Hallegatte", "S.", ""], ["Weisbuch", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.2321", "submitter": "Hideaki Aoyama", "authors": "Hideaki Aoyama, Yoshi Fujiwara, and Mauro Gallegati", "title": "Micro-Macro Relation of Production - The Double Scaling Law for\n  Statistical Physics of Economy -", "comments": "5 pages with 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that an economic system populated by multiple agents generates an\nequilibrium distribution in the form of multiple scaling laws of conditional\nPDFs, which are sufficient for characterizing the probability distribution.
