In\nfact, it is such even to the extent that the BSM model turns out to be, in a\nsense, incompatible with the CAPM.

Considering the simplest possible case where each market\nparticipant has either a positive (bullish) or negative (bearish) sentiment\nwith respect to the market, we model the evolution of the sentiment in the\npopulation due to communication in subgroups of different sizes. Nonlinear\nfeedback effects between the market performance and changes in sentiments are\ntaking into account by assuming that the market performance is dependent on\nchanges in sentiments (e.g. a large sudden positive change in bullishness would\nlead to more buying). The market performance in turn has an impact on the\nsentiment through the transition probabilities to change an opinion in a group\nof a given size. The idea is that if for example the market has observed a\nrecent downturn, it will be easier for even a bearish minority to convince a\nbullish majority to change opinion compared to the case where the meeting takes\nplace in a bullish upturn of the market. Within the framework of our proposed\nmodel, financial markets stylized facts such as volatility clustering and\nextreme events may be perceived as arising due to abrupt sentiment changes via\nongoing communication of the market participants.

This requirement allows the existence of directors\nwho sit on the board of two or more corporations at the same time, generating\nwhat is commonly known as interlocking directorates. While research has shown\nthat networks of interlocking directorates facilitate the transmission of\ninformation between corporations, little is known about the extent to which\nsuch interlocking networks can explain the fluctuations of stock price returns.\nYet, this is a special concern since the risk of amplifying stock fluctuations\nis latent. To answer this question, here we analyze the board composition,\ntraders' perception, and stock performance of more than 1500 US traded\ncorporations from 2007-2011. First, we find that the fewer degrees of\nseparation between two corporations in the interlocking network, the stronger\nthe temporal correlation between their stock price returns. Second, we find\nthat the centrality of traded corporations in the interlocking network\ncorrelates with the frequency at which financial traders talk about such\ncorporations, and this frequency is in turn proportional to the corresponding\ntraded volume. Third, we show that the centrality of corporations was\nnegatively associated with their stock performance in 2008, the year of the big\nfinancial crash. These results suggest that the strategic decisions made by\ninterlocking directorates are strongly followed by stock analysts and have the\npotential to correlate and amplify the movement of stock prices during\nfinancial crashes. These results may have relevant implications for scholars,\ninvestors, and regulators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 11:03:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Saavedra", "Serguei", ""], ["Gilarranz", "Luis J.", ""], ["Rohr", "Rudolf P.", ""], ["Schnabel", "Michael", ""], ["Uzzi", "Brian", ""], ["Bascompte", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8432", "submitter": "Zhijian Wang", "authors": "Zhijian Wang and Bin Xu", "title": "Cycling in stochastic general equilibrium", "comments": "16 pages, 8 figures, keywords: general equilibrium; time reversal\n  symmetry; entanglement of deviations; angular momentum; macroeconomic\n  engineering", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By generalizing the measurements on the game experiments of mixed strategy\nNash equilibrium, we study the dynamical pattern in a representative dynamic\nstochastic general equilibrium (DSGE). The DSGE model describes the\nentanglements of the three variables (output gap [$y$], inflation [$\\pi$] and\nnominal interest rate [$r$]) which can be presented in 3D phase space. We find\nthat, even though the trajectory of $\\pi\\!-\\!y\\!-\\!r$ in phase space appears\nhighly stochastic, it can be visualized and quantified. It exhibits as\nclockwise cycles, counterclockwise cycles and weak cycles, respectively, when\nprojected onto $\\pi\\!-\\!y$, $y\\!-\\!r$ and $r\\!-\\!\\pi$ phase planes. We find\nalso that empirical data of United State (1960-2013) significantly exhibit same\ncycles. The resemblance between the cycles in general equilibrium and the\ncycles in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium suggest that, there generally exists\ndynamical fine structures accompanying with equilibrium. The fine structure,\ndescribing the entanglement of the non-equilibrium (the constantly deviating\nfrom the equilibrium), displays as endless cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 16:36:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhijian", ""], ["Xu", "Bin", ""]]}]
