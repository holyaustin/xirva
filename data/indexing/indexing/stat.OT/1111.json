We consider the problem of estimating the probabilistic graph\nstructure associated with a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF), the Ising\nmodel and the Potts model, by extending previous work on $l_1$ regularized\nneighborhood estimation to include the elastic net $l_1+l_2$ penalty.\nAdditionally, we show numerical evidence that the edge density plays a role in\nthe graph recovery process. Finally, we introduce a novel method for augmenting\nneighborhood estimation by leveraging pair-wise neighborhood union estimates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 16:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cucuringu", "Mihai", ""], ["Puente", "Jesus", ""], ["Shue", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.2091", "submitter": "Gah-Yi Vahn", "authors": "Noureddine El Karoui, Andrew E.

We assume the available log-return data is iid, and detail the\napproach for two cases: nonparametric and parametric (the log-return\ndistribution belongs in the elliptical family). The nonparametric PBR method\npenalizes portfolios with large variability in mean and CVaR estimations. The\nparametric PBR method solves the empirical Markowitz problem instead of the\nempirical mean-CVaR problem, as the solutions of the Markowitz and mean-CVaR\nproblems are equivalent when the log-return distribution is elliptical. We\nderive the asymptotic behavior of the nonparametric PBR solution, which leads\nto insight into the effect of penalization, and justification of the parametric\nPBR method. We also show via simulations that the PBR methods produce efficient\nfrontiers that are, on average, closer to the population efficient frontier\nthan the empirical approach to the mean-CVaR problem, with less variability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 02:37:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 22:32:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Karoui", "Noureddine El", ""], ["Lim", "Andrew E.
