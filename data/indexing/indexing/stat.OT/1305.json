In this work we present a Bayesian approach\nto the problem of presence-only data based on a two levels scheme. A\nprobability law and a case-control design are combined to handle the double\nsource of uncertainty: one due to the censoring and one due to the sampling. We\npropose a new formalization for the logistic model with presence-only data that\nallows further insight into inferential issues related to the model. We\nconcentrate on the case of the linear logistic regression and, in order to make\ninference on the parameters of interest, we present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nalgorithm with data augmentation that does not require the a priori knowledge\nof the population prevalence. A simulation study concerning 24,000 simulated\ndatasets related to different scenarios is presented comparing our proposal to\noptimal benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 May 2013 16:03:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Divino", "Fabio", ""], ["Golini", "Natalia", ""], ["Lasinio", "Giovanna Jona", ""], ["Penttinen", "Antti", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6995", "submitter": "Andy  Royle", "authors": "J.
