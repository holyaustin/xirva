You may feel\nthat the event of her winning wasn't particularly random, but how would you\nargue that in a fair court of law? Traditional probability theory does not even\nhave the notion of random events. Algorithmic information theory does, but it\nis not applicable to real-world scenarios like the lottery one. We attempt to\nrectify that.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 18:49:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gurevich", "Yuri", ""], ["Passmore", "Grant Olney", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.08099", "submitter": "Adil Yilmaz Mr", "authors": "Adil Yilmaz, Gazanfer Unal", "title": "Chaos in Fractionally Integrated Generalized Autoregressive Conditional\n  Heteroskedastic Processes", "comments": "20 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF math.DS q-fin.ST stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fractionally integrated generalized autoregressive conditional\nheteroskedasticity (FIGARCH) arises in modeling of financial time series.\nFIGARCH is essentially governed by a system of nonlinear stochastic difference\nequations ${u_t}$ = ${z_t}$ $(1-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^q \\beta_j L^j)\\sigma_{t}^2 =\n\\omega+(1-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^q \\beta_j L^j - (\\sum\\limits_{k=1}^p \\varphi_k L^k)\n(1-L)^d) u_t^2$, where $\\omega\\in$ R, and $\\beta_j\\in$ R are constant\nparameters, $\\{u_t\\}_{{t\\in}^+}$ and $\\{\\sigma_t\\}_{{t\\in}^+}$ are the discrete\ntime real valued stochastic processes which represent FIGARCH (p,d,q) and\nstochastic volatility, respectively. Moreover, L is the backward shift\noperator, i.e. $L^d u_t \\equiv u_{t-d}$ (d is the fractional differencing\nparameter 0$<$d$<$1).\n  In this work, we have studied the chaoticity properties of FIGARCH (p,d,q)\nprocesses by computing mutual information, correlation dimensions, FNNs (False\nNearest Neighbour), the Lyapunov exponents, and for both the stochastic\ndifference equation given above and for the financial time series. We have\nobserved that maximal Lyapunov exponents are negative, therefore, it can be\nsuggested that FIGARCH (p,d,q) is not deterministic chaotic process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 13:31:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 13:10:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "Adil", ""], ["Unal", "Gazanfer", ""]]}]
