Using a Coulomb fluid technique, we derive analytically and for large\n$N$ the cumulative $\\mathcal{P}[\\kappa<x]$ and tail-cumulative\n$\\mathcal{P}[\\kappa>x]$ distributions of $\\kappa$. We find that these\ndistributions decay as $\\mathcal{P}[\\kappa<x]\\approx\\exp\\left(-\\beta N^2\n\\Phi_{-}(x)\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{P}[\\kappa>x]\\approx\\exp\\left(-\\beta N\n\\Phi_{+}(x)\\right)$, where $\\beta$ is the Dyson index of the ensemble. The left\nand right rate functions $\\Phi_{\\pm}(x)$ are independent of $\\beta$ and\ncalculated exactly for any choice of the rectangularity parameter\n$\\alpha=M/N-1>0$. Interestingly, they show a weak non-analytic behavior at\ntheir minimum $\\langle\\kappa\\rangle$ (corresponding to the average condition\nnumber), a direct consequence of a phase transition in the associated Coulomb\nfluid problem. Matching the behavior of the rate functions around\n$\\langle\\kappa\\rangle$, we determine exactly the scale of typical fluctuations\n$\\sim\\mathcal{O}(N^{-2/3})$ and the tails of the limiting distribution of\n$\\kappa$. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with numerical\nsimulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 16:42:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Castillo", "Isaac P\u00e9rez", ""], ["Katzav", "Eytan", ""], ["Vivo", "Pierpaolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.3371", "submitter": "Hamed Firouzi", "authors": "Hamed Firouzi, Dennis Wei, Alfred O.

The goal is to identify\nthe hub time series, i.e., those that are highly correlated with a specified\nnumber of other time series. We show that Fourier components of the time series\nat different frequencies are asymptotically statistically independent. This\nproperty permits independent correlation analysis at each frequency,\nalleviating the computational and statistical challenges of high-dimensional\ntime series. To detect correlation hubs at each frequency, an existing\ncorrelation screening method is extended to the complex numbers to accommodate\ncomplex-valued Fourier components. We characterize the number of hub\ndiscoveries at specified correlation and degree thresholds in the regime of\nincreasing dimension and fixed sample size. The theory specifies appropriate\nthresholds to apply to sample correlation matrices to detect hubs and also\nallows statistical significance to be attributed to hub discoveries. Numerical\nresults illustrate the accuracy of the theory and the usefulness of the\nproposed spectral framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Mar 2014 19:01:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Apr 2014 16:25:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Firouzi", "Hamed", ""], ["Wei", "Dennis", ""], ["Hero", "Alfred O.", "III"]]}, {"id": "1403.4471", "submitter": "Lin Jiu", "authors": "Didong Li, Huafei Sun, Chen Tao and Lin Jiu", "title": "Principal bundles over statistical manifolds", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DG stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we introduce the concept of principal bundles on statistical\nmanifolds.
