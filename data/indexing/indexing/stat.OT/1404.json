Contacts are\nusually assumed to be possible only through a network of connected patches.\nThis network accounts for a spatial landscape or a social organisation of\ninteractions. Thanks to social network literature, heterogeneous networks of\ncontacts can be considered. A major issue is to assess the influence of the\nnetwork in the dynamic model. Most work with this common purpose uses\ndeterministic models or an approximation of a stochastic\nExtinction-Colonisation model (sEC) which are relevant only for large networks.\nWhen working with a limited size network, the induced stochasticity is\nessential and has to be taken into account in the conclusions. Here, a rigorous\nframework is proposed for limited size networks and the limitations of the\ndeterministic approximation are exhibited. This framework allows exact\ncomputations when the number of patches is small. Otherwise, simulations are\nused and enhanced by adapted simulation techniques when necessary. A\nsensitivity analysis was conducted to compare four main topologies of networks\nin contrasting settings to determine the role of the network. A challenging\ncase was studied in this context: seed exchange of crop species in the R\\'eseau\nSemences Paysannes (RSP), an emergent French farmers' organisation. A\nstochastic Extinction-Colonisation model was used to characterize the\nconsequences of substantial changes in terms of RSP's social organisation on\nthe ability of the system to maintain crop varieties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Apr 2014 15:34:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Barbillon", "Pierre", ""], ["Thomas", "Mathieu", ""], ["Goldringer", "Isabelle", ""], ["Hospital", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""], ["Robin", "St\u00e9phane", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7208", "submitter": "Jiajie Chen", "authors": "Jiajie Chen and Cong Han Lim and Peter Z.

SAA can also be used to find estimates\nof a lower bound on the optimal objective value of the true problem which, when\ncoupled with an upper bound, provides confidence intervals for the true optimal\nobjective value and valuable information about the quality of the approximate\nsolutions. Specifically, the lower bound can be estimated by solving multiple\nSAA problems (each obtained using a particular sampling method) and averaging\nthe obtained objective values. State-of-the-art methods for lower-bound\nestimation generate batches of scenarios for the SAA problems independently. In\nthis paper, we describe sampling methods that produce negatively dependent\nbatches, thus reducing the variance of the sample-averaged lower bound\nestimator and increasing its usefulness in defining a confidence interval for\nthe optimal objective value. We provide conditions under which the new sampling\nmethods can reduce the variance of the lower bound estimator, and present\ncomputational results to verify that our scheme can reduce the variance\nsignificantly, by comparison with the traditional Latin hypercube approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 01:49:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 May 2014 03:59:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jiajie", ""], ["Lim", "Cong Han", ""], ["Qian", "Peter Z.
