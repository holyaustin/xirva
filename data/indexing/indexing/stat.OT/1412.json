The most elementary form of such a causal\ndiscovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes\nX, given joint observations of two variables X, Y. An example is to decide\nwhether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint\nmeasurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no\nconfounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal\ndiscovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for\naddressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two\nfamilies of such methods: Additive Noise Methods (ANM) and Information\nGeometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CauseEffectPairs\nthat consists of data for 100 different cause-effect pairs selected from 37\ndatasets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine,\nengineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the \"ground\ntruth\" causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several\nbivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in\naddition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world\ndata indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from\neffect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would\nbe needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best\nperforming methods overall is the additive-noise method originally proposed by\nHoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63+-10 % and an AUC of\n0.74+-0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of\nthis work we prove the consistency of that method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2014 19:34:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 14:51:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 11:37:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Mooij", "Joris M.", ""], ["Peters", "Jonas", ""], ["Janzing", "Dominik", ""], ["Zscheischler", "Jakob", ""], ["Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Bernhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5294", "submitter": "Francesco Papi", "authors": "Francesco Papi, Ba-Ngu Vo, Ba-Tuong Vo, Claudio Fantacci, and Michael\n  Beard", "title": "Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli Approximation of Multi-Object\n  Densities", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2015.2454478", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In multi-object inference, the multi-object probability density captures the\nuncertainty in the number and the states of the objects as well as the\nstatistical dependence between the objects. Exact computation of the\nmulti-object density is generally intractable and tractable implementations\nusually require statistical independence assumptions between objects. In this\npaper we propose a tractable multi-object density approximation that can\ncapture statistical dependence between objects. In particular, we derive a\ntractable Generalized Labeled Multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) density that matches the\ncardinality distribution and the first moment of the labeled multi-object\ndistribution of interest. It is also shown that the proposed approximation\nminimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence over a special tractable class of\nGLMB densities. Based on the proposed GLMB approximation we further demonstrate\na tractable multi-object tracking algorithm for generic measurement models.\nSimulation results for a multi-object Track-Before-Detect example using radar\nmeasurements in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios verify the\napplicability of the proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 09:12:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 03:20:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 05:40:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Papi", "Francesco", ""], ["Vo", "Ba-Ngu", ""], ["Vo", "Ba-Tuong", ""], ["Fantacci", "Claudio", ""], ["Beard", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5936", "submitter": "Ad\\'ela\\\"ide Olivier", "authors": "Marc Hoffmann and Ad\\'ela\\\"ide Olivier", "title": "Nonparametric estimation of the division rate of an age dependent\n  branching process", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the nonparametric estimation of the branching rate $B(x)$ of a\nsupercritical Bellman-Harris population: a particle with age $x$ has a random\nlifetime governed by $B(x)$; at its death time, it gives rise to $k \\geq 2$\nchildren with lifetimes governed by the same division rate and so on.
