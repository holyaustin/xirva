In some cases\nit leads to a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia known as Torsade de\nPointes (TdP). Therefore recognizing drugs with TdP risk is essential.\nCandidate drugs that are determined not to cause cardiac ion channel blockage\nare more likely to pass successfully through clinical phases II and III trials\n(and preclinical work) and not be withdrawn even later from the marketplace due\nto cardiotoxic effects. The objective of the present study is to develop an SAR\nmodel that can be used as an early screen for torsadogenic (causing TdP\narrhythmias) potential in drug candidates. The method is performed using\ndescriptors comprised of atomic NMR chemical shifts and corresponding\ninteratomic distances which are combined into a 3D abstract space matrix. The\nmethod is called 3D-SDAR (3 dimensional spectral data-activity relationship)\nand can be interrogated to identify molecular features responsible for the\nactivity, which can in turn yield simplified hERG toxicophores. A dataset of 55\nhERG potassium channel inhibitors collected from Kramer et al. consisting of 32\ndrugs with TdP risk and 23 with no TdP risk was used for training the 3D-SDAR\nmodel.An ANN model with multilayer perceptron was used to define collinearities\namong the independent 3D-SDAR features. A composite model from 200 random\niterations with 25% of the molecules in each case yielded the following figures\nof merit: training, 99.2 %; internal test sets, 66.7%; external (blind\nvalidation) test set, 68.4%. In the external test set, 70.3% of positive TdP\ndrugs were correctly predicted. Moreover, toxicophores were generated from TdP\ndrugs. A 3D-SDAR was successfully used to build a predictive model for\ndrug-induced torsadogenic and non-torsadogenic drugs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 18:42:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sharifi", "Mohsen", ""], ["Buzatu", "Dan", ""], ["Harris", "Stephen", ""], ["Wilkes", "Jon", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01598", "submitter": "Anthony David Blaom", "authors": "Anthony D.
