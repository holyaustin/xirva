Authors in\n[4] offered possible measurement models for a given comparison and a suitable\nmodel was selected out after rigorous analyzing steps for expectation values of\nthese degrees of equivalence. The systematic laboratory-effects model was then\nselected as a right one in this report. Those models were all based on the one\ntrue value existence assumption. However in the year 2008, a new version of the\nVocabulary for International Metrology (VIM) [7] was issued where the true\nvalue of a given measurement standard should be now perceived as multi true\nvalues which following a given statistics distribution. Applying this\nperception of true values of a measurement standard with combination of the\nsteps in [4], measurement models have been developed and degrees of equivalence\nhave been analyzed. The results show that although with new definition, the\nsystematic laboratory-effects model is still the reasonable one in a given key\ncomparison.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Dec 2010 02:30:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 08:36:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Le", "Thang H.", ""], ["Do", "Nguyen D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1012.2184", "submitter": "Christian P.
