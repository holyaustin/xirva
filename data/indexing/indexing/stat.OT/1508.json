This impact comes\nfrom simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of\ninference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability or\nmathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process,\n(d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e)\nallowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data,\nand (f) acting as a firmer foundation on which to build statistical intuition.\nThus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an\nundergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based\ninference should be used throughout all undergraduate statistics courses. In\norder to achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based\ninference on the undergraduate statistics program we will need to break free of\nhistorical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics,\nconsider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses,\nfully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation\nthroughout the curriculum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2015 19:30:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tintle", "Nathan", ""], ["Chance", "Beth", ""], ["Cobb", "George", ""], ["Roy", "Soma", ""], ["Swanson", "Todd", ""], ["VanderStoep", "Jill", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02083", "submitter": "Dina Ramadan", "authors": "M.

Recent work has focused on causal definitions of\ninformation transfer excluding effects of common drivers and indirect\ninfluences. While the former clearly constitutes a spurious causality, the aim\nof the present article is to develop measures quantifying different notions of\nthe strength of information transfer along indirect causal paths, based on\nfirst reconstructing the multivariate causal network (\\emph{Tigramite}\napproach). Another class of novel measures quantifies to what extent different\nintermediate processes on causal paths contribute to an interaction mechanism\nto determine pathways of causal information transfer. A rigorous mathematical\nframework allows for a clear information-theoretic interpretation that can also\nbe related to the underlying dynamics as proven for certain classes of\nprocesses. Generally, however, estimates of information transfer remain hard to\ninterpret for nonlinearly intertwined complex systems. But, if experiments or\nmathematical models are not available, measuring pathways of information\ntransfer within the causal dependency structure allows at least for an\nabstraction of the dynamics.

A practitioner working\nwith spatial data is presented a number of choices regarding the structure of\nthe dependence between observations. One of these choices is determining\nwhether or not an isotropic covariance function is appropriate. Isotropy\nimplies that spatial dependence does not depend on the direction of the spatial\nseparation between sampling locations. Misspecification of isotropy properties\n(directional dependence) can lead to misleading inferences, e.g., inaccurate\npredictions and parameter estimates. A researcher may use graphical\ndiagnostics, such as directional sample variograms, to decide whether the\nassumption of isotropy is reasonable. These graphical techniques can be\ndifficult to assess, open to subjective interpretations, and misleading.\nHypothesis tests of the assumption of isotropy may be more desirable. To this\nend, a number of tests of directional dependence have been developed using both\nthe spatial and spectral representations of random fields.
