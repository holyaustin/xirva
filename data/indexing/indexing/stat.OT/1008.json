One very general super-class of\nNormal distributions is the class of $\\nu$-spherical distributions whose random\nvariables can be represented as the product $\\x = r\\cdot \\u$ of a uniformly\ndistribution random variable $\\u$ on the $1$-level set of a positively\nhomogeneous function $\\nu$ and arbitrary positive radial random variable $r$.\nProminent subclasses of $\\nu$-spherical distributions are spherically symmetric\ndistributions ($\\nu(\\x)=\\|\\x\\|_2$) which have been further generalized to the\nclass of $L_p$-spherically symmetric distributions ($\\nu(\\x)=\\|\\x\\|_p$). Both\nof these classes contain the Gaussian as a special case. In general, however,\n$\\nu$-spherical distributions are computationally intractable since, for\ninstance, the normalization constant or fast sampling algorithms are unknown\nfor an arbitrary $\\nu$. In this paper we introduce a new subclass of\n$\\nu$-spherical distributions by choosing $\\nu$ to be a nested cascade of\n$L_p$-norms. This class is still computationally tractable, but includes all\nthe aforementioned subclasses as a special case. We derive a general expression\nfor $L_p$-nested symmetric distributions as well as the uniform distribution on\nthe $L_p$-nested unit sphere, including an explicit expression for the\nnormalization constant. We state several general properties of $L_p$-nested\nsymmetric distributions, investigate its marginals, maximum likelihood fitting\nand discuss its tight links to well known machine learning methods such as\nIndependent Component Analysis (ICA), Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) and\nmixed norm regularizers. Finally, we derive a fast and exact sampling algorithm\nfor arbitrary $L_p$-nested symmetric distributions, and introduce the Nested\nRadial Factorization algorithm (NRF), which is a form of non-linear ICA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Aug 2010 10:44:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Sinz", "Fabian", ""], ["Bethge", "Matthias", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0756", "submitter": "S\\\"oren Christensen", "authors": "S\\\"oren Christensen", "title": "Phasetype distributions, autoregressive processes and overshoot", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1239/jap/1331216832", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Autoregressive processes are intensively studied in statistics and other\nfields of applied stochastics.
