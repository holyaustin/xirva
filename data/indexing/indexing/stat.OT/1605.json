In this paper,\nwe investigate performance lower bounds on the mean-square-error (MSE) of any\nestimator for the Bayesian linear model, corrupted by a noise distributed\naccording to an i.i.d. Student's t-distribution. This class of prior\nparametrized by its degree of freedom is relevant to modelize either dense or\nsparse (accounting for outliers) noise. Using the hierarchical Normal-Gamma\nrepresentation of the Student's t-distribution, the Van Trees' Bayesian\nCram\\'er-Rao bound (BCRB) on the amplitude parameters is derived. Furthermore,\nthe random matrix theory (RMT) framework is assumed, i.e., the number of\nmeasurements and the number of unknown parameters grow jointly to infinity with\nan asymptotic finite ratio. Using some powerful results from the RMT,\nclosed-form expressions of the BCRB are derived and studied. Finally, we\npropose a framework to fairly compare two models corrupted by noises with\ndifferent degrees of freedom for a fixed common target signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR). In particular, we focus our effort on the comparison of the BCRBs\nassociated with two models corrupted by a sparse noise promoting outliers and a\ndense (Gaussian) noise, respectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 May 2016 08:31:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 22 Jan 2017 17:20:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 13:12:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ollier", "Virginie", ""], ["Boyer", "R\u00e9my", ""], ["Korso", "Mohammed Nabil El", ""], ["Larzabal", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.05069", "submitter": "Sergei Kucherenko", "authors": "S.
