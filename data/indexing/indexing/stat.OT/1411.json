The constraints that we consider frequently arise in cases\nwhere the response categories are ordered in some sense such as in\nconfidence-rating data, Likert scale data, where graded guessing tendencies or\nresponse biases are created via base-rate or payoff manipulations, in the\nanalysis of contingency tables with order constraints, and in many other cases.\nWe show how to construct an MPT model without order constraints that is\nstatistically equivalent to the MPT model with order constraints. This new\nclosure result extends the mathematical analysis of the MPT class, and it\noffers an approach to order-restricted inference that extends the approaches\ndiscussed by Knapp and Batchelder (2004). The usefulness of the method is\nillustrated by means of an analysis of an order-constrained version of the\ntwo-high-threshold model for confidence ratings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 20:25:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Klauer", "Karl Christoph", ""], ["Singmann", "Henrik", ""], ["Kellen", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.2778", "submitter": "Daniel W.
