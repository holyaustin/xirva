The skewness in the distribution of LOS\nposes problems in statistical modelling because it fails to adequately follow\nthe usual traditional distribution such as the log-normal distribution. The aim\nof this work is to model the variable LOS using the convolution of two\ndistributions; a technique well known in the signal processing community. The\nspecificity of that model is that the variable of interest is considered to be\nthe resulting sum of two random variables with different distributions. One of\nthe variables will feature the patient-related factors in terms their need to\nrecover from their admission condition, while the other models the hospital\nmanagement process such as the discharging process. Two estimation procedures\nare proposed. One is the classical maximum likelihood, while the other relates\nto the expectation maximisation algorithm. We will present some results\nobtained by applying this model to a set of real data from a group of hospitals\nin Victoria (Australia).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 22:57:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ickowicz", "Adrien", ""], ["Sparks", "Ross", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.03533", "submitter": "Louise Ryan", "authors": "Louise Ryan", "title": "A Conversation with Nan Laird", "comments": "Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/15-STS528 in the Statistical\n  Science (http://www.imstat.org/sts/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org), Report No IMS-STS-STS528", "journal-ref": "Statistical Science 2015, Vol. 30, No. 4, 582-596", "doi": "10.1214/15-STS528", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nan McKenzie Laird is the Harvey V.

Using extreme-value form statistics to test against\nsparse alternatives and using quadratic form statistics to test against dense\nalternatives are two important testing procedures for high-dimensional\nindependence. However, quadratic form statistics suffer from low power against\nsparse alternatives, and extreme-value form statistics suffer from low power\nagainst dense alternatives with small disturbances and may have size\ndistortions due to its slow convergence. For real-world applications, it is\nimportant to derive powerful testing procedures against more general\nalternatives. Based on intermediate limiting distributions, we derive\n(model-free) joint limiting laws of extreme-value form and quadratic form\nstatistics, and surprisingly, we prove that they are asymptotically\nindependent. Given such asymptotic independencies, we propose (model-free)\ntesting procedures to boost the power against general alternatives and also\nretain the correct asymptotic size. Under the high-dimensional setting, we\nderive the closed-form limiting null distributions, and obtain their explicit\nrates of uniform convergence. We prove their consistent statistical powers\nagainst general alternatives. We demonstrate the performance of our proposed\ntest statistics in simulation studies. Our work provides very helpful insights\nto high-dimensional independence tests, and fills an important gap.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 00:30:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Danning", ""], ["Xue", "Lingzhou", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09016", "submitter": "Kayvan Sadeghi", "authors": "Kayvan Sadeghi and Nanny Wermuth", "title": "Pairwise Markov properties for regression graphs", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "STAT, 5, (2016), 286-294", "doi": "10.1002/sta4.122", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With a sequence of regressions, one may generate joint probability\ndistributions.
