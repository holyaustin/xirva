Many researchers are not aware of the numerous\ncriticisms raised against NHST. As practiced, NHST has been characterized as a\nnull ritual that is overused and too often misapplied and misinterpreted. NHST\nis in fact a patchwork of two fundamentally different classical statistical\ntesting models, often blended with some wishful quasi-Bayesian interpretations.\nThis is undoubtedly a major reason why NHST is very often misunderstood. But\nNHST also has intrinsic logical problems and the epistemic range of the\ninformation provided by such tests is much more limited than most researchers\nrecognize. In this article we introduce to the scientometric community the\ntheoretical origins of NHST, which is mostly absent from standard statistical\ntextbooks, and we discuss some of the most prevalent problems relating to the\npractice of NHST and trace these problems back to the mixup of the two\ndifferent theoretical origins. Finally, we illustrate some of the\nmisunderstandings with examples from the scientometric literature and bring\nforward some modest recommendations for a more sound practice in quantitative\ndata analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 19:02:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schneider", "Jesper W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.1673", "submitter": "Petr  Tichavsky", "authors": "Petr Tichavsky, Anh Huy Phan, and Andrzej Cichocki", "title": "Non-Orthogonal Tensor Diagonalization", "comments": "The manuscript was revised deeply, but the main idea is the same.
