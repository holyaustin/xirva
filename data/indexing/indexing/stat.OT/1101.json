That is, do there\nexist circularly symmetric distributions on the unit disk in $R^2$ and\nspherically symmetric distributions on the unit ball in $R^d$, $d\\ge3$, whose\none-dimensional marginal distributions are uniform? The answer is yes for $d=2$\nand 3, where the circular and spherical copulas are unique and can be\ndetermined explicitly, but no for $d\\ge4$. A one-parameter family of elliptical\nbivariate copulas is obtained from the unique circular copula in $R^2$ by\noblique coordinate transformations. Copulas obtained by a non-linear\ntransformation of a uniform distribution on the unit ball in $R^d$ are also\ndescribed, and determined explicitly for $d=2$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Dec 2010 19:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Perlman", "Michael D.", "", "University of Washington, Seattle"], ["Wellner", "Jon A.", "", "University of Washington, Seattle"]]}, {"id": "1101.4207", "submitter": "Saeed Abdallah", "authors": "Saeed Abdallah and Ioannis N.

Most works on this problem focus on pilot-based\napproaches which impose a significant training overhead that reduces the\nspectral efficiency of the system. To avoid such losses, this work proposes\nblind channel estimation algorithms for AF TWRNs that employ constant-modulus\n(CM) signaling. Our main algorithm is based on the deterministic maximum\nlikelihood (DML) approach. Assuming M-PSK modulation, we show that the\nresulting estimator is consistent and approaches the true channel with high\nprobability at high SNR for modulation orders higher than 2. For BPSK, however,\nthe DML performs poorly and we propose an alternative algorithm that performs\nmuch better by taking into account the BPSK structure of the data symbols. For\ncomparative purposes, we also investigate the Gaussian maximum-likelihood (GML)\napproach which treats the data symbols as Gaussian-distributed nuisance\nparameters. We derive the Cramer-Rao bound and use Monte-Carlo simulations to\ninvestigate the mean squared error (MSE) performance of the proposed\nalgorithms. We also compare the symbol-error rate (SER) performance of the DML\nalgorithm with that of the training-based least-squares (LS) algorithm and\ndemonstrate that the DML offers a superior tradeoff between accuracy and\nspectral efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 19:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2012 02:27:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Abdallah", "Saeed", ""], ["Psaromiligkos", "Ioannis N.", ""]]}]
