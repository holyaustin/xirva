Histogram data describes\nindividuals in terms of empirical distributions. These kind of data can be\nconsidered as complex descriptions of phenomena observed on complex objects:\nimages, groups of individuals, spatial or temporal variant data, results of\nqueries, environmental data, and so on. The Wasserstein distance is used to\ncompare two histograms. The Wasserstein distance between histograms is\nconstituted by two components: the first based on the means, and the second, to\ninternal dispersions (standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and so on) of the\nhistograms. To cluster sets of histogram data, we propose to use Dynamic\nClustering Algorithm, (based on adaptive squared Wasserstein distances) that is\na k-means-like algorithm for clustering a set of individuals into $K$ classes\nthat are apriori fixed.\n  The main aim of this research is to provide a tool for clustering histograms,\nemphasizing the different contributions of the histogram variables, and their\ncomponents, to the definition of the clusters. We demonstrate that this can be\nachieved using adaptive distances. Two kind of adaptive distances are\nconsidered: the first takes into account the variability of each component of\neach descriptor for the whole set of individuals; the second takes into account\nthe variability of each component of each descriptor in each cluster. We\nfurnish interpretative tools of the obtained partition based on an extension of\nthe classical measures (indexes) to the use of adaptive distances in the\nclustering criterion function. Applications on synthetic and real-world data\ncorroborate the proposed procedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Oct 2011 09:11:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Irpino", "Antonio", ""], ["Verde", "Rosanna", ""], ["De Carvalho", "Francisco de AT", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.1615", "submitter": "David Albers", "authors": "DJ Albers and George Hripcsak", "title": "Estimation of time-delayed mutual information and bias for irregularly\n  and sparsely sampled time-series", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.chaos.2012.03.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.CD physics.data-an q-bio.QM stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A method to estimate the time-dependent correlation via an empirical bias\nestimate of the time-delayed mutual information for a time-series is proposed.\nIn particular, the bias of the time-delayed mutual information is shown to\noften be equivalent to the mutual information between two distributions of\npoints from the same system separated by infinite time.
