One of the first investigation of the topic\nis given in the paper written by Ajtai, Koml\\'os and Tusn\\'ady in $1984.$\n  Interestingly, all the neighboring questions posed by that paper were settled\nalready without the original one. In this paper we are going to delineate the\nlimit behavior of the original statistics with the help of computer\nsimulations. At the same time we kept an eye on theoretical grasping of the\nproblem. Based on our computer simulations our opinion is that the limit\ndistribution is Gaussian.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 15:55:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Aug 2013 20:41:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 15 Sep 2013 21:42:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rejt\u0151", "L.", ""], ["Tusn\u00e1dy", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.4178", "submitter": "Andr\\'e Beauducel", "authors": "Andre Beauducel", "title": "The factor paradox: Common factors can be correlated with the variance\n  not accounted for by the common factors!", "comments": "11 pages, 2 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The case that the factor model does not account for all the covariances of\nthe observed variables is considered. This is a quite realistic condition\nbecause some model error as well as some sampling error should usually occur\nwith empirical data. It is shown that principal components representing\ncovariances not accounted for by the factors of the model can have a non-zero\ncorrelation with the common factors of the factor model. Non-zero correlations\nof components representing variance not accounted for by the factor model with\ncommon factors were also found in a simulation study. Based on these results it\nshould be concluded that common factors can be correlated with variance\ncomponents representing model error as well as sampling error. In consequence,\neven when researchers decide not to represent some small or trivial variance by\nmeans of a common factor, these excluded variances can still be part of the\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 21:29:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Beauducel", "Andre", ""]]}]
