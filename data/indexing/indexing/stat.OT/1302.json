They may also\nserve as a general reference for the application of quantitative--empirical\nresearch methods. In an attempt to encourage the adoption of an\ninterdisciplinary perspective on quantitative problems arising in practice, the\nnotes cover the four broad topics (i) descriptive statistical processing of raw\ndata, (ii) elementary probability theory, (iii) the operationalisation of\none-dimensional latent statistical variables according to Likert's widely used\nscaling approach, and (iv) null hypothesis significance testing within the\nfrequentist approach to probability theory concerning (a) distributional\ndifferences of variables between subgroups of a target population, and (b)\nstatistical associations between two variables. The relevance of effect sizes\nfor making inferences is emphasised. These lecture notes are fully hyperlinked,\nthus providing a direct route to original scientific papers as well as to\ninteresting biographical information. They also list many commands for running\nstatistical functions and data analysis routines in the software packages R,\nSPSS, EXCEL and OpenOffice. The immediate involvement in actual data analysis\npractices is strongly recommended.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 16:32:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 06:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 30 Aug 2015 15:15:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2019 06:24:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["van Elst", "Henk", "", "parcIT GmbH, K\u00f6ln, Germany"]]}]
