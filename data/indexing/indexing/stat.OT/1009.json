These\nsystems break down when some shock overcomes a given resistance level. In this\npaper we propose an alternative approach to extreme shock models using\nreinforced urn processes. As a consequence of this we are able to look at the\nsame problem under a Bayesian nonparametric perspective, providing the\npredictive distribution of systems' defaults.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 10:39:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Cirillo", "Pasquale", ""], ["H\u00fcsler", "J\u00fcrg", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.2723", "submitter": "Toshio Sakata", "authors": "Toshio Sakata, Kazumitsu Maehra, Takeshi Sasaki, Toshio Sumi,\n  Mitsuhiro Miyazaki and Yoshitaka Watanabe", "title": "Tests of Non-Equivalence among Absolutely Nonsingular Tensors through\n  Geometric Invariants", "comments": "24 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  4x4x3 absolutely nonsingular tensors are characterized by their determinant\npolynomial.
