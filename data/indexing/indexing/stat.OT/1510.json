It comes from the lack of information or\nknowledge about the simulated system as well as from restrictions of the model\nset being used. One of the powerful tools for the uncertainty management is\nensemble-based simulation, which uses variation in input or output data, model\nparameters, or available versions of models to improve the simulation\nperformance. Furthermore the system of models for complex system simulation\n(especially in case of hiring ensemble-based approach) can be considered as a\ncomplex system. As a result, the identification of the complex model's\nstructure and parameters provide additional sources of uncertainty to be\nmanaged. Within the presented work we are developing a conceptual and\ntechnological approach to manage the ensemble-based simulation taking into\naccount changing states of both simulated system and system of models within\nthe ensemble-based approach. The states of these systems are considered as a\nsubject of classification with consequent inference of better strategies for\nensemble evolution over the simulation time and ensemble aggregation. Here the\nensemble evolution enables implementation of dynamic reactive solutions which\ncan automatically conform to the changing states of both systems. The ensemble\naggregation can be considered within a scope of averaging (regression way) or\nselection (classification way, which complement the classification mentioned\nearlier) approach. The technological basis for such approach includes\nensemble-based simulation techniques using domain-specific software combined\nwithin a composite application; data science approaches for analysis of\navailable datasets (simulation data, observations, situation assessment etc.);\nand machine learning algorithms for classes identification, ensemble management\nand knowledge acquisition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 15:57:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Mar 2016 14:01:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kovalchuk", "Sergey V.", ""], ["Krikunov", "Aleksey V.", ""], ["Knyazkov", "Konstantin V.", ""], ["Kosukhin", "Sergey S.", ""], ["Boukhanovsky", "Alexander V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.01993", "submitter": "Nianxia Cao", "authors": "Nianxia Cao, Sora Choi, Engin Masazade, Pramod K.

The\nuncertainties of the WSNs result in a set of sensor observations with\ninsufficient information about the target. We propose a novel mutual\ninformation upper bound (MIUB) based sensor selection scheme, which has low\ncomputational complexity, same as the Fisher information (FI) based sensor\nselection scheme, and gives estimation performance similar to the mutual\ninformation (MI) based sensor selection scheme. Without knowing the number of\nsensors to be selected a priori, the multiobjective optimization problem (MOP)\ngives a set of sensor selection strategies that reveal different trade-offs\nbetween two conflicting objectives: minimization of the number of selected\nsensors and minimization of the gap between the performance metric (MIUB and\nFI) when all the sensors transmit measurements and when only the selected\nsensors transmit their measurements based on the sensor selection strategy.\nIllustrative numerical results that provide valuable insights are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 15:40:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Cao", "Nianxia", ""], ["Choi", "Sora", ""], ["Masazade", "Engin", ""], ["Varshney", "Pramod K.", ""]]}]
