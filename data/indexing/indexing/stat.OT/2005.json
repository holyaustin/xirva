Although constructing confidence intervals\nare common practice in statistical analysis, it is challenging in our framework\ndue to the data-dependence of the selected model and the correlation among the\nvariables being selected and not selected. We first introduce estimators for\nthe selected coefficients and show that it is consistent under martingale\nregression model, in which the observations can be dependent and the errors can\nbe heteroskedastic. Then we use the estimators together with a resampling\napproach to construct confidence intervals. Our simulation results show that\nour approach outperforms other existing approaches in various data structures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 May 2020 01:20:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Tsang", "Ka Wai", ""], ["Dai", "Wei", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.13974", "submitter": "Can Yang", "authors": "Can Yang, Junjie Zhai, Helong Li", "title": "On the Bound of Cumulative Return in Trading Series and the Verification\n  Using Technical Trading Rules", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST cs.CE stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Although there is a wide use of technical trading rules in stock markets, the\nprofitability of them still remains controversial.

It is found that the OLS estimate for the slope\ncoefficient is not invariant under Lorentz velocity transformation.\nAccordingly, an alternative estimator for the parameters of linear regression\nunder special relativity is proposed. This estimator can be considered a\ngeneralization of the OLS estimator under special relativity; when c approaches\nto infinity, the proposed estimator and its variance converges to the OLS\nestimator and its variance, respectively. The variance of the proposed\nestimator is larger than that of the OLS estimator, which implies that\nhypothesis testing using the OLS estimator and its variance may result in a\nliberal test under special relativity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2020 21:03:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Joo", "Si Hyung", ""]]}]
