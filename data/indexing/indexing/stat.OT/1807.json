In this study we investigate the dynamic behaviour of\nindividuals to see whether or not we can expect a transition to another mood\nstate. We introduce a mean field model to a binomial process, where we reduce a\ndynamic multidimensional system (stochastic cellular automaton) to a\none-dimensional system to analyse the dynamics. Using maximum likelihood\nestimation, we can estimate the parameter of interest which, in combination\nwith a bifurcation diagram, reflects the expectancy that someone has to\ntransition to another mood state. After validating the proposed method with\nsimulated data, we apply this method to two empirical examples, where we show\nits use in a clinical sample consisting of patients diagnosed with major\ndepressive disorder, and a general population sample. Results showed that the\nmajority of the clinical sample was categorized as having an expectancy for a\ntransition, while the majority of the general population sample did not have\nthis expectancy. We conclude that the mean field model has great potential in\nassessing the expectancy for a transition between mood states. With some\nextensions it could, in the future, aid clinical therapists in the treatment of\ndepressed patients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2018 12:36:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Nov 2018 17:56:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 14:35:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kossakowski", "Jolanda J", ""], ["Gordijn", "Marijke C M", ""], ["Riese", "Harriette", ""], ["Waldorp", "Lourens J", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.09681", "submitter": "Daisuke Murakami", "authors": "Daisuke Murakami, Daniel A.

This is especially true if a\nmultiscale property of SVC is considered. Given this background, this study\ndevelops a Moran's eigenvector-based spatially varying coefficients (M-SVC)\nmodeling approach that estimates multiscale SVCs computationally efficiently.\nThis estimation is accelerated through a (i) rank reduction, (ii)\npre-compression, and (iii) sequential likelihood maximization. Steps (i) and\n(ii) eliminate the sample size N from the likelihood function; after these\nsteps, the likelihood maximization cost is independent of N. Step (iii) further\naccelerates the likelihood maximization so that multiscale SVCs can be\nestimated even if the number of SVCs, K, is large. The M-SVC approach is\ncompared with geographically weighted regression (GWR) through Monte Carlo\nsimulation experiments. These simulation results show that our approach is far\nfaster than GWR when N is large, despite numerically estimating 2K parameters\nwhile GWR numerically estimates only 1 parameter. Then, the proposed approach\nis applied to a land price analysis as an illustration. The developed SVC\nestimation approach is implemented in the R package \"spmoran.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Jul 2018 16:20:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Murakami", "Daisuke", ""], ["Griffith", "Daniel A.", ""]]}]
