Recently we proposed measurement theory\n(i.e., quantum language, or the linguistic interpretation of quantum\nmechanics), which is characterized as the linguistic turn of the Copenhagen\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics. This turn from physics to language does\nnot only extend quantum theory to classical theory but also yield the quantum\nmechanical world view (i.e., the (quantum) linguistic world view, and thus, a\nform of quantum thinking, in other words, quantum philosophy). Thus, we believe\nthat the quantum lingistic formulation of statistics gives an answer to the\nquestion: \"What is statistics?\". In this paper, this will be done through the\nstudies of inference interval, statistical hypothesis testing, Fisher maximum\nlikelihood method, Bayes method and regression analysis in meaurement theory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 24 Jun 2012 02:18:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ishikawa", "Shiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.0700", "submitter": "Jens Smiatek", "authors": "Jens Smiatek and Andreas Heuer", "title": "A statistical view on team handball results: home advantage, team\n  fitness and prediction of match outcomes", "comments": "8 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT physics.data-an physics.soc-ph stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the results of the German Team Handball Bundesliga for ten seasons\nin a model-free statistical time series approach.

They translate the intuition and many features of\nthe copula concept into a time series setting. A challenge faced by both,\ndistributional and Levy copulas, is to find flexible but still applicable\nmodels for higher dimensions. To overcome this problem, the concept of pair\ncopula constructions has been successfully applied to distributional copulas.\nIn this paper, we develop the pair construction for Levy copulas (PLCC).\nSimilar to pair constructions of distributional copulas, the pair construction\nof a d-dimensional Levy copula consists of d(d-1)/2 bivariate dependence\nfunctions. We show that only d-1 of these bivariate functions are Levy copulas,\nwhereas the remaining functions are distributional copulas. Since there are no\nrestrictions concerning the choice of the copulas, the proposed pair\nconstruction adds the desired flexibility to Levy copula models. We discuss\nestimation and simulation in detail and apply the pair construction in a\nsimulation study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Jul 2012 09:23:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Sep 2012 08:16:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Grothe", "Oliver", ""], ["Nicklas", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5781", "submitter": "Roberto Rossi", "authors": "Roberto Rossi and Steven Prestwich and S.

In addition, for each candidate\norder quantity that is identified, our approach can produce an upper and a\nlower bound for the associated cost. We apply our novel approach to three\ndemand distribution in the exponential family: binomial, Poisson, and\nexponential. For two of these distributions we also discuss the extension to\nthe case of unobserved lost sales.
