This turn from physics to language does not only\nextend quantum theory to classical systems but also yield the quantum\nmechanical world view (i.e., the philosophy of quantum mechanics, in other\nwords, quantum philosophy).And we believe that this quantum language is the\nmost powerful language to describe science. The purpose of this paper is to\ndescribe the Monty-Hall problem and the three prisoners problem in quantum\nlanguage. We of course believe that our proposal is the final solutions of the\ntwo problems. Thus in this paper, we can answer the question: \"Why have\nphilosophers continued to stick to these problems?\" And the readers will find\nthat these problems are never elementary, and they can not be solved without\nthe deep understanding of \"probability\" and \"dualism\".\n  KEY WORDS: Philosophy of probability, Fisher Maximum Likelihood Method,\nBayes' Method,The Principle of Equal (a priori) Probabilities\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 13:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ishikawa", "Shiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1809", "submitter": "Robin Evans", "authors": "Robin J.

If latent variables are included in such a model, then\nthe set of possible marginal distributions over the remaining (observed)\nvariables is generally complex, and not represented by any DAG. Larger classes\nof mixed graphical models, which use multiple edge types, have been introduced\nto overcome this; however, these classes do not represent all the models which\ncan arise as margins of DAGs. In this paper we show that this is because\nordinary mixed graphs are fundamentally insufficiently rich to capture the\nvariety of marginal models.\n  We introduce a new class of hyper-graphs, called mDAGs, and a latent\nprojection operation to obtain an mDAG from the margin of a DAG. We show that\neach distinct marginal of a DAG model is represented by at least one mDAG, and\nprovide graphical results towards characterizing when two such marginal models\nare the same. Finally we show that mDAGs correctly capture the marginal\nstructure of causally-interpreted DAGs under interventions on the observed\nvariables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Aug 2014 10:25:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 17:17:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Robin J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4916", "submitter": "Shiro Ishikawa", "authors": "Shiro Ishikawa", "title": "The two envelopes paradox in non-Bayesian and Bayesian statistics", "comments": "17 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this paper is to clarify the (non-Bayesian and Bayesian)\ntwo-envelope problems in terms of quantum language (or, measurement theory),\nwhich was recently proposed as a linguistic turn of quantum mechanics (with the\nCopenhagen interpretation).
