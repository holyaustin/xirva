A challenge often faced by\npractitioners is the selection of the right model to take into account\ndispersion, which typically occurs in count datasets. It is highly desirable to\nhave a unified model that can automatically adapt to the underlying dispersion\nand that can be easily implemented in practice. In this paper, a discrete\nWeibull regression model is shown to be able to adapt in a simple way to\ndifferent types of dispersions relative to Poisson regression: overdispersion,\nunderdispersion and covariate-specific dispersion. Maximum likelihood can be\nused for efficient parameter estimation. The description of the model,\nparameter inference and model diagnostics is accompanied by simulated and real\ndata analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 19:12:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Jul 2016 17:02:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 20:01:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2018 01:36:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Klakattawi", "Hadeel S.", ""], ["Vinciotti", "Veronica", ""], ["Yu", "Keming", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.04351", "submitter": "Scott Bruce", "authors": "Scott Bruce", "title": "A Scalable Framework for NBA Player and Team Comparisons Using Player\n  Tracking Data", "comments": "18 pages including figures and appendices", "journal-ref": "Journal of Sports Analytics 2 (2016) 107-119", "doi": "10.3233/JSA-160022", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The release of NBA player tracking data greatly enhances the granularity and\ndimensionality of basketball statistics used to evaluate and compare player\nperformance. However, the high dimensionality of this new data source can be\ntroublesome as it demands more computational resources and reduces the ability\nto easily interpret findings. Therefore, we must find a way to reduce the\ndimensionality of the data while retaining the ability to differentiate and\ncompare player performance.\n  In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used to identify four\nprincipal components that account for 68% of the variation in player tracking\ndata from the 2013-2014 regular season and intuitive interpretations of these\nnew dimensions are developed by examining the statistics that influence them\nthe most. In this new high variance, low dimensional space, you can easily\ncompare statistical profiles across any or all of the principal component\ndimensions to evaluate characteristics that make certain players and teams\nsimilar or unique. A simple measure of similarity between two player or team\nstatistical profiles based on the four principal component scores is also\nconstructed. The Statistical Diversity Index (SDI) allows for quick and\nintuitive comparisons using the entirety of the player tracking data. As new\nstatistics emerge, this framework is scalable as it can incorporate existing\nand new data sources by reconstructing the principal component dimensions and\nSDI for improved comparisons. Using principal component scores and SDI, several\nuse cases are presented for improved personnel management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 16:40:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 10 Jan 2016 06:01:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bruce", "Scott", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.06013", "submitter": "Roger Hoerl", "authors": "Roger W.

In line with current thinking, we find that the conceptual\ninnovation - to assign prior mass to a general law - is due to a series of\nthree articles by Dorothy Wrinch and Sir Harold Jeffreys (1919, 1921, 1923).\nHowever, our historical investigation also suggests that in 1932 J. B. S.\nHaldane made an important contribution to the development of the Bayes factor\nby proposing the use of a mixture prior comprising a point mass and a\ncontinuous probability density. Jeffreys was aware of Haldane's work and it may\nhave inspired him to pursue a more concrete statistical implementation for his\nconceptual ideas. It thus appears that Haldane may have played a much bigger\nrole in the statistical development of the Bayes factor than has hitherto been\nassumed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 19:51:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Dec 2015 02:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 22:15:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2016 00:05:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Etz", "Alexander", ""], ["Wagenmakers", "Eric-Jan", ""]]}]
