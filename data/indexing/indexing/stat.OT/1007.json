We map the structure of signal flow in directed networks by analysing the\ndegree of edge convergence and the overlap between the in- and output sets of\nan edge. Definitions of convergence degree and overlap are based on the\nshortest paths, thus they encapsulate global network properties. Using the\ndefining notions of convergence degree and overlapping set we clarify the\nmeaning of network causality and demonstrate the crucial role of chordless\ncircles. In real-world networks the flow representation distinguishes nodes\naccording to their signal transmitting, processing and control properties. The\nanalysis of real-world networks in terms of flow representation was in\naccordance with the known functional properties of the network nodes. It is\nshown that nodes with different signal processing, transmitting and control\nproperties are randomly connected at the global scale, while local connectivity\npatterns depart from randomness. Grouping network nodes according to their\nsignal flow properties was unrelated to the network's community structure. We\npresent evidence that signal flow properties of small-world-like, real-world\nnetworks can not be reconstructed by algorithms used to generate small-world\nnetworks. Convergence degree values were calculated for regular oriented trees,\nand its probability density function for networks grown with the preferential\nattachment mechanism. For Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs we calculated both the\nprobability density function of convergence degrees and of overlaps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 16:11:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Dec 2010 21:22:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2011 20:52:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e1nyai", "M.", ""], ["N\u00e9gyessy", "L.", ""], ["Bazs\u00f3", "F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1094", "submitter": "Peter Bubeliny", "authors": "Peter Bubeliny", "title": "Hotelling's test for highly correlated data", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is motivated by the analysis of gene expression sets, especially\nby finding differentially expressed gene sets between two phenotypes.

We discover some unexpected\nproperties of the test making it different from the majority of tests\npreviously used for such data. It appears that the Hotelling's test does not\nalways reach maximal power when all marginal distributions are differentially\nexpressed. For highly correlated data its maximal power is attained when about\na half of marginal distributions are essentially different. For the case when\nthe correlation coefficient is greater than 0.5 this test is more powerful if\nonly one marginal distribution is shifted, omparing to the case when all\nmarginal distributions are equally shifted. Moreover, when the correlation\ncoefficient increases the power of Hotelling's test increases as well.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Jul 2010 10:12:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bubeliny", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.1787", "submitter": "Donald Chambers", "authors": "D.

The predominant\nfocus of reform has been on content, pedagogy, technology and assessment, with\nlittle attention to instructor characteristics. However, there is strong\ntheoretical and empirical evidence that instructors' attitudes impact the\nquality of teaching and learning. The objective of this study was to develop\nand initially validate a scale to measure instructors' attitudes toward\nreform-oriented (or concept-based) teaching of introductory statistics in the\nhealth and behavioral sciences, at the tertiary level. This scale will be\nreferred to as FATS (Faculty Attitudes Toward Statistics). Data were obtained\nfrom 227 instructors (USA and international), and analyzed using factor\nanalysis, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The\noverall scale consists of five sub-scales with a total of 25 items, and an\noverall alpha of 0.89. Construct validity was established. Specifically, the\noverall scale, and subscales (except perceived difficulty) plausibly\ndifferentiated between low-reform and high-reform practice instructors.\nStatistically significant differences in attitude were observed with respect to\nage, but not gender, employment status, membership status in professional\norganizations, ethnicity, highest academic qualification, and degree\nconcentration. This scale can be considered a reliable and valid measure of\ninstructors' attitudes toward reform-oriented (concept-based or constructivist)\nteaching of introductory statistics in the health and behavioral sciences at\nthe tertiary level. These five dimensions influence instructors' attitudes.\nAdditional studies are required to confirm these structural and psychometric\nproperties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jul 2010 17:07:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Hassad", "Rossi A.", ""], ["Coxon", "Anthony P.
