Data science is an important part of modern statistics, but our\nintroductory and second statistics courses often neglect this fact. This paper\ndiscusses ways to provide a practical foundation for students to learn to\n\"compute with data\" as defined by Nolan and Temple Lang (2010), as well as\ndevelop \"data habits of mind\" (Finzer, 2013). We describe how introductory and\nsecond courses can integrate two key precursors to data science: the use of\nreproducible analysis tools and access to large databases. By introducing\nstudents to commonplace tools for data management, visualization, and\nreproducible analysis in data science and applying these to real-world\nscenarios, we prepare them to think statistically in the era of big data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 17:43:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Horton", "Nicholas J", ""], ["Baumer", "Benjamin S", ""], ["Wickham", "Hadley", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.4787", "submitter": "Xianhua Peng", "authors": "Steven Kou and Xianhua Peng", "title": "On the Measurement of Economic Tail Risk", "comments": "51 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.ST stat.AP stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper attempts to provide a decision-theoretic foundation for the\nmeasurement of economic tail risk, which is not only closely related to utility\ntheory but also relevant to statistical model uncertainty. The main result is\nthat the only risk measures that satisfy a set of economic axioms for the\nChoquet expected utility and the statistical property of elicitability (i.e.\nthere exists an objective function such that minimizing the expected objective\nfunction yields the risk measure) are the mean functional and the median\nshortfall, which is the median of tail loss distribution. Elicitability is\nimportant for backtesting. We also extend the result to address model\nuncertainty by incorporating multiple scenarios. As an application, we argue\nthat median shortfall is a better alternative than expected shortfall for\nsetting capital requirements in Basel Accords.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jan 2014 03:55:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 12:49:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 16 Aug 2015 14:48:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kou", "Steven", ""], ["Peng", "Xianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6849", "submitter": "Kyle Vincent Ph.

As arguments favoring and opposing such methodology\nwere discussed, other publications empirically showed that the past development\nof performances followed a non linear trend. Other works, while deeply\nexploring the conditions leading to world records, highlighted that performance\nis tied to the economical and geopolitical context. Here we investigated the\nfollowing human boundaries: development of performances with time in Olympic\nand non-Olympic events, development of sport performances with aging among\nhumans and others species (greyhounds, thoroughbreds, mice). Development of\nperformances from a broader point of view (demography & lifespan) in a specific\nsub-system centered on primary energy was also investigated. We show that the\nphysiological developments are limited with time. Three major and direct\ndeterminants of sport performance are age, technology and climatic conditions\n(temperature). However, all observed developments are related to the\ninternational context including the efficient use of primary energies. This\nlast parameter is a major indirect propeller of performance development. We\nshow that when physiological and societal performance indicators such as\nlifespan and population density depend on primary energies, the energy source,\ncompetition and mobility are key parameters for achieving long term sustainable\ntrajectories. Otherwise, the vast majority (98.7%) of the studied trajectories\nreaches 0 before 15 generations, due to the consumption of fossil energy and a\nlow mobility rate. This led us to consider that in the present turbulent\neconomical context and given the upcoming energy crisis, societal and physical\nperformances are not expected to grow continuously.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 11:31:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-30", "authors_parsed": [["Berthelot", "Geoffroy", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8115", "submitter": "Amelia Sim\\'o", "authors": "M. \\'Angeles Gallego, M.
