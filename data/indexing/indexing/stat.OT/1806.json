Traditional teaching on neuroimaging usually consists of\na series of lectures that emphasize the big picture rather than the foundations\non which the techniques are based. The lectures are often paired with practical\nworkshops in which students run imaging analyses using the graphical interface\nof specific neuroimaging software packages. Our experience suggests that this\ncombination leaves the student with a superficial understanding of the\nunderlying ideas, and an informal, inefficient, and inaccurate approach to\nanalysis. To address these problems, we based our course around a substantial\nopen-ended group project. This allowed us to teach: (a) computational tools to\nensure computationally reproducible work, such as the Unix command line,\nstructured code, version control, automated testing, and code review and (b) a\nclear understanding of the statistical techniques used for a basic analysis of\na single run in an MRI scanner. The emphasis we put on the group project showed\nthe importance of standard computational tools for accuracy, efficiency, and\ncollaboration. The projects were broadly successful in engaging students in\nworking reproducibly on real scientific questions. We propose that a course on\nthis model should be the foundation for future programs in neuroimaging. We\nbelieve it will also serve as a model for teaching efficient and reproducible\nresearch in other fields of computational science.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2018 22:45:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Millman", "K.
