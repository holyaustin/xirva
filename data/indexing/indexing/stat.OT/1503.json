It enables\nresearchers to verify results and to pursuit new research questions with \"old\"\ndata. It is therefore not surprising that data sharing is advocated by funding\nagencies, journals, and researchers alike. We surveyed 2661 individual academic\nresearchers across all disciplines on their dealings with data, their\npublication practices, and motives for sharing or withholding research data.\nThe results for 1564 valid responses show that researchers across disciplines\nrecognise the benefit of secondary research data for their own work and for\nscientific progress as a whole-still they only practice it in moderation. An\nexplanation for this evidence could be an academic system that is not driven by\nmonetary incentives, nor the desire for scientific progress, but by individual\nreputation-expressed in (high ranked journal) publications. We label this\nsystem a Reputation Economy. This special economy explains our findings that\nshow that researchers have a nuanced idea how to provide adequate formal\nrecognition for making data available to others-namely data citations. We\nconclude that data sharing will only be widely adopted among research\nprofessionals if sharing pays in form of reputation. Thus, policy measures that\nintend to foster research collaboration need to understand academia as a\nreputation economy. Successful measures must value intermediate products, such\nas research data, more highly than it is the case now.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 10:54:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Fecher", "Benedikt", ""], ["Friesike", "Sascha", ""], ["Hebing", "Marcel", ""], ["Linek", "Stephanie", ""], ["Sauermann", "Armin", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.00781", "submitter": "Deborah Nolan", "authors": "Deborah Nolan and Jamis Perrett", "title": "Teaching and Learning Data Visualization: Ideas and Assignments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article discusses how to make statistical graphics a more prominent\nelement of the undergraduate statistics curricula.

We develop a mathematical\nmodel of scientific discovery that combines all of these elements. This model\nprovides both a dynamic model of research as well as a formal framework for\nreasoning about the normative structure of science. We show that replication\nmay serve as a ratchet that gradually separates true hypotheses from false, but\nthe same factors that make initial findings unreliable also make replications\nunreliable. The most important factors in improving the reliability of research\nare the rate of false positives and the base rate of true hypotheses, and we\noffer suggestions for addressing each. Our results also bring clarity to verbal\ndebates about the communication of research. Surprisingly, publication bias is\nnot always an obstacle, but instead may have positive impacts---suppression of\nnegative novel findings is often beneficial. We also find that communication of\nnegative replications may aid true discovery even when attempts to replicate\nhave diminished power. The model speaks constructively to ongoing debates about\nthe design and conduct of science, focusing analysis and discussion on precise,\ninternally consistent models, as well as highlighting the importance of\npopulation dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 06:17:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 20:51:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2015 18:01:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["McElreath", "Richard", ""], ["Smaldino", "Paul E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.04620", "submitter": "Myoungwon Cho", "authors": "Myoung Won Cho", "title": "Two symmetry breaking mechanisms for the development of orientation\n  selectivity in a neural system", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.3938/jkps.67.1661", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Orientation selectivity is a remarkable feature of the neurons located in the\nprimary visual cortex.
