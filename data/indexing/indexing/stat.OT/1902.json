The development and\nmaintenance of CQMs involves substantial and ongoing evaluation of the evidence\non the measure's properties: importance, reliability, validity, feasibility,\nand usability. As such, CMS conducts monthly environmental scans of the\npublished clinical and health service literature. Conducting time consuming,\nexhaustive evaluations of the ever-changing healthcare literature presents one\nof the largest challenges to an evidence-based approach to healthcare quality\nimprovement. Thus, it is imperative to leverage automated techniques to aid CMS\nin the identification of clinical and health services literature relevant to\nCQMs. Additionally, the estimated labor hours and related cost savings of using\nCMS Sematrix compared to a traditional literature review are roughly 818 hours\nand 122,000 dollars for a single monthly environmental scan.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 21:26:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Schwemmer", "Michael A.", ""], ["Chen", "Po-Hsu", ""], ["Balakrishna", "Mithun", ""], ["Leibrand", "Amy", ""], ["Leonard", "Aaron", ""], ["McMillan", "Nancy J.", ""], ["Geppert", "Jeffrey J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.02579", "submitter": "Mohammed Zafar Anis", "authors": "Mohammad Ahsanullah, and M.
