On the one hand these technologies enhance security levels, by\ndesigning a trusted operating system. On the other hand these technologies can\nbe taken up into modern malware which is rather hard to detect. None of the\nexisting methods is able to efficiently detect a hypervisor in the face of\ncountermeasures such as time cheating, temporary self uninstalling, memory\nhiding etc. New hypervisor detection methods which will be described in this\npaper can detect a hypervisor under these countermeasures and even count\nseveral nested ones. These novel approaches rely on the new statistical\nanalysis of time discrepancies by examination of a set of instructions, which\nare unconditionally intercepted by a hypervisor. Reliability was achieved\nthrough the comprehensive analysis of the collected data despite its\nfluctuation. These offered methods were comprehensively assessed in both Intel\nand AMD CPUs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 19:50:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Korkin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.04570", "submitter": "Jeffrey Tyler", "authors": "Jeffrey Brian Tyler", "title": "The Two-envelope Problem: An Informed Choice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The host of a game presents two indistinguishable envelopes to an agent. One\nof the envelopes is randomly selected and allocated to the agent. The agent is\ninformed that the monetary content of one of the envelopes is twice that of the\nother. The dilemma is under which conditions it would be beneficial to switch\nthe allocated envelope for the complementary one. The objective of his or her\nenvelope-switching strategy is to determine the benefit of switching the\nallocated envelope and its content for the expected content of the\ncomplementary envelope.\n  The agent, upon revealing the content of the allocated envelope, must\nconsider the events that are likely to have taken place as a result of the\nhost's activities. The preceding approach is in stark contrast to considering\nthe agent's reasoning for a particular outcome that seeks to derive a strategy\nbased on the relative contents of the presented envelopes. However, it is the\nformer reasoning that seeks to identify what the initial amounts could have\nbeen, as a result of the observed amount, that facilitates the identification\nof an appropriate switching strategy.\n  Knowledge of the content and allocation process is essential for the agent to\nderive a successful switching strategy, as is the distribution function from\nwhich the host sampled the initial amount that is assigned to the first\nenvelope.\n  For every play of the game, once the agent is afforded the opportunity of\nsighting the content of the randomly allocated envelope, he or she can\ndetermine the expected benefit of switching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 12:40:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Tyler", "Jeffrey Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.05557", "submitter": "Dhanesh Garg", "authors": "Dhanesh Garg and Staish Kumar", "title": "Exponential Quantum Tsallis Havrda Charvat Entropy of Type Alpha", "comments": "10 pages, no figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "1284489", "categories": "cs.IT math-ph math.IT math.MP stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Entropy is a key measure in studies related to information theory and its\nmany applications.
