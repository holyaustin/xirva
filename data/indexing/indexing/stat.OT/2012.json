This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0\nacross the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore\nsocial factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.\n  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from\nJanuary to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that\nprovided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under\nstudy and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated\nper country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each\ncountry with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable\nMobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status\nwere obtained from external sources.\n  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies\nprovided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to\nexplain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and\n14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.\n  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the\nestimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights\nthe spatial heterogeneity in R0. Higher values were recorded in more developed\ncountries, and countries with an older population or more sustainable mobility.\nCountries with higher population density had lower R0 estimates.

This study measures child mortality at six thresholds: neonatal,\nunder-one (infant), under-two, under-three, under-four, and under-five\nmortality. Using a machine-learning (ML) model for causal inference, this study\nfinds that while an SDC causes an adverse yet statistically insignificant\neffect on neonatal mortality, all other child mortality group samples are\nadversely affected between a probability of 0.12 to 0.14 (all statistically\nsignificant at the 95-percent threshold). Through this ML, this study also\nfinds that the most important treatment heterogeneity moderator, in the entire\nadjustment set, is whether a child is born in a low-income country.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2020 20:57:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Daoud", "Adel", ""]]}]
