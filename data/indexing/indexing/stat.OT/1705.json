We add different levels of the two typical\nnon-Gaussian noises, L\\'evy and stretched Gaussian noises, to exact value of\nthe selected functions including linear equations, polynomial and exponential\nequations, and the maximum absolute and the mean square errors are calculated\nfor the different cases. L\\'evy and stretched Gaussian distributions have many\napplications in fractional and fractal calculus. It is observed that the\nnon-Gaussian noises are less accurately fitted than the Gaussian noise, but the\nstretched Gaussian cases appear to perform better than the L\\'evy noise cases.\nIt is stressed that the least-squares method is inapplicable to the\nnon-Gaussian noise cases when the noise level is larger than 5%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 May 2017 14:38:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 02:00:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Wei", ""], ["Chen", "Wen", ""], ["Liang", "Yingjie", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.03560", "submitter": "Vincent Conitzer", "authors": "Vincent Conitzer", "title": "A Dutch Book against Sleeping Beauties Who Are Evidential Decision\n  Theorists", "comments": "This paper appears in {\\em Synthese}, Volume 192, Issue 9, pp.\n  2887-2899, October 2015.

To attempt to settle the issue, one\nnatural approach consists in creating decision variants of the problem,\ndetermining what actions the various candidate beliefs prescribe, and assessing\nwhether these actions are reasonable when we step back. Dutch book arguments\nare a special case of this approach, but other Sleeping Beauty games have also\nbeen constructed to make similar points. Building on a recent article (James\nR.~Shaw. {\\em De se} belief and rational choice. {\\em Synthese},\n190(3):491-508, 2013), I show that in general we should be wary of such\narguments, because unintuitive actions may result for reasons that are\nunrelated to the beliefs. On the other hand, I show that, when we restrict our\nattention to {\\em additive} games, then a thirder will necessarily maximize her\n{\\em ex ante} expected payout, but a halfer in some cases will not (assuming\ncausal decision theory).
