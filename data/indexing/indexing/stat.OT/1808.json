In an Uncertainty\nQuantification (UQ) framework, such analysis coupled with standard statistical\nanalysis tools such as Probability Density Functions (PDF) can be used to\naugment the understanding of how the uncertainties in the numerical code inputs\ntranslate into uncertainties in the quantity of interest (QoI).\n  In contrast with static representation of most advanced techniques such as\nfunctional Highest Density Region (HDR) boxplot or functional boxplot, f-HOPs\nis a dynamic visualization that enables the practitioners to infer the dynamics\nof the physics and enables to see functional correlations that may exist. While\nthis technique only allows to represent the QoI, we propose a 3-dimensional\nversion of the Kiviat plot to encode all input parameters. This new\nvisualization takes advantage of information from f-HOPs through data\nsonification. All in all, this allows to analyse large datasets within a\nhigh-dimensional parameter space and a functional QoI in the same canvas. The\nproposed method is assessed and showed its benefits on two related\nenvironmental datasets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2018 15:09:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Roy", "Pamphile T.", ""], ["Ricci", "Sophie", ""], ["Cuenot", "B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte", ""], ["Jouhaud", "Jean-Christophe", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.02214", "submitter": "Yiying Zhang", "authors": "Xiaoyu Zhang and Yiying Zhang and Rui Fang", "title": "Allocations of Cold Standbys to Series and Parallel Systems with\n  Dependent Components", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the context of industrial engineering, cold-standby redundancies\nallocation strategy is usually adopted to improve the reliability of coherent\nsystems.

We term the representation `turtleback diagram' for its\nresemblance to the pattern on turtle shells. Adopting the set theoretic view of\nevents and the sample space, the turtleback diagram uses elements from Venn\ndiagrams---set intersection, complement and partition---for conditioning, with\nthe additional notion that the area of a set indicates probability whereas the\nratio of areas for conditional probability. Once parts of the diagram are drawn\nand properly labeled, the calculation of conditional probability involves only\nsimple arithmetic on the area of relevant sets. We discuss turtleback diagrams\nin relation to other visual representations of conditional probability, and\ndetail several scenarios in which turtleback diagrams prove useful. By the\nequivalence of recursive space partition and the tree, the turtleback diagram\nis seen to be equally expressive as the tree diagram for representing abstract\nconcepts. We also provide empirical data on the use of turtleback diagrams with\nundergraduate students in elementary statistics or probability courses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 13:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Yan", "Donghui", ""], ["Davis", "Gary E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.06961", "submitter": "Peter Selinger", "authors": "Peter Selinger and Kristopher Tapp", "title": "On the mathematics of the free-choice paradigm", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Chen and Risen pointed out a logical flaw affecting the conclusions of a\nnumber of past experiments that used the free-choice paradigm to measure\nchoice-induced attitude change.
