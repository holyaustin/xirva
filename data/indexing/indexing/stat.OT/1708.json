We apply\nBayesian networks for developing more accurate overall estimations of\npsychological characteristics of an individual, based on psychological test\nresults, which identify how much an individual possesses a certain trait.\nExamples of traits could be a stress resistance, the readiness to take a risk,\nthe ability to concentrate on certain complicated work. The most common way of\nstudying psychological characteristics of each individual is testing.\nAdditionally, the overall estimation is usually based on personal experiences\nand the subjective perception of a psychologist or a group of psychologists\nabout the investigated psychological personality traits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 09:07:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 06:14:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 6 Oct 2017 10:08:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Litvinenko", "Alexander", ""], ["Litvinenko", "Natalya", ""], ["Mamyrbayev", "Orken", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.04098", "submitter": "Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay", "authors": "Subhadeep Mukhopadhyay", "title": "Statistics Educational Challenge in the 21st Century", "comments": "Invited Opinion Article", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What do we teach and what should we teach?

Furthermore, many economic\nforecasts predict a rising shortage of domestic STEM-trained professions in the\nUS for years to come. One potential solution to this deficit is to decrease the\nrates at which students leave STEM-related fields in higher education, as\ncurrently over half of all students intending to graduate with a STEM degree\neventually attrite. However, little quantitative research at scale has looked\nat causes of STEM attrition, let alone the use of machine learning to examine\nhow well this phenomenon can be predicted. In this paper, we detail our efforts\nto model and predict dropout from STEM fields using one of the largest known\ndatasets used for research on students at a traditional campus setting. Our\nresults suggest that attrition from STEM fields can be accurately predicted\nwith data that is routinely collected at universities using only information on\nstudents' first academic year. We also propose a method to model student STEM\nintentions for each academic term to better understand the timing of STEM\nattrition events. We believe these results show great promise in using machine\nlearning to improve STEM retention in traditional and non-traditional campus\nsettings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:29:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Aulck", "Lovenoor", ""], ["Aras", "Rohan", ""], ["Li", "Lysia", ""], ["L'Heureux", "Coulter", ""], ["Lu", "Peter", ""], ["West", "Jevin", ""]]}]
