Currently, in \\'Electricit\\'e De France (EDF), class load\nprofiles are estimated using point-wise mean function. Unfortunately, it is\nwell known that the mean is highly sensitive to the presence of outliers, such\nas one or more consumers with unusually high-levels of consumption. In this\npaper, we propose an alternative to the mean profile: the $L_1$-median profile\nwhich is more robust. When dealing with large datasets of functional data (load\ncurves for example), survey sampling approaches are useful for estimating the\nmedian profile avoiding storing the whole data. We propose here estimators of\nthe median trajectory using several sampling strategies and estimators. A\ncomparison between them is illustrated by means of a test population. We\ndevelop a stratification based on the linearized variable which substantially\nimproves the accuracy of the estimator compared to simple random sampling\nwithout replacement. We suggest also an improved estimator that takes into\naccount auxiliary information. Some potential areas for future research are\nalso highlighted.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jan 2012 08:53:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Chaouch", "Mohamed", ""], ["Goga", "Camelia", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2590", "submitter": "William Briggs", "authors": "William M.

We are very fortunate in having Constance\nReid's biography \"Neyman -- From Life\" and Erich's \"Reminiscences of a\nStatistician: The Company I Kept\" and other historical material documenting the\nfounding and growth of the department, and the people in it. In what follows,\nwe will draw heavily from these sources, describing what seems to us to be a\nremarkable success story: one person starting \"a cell of statistical research\nand teaching ... not being hampered by any existing traditions and routines\"\nand seeing that cell grow rapidly into a major force in academic statistics\nworldwide. That it has remained so for (at least) the half-century after its\nfounding is a testament to the strength of Neyman's model for a department of\nstatistics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 05:54:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["Speed", "Terry", ""], ["Pitman", "Jim", ""], ["Rice", "John", ""]]}]
