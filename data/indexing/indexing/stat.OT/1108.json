A Bayesian hierarchical approach is typically used to\nproduce such maps, which models the risk surface with a set of spatially smooth\nrandom effects. However, in complex urban settings there are likely to be\nboundaries in the risk surface, which separate populations that are\ngeographically adjacent but have very different risk profiles. Therefore this\npaper proposes an approach for detecting such risk boundaries, and tests its\neffectiveness by simulation. Finally, the model is applied to lung cancer\nincidence data in Greater Glasgow, Scotland, between 2001 and 2005.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Aug 2011 08:31:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Duncan", ""], ["Mitchell", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.3585", "submitter": "Piotr Nowak", "authors": "Piotr Nowak", "title": "Some properties of the moment estimator of shape parameter for the gamma\n  distribution", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Exact distribution of the moment estimator of shape parameter for the gamma\ndistribution for small samples is derived.
