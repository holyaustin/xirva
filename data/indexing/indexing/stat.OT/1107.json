This paper determines some dynamics of fitness\nlandscape which are lead to termination of decision makers' research before\nreaching the global maximum in strategic decisions. These dynamics are\nspecified according to management decision making models and supported with\nsimulation results. This article determines simulation results by means of\n\"Fitness Value\" and \"Probability of Optimality\". Correlation between these two\nconcepts may be remarkable according to revealing optimal values in innovative\nand research-based decision making approaches beside sub-optimal results of\ntraditional decision making approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 11:47:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ilter", "H.

Based on Web of Science data, domain-specific excellence can be\nidentified for cities where highly cited papers are published. Data refer to\nall psychology articles published in 2007 which are documented in the Social\nScience Citation Index and to their citation frequencies from 2007 to May 2011.\nVisualized are 214 cities with an article output of at least 50 in 2007.\nStatistical z tests are used for the evaluation of the degree to which an\nobserved number of top-cited papers (top-10%) for a city differs from the\nnumber expected on the basis of randomness in the selection of papers. Map\nvisualizing city ratios on significant differences between observed and\nexpected numbers of highly-cited papers point at excellence centers in cities\nat the East and West Coast of the United States as well as in Great Britain,\nGermany, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Finland, Australia, and\nTaiwan. Furthermore, positive but non-significant differences in favor of high\ncitation rates are documented for some cities in the United States, Great\nBritain, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian and the German-speaking countries,\nBelgium, France, Spain, Israel, South Korea, and China. Scientometric results\nshow convincingly that highly-cited psychological research articles come from\nthe Anglo-American countries and some of the non-English European countries in\nwhich the number of English-language publications has increased during the last\ndecades.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 09:22:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bornmann", "Lutz", ""], ["Leydesdorff", "Loet", ""], ["Krampen", "G\u00fcnter", ""]]}]
