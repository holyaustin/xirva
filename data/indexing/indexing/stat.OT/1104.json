During the traditional festival of\nSechsel\\\"auten, which takes place each spring in Zurich, Switzerland, the\nB\\\"o\\\"ogg is placed atop a wooden pyre, which is set alight. According to\npopular legend, the time that elapses until the B\\\"o\\\"ogg's head explodes (the\n\"head-bang\" time) is said to give a rough forecast of local weather conditions\nprevailing during the following summer. However, recent research has questioned\nthe validity of this prediction. To study the B\\\"o\\\"ogg's predictive powers, we\nanalyzed the B\\\"o\\\"ogg head-bang time record from 1965-2010 within the context\nof global climate change. Our analysis shows that the B\\\"o\\\"ogg head-bang time\nis a good predictor not of short-term local weather, as might be expected from\nthe legend, but of the behavior of the entire global climate system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 03:23:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Brennwald", "M.
