The intrinsic integral measure based on\nthe overlap of corresponding mixture components is often analytically\nintractable. This is also the case for Gaussian mixture models with unequal\ncovariance matrices when space dimension $d > 1$. In this work we focus on\nGaussian mixture models and at the sample level we assume the class assignments\nto be known. We derive a measure of component overlap based on eigenvalues of a\ngeneralized eigenproblem that represents Fisher's discriminant task. We explain\nrationale behind it and present simulation results that show how well it can\nreflect the behavior of the integral measure in its linear approximation. The\nanalyzed coefficient possesses the advantage of being analytically tractable\nand numerically computable even in complex setups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jul 2014 00:30:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Nowakowska", "Ewa", ""], ["Koronacki", "Jacek", ""], ["Lipovetsky", "Stan", ""]]}]
