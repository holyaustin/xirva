Climate conditions have\ndirect and indirect impacts on vector abundance and virus dynamics within the\nmosquito. The significance of environmental variables as drivers in WNV\nepidemiology is increasing under the current climate change scenario. In this\nstudy, we used a machine learning algorithm to model WNV distributions in South\nAmerica. Our model evaluated eight environmental variables (type of biome,\nannual temperature, seasonality of temperature, daytime temperature variation,\nthermal amplitude, seasonality of precipitation, annual rainfall, and\nelevation) for their contribution to the occurrence of WNV since its\nintroduction in South America (2004). Our results showed that environmental\nvariables can directly alter the occurrence of WNV, with lower precipitation\nand higher temperatures associated with increased virus incidence. High-risk\nareas may be modified in the coming years, becoming more evident with high\ngreenhouse gas emission levels. Countries such as Bolivia and Paraguay will be\ngreatly affected, drastically changing their current WNV distribution. Several\nBrazilian areas will also increase the likelihood of presenting WNV, mainly in\nthe Northeast and Midwest regions and the Pantanal biome. The Galapagos Islands\nwill also probably increase their geographic range suitable for WNV occurrence.\nIt is necessary to develop preventive policies to minimize potential WNV\ninfection in humans and enhance active epidemiological surveillance in birds,\nhumans, and other mammals before it becomes a more significant public health\nproblem in South America.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 21:48:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-05", "authors_parsed": [["Lorenz", "Camila", ""], ["de Azevedo", "Thiago Salomao", ""], ["Chiaravalloti-Neto", "Francisco", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.01107", "submitter": "Felix Ambellan", "authors": "Felix Ambellan, Stefan Zachow, Christoph von Tycowicz", "title": "Geodesic B-Score for Improved Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis", "comments": "To be published in: Proc.
