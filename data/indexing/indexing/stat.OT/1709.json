When we have picked one of each, should\nwe aggregate first and then fix, or fix first and then aggregate? Or should we\ntry to do both at once?

We will examine an application of the distance\ncorrelation coefficient to data drawn from large astrophysical databases, where\nit is desired to classify galaxies according to various types. Further, the\nlecture will analyze data arising in the ongoing national discussion of the\nrelationship between state-by-state homicide rates and the stringency of state\nlaws governing firearm ownership.\n  The lecture will also describe a remarkable singular integral which lies at\nthe core of the theory of the distance correlation coefficient. We will see\nthat this singular integral admits generalizations to the truncated Maclaurin\nexpansions of the cosine function and to the theory of spherical functions on\nsymmetric cones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 16:55:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Richards", "Donald St. P.", ""]]}]
