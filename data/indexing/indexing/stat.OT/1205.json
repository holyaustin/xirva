We establish large sample\nproperties of the estimator without assuming Gaussianity. The class of models\nconsidered here satisfies simple conditions on the spectral density function,\nrestricted to a small neighborhood of the zero frequency and includes important\nclass of VARFIMA processes.

A composite likelihood approach based on\nthe bivariate distribution of block maxima has been recently proposed in the\nliterature. However modeling block maxima is a wasteful approach provided that\nother information is available. Moreover an approach based on block, typically\nannual, maxima is unable to take into account the fact that maxima occur or not\nsimultaneously. If time series of, say, daily data are available, then\nestimation procedures based on exceedances of a high threshold could mitigate\nsuch problems. In this paper we focus on two approaches for composing\nlikelihoods based on pairs of exceedances. The first one comes from the tail\napproximation for bivariate distribution proposed by Ledford and Tawn (1996)\nwhen both pairs of observations exceed the fixed threshold. The second one uses\nthe bivariate extension (Rootzen and Tajvidi, 2006) of the generalized Pareto\ndistribution which allows to model exceedances when at least one of the\ncomponents is over the threshold. The two approaches are compared through a\nsimulation study according to different degrees of spatial dependency. Results\nshow that both the strength of the spatial dependencies and the threshold\nchoice play a fundamental role in determining which is the best estimating\nprocedure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 May 2012 06:47:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Bacro", "Jean-Noel", ""], ["Gaetan", "Carlo", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.3217", "submitter": "Mauricio Sadinle", "authors": "Mauricio Sadinle, Stephen E.
