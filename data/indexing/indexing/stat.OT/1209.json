It is shown that Q exhibits a\nFisher-Snedecor F-distribution whose degrees of freedom are governed by the\nnumber of simultaneously excited cavity modes per stir state. The most probable\nvalue of Q is between a fraction 2/9 and 1 of its mean value, and between a\nfraction 4/9 and 1 of its asymptotic (composite Q) value. The arithmetic mean\nvalue is found to always exceed the values of all other theoretical metrics for\ncentrality of Q. For a rectangular cavity, we retrieve the known asymptotic Q\nin the limit of highly overmoded regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2012 17:44:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Arnaut", "L.

A novel expression is\nderived for a bound on the mean square angular error of factors along a\nselected dimension of a tensor of an arbitrary dimension. The expression needs\nless operations for computing the bound, O(NR^6), than the best existing\nstate-of-the art algorithm, O(N^3R^6) operations, where N and R are the tensor\norder and the tensor rank. Insightful expressions are derived for tensors of\nrank 1 and rank 2 of arbitrary dimension and for tensors of arbitrary dimension\nand rank, where two factor matrices have orthogonal columns.\n  The results can be used as a gauge of performance of different approximate CP\ndecomposition algorithms, prediction of their accuracy, and for checking\nstability of a given decomposition of a tensor (condition whether the CRLB is\nfinite or not). A novel expression is derived for a Hessian matrix needed in\npopular damped Gauss-Newton method for solving the CP decomposition of tensors\nwith missing elements. Beside computing the CRLB for these tensors the\nexpression may serve for design of damped Gauss-Newton algorithm for the\ndecomposition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 15:06:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Dec 2012 16:27:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Tichavsky", "Petr", ""], ["Phan", "Anh Huy", ""], ["Koldovsky", "Zbynek", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.4019", "submitter": "Giles Hooker", "authors": "Leifur Thorbergsson and Giles Hooker", "title": "Experimental design for Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes", "comments": "39 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper deals with the question of how to most effectively conduct\nexperiments in Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes so as to provide\ndata that is most informative about a parameter of interest.
