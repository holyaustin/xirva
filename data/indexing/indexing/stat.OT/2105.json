In our approach, we\nemploy a Nonhomogeneous Poisson Process (NHPP) model for estimating\nspatially-varying probability distributions of damage as a function of\nhurricane wind field velocities. Specifically, we consider a physically-based,\nquadratic NHPP model for failures of overhead assets in electricity\ndistribution systems. The wind field velocities are provided by Forecasts of\nHurricanes using Large-Ensemble Outputs (FHLO), a framework for generating\nprobabilistic hurricane forecasts. We use FHLO in conjunction with the NHPP\nmodel, such that the hurricane forecast uncertainties represented by FHLO are\naccounted for in estimating the probability distributions of damage.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the spatial variability and extent of hurricane damage\nunder key wind field parameters (intensity, size, and asymmetries). By applying\nour approach to prediction of power outages (loss-of-service) in northwestern\nFlorida due to Hurricane Michael (2018), we demonstrate a statistically\nsignificant relationship between outage rate and failure rate. Finally, we\nformulate parametric models that relate total damage and financial losses to\nthe hurricane parameters of intensity and size. Overall, this paper's findings\nsuggest that our approach is well-suited to jointly account for spatial\nvariability and forecast uncertainty in the damage estimates, and is readily\napplicable to prediction of system loss-of-service due to the damage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 May 2021 20:36:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Chang", "Derek", ""], ["Emanuel", "Kerry", ""], ["Amin", "Saurabh", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.03557", "submitter": "Wenpo Yao", "authors": "Wenpo Yao and Wenli Yao", "title": "Comparative analysis of the original and amplitude permutations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT stat.ME", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We compare the two basic ordinal patterns, i.e., the original and amplitude\npermutations, used to characterize vector structures.
