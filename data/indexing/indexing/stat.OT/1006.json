The\nbasic metaphor of decision theory is the maximization of a gambler's expected\nfortune, according to his own subjective utility, prior beliefs an learned\nexperiences. This metaphor has proven to be very useful, leading the\ndevelopment of Bayesian statistics since its XX-th century revival, rooted on\nthe work of de Finetti, Savage and others. The basic metaphor presented in this\ntext, as a foundation for cognitive constructivism, is that of an\neigen-solution, and the verification of its objective epistemic status. The\nFBST - Full Bayesian Significance Test - is the cornerstone of a set of\nstatistical tolls conceived to assess the epistemic value of such\neigen-solutions, according to their four essential attributes, namely,\nsharpness, stability, separability and composability. We believe that this\nalternative perspective, complementary to the one ofered by decision theory,\ncan provide powerful insights and make pertinent contributions in the context\nof scientific research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 21:15:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 17:30:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Jul 2011 15:02:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 20:12:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 4 Oct 2013 00:27:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 12:28:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Wed, 4 Mar 2020 18:45:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 16:19:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Stern", "J.

A dynamic treatment regime is\na sequence of decision rules, with a decision rule per stage of clinical\nintervention; each decision rule maps up-to-date patient information to a\nrecommended treatment. We briefly review a variety of approaches for using data\nto construct the decision rules. We then review an interesting challenge, that\nof nonregularity that often arises in this area. By nonregularity, we mean the\nparameters indexing the optimal dynamic treatment regime are nonsmooth\nfunctionals of the underlying generative distribution.\n  A consequence is that no regular or asymptotically unbiased estimator of\nthese parameters exists. Nonregularity arises in inference for parameters in\nthe optimal dynamic treatment regime; we illustrate the effect of nonregularity\non asymptotic bias and via sensitivity of asymptotic, limiting, distributions\nto local perturbations. We propose and evaluate a locally consistent Adaptive\nConfidence Interval (ACI) for the parameters of the optimal dynamic treatment\nregime. We use data from the Adaptive Interventions for Children with ADHD\nstudy as an illustrative example. We conclude by highlighting and discussing\nemerging theoretical problems in this area.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 11:10:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Nov 2011 21:00:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 16:54:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Laber", "Eric B.", ""], ["Qian", "Min", ""], ["Lizotte", "Dan J.", ""], ["Pelham", "William E.", ""], ["Murphy", "Susan A.", ""]]}]
