This practice allows new\nfeatures to be seamlessly added when desired, and unwanted features to be\nremoved, thus simplifying the user-facing view of the software. The recent rise\nof web-based software applications has presented new challenges for designing\nan extensible, modular software system. In this paper, we outline a framework\nfor designing such a system, with a focus on reproducibility of the results. We\npresent as a case study a Shiny-based web application called intRo, that allows\nthe user to perform basic data analyses and statistical routines. Finally, we\nhighlight some challenges we encountered, and how to address them, when\ncombining modular programming concepts with reactive programming as used by\nShiny.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Aug 2016 17:53:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 21:21:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hare", "Eric", ""], ["Kaplan", "Andee", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04843", "submitter": "Andee Kaplan", "authors": "Andee Kaplan and Eric Hare", "title": "Putting Down Roots: A Graphical Exploration of Community Attachment", "comments": "16 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s0018", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we explore the relationships that individuals have with their\ncommunities. This work was prepared as part of the ASA Data Expo '13 sponsored\nby the Graphics Section and the Computing Section, using data provided by the\nKnight Foundation Soul of the Community survey. The Knight Foundation in\ncooperation with Gallup surveyed 43,000 people over three years in 26\ncommunities across the United States with the intention of understanding the\nassociation between community attributes and the degree of attachment people\nfeel towards their community. These include the different facets of both urban\nand rural communities, the impact of quality education, and the trend in the\nperceived economic conditions of a community over time. The goal of our work is\nto facilitate understanding of why people feel attachment to their communities\nthrough the use of an interactive and web-based visualization. We will explain\nthe development and use of web-based interactive graphics, including an\noverview of the R package Shiny and the JavaScript library D3, focusing on the\nchoices made in producing the visualizations and technical aspects of how they\nwere created. Then we describe the stories about community attachment that\nunfolded from our analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 03:26:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kaplan", "Andee", ""], ["Hare", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.05810", "submitter": "Kayvan Sadeghi", "authors": "Steffen Lauritzen and Kayvan Sadeghi", "title": "Unifying Markov Properties for Graphical Models", "comments": "31 Pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Several types of graphs with different conditional independence\ninterpretations --- also known as Markov properties --- have been proposed and\nused in graphical models. In this paper we unify these Markov properties by\nintroducing a class of graphs with four types of edges --- lines, arrows, arcs,\nand dotted lines --- and a single separation criterion. We show that\nindependence structures defined by this class specialize to each of the\npreviously defined cases, when suitable subclasses of graphs are considered. In\naddition, we define a pairwise Markov property for the subclass of chain mixed\ngraphs which includes chain graphs with the LWF interpretation, as well as\nsummary graphs (and consequently ancestral graphs). We prove the equivalence of\nthis pairwise Markov property to the global Markov property for compositional\ngraphoid independence models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Aug 2016 11:25:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Aug 2016 19:14:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 16:53:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 17:38:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lauritzen", "Steffen", ""], ["Sadeghi", "Kayvan", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.06330", "submitter": "Yaakov Malinovsky", "authors": "Yaakov Malinovsky and Paul S.

Much of the theoretical framework of group testing was\ndeveloped starting in the late 1950s, with continued work into the 1990s.\nRecently, with the advent of new laboratory and genetic technologies, there has\nbeen an increasing interest in group testing designs for cost saving purposes.\nIn this paper, we compare different nested designs, including Dorfman, Sterrett\nand an optimal nested procedure obtained through dynamic programming. To\nelucidate these comparisons, we develop closed-form expressions for the optimal\nSterrett procedure and provide a concise review of the prior literature for\nother commonly used procedures. We consider designs where the prevalence of\ndisease is known as well as investigate the robustness of these procedures when\nit is incorrectly assumed.
