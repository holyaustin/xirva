Our central hypothesis is that the observed\nracial disparities in incarceration rates between Black and White Americans can\nbe explained as the result of differential sentencing between the two\ndemographic groups. We demonstrate that if incarceration can be spread through\na social influence network, then even relatively small differences in\nsentencing can result in the large disparities in incarceration rates.\nControlling for effects of transmissibility, susceptibility, and influence\nnetwork structure, our model reproduces the observed large disparities in\nincarceration rates given the differences in sentence lengths for White and\nBlack drug offenders in the United States without extensive parameter tuning.\nWe further establish the suitability of the SIS model as applied to\nincarceration, as the observed structural patterns of recidivism are an\nemergent property of the model. In fact, our model shows a remarkably close\ncorrespondence with California incarceration data, without requiring any\nparameter tuning. This work advances efforts to combine the theories and\nmethods of epidemiology and criminology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 20:12:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lum", "Kristian", ""], ["Swarup", "Samarth", ""], ["Eubank", "Stephen", ""], ["Hawdon", "James", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.2211", "submitter": "Pierpaolo Vivo", "authors": "Ricardo Marino, Satya N.
