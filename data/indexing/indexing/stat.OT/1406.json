It is very easy to use, estimating a team's winning\npercentage from the runs they score and allow. This data is readily available\non standings pages; no computationally intensive simulations are needed.\nNormally accurate to within a few games per season, it allows teams to\ndetermine how much a run is worth in different situations. This determination\nhelps solve some of the most important economic decisions a team faces: How\nmuch is a player worth, which players should be pursued, and how much should\nthey be offered. We discuss the formula and these applications in detail, and\nprovide a theoretical justification, both for the formula as well as simpler\nlinear estimators of a team's winning percentage. The calculations and modeling\nare discussed in detail, and when possible multiple proofs are given. We\nanalyze the 2012 season in detail, and see that the data for that and other\nrecent years support our modeling conjectures. We conclude with a discussion of\nwork in progress to generalize the formula and increase its predictive power\n\\emph{without} needing expensive simulations, though at the cost of requiring\nplay-by-play data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 04:33:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Steven J.", ""], ["Corcoran", "Taylor", ""], ["Gossels", "Jennifer", ""], ["Luo", "Victor", ""], ["Porfilio", "Jaclyn", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.0913", "submitter": "Federico  Holik", "authors": "F.
