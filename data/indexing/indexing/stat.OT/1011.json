During his service as a meteorologist in the Army in World War II,\nJim played poker and made weather forecasts. It is curious that his later\nresearch included strategies for repeated play that apply to selecting the best\nforecaster. James Hannan was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts on September 14,\n1922. He attended St. Jerome's High School and in January 1943 received the\nPh.B. from St. Michael's College in Colchester, Vermont. Jim enlisted in the US\nArmy Air Force to train and serve as a meteorologist. This took him to army\nairbases in China by the close of the war. Following discharge from the army,\nJim studied mathematics at Harvard and graduated with the M.S. in June 1947. To\nprepare for doctoral work in statistics at the University of North Carolina\nthat fall, Jim went to the University of Michigan in the summer of 1947. The\nroutine admissions' physical revealed a spot on the lung and the possibility of\ntuberculosis. This caused Jim to stay at Ann Arbor through the fall of 1947 and\nthen at a Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Massachusetts to have\nhis condition followed more closely. He was discharged from the hospital in the\nspring and started his study at Chapel Hill in the fall of 1948. There he began\nresearch in compound decision theory under Herbert Robbins. Feeling the need\nfor teaching experience, Jim left Chapel Hill after two years and short of\nthesis to take a three year appointment as an instructor at Catholic University\nin Washington, DC. When told that renewal was not coming, Jim felt pressure to\nfinish his degree.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Nov 2010 13:52:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gilliland", "Dennis", ""], ["Ramamoorthi", "R.

He completed a B.Eng. degree in Chemical Engineering in\n1945 at McGill University and worked as a Research Engineer on the Atomic\nEnergy Project for the National Research Council of Canada from 1945 to 1950.\nHe then went to Iowa State College, where he completed a M.Sc. and a Ph.D.\ndegree in Statistics in 1953 and 1955, respectively. After a one-year post-doc\nwith John Tukey, he became Assistant Director of the Statistical Techniques\nResearch Group at Princeton University in 1956--1957, and then served as\nProfessor and Director of Research in Statistics at Rutgers University from\n1959 to 1963. In parallel, he also had a 14-year career at Bell Laboratories,\nMurray Hill, New Jersey. From 1956 to 1969, he was in turn Member of Technical\nStaff, Head of the Statistical Models and Methods Research Department, and\nStatistical Director in Management Sciences Research. He wrote a number of\ninfluential papers in statistical methodology during that period, notably\ntesting procedures for normality (the Shapiro--Wilk statistic) and probability\nplotting techniques for multivariate data. In 1970, Martin moved into higher\nmanagement levels of the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) Company. He\noccupied various positions culminating as Assistant Vice-President and Director\nof Corporate Planning. In 1980, he returned to Canada and became the first\nprofessional statistician to serve as Chief Statistician. His accomplishments\nat Statistics Canada were numerous and contributed to a resurgence of the\ninstitution's international standing. He played a crucial role in the\nreinstatement of the Cabinet-cancelled 1986 Census.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Nov 2010 11:44:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Genest", "Christian", ""], ["Brackstone", "Gordon", ""]]}]
