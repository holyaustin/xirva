An appropriate\nmetric is introduced in order to measure the error between the observed and the\npredicted distributions. In particular, the Wasserstein distance is proposed.\nSome properties of such metric are exploited to predict the response variable\nas direct linear combination of other independent histogram variables. Measures\nof goodness of fit are discussed. An application on real data corroborates the\nproposed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 14:38:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Jul 2012 20:04:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Irpino", "Antonio", ""], ["Verde", "Rosanna", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.3468", "submitter": "Saeed Abdallah", "authors": "Saeed Abdallah and Ioannis N.
