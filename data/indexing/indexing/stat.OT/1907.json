Victoria Stodden has claimed that the computer is an\nanalog for Boyle's pump -- another kind of scientific instrument that needs\ndetailed descriptions of how it generates results. In the place of Boyle's\nhand-written notes, we now expect code in open source programming languages to\nbe available to enable others to reproduce and extend computational\nexperiments. In this paper we show that there is another genealogy for\nreproducibility, starting at least from Euclid, in the production of proofs in\nmathematics. Proofs have a distinctive quality of being necessarily\nreproducible, and are the cornerstone of mathematical science. However, the\ntask of the modern mathematical scientist has drifted from that of blackboard\nrhetorician, where the craft of proof reigned, to a scientific workflow that\nnow more closely resembles that of an experimental scientist. So, what is proof\nin modern mathematics? And, if proof is unattainable in other fields, what is\ndue scientific diligence in a computational experimental environment? How do we\nmeasure truth in the context of uncertainty? Adopting a manner of Lakatosian\nconversant conjecture between two mathematicians, we examine how proof informs\nour practice of computational statistical inquiry.
