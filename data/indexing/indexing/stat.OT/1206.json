This method, referred to as nGpFBMP, performs Bayesian\nestimates of sparse signals even when the signal prior is non-Gaussian or\nunknown. It is agnostic on signal statistics and utilizes a priori statistics\nof additive noise and the sparsity rate of the signal, which are shown to be\neasily estimated from data if not available. nGpFBMP utilizes a greedy approach\nand order-recursive updates of its metrics to find the most dominant sparse\nsupports to determine the approximate minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate\nof the sparse signal. Simulation results demonstrate the power and robustness\nof our proposed estimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2012 13:50:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Masood", "Mudassir", ""], ["Al-Naffouri", "Tareq", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.5478", "submitter": "Demetris Christopoulos", "authors": "Demetris T.
