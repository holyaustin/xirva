This paper presents an intuitive analytical model for the temporal\nevolution of large grids and uses it to understand common structural features\nobserved in grids across America. In particular, key graph parameters like\ndegree distribution, graph diameter, betweenness centralities, eigen-spread and\nclustering coefficients, as well as graph processes like infection propagation\nare used to quantify the model's benefits through comparison with the Western\nUS and ERCOT power grids. The most significant contribution of the developed\nmodel is its analytical tractability, that provides a closed form expression\nfor the nodal degree distribution observed in large grids. The discussed model\ncan be used to generate realistic test cases to analyze topological effects on\ngrid functioning and new grid technologies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Apr 2012 05:03:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 20:08:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 01:36:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Deka", "Deepjyoti", ""], ["Vishwanath", "Sriram", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.1561", "submitter": "Peter Sasvari", "authors": "Peter Sasvari", "title": "The macroeconomic effect of the information and communication technology\n  in Hungary", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and\n  Applications (IJACSA), Vol. 2, No. 12, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CY q-fin.GN stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It was not until the beginning of the 1990s that the effects of information\nand communication technology on economic growth as well as on the profitability\nof enterprises raised the interest of researchers. After giving a general\ndescription on the relationship between a more intense use of ICT devices and\ndynamic economic growth, the author identified and explained those four\nchannels that had a robust influence on economic growth and productivity. When\ncomparing the use of information technonology devices in developed as well as\nin developing countries, the author highlighted the importance of the available\nadditional human capital and the elimination of organizational inflexibilities\nin the attempt of narrowing the productivity gap between the developed and\ndeveloping nations. By processing a large quantitiy of information gained from\nHungarian enterprises operating in several economic sectors, the author made an\nattempt to find a strong correlation between the development level of using ICT\ndevices and profitability together with total factor productivity. Although the\nimpact of using ICT devices cannot be measured unequivocally at the\nmicroeconomic level because of certain statistical and methodological\nimperfections, by applying such analytical methods as cluster analysis and\ncorrelation and regression calculation, the author managed to prove that both\nthe correlation coefficient and the gradient of the regression trend line\nshowed a positive relationship between the extensive use of information and\ncommunication technology and the profitability of enterprises.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 20:45:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sasvari", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.2410", "submitter": "Marius Hofert", "authors": "Marius Hofert, David Pham", "title": "Densities of nested Archimedean copulas", "comments": "25 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.CO stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nested Archimedean copulas recently gained interest since they generalize the\nwell-known class of Archimedean copulas to allow for partial asymmetry.\nSampling algorithms and strategies have been well investigated for nested\nArchimedean copulas.

The LMPIT is the optimal test for the case of close\nhypotheses, among those satisfying the invariances of the problem, and in\npractical scenarios can provide better performance than the typically used\ngeneralized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). The derivation of the LMPIT usually\nrequires one to find the maximal invariant statistic for the detection problem\nand then derive its distribution under both hypotheses, which in general is a\nrather involved procedure. As an alternative, Wijsman's theorem provides the\nratio of the maximal invariant densities without even finding an explicit\nexpression for the maximal invariant. We first consider the problem of testing\nwhether a set of $N$-dimensional Gaussian random vectors are uncorrelated or\nnot, and show that the LMPIT is given by the Frobenius norm of the sample\ncoherence matrix. Second, we study the case in which the vectors under the null\nhypothesis are uncorrelated and identically distributed, that is, the\nsphericity test for Gaussian vectors, for which we show that the LMPIT is given\nby the Frobenius norm of a normalized version of the sample covariance matrix.\nFinally, some numerical examples illustrate the performance of the proposed\ntests, which provide better results than their GLRT counterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Apr 2012 12:11:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 12:20:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Ram\u00edrez", "D.", ""], ["V\u00eda", "J.", ""], ["Santamar\u00eda", "I.", ""], ["Scharf", "L.
