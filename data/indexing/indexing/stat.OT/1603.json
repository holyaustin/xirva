Each job is associated with a hidden label drawn from\nsome prior distribution. An inspection by an expert produces a noisy outcome\nthat depends both on the job's hidden label and the type of the expert, and\noccupies the expert for a finite time duration. A decision maker's task is to\ndynamically assign inspections so that the resulting outcomes can be used to\naccurately recover the labels of all jobs, while keeping the system stable.\nAmong our chief motivations are applications in crowd-sourcing, diagnostics,\nand experiment designs, where one wishes to efficiently learn the nature of a\nlarge number of items, using a finite pool of computational resources or human\nagents.\n  We focus on the capacity of such an information processing system. Given a\nlevel of accuracy guarantee, we ask how many experts are needed in order to\nstabilize the system, and through what inspection architecture. Our main result\nprovides an adaptive inspection policy that is asymptotically optimal in the\nfollowing sense: the ratio between the required number of experts under our\npolicy and the theoretical optimal converges to one, as the probability of\nerror in label recovery tends to zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 01:34:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2016 05:10:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Massoulie", "Laurent", ""], ["Xu", "Kuang", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.00738", "submitter": "Nick Watkins", "authors": "Nicholas Wynn Watkins", "title": "Mandelbrot's 1/f fractional renewal models of 1963-67: The non-ergodic\n  missing link between change points and long range dependence", "comments": "11 pages.

This was accompanied by single-sensor and\nmultisensor versions of a claimed generalization of the PHD filter, the\n\"iFilter.\" Then in 2013 in the Journal of Advances in Information Fusion (JAIF)\nand elsewhere, the same author went on to claim that the FISST\np.g.fl./functional derivative approach is actually \"due to\" (a \"corollary\" of)\na 50-year-old pure-mathematics paper by Moyal; and described a \"point process\"\np.g.fl./functional derivative approach to multitarget tracking supposedly based\non it. In this paper it is shown that: (1)non-RFS point processes are a\nphenomenologically erroneous foundation for multitarget tracking; (2) nearly\nevery equation, concept, discussion, derivation, and methodology in the JAIF\npaper originally appeared in FISST publications, without being so attributed;\n(3) FISST cannot possibly be \"due to Moyal\"; (4) the \"point process\" approach\ndescribed in JAIF differs from FISST only in regard to terminology and\nnotation, and thus in this sense appears to be an obscured, phenomenologically\nerroneous, and improperly attributed copy of FISST. It is also shown that the\nderivations of the single-sensor and multisensory iFilter appear to have had\nmajor errors, as did a subsequent recasting of the multisensor iFilter as a\n\"traffic mapping filter.\"\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 03:59:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Mar 2018 20:09:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Mahler", "Ronald", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.04912", "submitter": "Johanna Hardin", "authors": "Johanna Hardin", "title": "Dynamic Data in the Statistics Classroom", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The call for using real data in the classroom has long meant using datasets\nwhich are culled, cleaned, and wrangled prior to any student working with the\nobservations.

Further insight is provided by showing\nthat the R\\'enyi and Tsallis entropy functions translated to the probability\ndomain are both the weighted generalized mean of the distribution.

Suppose\n(X,Y) denotes a risk vector pertaining to two components in some system. A\nrelevant measurement of risk contagion would be to quantify the amount of\ninfluence of high values of Y on X. This can be measured in a variety of ways.\nIn this paper, we study two such measures: the quantity E[max(X-t,0)|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Mean Excess (MME) as well as the related quantity E[X|Y > t]\ncalled Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES). Both quantities are indicators of\nrisk contagion and useful in various applications ranging from finance,\ninsurance and systemic risk to environmental and climate risk. We work under\nthe assumptions of multivariate regular variation, hidden regular variation and\nasymptotic tail independence for the risk vector (X,Y). Many broad and useful\nmodel classes satisfy these assumptions. We present several examples and derive\nthe asymptotic behavior of both MME and MES as the threshold t tends to\ninfinity. We observe that although we assume asymptotic tail independence in\nthe models, MME and MES converge to 1 under very general conditions; this\nreflects that the underlying weak dependence in the model still remains\nsignificant. Besides the consistency of the empirical estimators, we introduce\nan extrapolation method based on extreme value theory to estimate both MME and\nMES for high thresholds t where little data are available. We show that these\nestimators are consistent and illustrate our methodology in both simulated and\nreal data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 22:43:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 00:57:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Bikramjit", ""], ["Fasen", "Vicky", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.09453", "submitter": "James Wilson", "authors": "William H.
