Temporal dynamics are modeled as a discrete Markov process specified\nthrough individual transition distributions for each actor in the system at a\ngiven time. We prove that these distributions have an analytic closed form\nunder certain conditions and use the result to develop likelihood-based\ninference. We provide a computational framework to enable both simulation and\ninference in practice. Finally, we demonstrate the value of these models by\nanalyzing alcohol and drug use over time in the context of adolescent\nfriendship networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 22:30:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["EmBree", "Joshua D.", ""], ["Handcock", "Mark S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.00290", "submitter": "Mark O'Connell", "authors": "Mark O'Connell, Catherine B.

In particular,\nmuch work has been done recently to generalize principal component analysis\n(PCA), the method of dimension reduction in linear spaces, to Riemannian\nmanifolds. One such generalization is known as principal geodesic analysis\n(PGA). This paper, in a novel fashion, obtains Taylor expansions in scaling\nparameters introduced in the domain of objective functions in PGA. It is shown\nthis technique not only leads to better closed-form approximations of PGA but\nalso reveals the effects that scale, curvature and the distribution of data\nhave on solutions to PGA and on their differences to first-order tangent space\napproximations. This approach should be able to be applied not only to PGA but\nalso to other generalizations of PCA and more generally to other intrinsic\nstatistics on Riemannian manifolds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 17:23:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 17:44:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Lazar", "Drew", ""], ["Lin", "Lizhen", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.02608", "submitter": "Lois Curfman McInnes", "authors": "Ulrich R\\\"ude, Karen Willcox, Lois Curfman McInnes, Hans De Sterck,\n  George Biros, Hans Bungartz, James Corones, Evin Cramer, James Crowley, Omar\n  Ghattas, Max Gunzburger, Michael Hanke, Robert Harrison, Michael Heroux, Jan\n  Hesthaven, Peter Jimack, Chris Johnson, Kirk E.
