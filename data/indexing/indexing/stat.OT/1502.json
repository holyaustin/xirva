The Gumbel distribution has certain drawbacks because it is a\nnon-heavy-tailed distribution and is characterized by constant skewness and\nkurtosis. The generalized extreme value distribution is frequently used in this\ncontext because it encompasses the three possible limiting distributions for a\nnormalized maximum of infinite samples of independent and identically\ndistributed observations. However, the generalized extreme value distribution\nmight not be a suitable model when each observed maximum does not come from a\nlarge number of observations. Hence, other forms of generalizations of the\nGumbel distribution might be preferable. Our goal is to collect in the present\nliterature the distributions that contain the Gumbel distribution embedded in\nthem and to identify those that have flexible skewness and kurtosis, are\nheavy-tailed and could be competitive with the generalized extreme value\ndistribution. The generalizations of the Gumbel distribution are described and\ncompared using an application to a wind speed data set and Monte Carlo\nsimulations. We show that some distributions suffer from overparameterization\nand coincide with other generalized Gumbel distributions with a smaller number\nof parameters, i.e., are non-identifiable. Our study suggests that the\ngeneralized extreme value distribution and a mixture of two extreme value\ndistributions should be considered in practical applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 22:10:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Aug 2015 13:36:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pinheiro", "E.

Here Hindustani Music has been\nused as a reference frame for tracking the changing perception of emotions. It\nhas been found that different emotions perceived from Hindustani Music form a\nparticular sequential pattern when their corresponding pitch periods are\nanalyzed using the standard deviations and mean successive squared\ndifferences.This sequential pattern of emotions coincides with their\ncorresponding sequential pattern of tempos or average number of steady states.\nOn the basis of this result we further found that the range of perception of\nemotions has diminished significantly these days compared to what it was\nbefore. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotions like Anger,\nSerenity, Romantic and Sorrow has also decreased to a great extent than what it\nwas previously. The proportion of responses for the perceived emotion Anxiety\nhas increased phenomenally. Both standard deviation and mean successive squared\ndifference are two very good measures in tracking the changing perception of\nemotions. The overall pattern of the change of perceived emotions has\ncorresponded to the psychological and sociological change of human life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Feb 2015 18:32:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Midya", "Vishal", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Sneha", ""], ["Manna", "Srijita", ""], ["Sengupta", "Ranjan", ""]]}]
