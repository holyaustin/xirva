The approach employs basic elements of Morse Theory, and is capable of\nproducing not only a point estimate of various topological quantities (e.g.,\ngenus), but it can also assess their sampling uncertainty in a probabilistic\nfashion. Several examples of point cloud data in three dimensions are utilized\nto demonstrate how the method yields interval estimates for the topology of the\ndata as a 2-dimensional surface embedded in R^3.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 21:24:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-16", "authors_parsed": [["Marzban", "Caren", ""], ["Yurtsever", "Ulvi", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5038", "submitter": "Emmanuel Guerre", "authors": "Emmanuel Guerre and Camille Sabbah", "title": "Uniform bias study and Bahadur representation for local polynomial\n  estimators of the conditional quantile function", "comments": "This version corrects an error in the proof of Lemma B.2 which was\n  pointed out by Zhongjun Qu but does not change the results of the published\n  version, Econometric Theory, 28, 2012", "journal-ref": "Econometric Theory, Volume 28, Issue 1 February 2012 , pp. 87-129", "doi": "10.1017/S0266466611000132", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.AP stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates the bias and the weak Bahadur representation of a\nlocal polynomial estimator of the conditional quantile function and its\nderivatives. The bias and Bahadur remainder term are studied uniformly with\nrespect to the quantile level, the covariates and the smoothing parameter. The\norder of the local polynomial estimator can be higher than the\ndifferentiability order of the conditional quantile function. Applications of\nthe results deal with global optimal consistency rates of the local polynomial\nquantile estimator, performance of random bandwidths and estimation of the\nconditional quantile density function. The latter allows to obtain a simple\nestimator of the conditional quantile function of the private values in a first\nprice sealed bids auctions under the independent private values paradigm and\nrisk neutrality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 May 2011 14:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 14:28:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Guerre", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Sabbah", "Camille", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6145", "submitter": "Alessandro Rinaldo", "authors": "Alessandro Rinaldo, Sonja Petrovi\\'c, Stephen E.
