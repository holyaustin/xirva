Is it Chelsea's Eden Hazard? Is it\nPaulo Dybala, the heir to Messi in the national team of Argentina? Or is the\nmost alike player to Messi someone completely else? In general, the research on\nthe evaluation of players' performances originated in the context of baseball\nin the USA, but, currently, it is of great importance in almost every team\nsport on the planet. Specifically, football clubs' managers can use the data on\nplayer's similarity when looking for replacement of their players by other,\npresumably similar ones. Also, the research in the presented direction is\ncertainly interesting both for football pundits and football fans. Therefore,\nthe aim of this study is to answer the question from the title with the use of\nthe statistical analysis based on the data from ongoing league season retrieved\nfrom WhoScored (WS) database. WS provides detailed data (up to 24 parameters\nsuch as goals scored, the number of assists, shots on goal, passes, dribbles or\nfouls) for players of TOP 5 European leagues, and ranks them with respect to\ntheir overall performance. For this study, 17 parameters (criteria) most\nrelevant for an attacking player were used, and a set of 28 players, candidates\nto be 'most alike to Messi' from WS TOP 100 list were selected. After data\nnormalization and application of a proper metric function the most similar\nplayer to Lionel Messi was found.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Feb 2018 12:50:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mazurek", "Jiri", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.04161", "submitter": "Suveen Angraal", "authors": "Suveen Angraal, Ambika Bhatnagar, Suraj Verma, Sukhman Shergill,\n  Aakriti Gupta and Rohan Khera", "title": "Risk Factors Associated with Mortality in Game of Thrones: A\n  Longitudinal Cohort Study", "comments": "6 Pages, 2 Tables and 1 Figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Objective: To assess mortality, and identify the risk factors associated with\nmortality in Game of Thrones (GoT). Design and Setting: A longitudinal cohort\nstudy in the fictional kingdom of Westeros and Essos. Participants: All the\ncharacters appearing in the GoT since airing of its first episode with screen\ntime of greater than or equal to 5 minutes. Main Outcome Measures: All-cause\nmortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the\nrisk factors associated with mortality, represented by hazard ratios, with\nepisodes as the unit of time. Results: Of the 132 characters, followed up for a\nmedian time of 32 episodes, a total 89 (67.4%) characters died; with external\ninvasive injury as the most common cause of death, attributing to 42.4% of the\ntotal deaths. Age (in decades) was a significant risk factor for death [HR,\n1.24 (95% CI, 1.08-1.43), P=0.0001]. Although statistically non-significant,\nallegiance to house Targaryen [HR, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.32-3.77)] was associated\nwith a higher risk for mortality per episode than house Stark. Characters\nresiding in South were less likely to die than characters residing in North\n[HR, 0.58 (95% CI, 0.29-1.16), P=0.12]. Advisors showed a lower risk of\nmortality than the members of houses, with some statistical significance [HR,\n0.39 (95% CI, 0.14-1.08), P=0.07]. Conclusions: There is a high mortality rate\namong the characters in GoT. Residing in the North and being a member of a\nhouse is very dangerous in GoT.

Using\nnetwork data from 75 villages, we ask 4,554 individuals to assess whether five\nrandomly chosen pairs of households in their village are linked through\nfinancial, social, and informational relationships. We find that network\nknowledge is low and highly localized, declining steeply with the pair's\nnetwork distance to the respondent. 46% of respondents are not even able to\noffer a guess about the status of a potential link between a given pair of\nindividuals. Even when willing to offer a guess, respondents can only correctly\nidentify the links 37% of the time. We also find that a one-step increase in\nthe social distance to the pair corresponds to a 10pp increase in the\nprobability of misidentifying the link. We then investigate the theoretical\nimplications of this assumption by showing that the predictions of various\nmodels change substantially if agents behave under the more realistic\nassumption of incomplete knowledge about the network. Taken together, our\nresults suggest that the assumption of full network knowledge (i) may serve as\na poor approximation to the real world and (ii) is not innocuous: allowing for\nincomplete network knowledge may have first-order implications for a range of\nqualitative and quantitative results in various contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 17:38:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Breza", "Emily", ""], ["Chandrasekhar", "Arun G.", ""], ["Tahbaz-Salehi", "Alireza", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.08761", "submitter": "Matthew Levine", "authors": "Matthew E.

Materials\nand Methods: We used hierarchical clustering (HC) to identify groups of meals\nwith similar nutrition and glycemic impact for 6 individuals with T2DM who\ncollected self-monitoring data. We evaluated clusters on: 1) correspondence to\ngold standards generated by certified diabetes educators (CDEs) for 3\nparticipants; 2) face validity, rated by CDEs, and 3) impact on CDEs' ability\nto identify patterns for another 3 participants. Results: Gold standard (GS)\nincluded 9 patterns across 3 participants. Of these, all 9 were re-discovered\nusing HC: 4 GS patterns were consistent with patterns identified by HC (over\n50% of meals in a cluster followed the pattern); another 5 were included as\nsub-groups in broader clusers. 50% (9/18) of clusters were rated over 3 on\n5-point Likert scale for validity, significance, and being actionable. After\nreviewing clusters, CDEs identified patterns that were more consistent with\ndata (70% reduction in contradictions between patterns and participants'\nrecords). Discussion: Hierarchical clustering of blood glucose and\nmacronutrient consumption appears suitable for discovering behavioral-clinical\nphenotypes in T2DM. Most clusters corresponded to gold standard and were rated\npositively by CDEs for face validity. Cluster visualizations helped CDEs\nidentify more robust patterns in nutrition and glycemic impact, creating new\npossibilities for visual analytic solutions. Conclusion: Machine learning\nmethods can use diabetes self-monitoring data to create personalized\nbehavioral-clinical phenotypes, which may prove useful for delivering\npersonalized medicine.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 Feb 2018 23:11:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Levine", "Matthew E.", ""], ["Albers", "David J.", ""], ["Burgermaster", "Marissa", ""], ["Davidson", "Patricia G.", ""], ["Smaldone", "Arlene M.", ""], ["Mamykina", "Lena", ""]]}, {"id": "1802.08858", "submitter": "David White", "authors": "David White", "title": "A Project Based Approach to Statistics and Data Science", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an increasingly data-driven world, facility with statistics is more\nimportant than ever for our students.
