First we focus on the population level and show how optimal\nquantization of $X$, which consists in discretizing $X$ by projecting it on an\nappropriate grid of $N$ points, allows to approximate conditional quantiles of\n$Y$ given $X$. We show that this is approximation is arbitrarily good as $N$\ngoes to infinity and provide a rate of convergence for the approximation error.\nThen we turn to the sample case and define an estimator of conditional\nquantiles based on quantization ideas. We prove that this estimator is\nconsistent for its fixed-$N$ population counterpart. The results are\nillustrated on a numerical example. Dominance of our estimators over local\nconstant/linear ones and nearest neighbor ones is demonstrated through\nextensive simulations in the companion paper Charlier et al.(2014b).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 May 2014 14:36:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Charlier", "Isabelle", ""], ["Paindaveine", "Davy", ""], ["Saracco", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.4136", "submitter": "Pedro Marijuan", "authors": "R. del Moral, J.

This core pattern\nor 'sociotype' has been explored herein for the networking relationships of\nyoung people--165 university students filling in a 20-items questionnaire on\ntheir social interactions. In spite that this is a preliminary study,\ninteresting results have been obtained on gender conversation time, mental\nhealth, sociability level, and satisfaction with personal relationships.

Quantitative Fitness Analysis (QFA) is a high-throughput\nexperimental and computational methodology for quantifying the fitness of\nmicrobial cultures. QFA can be used to compare between fitness observations for\ndifferent genotypes and thereby infer genetic interaction strengths. Current\n\"naive\" frequentist statistical approaches used in QFA do not model\nbetween-genotype variation or difference in genotype variation under different\nconditions. In this thesis, a Bayesian approach is introduced to evaluate\nhierarchical models that better reflect the structure or design of QFA\nexperiments. First, a two-stage approach is presented: a hierarchical logistic\nmodel is fitted to microbial culture growth curves and then a hierarchical\ninteraction model is fitted to fitness summaries inferred for each genotype.\nNext, a one-stage Bayesian approach is presented: a joint hierarchical model\nwhich does not require a univariate summary of fitness, used to pass\ninformation between models. The new hierarchical approaches are then compared\nusing a dataset examining the effect of telomere defects on yeast. By better\ndescribing the experimental structure, new evidence is found for genes and\ncomplexes which interact with the telomere cap. Various extensions of these\nmodels, including models for data transformation, batch effects, and\nintrinsically stochastic growth models are also considered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 May 2014 23:49:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Heydari", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7129", "submitter": "Kayvan Sadeghi", "authors": "Kayvan Sadeghi", "title": "Marginalization and Conditioning for LWF Chain Graphs", "comments": "48 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": "Annals of Statistics, 44 (4), 1792--1816, 2016", "doi": "10.1214/16-AOS1451", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we deal with the problem of marginalization over and\nconditioning on two disjoint subsets of the node set of chain graphs (CGs) with\nthe LWF Markov property.
