A primary advantage of this new criterion lies in its relative\nindependence from the configuration of the outliers. A second advantage is that\nit easily lends itself to so-called \"symmetricizing\" transformations whereby\nthe observations only enter the objective function through their pairwise\ndifferences: this makes our proposal well suited for models with an asymmetric\ndistribution. M$S_n$ is, therefore, more generally applicable than either MVE,\nMCD or SDE. We also construct a fast algorithm for the M$S_n$ estimator, and\nsimulate its bias under various adversary configurations of outliers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Aug 2012 14:12:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Oct 2012 15:27:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 09:45:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 3 May 2014 14:21:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 12:47:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Vakili", "Kaveh", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5597", "submitter": "Benjamin Hofner", "authors": "Benjamin Hofner, Lea Vaas, John-Philip Lawo, Tina M\\\"uller, Johannes\n  Sikorski, and Dirk Repsilber", "title": "Biologists meet statisticians: A workshop for young scientists to foster\n  interdisciplinary team work", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Life science and statistics have necessarily become essential partners. The\nneed to plan complex, structured experiments, involving elaborated designs, and\nthe need to analyse datasets in the era of systems biology and high throughput\ntechnologies has to build upon professional statistical expertise. On the other\nhand, conducting such analyses and also developing improved or new methods,\nalso for novel kinds of data, has to build upon solid biological understanding\nand practise. However, the meeting of scientists of both fields is often\nhampered by a variety of communicative hurdles - which are based on\nfield-specific working languages and cultural differences.\n  As a step towards a better mutual understanding, we developed a workshop\nconcept bringing together young experimental biologists and statisticians, to\nwork as pairs and learn to value each others competences and practise\ninterdisciplinary communication in a casual atmosphere. The first\nimplementation of our concept was a cooperation of the German Region of the\nInternational Biometrical Society and the Leibnitz Institute DSMZ-German\nCollection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (short: DSMZ), Braunschweig,\nGermany. We collected feedback in form of three questionnaires, oral comments,\nand gathered experiences for the improvement of this concept. The long-term\nchallenge for both disciplines is the establishment of systematic schedules and\nstrategic partnerships which use the proposed workshop concept to foster mutual\nunderstanding, to seed the necessary interdisciplinary cooperation network, and\nto start training the indispensable communication skills at the earliest\npossible phase of education.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 09:26:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Hofner", "Benjamin", ""], ["Vaas", "Lea", ""], ["Lawo", "John-Philip", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Tina", ""], ["Sikorski", "Johannes", ""], ["Repsilber", "Dirk", ""]]}]
