They are adopted by researchers in social science,\nparticularly in the analysis of performance or attitudinal data, in psychology,\neducation, medicine, marketing and other fields where the aim is to measure\nlatent constructs. Most IRT analyses use parametric models that rely on\nassumptions that often are not satisfied. In such cases, a nonparametric\napproach might be preferable; nevertheless, there are not many software\napplications allowing to use that. To address this gap, this paper presents the\nR package KernSmoothIRT. It implements kernel smoothing for the estimation of\noption characteristic curves, and adds several plotting and analytical tools to\nevaluate the whole test/questionnaire, the items, and the subjects. In order to\nshow the package's capabilities, two real datasets are used, one employing\nmultiple-choice responses, and the other scaled responses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2012 11:26:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 09:56:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mazza", "Angelo", ""], ["Punzo", "Antonio", ""], ["McGuire", "Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.1184", "submitter": "Antonio Punzo", "authors": "Angelo Mazza and Antonio Punzo", "title": "DBKGrad: An R Package for Mortality Rates Graduation by Fixed and\n  Adaptive Discrete Beta Kernel Techniques", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO stat.AP stat.ME stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Kernel smoothing represents a useful approach in the graduation of mortality\nrates. Though there exist several options for performing kernel smoothing in\nstatistical software packages, there have been very few contributions to date\nthat have focused on applications of these techniques in the graduation\ncontext. Also, although it has been shown that the use of a variable or\nadaptive smoothing parameter, based on the further information provided by the\nexposed to the risk of death, provides additional benefits, specific\ncomputational tools for this approach are essentially absent. Furthermore,\nlittle attention has been given to providing methods in available software for\nany kind of subsequent analysis with respect to the graduated mortality rates.\nTo facilitate analyses in the field, the R package DBKGrad is introduced. Among\nthe available kernel approaches, it considers a recent discrete beta kernel\nestimator, in both its fixed and adaptive variants. In this approach, boundary\nbias is automatically reduced and age is pragmatically considered as a discrete\nvariable. The bandwidth, fixed or adaptive, is allowed to be manually given by\nthe user or selected by cross-validation. Pointwise confidence intervals, for\neach considered age, are also provided. An application to mortality rates from\nthe Sicily Region (Italy) for the year 2008 is also presented to exemplify the\nuse of the package.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2012 11:27:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Mazza", "Angelo", ""], ["Punzo", "Antonio", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.7008", "submitter": "Bharath  H M", "authors": "H.
