Data science, however, is often understood as a\nbroader, task-driven and computationally-oriented version of statistics. Both\nthe term data science and the broader idea it conveys have origins in\nstatistics and are a reaction to a narrower view of data analysis. Expanding\nupon the views of a number of statisticians, this paper encourages a big-tent\nview of data analysis. We examine how evolving approaches to modern data\nanalysis relate to the existing discipline of statistics (e.g. exploratory\nanalysis, machine learning, reproducibility, computation, communication and the\nrole of theory). Finally, we discuss what these trends mean for the future of\nstatistics by highlighting promising directions for communication, education\nand research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Dec 2017 23:00:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2018 02:55:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Carmichael", "Iain", ""], ["Marron", "J.

Second, two deep learning methods: Deep Belief Network\n(DBN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) are investigated and implemented on the\nextracted token. Results show that DBN can obtain an overall accuracy of 85%\nwith about 44 individual token features and 17 paired token features. The\nclassification results from DBN outperform those of Support Vector Machines\n(SVMs) and supervised Latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA). Finally, to validate\nthis study, we compare the accident-related tweets with both the traffic\naccident log on freeways and traffic data on local roads from 15,000 loop\ndetectors. It is found that nearly 66% of the accident-related tweets can be\nlocated by the accident log and more than 80% of them can be tied to nearby\nabnormal traffic data.

The correlation\ncoefficient is designed to enforce a neutral treatment of incompleteness\nwhereby no assumptions are made about individual preferences involving unranked\nobjects. The new measure, which can be regarded as a generalization of the\nseminal Kendall tau correlation coefficient, is proven to satisfy a set of\nmetric-like axioms and to be equivalent to a recently developed ranking\ndistance function associated with Kemeny aggregation. In an effort to further\nunify and enhance both robust ranking methodologies, this work proves the\nequivalence of an additional distance and correlation-coefficient pairing in\nthe space of non-strict incomplete rankings. These connections induce new exact\noptimization methodologies: a specialized branch and bound algorithm and an\nexact integer programming formulation. Moreover, the bridging of these\ncomplementary theories reinforces the singular suitability of the featured\ncorrelation coefficient to solve the general consensus ranking problem. The\nlatter premise is bolstered by an accompanying set of experiments on random\ninstances, which are generated via a herein developed sampling technique\nconnected with the classic Mallows distribution of ranking data. Associated\nexperiments with the branch and bound algorithm demonstrate that, as data\nbecomes noisier, the featured correlation coefficient yields relatively fewer\nalternative optimal solutions and that the aggregate rankings tend to be closer\nto an underlying ground truth shared by a majority.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jan 2018 22:14:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 2 Jun 2018 09:45:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 00:55:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2019 20:38:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Yoo", "Yeawon", ""], ["Escobedo", "Adolfo R.", ""], ["Skolfield", "J.
