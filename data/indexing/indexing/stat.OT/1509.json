Although Rosenthal's estimator is\nhighly used by researchers, its statistical properties are largely unexplored.\nFirst of all, we developed statistical theory which allowed us to produce\nconfidence intervals for Rosenthal's fail-safe number.This was produced by\ndiscerning whether the number of studies analysed in a meta-analysis is fixed\nor random. Each case produces different variance estimators. For a given number\nof studies and a given distribution, we provided five variance estimators.\nConfidence intervals are examined with a normal approximation and a\nnonparametric bootstrap. The accuracy of the different confidence interval\nestimates was then tested by methods of simulation under different\ndistributional assumptions. The half normal distribution variance estimator has\nthe best probability coverage. Finally, we provide a table of lower confidence\nintervals for Rosenthal's estimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 08:24:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Fragkos", "Konstantinos C.", ""], ["Tsagris", "Michail", ""], ["Frangos", "Christos C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.03056", "submitter": "Anthony C.

Despite the\nabsence of formal secondary eduction for Poles during the Second World War, he\nentered the University of Pozna\\'{n} in 1948, initially studying agronomy and\nin later years mathematics. From 1953 to 1988 he taught statistics, biometry\nand experimental design at the Agricultural University of Pozna\\'{n}. During\nthis period he founded and developed the Pozna\\'{n} inter-university school of\nmathematical statistics and biometry, which has become one of the most\nimportant schools of this type in Poland and beyond. He has supervised 24 Ph.D.\nstudents, many of whom are currently professors at a variety of universities.\nHe is now Professor Emeritus. Among many awards, in 1995 Professor Cali\\'{n}ski\nreceived the Order of Polonia Restituta for his outstanding achievements in the\nfields of Education and Science. In 2012 the Polish Statistical Society awarded\nhim The Jerzy Sp{\\l}awa-Neyman Medal for his contribution to the development of\nresearch in statistics in Poland. Professor Cali\\'{n}ski in addition has\nDoctoral Degrees honoris causa from the Agricultural University of Pozna\\'{n}\nand the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. His research interests include\nmathematical statistics and biometry, with applications to agriculture, natural\nsciences, biology and genetics. He has published over 140 articles in\nscientific journals as well as, with Sanpei Kageyama, two important books on\nthe randomization approach to the design and analysis of experiments. He has\nbeen extremely active and successful in initiating and contributing to fruitful\ninternational research cooperation between Polish statisticians and\nbiometricians and their colleagues in various countries, particularly in the\nNetherlands, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Portugal. The\nconversations in addition cover the history of biometry and experimental design\nin Poland and the early influence of British statisticians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 09:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Atkinson", "Anthony C.", ""], ["Bogacka", "Barbara", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.03068", "submitter": "Bradley P.

Gelfand was born April 17, 1945, in the Bronx, New York. He attended\npublic grade schools and did his undergraduate work at what was then called\nCity College of New York (CCNY, now CUNY), excelling at mathematics. He then\nsurprised and saddened his mother by going all the way across the country to\nStanford to graduate school, where he completed his dissertation in 1969 under\nthe direction of Professor Herbert Solomon, making him an academic grandson of\nHerman Rubin and Harold Hotelling. Alan then accepted a faculty position at the\nUniversity of Connecticut (UConn) where he was promoted to tenured associate\nprofessor in 1975 and to full professor in 1980. A few years later he became\ninterested in decision theory, then empirical Bayes, which eventually led to\nthe publication of Gelfand and Smith [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 85 (1990)\n398-409], the paper that introduced the Gibbs sampler to most statisticians and\nrevolutionized Bayesian computing. In the mid-1990s, Alan's interests turned\nstrongly to spatial statistics, leading to fundamental contributions in\nspatially-varying coefficient models, coregionalization, and spatial boundary\nanalysis (wombling). He spent 33 years on the faculty at UConn, retiring in\n2002 to become the James B. Duke Professor of Statistics and Decision Sciences\nat Duke University, serving as chair from 2007-2012. At Duke, he has continued\nhis work in spatial methodology while increasing his impact in the\nenvironmental sciences. To date, he has published over 260 papers and 6 books;\nhe has also supervised 36 Ph.D. dissertations and 10 postdocs.

For example, controlled trials\nare ubiquitously used to investigate the effect of a medical treatment, perhaps\ndependent on a set of patient covariates, and traditional approaches have\nrelied primarily on randomized patient sampling and allocation to treatment and\ncontrol group. However, when covariate data for a large cohort group of\npatients have already been collected and are available in a database, one can\npotentially design a treatment/control sample and allocation that provides far\nbetter estimates of the covariate-dependent effects of the treatment. In this\npaper, we develop a new approach that uses optimal design of experiments (DOE)\nconcepts to accomplish this objective. The approach selects the patients for\nthe treatment and control samples upfront, based on their covariate values, in\na manner that optimizes the information content in the data. For the optimal\nsample selection, we develop simple guidelines and an optimization algorithm\nthat provides solutions that are substantially better than random sampling.\nMoreover, our approach causes no sampling bias in the estimated effects, for\nthe same reason that DOE principles do not bias estimated effects. We test our\nmethod with a simulation study based on a testbed data set containing\ninformation on the effect of statins on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)\ncholesterol.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 18:41:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ouyang", "Liwen", ""], ["Apley", "Daniel W.", ""], ["Mehrotra", "Sanjay", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07804", "submitter": "Philippe Besse", "authors": "Philippe Besse (IMT, INSA Toulouse), Beatrice Laurent (IMT)", "title": "From Statistician to Data Scientist", "comments": "in French", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  According to a recent report from the European Commission, the world\ngenerates every minute 1.7 million of billions of data bytes, the equivalent of\n360,000 DVDs, and companies that build their decision-making processes by\nexploiting these data increase their productivity.
