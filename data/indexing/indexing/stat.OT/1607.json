Methodological statisticians routinely write\nsimulations to compare their methods to preexisting ones. While developing\nideas, there is a temptation to write \"quick and dirty\" simulations to try out\nideas. This approach of rapid prototyping is useful but can sometimes backfire\nif bugs are introduced. Using the simulator allows one to remove the \"dirty\"\nwithout sacrificing the \"quick.\" Coding is quick because the statistician\nfocuses exclusively on those aspects of the simulation that are specific to the\nparticular paper being written. Code written with the simulator is succinct,\nhighly readable, and easily shared with others. The modular nature of\nsimulations written with the simulator promotes code reusability, which saves\ntime and facilitates reproducibility. The syntax of the simulator leads to\nsimulation code that is easily human-readable. Other benefits of using the\nsimulator include the ability to \"step in\" to a simulation and change one\naspect without having to rerun the entire simulation from scratch, the\nstraightforward integration of parallel computing into simulations, and the\nability to rapidly generate plots, tables, and reports with minimal effort.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 20:04:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bien", "Jacob", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.00858", "submitter": "Adam Loy", "authors": "Adam Loy", "title": "Embracing Data Science", "comments": "9 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "The UMAP Journal 36 (2015) 285-292", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT cs.GL", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Statistics is running the risk of appearing irrelevant to today's\nundergraduate students.

Past work has taken a rule-based\napproach, uniformly across all respondents. We envision a richer interpretation\nof adaptive questions, which we call dynamic question ordering (DQO), where\nquestion order is personalized. Such an approach could increase engagement, and\ntherefore response rate, as well as imputation quality. We present a DQO\nframework to improve survey completion and imputation. In the general\nsurvey-taking setting, we want to maximize survey completion, and so we focus\non ordering questions to engage the respondent and collect hopefully all\ninformation, or at least the information that most characterizes the\nrespondent, for accurate imputations. In another scenario, our goal is to\nprovide a personalized prediction. Since it is possible to give reasonable\npredictions with only a subset of questions, we are not concerned with\nmotivating users to answer all questions. Instead, we want to order questions\nto get information that reduces prediction uncertainty, while not being too\nburdensome. We illustrate this framework with an example of providing energy\nestimates to prospective tenants. We also discuss DQO for national surveys and\nconsider connections between our statistics-based question-ordering approach\nand cognitive survey methodology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 17:03:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Early", "Kirstin", ""], ["Mankoff", "Jennifer", ""], ["Fienberg", "Stephen E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04807", "submitter": "Hien Nguyen", "authors": "Hien D Nguyen, Geoffrey J McLachlan", "title": "Progress on a Conjecture Regarding the Triangular Distribution", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Triangular distributions are a well-known class of distributions that are\noften used as an elementary example of a probability model.

Current generative algorithms fail in accurately reproducing the\nindividuals' recurrent schedules and at the same time in accounting for the\npossibility that individuals may break the routine during periods of variable\nduration. In this article we present DITRAS (DIary-based TRAjectory Simulator),\na framework to simulate the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility. DITRAS\noperates in two steps: the generation of a mobility diary and the translation\nof the mobility diary into a mobility trajectory. We propose a data-driven\nalgorithm which constructs a diary generator from real data, capturing the\ntendency of individuals to follow or break their routine. We also propose a\ntrajectory generator based on the concept of preferential exploration and\npreferential return. We instantiate DITRAS with the proposed diary and\ntrajectory generators and compare the resulting algorithm with real data and\nsynthetic data produced by other generative algorithms, built by instantiating\nDITRAS with several combinations of diary and trajectory generators. We show\nthat the proposed algorithm reproduces the statistical properties of real\ntrajectories in the most accurate way, making a step forward the understanding\nof the origin of the spatio-temporal patterns of human mobility.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Jul 2016 11:54:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 18:51:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 9 Dec 2017 10:51:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Pappalardo", "Luca", ""], ["Simini", "Filippo", ""]]}]
