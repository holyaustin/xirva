The\nGlivenko-Cantelli theorem states that with probability 1, $F_{n}$ converges\nuniformly to $F$. In so doing it describes the macroscopic structure of\n$\\{x_{i}\\}_{1}^{n}$, however it is insensitive to the position of individual\npoints. Indeed any subset of $o(n)$ points can be perturbed at will without\ndisturbing the convergence. We provide several refinements of the\nGlivenko-Cantelli theorem which are sensitive not only to the global structure\nof the sample but also to individual points. Our main result provides\nconditions that guarantee simultaneous concentration of all order statistics.\nThe example of main interest is the normal distribution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Feb 2011 06:01:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Feb 2011 08:02:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Fresen", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2146", "submitter": "Rub\\'en J.

Here we show that resource\nlimitations may generate dynamical payoffs able to alter an original prisoner's\ndilemma, and to allow for the stable coexistence between unconditional\ncooperators and defectors in well-mixed populations. This is a consequence of a\nself-organizing process that turns the interaction payoff matrix into\nevolutionary neutral, and represents a resource-based control mechanism\npreventing the spread of defectors. To our knowledge, this is the first example\nof coexistence in well-mixed populations with a game structure different from a\nsnowdrift game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 15:34:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 03:37:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2012 18:48:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Requejo", "Rub\u00e9n J.", ""], ["Camacho", "Juan", ""]]}]
