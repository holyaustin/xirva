Where does this leave our ability to interpret results? I suggest that a\nphilosophy compatible with statistical practice, labeled here statistical\npragmatism, serves as a foundation for inference. Statistical pragmatism is\ninclusive and emphasizes the assumptions that connect statistical models with\nobserved data. I argue that introductory courses often mischaracterize the\nprocess of statistical inference and I propose an alternative \"big picture\"\ndepiction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2011 07:47:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Jun 2011 09:07:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kass", "Robert E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2994", "submitter": "Saeed Abdallah", "authors": "Saeed Abdallah and Ioannis N.

The conventional estimator suffers from a phase ambiguity that reduces\nto a sign ambiguity for the WL estimator. We derive closed-form expressions for\nthe MSE of the two estimators under four different ambiguity resolution\nscenarios. The first scenario is optimal resolution, which minimizes the\nEuclidean distance between the channel estimate and the actual channel. The\nsecond scenario assumes that a randomly chosen coefficient of the actual\nchannel is known and the third assumes that the one with the largest magnitude\nis known. The fourth scenario is the more realistic case where pilot symbols\nare used to resolve the ambiguities. Our work demonstrates that there is a\nstrong relationship between the accuracy of ambiguity resolution and the\nrelative performance of WL and conventional subspace-based estimators, and\nshows that the less information available about the actual channel for\nambiguity resolution, or the lower the accuracy of this information, the higher\nthe performance gap in favor of the WL estimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:20:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Abdallah", "Saeed", ""], ["Psaromiligkos", "Ioannis N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.3259", "submitter": "Yu-Cheng Ku", "authors": "Yu-Cheng Ku, Peter Bloomfield, Robert Kohn", "title": "A flexible observed factor model with separate dynamics for the factor\n  volatilities and their correlation matrix", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Our article considers a regression model with observed factors. The observed\nfactors have a flexible stochastic volatility structure that has separate\ndynamics for the volatilities and the correlation matrix. The correlation\nmatrix of the factors is time-varying and its evolution is described by an\ninverse Wishart process. The model specifies the evolution of the observed\nvolatilities flexibly and is particularly attractive when the dimension of the\nobservations is high. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed to\nestimate the model. It is straightforward to use this algorithm to obtain the\npredictive distributions of future observations and to carry out model\nselection. The model is illustrated and compared to other Wishart-type factor\nmultivariate stochastic volatility models using various empirical data\nincluding monthly stock returns and portfolio weighted returns. The evidence\nsuggests that our model has better predictive performance.
