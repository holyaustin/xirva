This result supposes that $\\theta_0$\nis perfectly known. In most real applications, this assumption is not realistic\nsince $\\theta_0$ is unknown and has to be estimated. In this paper, we analysis\nthe Kalman filter for a biased estimator of $\\theta_0$. We show the propagation\nof this bias on the estimation of the hidden state. We give an expression of\nthis propagation for linear and Gaussian state space models and we extend this\nresult for almost linear models estimated by the Extended Kalman filter. An\nillustration is given for the autoregressive process with measurement noises\nwidely studied in econometrics to model economic and financial data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Mar 2013 17:13:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kolei", "Salima El", ""]]}]
