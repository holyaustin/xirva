The usual objective approaches work\noff the chosen statistical model and in the majority of cases the resulting\nprior is improper, which can pose limitations to a practical implementation,\neven when the complexity of the model is moderate. In this paper we propose to\ntake a novel look at the construction of objective prior distributions, where\nthe connection with a chosen sampling distribution model is removed. We explore\nthe notion of defining objective prior distributions which allow one to have\nsome degree of flexibility, in particular in exhibiting some desirable\nfeatures, such as being proper, or centered on specific values which would be\nof interest in nested model comparisons. The basic tool we use are proper\nscoring rules and the main result is a class of objective prior distributions\nthat can be employed in scenarios where the usual model based priors fail, such\nas mixture models and model selection via Bayes factors. In addition, we show\nthat the proposed class of priors is the result of minimising the information\nit contains, providing solid interpretation to the method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 09:17:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 23 Sep 2018 19:53:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Leisen", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Villa", "Cristiano", ""], ["Walker", "Stephen G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01584", "submitter": "Yuthika Gardiyawasam Punchihewa", "authors": "Yuthika Punchihewa, Ba-Tuong Vo, Ba-Ngu Vo and Du Yong Kim", "title": "Multiple Object Tracking in Unknown Backgrounds with Labeled Random\n  Finite Sets", "comments": "12 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TSP.2018.2821650", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper proposes an on-line multiple object tracking algorithm that can\noperate in unknown background.

The autoregressive Hilbertian process framework of order one (ARH(1)\nprocess framework) is adopted. A componentwise estimator of the autocorrelation\noperator is formulated, from the moment-based estimation of its diagonal\ncoefficients, with respect to the orthogonal eigenvectors of the\nauto-covariance operator, which are assumed to be known. Mean-square\nconvergence to the theoretical autocorrelation operator, in the space of\nHilbert-Schmidt operators, is proved. Consistency then follows in that space.\nFor the associated ARH(1) plug-in predictor, mean absolute convergence to the\ncorresponding conditional expectation, in the considered Hilbert space, is\nobtained. Hence, consistency in that space also holds. A simulation study is\nundertaken to illustrate the finite-large sample behavior of the formulated\ncomponentwise estimator and predictor. The performance of the presented\napproach is compared with alternative approaches in the previous and current\nARH(1) framework literature, including the case of unknown eigenvectors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 14:50:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2018 10:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["\u00c1lvarez-Li\u00e9bana", "J.", ""], ["Bosq", "D.", ""], ["Ruiz-Medina", "M.
