Among them: use of real data with context and purpose.\nMany educators have created databases consisting of multiple data sets for use\nin class; sometimes making hundreds of data sets available. Yet `the context\nand purpose' component of the data may remain elusive if just a generic\ndatabase is made available.\n  We describe the use of open data in introductory courses. Countries and\ncities continue to share data through open data portals. Hence, educators can\nfind regional data that engages their students more effectively. We present\nexcerpts from case studies that show the application of statistical methods to\ndata on: crime, housing, rainfall, tourist travel, and others. Data wrangling\nand discussion of results are recognized as important case study components.\nThus the open data based case studies attend most GAISE College Report\nrecommendations.

In the course of the associated long-lasting\nanticyclonic summer circulations, heat waves and drought spells often coincide,\nleading to so-called hotter droughts. Previous hotter droughts caused a\ndecrease in agricultural yields and increase in tree mortality, and thus, had a\nremarkable effect on carbon budgets and negative economic impacts.\nConsequently, a quantification of ecosystem responses to hotter droughts and a\nbetter understanding of the underlying mechanisms is crucial. In this context,\nthe European hotter drought of the year 2018 may be considered as a key event.\nAs a first step towards the quantification of its causes and consequences, we\nhere assess anomalies of atmospheric circulation patterns, temperature loads,\nand climatic water balance as potential drivers of ecosystem responses as\nquantified by remote sensing using the MODIS vegetation indices NDVI and EVI.\nTo place the drought of 2018 within a climatological context, we compare its\nclimatic features and ecosystem response with the extreme hot drought of 2003.\nOur results indicated 2018 to be characterized by a climatic dipole, featuring\nextremely hot and dry weather conditions north of the Alps but comparably cool\nand moist conditions across large parts of the Mediterranean. Analyzing\necosystem response of five dominant land-cover classes, we found significant\npositive effects of April-July climatic water balance on ecosystem\nproductivity. Negative drought impacts appeared to affect a larger area in 2018\ncompared to 2003. We found a significantly higher sensitivity of pastures and\narable land to climatic water balance compared to forests in both years. This\nstudy quantifies the drought of 2018 as a yet unprecedented event and provides\nvaluable insights into the heterogeneous drought responses of European\necosystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2019 09:40:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2019 12:58:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Buras", "Allan", ""], ["Rammig", "Anja", ""], ["Zang", "Christian S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.08726", "submitter": "Tenglong Li", "authors": "Tenglong Li, Kenneth A.

Formally,\nthe PIV is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis again based on both\nthe observed sample and the counterfactuals, provided the same null hypothesis\nhas already been rejected based on the observed sample. Under either\nfrequentist or Bayesian framework, one can bound the PIV of an inference based\non his bounded belief about the counterfactuals, which is often needed when the\nunconfoundedness assumption is dubious. The PIV is equivalent to statistical\npower when the NHST is thought to be based on both the observed sample and the\ncounterfactuals. We summarize the process of evaluating internal validity with\nthe PIV into an eight-step procedure and illustrate it with an empirical\nexample (i.e., Hong and Raudenbush (2005)).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2019 16:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Tenglong", ""], ["Frank", "Kenneth A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.10564", "submitter": "Chris Oates", "authors": "Junyang Wang, Jon Cockayne, Chris J.

However, very little attention has been devoted\nto the diagnosis ability of the methods, aimed to provide useful information on\nthe causes of a given detected anomaly. This information is of utmost\nimportance for the security team to reduce the time from detection to response.\nIn this paper, we present Multivariate Big Data Analysis (MBDA), a complete\nintrusion detection approach based on 5 steps to effectively handle massive\namounts of disparate data sources. The approach has been designed to deal with\nthe main characteristics of Big Data, that is, the high volume, velocity and\nvariety. The core of the approach is the Multivariate Statistical Network\nMonitoring (MSNM) technique proposed in a recent paper. Unlike in state of the\nart machine learning methodologies applied to the intrusion detection problem,\nwhen an anomaly is identified in MBDA the output of the system includes the\ndetail of the logs of raw information associated to this anomaly, so that the\nsecurity team can use this information to elucidate its root causes. MBDA is\nbased in two open software packages available in Github: the MEDA Toolbox and\nthe FCParser. We illustrate our approach with two case studies. The first one\ndemonstrates the application of MBDA to semistructured sources of information,\nusing the data from the VAST 2012 mini challenge 2.
