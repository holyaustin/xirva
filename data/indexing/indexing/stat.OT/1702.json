The usual approach approximates this constant with Monte Carlo\nsimulations, however convergence may be exponentially slow. We propose a\ndeterministic method, based on a variational mean-field approximation of the\nERGM's normalizing constant. We compute lower and upper bounds for the\napproximation error for any network size, adapting nonlinear large deviations\nresults. This translates into bounds on the distance between true likelihood\nand mean-field likelihood. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that in practice our\ndeterministic method performs better than our conservative theoretical\napproximation bounds imply, for a large class of models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 15:21:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 18:30:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Apr 2019 19:19:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2020 22:30:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Mele", "Angelo", ""], ["Zhu", "Lingjiong", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00823", "submitter": "Michael Rosenthal", "authors": "Michael Rosenthal, Wei Wu, Eric Klassen, Anuj Srivastava", "title": "Nonparametric Spherical Regression Using Diffeomorphic Mappings", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spherical regression explores relationships between variables on spherical\ndomains.

The main goal of this line of\nresearch is to help two sided platform firms to target their marketing policies\ngiven the great heterogeneity among their customers. In three essays, I\ncombined structural modeling and machine learning approaches to first\nunderstand customers' responses to intrinsic and extrinsic factors, using\nunique data sets I scraped from the web, and then explore methods to optimize\ntwo sided platforms' firms' reactions accordingly. The first essay examines\n\"social learning\" in the mobile app store context, controlling for intrinsic\nvalue of hedonic and utilitarian mobile apps, price, advertising, and number of\noptions available. The second essay investigates bidders' anticipated winner\nand loser regret in the context of the eBay online auction platform. Using a\nlarge data set from eBay and empirical Bayesian estimation method, I quantify\nthe bidders' anticipation of regret in various product categories, and\ninvestigate the role of experience in explaining the bidders' regret and\nlearning behaviors. The third essay investigates the effects of Gamification\nincentive mechanisms in an online platform for user generated content. I use an\nensemble method over LDA, mixed normal and k-mean clustering methods to segment\nusers into competitors, collaborators, achievers, explorers and uninterested\nusers. These findings help the Gamification platform to target its users. The\nsimulation counterfactual analysis suggests that a two sided platform can\nincrease the number of user contributions, by making earning badges more\ndifficult.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:39:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Nia", "Meisam Hejazi", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.08261", "submitter": "Claus Vogl", "authors": "Claus Vogl", "title": "J.B.S.

Considering the information available to Haldane, I derive a superior\nprior and compare to Haldane's flat prior. Haldane's main intent with his\narticle seems to have been to explore the different parameter regions of the\nbinomial and the conjugate beta.
