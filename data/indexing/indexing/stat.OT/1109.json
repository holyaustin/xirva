The latter is particularly true if the underlying dynamics does\nnot lead to independent extreme events as often observed in natural systems.\nHere, we focus on this case and consider stationary stochastic processes that\nare characterized by long-range memory and heavy-tailed distributions, often\ncalled fractional L\\'evy noise. While the size distribution of extreme events\nis not affected by the long-range memory in the asymptotic limit and remains a\nFr\\'echet distribution, there are strong finite-size effects if the memory\nleads to persistence in the underlying dynamics. Moreover, we show that this\npersistence is also present in the extreme events, which allows one to make a\ntime-dependent hazard assessment of future extreme events based on events\nobserved in the past. This has direct applications in the field of space\nweather as we discuss specifically for the case of the solar power influx into\nthe magnetosphere. Finally, we show how the statistics of records, or\nrecord-breaking extreme events, is affected by the presence of long-range\nmemory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Sep 2011 20:18:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Schumann", "Aicko Yves", ""], ["Moloney", "Nicholas R.", ""], ["Davidsen", "J\u00f6rn", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.0828", "submitter": "Joachim Kaldasch", "authors": "Joachim Kaldasch", "title": "The Product Life Cycle of Durable Goods", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "British Journal of Economics, Management & Trade 10(2): 1-17,\n  2015, Article no.BJEMT.20395", "doi": "10.9734/BJEMT/2015/20395", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT q-fin.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A dynamic model of the product lifecycle of (nearly) homogeneous durables in\npolypoly markets is established. It describes the concurrent evolution of the\nunit sales and price of durable goods. The theory is based on the idea that the\nsales dynamics is determined by a meeting process of demanded with supplied\nproduct units. Taking advantage from the Bass model for first purchase and a\nlogistic model for repurchase the entire product lifecycle of a durable can be\nestablished. For the case of a fast growing supply the model suggests that the\nmean price of the good decreases according to a logistic law. Both, the\nestablished unit sales and price evolution are in agreement with the empirical\ndata studied in this paper. The presented approach discusses further the\ninterference of the diffusion process with the supply dynamics. The model\npredicts the occurrence of lost sales in the initial stages of the lifecycle\ndue to supply constraints. They are the origin for a retarded market\npenetration. The theory suggests that the imitation rate B indicating social\ncontagion in the Bass model has its maximum magnitude for the case of a large\namount of available units at introduction and a fast output increase. The\nempirical data of the investigated samples are in qualitative agreement with\nthis prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Sep 2011 08:31:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 11:34:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kaldasch", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.4371", "submitter": "Emanuel Ben-David", "authors": "Emanuel Ben-David, Tianxi Li, Helene Massam, Bala Rajaratnam", "title": "High dimensional Bayesian inference for Gaussian directed acyclic graph\n  models", "comments": "55 pages, 8 figures, 12 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.OT stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider Gaussian models Markov with respect to an\narbitrary DAG. We first construct a family of conjugate priors for the Cholesky\nparametrization of the covariance matrix of such models. This family has as\nmany shape parameters as the DAG has vertices, and naturally extends the work\nof Geiger and Heckerman [8]. From these distributions, we derive prior\ndistributions for the covariance and precision parameters of the Gaussian DAG\nMarkov models. Our works thus extends the work of Dawid and Lauritzen [5] and\nLetac and Massam [16] for Gaussian models Markov with respect to a decomposable\ngraph to arbitrary DAGs. For this reason, we call our distributions DAG-Wishart\ndistributions. An advantage of these distributions is that they possess strong\nhyper Markov properties and thus allow for explicit estimation of the\ncovariance and precision parameters, regardless of the dimension of the\nproblem. They also allow us to develop methodology for model selection and\ncovariance estimation in the space of DAG-Markov models. We demonstrate via\nseveral numerical examples that the proposed method scales well to\nhigh-dimensions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2011 17:27:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2011 18:36:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 1 Jan 2012 19:17:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 13:54:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 01:32:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Ben-David", "Emanuel", ""], ["Li", "Tianxi", ""], ["Massam", "Helene", ""], ["Rajaratnam", "Bala", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5640", "submitter": "Qiyu Jin", "authors": "Qiyu Jin, Ion Grama and Quansheng Liu", "title": "Removing Gaussian Noise by Optimization of Weights in Non-Local Means", "comments": "35 pages, 6 figures and 5 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new image denoising algorithm to deal with the additive Gaussian white\nnoise model is given.
