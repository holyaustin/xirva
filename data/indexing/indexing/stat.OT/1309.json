Cohen\n(1982) described an adaptation with less explicit competition suitable for\nundergraduate students at a liberal arts college. This paper details an\nadaptation of this modified Moore-method to teach mathematical statistics, and\ndescribes ways that such an approach helps engage students and foster the\nteaching of statistics.\n  Groups of students worked a set of 3 difficult problems (some theoretical,\nsome applied) every two weeks. Class time was devoted to coaching sessions with\nthe instructor, group meeting time, and class presentations. R was used to\nestimate solutions empirically where analytic results were intractable, as well\nas to provide an environment to undertake simulation studies with the aim of\ndeepening understanding and complementing analytic solutions. Each group\npresented comprehensive solutions to complement oral presentations. Development\nof parallel techniques for empirical and analytic problem solving was an\nexplicit goal of the course, which also attempted to communicate ways that\nstatistics can be used to tackle interesting problems. The group problem\nsolving component and use of technology allowed students to attempt much more\nchallenging questions than they could otherwise solve.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Sep 2013 10:19:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-21", "authors_parsed": [["Horton", "Nicholas Jon", ""]]}]
