In the absence of dividend payments,\nsuch a risk process is a particular case of so-called piecewise deterministic\nMarkov processes. The control mechanism chooses the size of dividend payments.\nThe objective consists in maximazing the sum of the expected cumulative\ndiscounted dividend payments received until the time of ruin and a penalty\npayment at the time of ruin, which is an increasing function of the size of the\nshortfall at ruin. A complete solution is presented to the corresponding\nstochastic control problem. We identify the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequation and find necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality of a\nsingle dividend-band strategy, in terms of particular Gerber-Shiu functions. A\nnumber of concrete examples are analyzed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Apr 2016 11:00:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Marciniak", "Ewa", ""], ["Palmowski", "Zbigniew", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.08037", "submitter": "Martijn Pistorius", "authors": "Martijn Pistorius and Mitja Stadje", "title": "On Dynamic Deviation Measures and Continuous-Time Portfolio Optimisation", "comments": "28pp", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose the notion of dynamic deviation measure, as a\ndynamic time-consistent extension of the (static) notion of deviation measure.\nTo achieve time-consistency we require that a dynamic deviation measures\nsatisfies a generalised conditional variance formula. We show that, under a\ndomination condition, dynamic deviation measures are characterised as the\nsolutions to a certain class of backward SDEs. We establish for any dynamic\ndeviation measure an integral representation, and derive a dual\ncharacterisation result in terms of additively $m$-stable dual sets. Using this\nnotion of dynamic deviation measure we formulate a dynamic mean-deviation\nportfolio optimisation problem in a jump-diffusion setting and identify a\nsubgame-perfect Nash equilibrium strategy that is linear as function of wealth\nby deriving and solving an associated extended HJB equation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 12:25:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pistorius", "Martijn", ""], ["Stadje", "Mitja", ""]]}]
