The strategy is parameterized by only two variables, p and q. Stocks are\nsold and bought if the log return is bigger than p and less than -q,\nrespectively. Repetition of this simple strategy for a long time gives the\nprofit defined in the underlying two-dimensional parameter space of p and q. It\nis revealed that the local maxima in the profit landscape are spread in the\nform of a fractal structure. The fractal structure implies that successful\nstrategies are not localized to any region of the profit landscape and are\nneither spaced evenly throughout the profit landscape, which makes the\noptimization notoriously hard and hypersensitive for partial or limited\ninformation. The concrete implication of this property is demonstrated by\nshowing that optimization of one stock for future values or other stocks\nrenders worse profit than a strategy that ignores fluctuations, i.e., a\nlong-term buy-and-hold strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2012 17:53:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Gronlund", "Andreas", ""], ["Yi", "Il Gu", ""], ["Kim", "Beom Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0877", "submitter": "Giacomo Livan", "authors": "Giacomo Livan, Jun-ichi Inoue, Enrico Scalas", "title": "On the non-stationarity of financial time series: impact on optimal\n  portfolio selection", "comments": "12 pages, 4 figures (revised version)", "journal-ref": "J.

We start in discrete time,\nwhere the formulation is straightforward, and then find the natural extension\nto continuous time.

We justify the continuous-time formulation by showing that\nit coincides with the continuous-time limit of the discrete-time formulation.\nThe proof of this convergence is based on a global description of the locally\noptimal strategy in terms of the structure condition and the\nF\\\"ollmer-Schweizer decomposition of the mean-variance tradeoff.
