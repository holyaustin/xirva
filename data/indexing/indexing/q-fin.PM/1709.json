The asymmetric\nregularizer allows us to penalize short and long positions differently, so the\npresent treatment includes the no-short-constrained portfolio optimization\nproblem as a special case. Results are presented for the out-of-sample and the\nin-sample estimator of the regularized variance, the relative estimation error,\nthe density of the assets eliminated from the portfolio by the regularizer, and\nthe distribution of the optimal portfolio weights. We have studied the\ndependence of these quantities on the ratio $r$ of the portfolio's dimension\n$N$ to the sample size $T$, and on the strength of the regularizer. We have\nchecked the analytic results by numerical simulations, and found general\nagreement. Regularization extends the interval where the optimization can be\ncarried out, and suppresses the large sample fluctuations, but the performance\nof $\\ell_1$ regularization is rather disappointing: if the sample size is large\nrelative to the dimension, i.e. $r$ is small, the regularizer does not play any\nrole, while for $r$'s where the regularizer starts to be felt the estimation\nerror is already so large as to make the whole optimization exercise pointless.\nWe find that the $\\ell_1$ regularization can eliminate at most half the assets\nfrom the portfolio, corresponding to this there is a critical ratio $r=2$\nbeyond which the $\\ell_1$ regularized variance cannot be optimized: the\nregularized variance becomes constant over the simplex.

We first present a comparative study\nof recurrent neural network models (RNNs), including a simple RNN, long\nshort-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) for selecting the best\npredictor to use in portfolio construction. The models are applied to the\ninvestment universe consisted of ten stocks in the S&P500. The experimental\nresults shows that LSTM outperforms the others in terms of hit ratio of\none-month-ahead forecasts. We then build predictive threshold-based portfolios\n(TBPs) that are subsets of the universe satisfying given threshold criteria for\nthe predicted returns. The TBPs are rebalanced monthly to restore equal weights\nto each security within the TBPs. We find that the risk and return profile of\nthe realized TBP represents a monotonically increasing frontier on the\nrisk-return plane, where the equally weighted portfolio (EWP) of all ten stocks\nplays a role in their lower bound. This shows the availability of TBPs in\ntargeting specific risk-return levels, and an EWP based on all the assets plays\na role in the reference portfolio of TBPs. In the process, thresholds play\ndominant roles in characterizing risk, return, and the prediction accuracy of\nthe subset. The TBP is more data-driven in designing portfolio target risk and\nreturn than existing ones, in the sense that it requires no prior knowledge of\nfinance such as financial assumptions, financial mathematics, or expert\ninsights.
