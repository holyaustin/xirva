The estimation error strongly depends on the ratio\nN/T and diverges for a critical value of this parameter. This divergence is the\nmanifestation of an algorithmic phase transition, it is accompanied by a number\nof critical phenomena, and displays universality. As the structure of a large\nnumber of multidimensional regression and modelling problems is very similar to\nportfolio optimization, the scope of the above observations extends far beyond\nfinance, and covers a large number of problems in operations research, machine\nlearning, bioinformatics, medical science, economics, and technology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Oct 2007 18:55:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Kondor", "Imre", ""], ["Varga-Haszonits", "Istvan", ""]]}]
