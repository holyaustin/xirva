Our primary goal\nis to show that the minimal probability of ruin, whose stochastic\nrepresentation does not have a classical form as does the utility maximization\nproblem (i.e., the objective's dependence on the initial values of the state\nvariables is implicit), is the unique classical solution of its\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which is a non-linear boundary-value\nproblem. We establish our goal by exploiting the convex duality relationship\nbetween (a) and (b).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Apr 2007 21:51:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Wed, 11 Nov 2009 20:47:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Sun, 4 Apr 2010 03:53:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Sun, 22 Aug 2010 19:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Fri, 27 Aug 2010 14:43:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Jan 2008 18:11:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 19:54:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2008 04:17:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 9 Nov 2008 13:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 16 Apr 2009 20:45:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 16:20:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2009 16:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Sat, 7 Nov 2009 12:37:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}]
