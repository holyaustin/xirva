We study this in continuous time in a general semimartingale model\nand under cone constraints: Trading strategies must take values in a (possibly\nrandom and time-dependent) closed cone. We first prove existence of a solution\nfor convex constraints by showing that the space of constrained terminal gains,\nwhich is a space of stochastic integrals, is closed in L^2. Then we use\nstochastic control methods to describe the local structure of the optimal\nstrategy, as follows. The value process of a naturally associated constrained\nlinear-quadratic optimal control problem is decomposed into a sum with two\nopportunity processes L^{\\pm} appearing as coefficients. The martingale\noptimality principle translates into a drift condition for the semimartingale\ncharacteristics of L^{\\pm} or equivalently into a coupled system of backward\nstochastic differential equations for L^{\\pm}. We show how this can be used to\nboth characterise and construct optimal strategies. Our results explain and\ngeneralise all the results available in the literature so far. Moreover, we\neven obtain new sharp results in the unconstrained case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2012 16:42:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Czichowsky", "Christoph", ""], ["Schweizer", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.0715", "submitter": "Leonel P\\'erez-Hern\\'andez", "authors": "Daniel Hern\\'andez-Hern\\'andez and Leonel P\\'erez-Hern\\'andez", "title": "Robust utility maximization for L\\'evy processes: Penalization and\n  solvability", "comments": "24 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with\n  arXiv:1205.3827", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the robust utility maximization problem for a market model\nbased on L\\'evy processes is analyzed.

Specifically, we show that the critical\nassumption used in Jarrow (2010, pg. 20), to derive the illusionary alpha\nresult, is based on a zero set for CAPM with Lebesgue measure zero. So\nconclusions based on that assumption may well have probability measure zero of\noccurrence as well. Technically, the existence of [Tanaka] local time on a zero\nset for CAPM implies existence of positive alphas. In fact, we show that\npositive alpha exists under the same scenarios of \"perpetual event swap\" and\n\"market systemic event\" Jarrow (2010) used to formulate the illusionary\npositive alpha result. First, we prove that as long as asset price volatility\nis greater than zero, systemic events like market crash will occur in finite\ntime almost surely. Thus creating an opportunity to hedge against that event.\nSecond, we find that Jarrow's \"false positive alpha\" variable constitutes\nportfolio manager reward for trading strategy. For instance, we show that\npositive alpha exists if portfolio managers develop hedging strategies based on\neither (1) an exotic [barrier] option on the underlying asset - with barrier\nhitting time motivated by the \"market systemic\" event, or (2) a swaption\nstrategy for the implied interest rate risk inherent in Jarrow's triumvirate of\nriskless rate of return, factor sensitivity exposure, and constant risk premium\nfor a perpetual event swap.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 17:42:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Charles-Cadogan", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4626", "submitter": "Steven C.H.
