We derive each portfolio using\noptimization methods, and evaluate its tracking performance from both empirical\nand theoretical perspectives. Among our results, we show that static portfolios\nof different VIX futures fail to track VIX closely. VIX futures simply do not\nreact quickly enough to movements in the spot VIX. In a discrete-time model, we\ndesign and implement a dynamic trading strategy that adjusts daily to optimally\ntrack VIX. The model is calibrated to historical data and a simulation study is\nperformed to understand the properties exhibited by the strategy. In addition,\ncomparing to the volatility ETN, VXX, we find that our dynamic strategy has a\nsuperior tracking performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2019 23:11:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Tim", ""], ["Ward", "Brian", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.01274", "submitter": "Rosanna Grassi", "authors": "Gian Paolo Clemente and Rosanna Grassi and Asmerilda Hitaj", "title": "Smart network based portfolios", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we deal with the problem of portfolio allocation by enhancing\nnetwork theory tools.

The portfolio\noptimization problem is naturally modeled as a mean-risk bi-criteria\noptimization problem where the mean rate of return of the portfolio must be\nmaximized whereas a given risk measure must be minimized. Several mathematical\nprogramming models and techniques have been presented in the literature in\norder to efficiently solve the portfolio problem. A relatively recent promising\nline of research is to exploit clustering information of an assets network in\norder to develop new portfolio optimization paradigms. In this paper we endow\nthe assets network with a metric based on correlation coefficients between\nassets' returns, and show how classical location problems on networks can be\nused for clustering assets. In particular, by adding a new criterion to the\nportfolio selection problem based on an objective function of a classical\nlocation problem, we are able to measure the effect of clustering on the\nselected assets with respect to the non-selected ones. Most papers dealing with\nclustering and portfolio selection models solve these problems in two distinct\nsteps: cluster first and then selection. The innovative contribution of this\npaper is that we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming formulation for\ndealing with this problem in a unified phase.
