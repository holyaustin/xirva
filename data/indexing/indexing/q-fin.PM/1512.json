The major difficulty in\nthese problems arises from time-inconsistency, which prevents us from directly\nusing dynamic programming. To resolve this challenge, we convert to an\nequivalent bilevel optimization problem in which the inner optimization problem\nis standard stochastic control. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which\nthe outer objective function is convex and differentiable. We compute the outer\nobjective's value via a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and its gradient via\nthe viscosity solution of a linear parabolic equation, which allows us to\nperform gradient descent. The significance of this result is that we provide an\nefficient dynamic programming-based algorithm for optimal control of CVaR\nwithout lifting the state-space. To broaden the applicability of the proposed\nalgorithm, we propose convergent approximation schemes in cases where our key\nassumptions do not hold and characterize relevant suboptimality bounds. In\naddition, we extend our method to a more general class of risk metrics, which\nincludes mean-variance and median-deviation. We also demonstrate a concrete\napplication to portfolio optimization under CVaR constraints. Our results\ncontribute an efficient framework for solving time-inconsistent CVaR-based\nsequential optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2015 00:31:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 22:39:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 03:29:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Christopher W.", ""], ["Yang", "Insoon", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.06247", "submitter": "Chris Kenyon", "authors": "Chris Kenyon, Andrew Green and Mourad Berrahoui", "title": "Which measure for PFE?
