We are\nconcerned with non-exponential discounting of time and this leads to time\ninconsistencies of the decision maker. Following Ekeland and Pirvu 2006, we\nintroduce the notion of equilibrium policies and we characterize them by an\nintegral equation. The main idea is to come up with the value function in this\ncontext. If risk preferences are of CRRA type, the integral equation which\ncharacterizes the value function is shown to have a solution which leads to an\nequilibrium policy. This work is an extension of Ekeland and Pirvu 2006.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jun 2008 05:29:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ekeland", "Ivar", ""], ["Pirvu", "Traian A", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4061", "submitter": "David Hobson", "authors": "Vicky Henderson, David Hobson", "title": "An explicit solution for an optimal stopping/optimal control problem\n  which models an asset sale", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-AAP511 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Probability 2008, Vol. 18, No. 5, 1681-1705", "doi": "10.1214/07-AAP511", "report-no": "IMS-AAP-AAP511", "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we study an optimal stopping/optimal control problem which\nmodels the decision facing a risk-averse agent over when to sell an asset. The\nmarket is incomplete so that the asset exposure cannot be hedged. In addition\nto the decision over when to sell, the agent has to choose a control strategy\nwhich corresponds to a feasible wealth process. We formulate this problem as\none involving the choice of a stopping time and a martingale. We conjecture the\nform of the solution and verify that the candidate solution is equal to the\nvalue function. The interesting features of the solution are that it is\navailable in a very explicit form, that for some parameter values the optimal\nstrategy is more sophisticated than might originally be expected, and that\nalthough the setup is based on continuous diffusions, the optimal martingale\nmay involve a jump process. One interpretation of the solution is that it is\noptimal for the risk-averse agent to gamble.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jun 2008 10:01:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Nov 2008 12:25:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Henderson", "Vicky", ""], ["Hobson", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4834", "submitter": "Shaolin Ji", "authors": "Shaolin Ji", "title": "Dual method for continuous-time Markowitz's Problems with nonlinear\n  wealth equations", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection model with nonlinear wealth\nequations and bankruptcy prohibition is investigated by the dual method.
