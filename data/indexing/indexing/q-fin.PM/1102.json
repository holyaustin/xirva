These constraints are modeled by predictable convex-set-valued\nprocesses whose values do not necessarily contain the origin; that is, it may\nbe inadmissible for an investor to hold no risky investment at all. Such a\nsetup subsumes the classical constrained utility-maximization problem, as well\nas the problem where illiquid assets or a random endowment are present. Our\nmain result establishes the existence of optimal trading strategies in such\nmodels under no smoothness requirements on the utility function. The result\nalso shows that, up to attainment, the dual optimization problem can be posed\nover a set of countably-additive probability measures, thus eschewing the need\nfor the usual finitely-additive enlargement.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Feb 2011 02:22:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Mar 2012 02:31:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 11:27:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Larsen", "Kasper", ""], ["\u017ditkovi\u0107", "Gordan", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.0938", "submitter": "Ola Mahmoud", "authors": "Lisa R.
