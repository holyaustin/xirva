In this formulation\nthe utility of consumption at any given time depends only on the amount\nconsumed at that time. However, it is both theoretically and empirically\nreasonable that an individuals utility of consumption would depend on past\nconsumption history. Economists term this \"Habit Formation\". We introduce a new\nformulation of habit formation which allows non-addictive consumption patterns\nfor a wide variety of utility specification. In this paper we construct a\nsimple mathematical description of this habit formation and present numerical\nsolutions. We compare the results with the standard ones and draw insights\nobtained from the habit formation. The consumption path tends to increase with\ntime and be less sensitive to the market fluctuations, which perfectly reflects\nthe existence of habit persistence of an investor. At the same time, his\ndecreasing risk aversion, which seems to be in contradiction with the empirical\nevidence, can be explained within the limitations of the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2008 16:27:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Naryshkin", "Roman", ""], ["Davison", "Matt", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.1922", "submitter": "Didier Sornette", "authors": "Gilles Daniel, Didier Sornette and Peter Wohrmann", "title": "Look-Ahead Benchmark Bias in Portfolio Performance Evaluation", "comments": "16 pages, 1 table, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Portfolio Management 36 (1), 121-130 (Fall 2009)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Performance of investment managers are evaluated in comparison with\nbenchmarks, such as financial indices. Due to the operational constraint that\nmost professional databases do not track the change of constitution of\nbenchmark portfolios, standard tests of performance suffer from the \"look-ahead\nbenchmark bias,\" when they use the assets constituting the benchmarks of\nreference at the end of the testing period, rather than at the beginning of the\nperiod. Here, we report that the \"look-ahead benchmark bias\" can exhibit a\nsurprisingly large amplitude for portfolios of common stocks (up to 8% annum\nfor the S&P500 taken as the benchmark) -- while most studies have emphasized\nrelated survival biases in performance of mutual and hedge funds for which the\nbiases can be expected to be even larger. We use the CRSP database from 1926 to\n2006 and analyze the running top 500 US capitalizations to demonstrate that\nthis bias can account for a gross overestimation of performance metrics such as\nthe Sharpe ratio as well as an underestimation of risk, as measured for\ninstance by peak-to-valley drawdowns. We demonstrate the presence of a\nsignificant bias in the estimation of the survival and look-ahead biases\nstudied in the literature. A general methodology to test the properties of\ninvestment strategies is advanced in terms of random strategies with similar\ninvestment constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Oct 2008 17:05:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Daniel", "Gilles", ""], ["Sornette", "Didier", ""], ["Wohrmann", "Peter", ""]]}]
