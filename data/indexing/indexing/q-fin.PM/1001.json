In this paper, we\nuse the Maximum Overlap Discrete Wavelet Transform to calculate correlation\nmatrices over different timescales and then explore the eigenvalue spectrum\nover sliding time windows. The dynamics of the eigenvalue spectrum at different\ntimes and scales provides insight into the interactions between the numerous\nconstituents involved.\n  Eigenvalue dynamics are examined for both medium and high-frequency equity\nreturns, with the associated correlation structure shown to be dependent on\nboth time and scale. Additionally, the Epps effect is established using this\nmultivariate method and analyzed at longer scales than previously studied. A\npartition of the eigenvalue time-series demonstrates, at very short scales, the\nemergence of negative returns when the largest eigenvalue is greatest. Finally,\na portfolio optimization shows the importance of timescale information in the\ncontext of risk management.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jan 2010 20:08:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Conlon", "Thomas", ""], ["Ruskin", "Heather J.", ""], ["Crane", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.1379", "submitter": "Sebastien Lleo", "authors": "Mark Davis, Sebastien Lleo", "title": "Jump-Diffusion Risk-Sensitive Asset Management I: Diffusion Factor Model", "comments": "33 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper considers a portfolio optimization problem in which asset prices\nare represented by SDEs driven by Brownian motion and a Poisson random measure,\nwith drifts that are functions of an auxiliary diffusion factor process.
