In order for the\nquantum game to reduce properly to the classical game, we require legal quantum\nmoves to be orthogonal to all previous moves. We also admit interference\neffects, by squaring the sum of amplitudes over all moves by a player to\ncompute his or her occupation level of a given site. A player wins when the\nsums of occupations along any of the eight straight lines we can draw in the $3\n\\times 3$ grid is greater than three. We play the quantum tic-tac-toe first\nrandomly, and then deterministically, to explore the impact different opening\nmoves, end games, and different combinations of offensive and defensive\nstrategies have on the outcome of the game. In contrast to the classical\ntic-tac-toe, the deterministic quantum game does not always end in a draw. In\ncontrast also to most classical two-player games of no chance, it is possible\nfor Player 2 to win. More interestingly, we find that Player 1 enjoys an\noverwhelming quantum advantage when he opens with a quantum move, but loses\nthis advantage when he opens with a classical move. We also find the quantum\nblocking move, which consists of a weighted superposition of moves that the\nopponent could use to win the game, to be very effective in denying the\nopponent his or her victory. We then speculate what implications these results\nmight have on quantum information transfer and portfolio optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 09:50:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Leaw", "J.
