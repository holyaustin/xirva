Many researchers have been\nstudying this issue, and the most pioneering one is Harry Markowitz's Modern\nPortfolio Theory developed in 1952, which is the cornerstone of investment\nportfolio management and aims at \"maximum the return at the given risk\". In\ncontrast to that, fifty years later, E. Robert Fernholz's Stochastic Portfolio\nTheory, as opposed to the normative assumption served as the basis of earlier\nmodern portfolio theory, is consistent with the observable characteristics of\nactual portfolios and markets. In this paper, after introducing some basic\ntheories of Markowitz's MPT and Fernholz's SPT, then we step across to the\napplication side, trying to figure out under four basic models based on\nMarkowitz Efficient Frontier, including Markowitz Model, Constant Correlation\nModel, Single Index Model, and Multi-Factor Model, which portfolios will be\nselected and how do these portfolios perform in the real world. Here we also\ninvolve universal Portfolio Algorithmby Thomas M. Cover to select portfolios as\na comparison. Besides, each portfolio value at Risk, Expected Shortfall, and\ncorresponding bootstrap confidence interval for risk management will be\nevaluated. Finally, by utilizing factor analysis and time series models, we\ncould predict the future performance of our four models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2020 21:58:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ge", "Qingyin", ""], ["Ma", "Yunuo", ""], ["Liao", "Yuezhi", ""], ["Li", "Rongyu", ""], ["Zhu", "Tianle", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.01672", "submitter": "Sotirios Sabanis", "authors": "Sotirios Sabanis, Ying Zhang", "title": "A fully data-driven approach to minimizing CVaR for portfolio of assets\n  via SGLD with discontinuous updating", "comments": "arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1910.02008", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC math.PR math.ST q-fin.MF stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new approach in stochastic optimization via the use of stochastic gradient\nLangevin dynamics (SGLD) algorithms, which is a variant of stochastic gradient\ndecent (SGD) methods, allows us to efficiently approximate global minimizers of\npossibly complicated, high-dimensional landscapes.
