In this first paper we explore the need\nfor more general optimization tools, and consider the means by which\nconstrained random portfolios may be generated. A practical scheme for the\nlong-only fully-invested problem is developed and tested for the classic QP\napplication. The advantage of Monte Carlo methods is that they may be extended\nto risk functions that are more complicated functions of the return\ndistribution, and that the underlying return distribution may be computed\nwithout the classical Gaussian limitations. The optimization of quadratic\nrisk-return functions, VaR, CVaR, may be handled in a similar manner to\nvariability ratios such as Sortino and Omega, or mathematical constructions\nsuch as expected utility and its behavioural finance extensions.\nRobustification is also possible. Grid computing technology is an excellent\nplatform for the development of such computations due to the intrinsically\nparallel nature of the computation, coupled to the requirement to transmit only\nsmall packets of data over the grid. We give some examples deploying\nGridMathematica, in which various investor risk preferences are optimized with\ndiffering multivariate distributions. Good comparisons with established results\nin Mean-Variance and CVaR optimization are obtained when ``edge-vertex-biased''\nsampling methods are employed to create random portfolios. We also give an\napplication to Omega optimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Aug 2010 19:35:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Shaw", "William T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.3746", "submitter": "Takashi Shinzato", "authors": "Takashi Shinzato and Muneki Yasuda", "title": "Belief Propagation Algorithm for Portfolio Optimization Problems", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures, to submit to EPL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0134968", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG math.OC q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The typical behavior of optimal solutions to portfolio optimization problems\nwith absolute deviation and expected shortfall models using replica analysis\nwas pioneeringly estimated by S.
