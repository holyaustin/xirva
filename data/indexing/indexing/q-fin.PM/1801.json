It is well\nknown that in the presence of credit constraints this paradigm no longer\napplies. Instead, optimal lifecycle investment gives rise to so-called\nstochastic lifestyling (Cairns et al., 2006), whereby for low levels of\naccumulated capital it is optimal to invest fully in stocks and then gradually\nswitch to safer assets as the level of savings increases. In stochastic\nlifestyling not only does the ratio between risky and safe assets change but\nalso the mix of risky assets varies over time. While the existing literature\nrelies on complex numerical algorithms to quantify optimal lifestyling the\npresent paper provides a simple formula that captures the main essence of the\nlifestyling effect with remarkable accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jan 2018 12:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Nov 2019 15:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 28 Dec 2019 12:24:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["\u010cern\u00fd", "Ale\u0161", ""], ["Melicher\u010d\u00edk", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04080", "submitter": "Natalie Packham", "authors": "N.

We seek to identify the robust optimal growth rate, as well\nas a trading strategy which achieves this rate in all models. Under minimal\nassumptions upon $(E,c,p)$, we identify the robust growth rate with the\nDonsker-Varadhan rate function from occupancy time Large Deviations theory. We\nalso prove existence of, and explicitly identify, the optimal trading strategy.\nWe then apply our results in the case of drift uncertainty for ranked relative\nmarket capitalizations.

The game is defined by a sequence of bets with independent\nand identically distributed returns X(k). The bettor selects the fraction of\nwealth K wagered at k = 0 and waits n steps before updating the bet size.\nBetween updates, the proceeds from the previous bets remain at risk in the\nspirit of \"buy and hold.\" Within this context, the main questions we consider\nare as follows: How does the optimal performance, we call it gn*, change with\nn? Does the high-frequency case, n = 1, always lead to the best performance?\nWhat are the effects of accrued interest and transaction costs? First, we\nprovide rather complete answers to these questions for the important special\ncase when X(k) in {-1,1} is a Bernoulli random variable with probability p that\nX(k) = 1. This serves as an entry point for future research using a binomial\nlattice model for stock trading. The latter sections focus on more general\nprobability distributions for X(k) and two conjectures. The first conjecture is\nsimple to state: Absent transaction costs, gn* is non-increasing in n. The\nsecond conjecture involves the technical condition which we call the sufficient\nattractiveness inequality. We first prove that satisfaction of this inequality\nis sufficient to guarantee that the low-frequency bettor using large n can\nmatch the performance of the high-frequency bettor using n = 1. Subsequently,\nwe conjecture, and provide supporting evidence that this condition is also\nnecessary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 20 Jan 2018 22:51:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 21:13:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hsieh", "Chung-Han", ""], ["Barmish", "B.
