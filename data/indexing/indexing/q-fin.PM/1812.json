Typical portfolio optimization problems are extensions\nof the classical Markowitz mean-variance portfolio optimization model.

Then the dual information of the master\nproblem is used in a sub-problem to propose more assets to consider. We also\nconsider other extensions to the Markowitz model to diversify the portfolio\nselection within the given intervals for active weights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 23:29:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 15:19:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 May 2019 14:41:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 22 Jun 2019 00:53:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Roebers", "Lorenz M.", ""], ["Selvi", "Aras", ""], ["Vera", "Juan C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.02340", "submitter": "Daniel Philps", "authors": "Daniel Philps, Tillman Weyde, Artur d'Avila Garcez, Roy Batchelor", "title": "Continual Learning Augmented Investment Decisions", "comments": "NeurIPS 2018 Workshop on Challenges and Opportunities for AI in\n  Financial Services: the Impact of Fairness, Explainability, Accuracy, and\n  Privacy, Montreal, Canada.

We introduce Continual Learning\nAugmentation (CLA) which is based on an explicit memory structure and a feed\nforward neural network (FFNN) base model and used to drive long term financial\ninvestment decisions. We demonstrate that our approach improves accuracy in\ninvestment decision making while memory is addressed in an explainable way. Our\napproach introduces novel remember cues, consisting of empirically learned\nchange points in the absolute error series of the FFNN. Memory recall is also\nnovel, with contextual similarity assessed over time by sampling distances\nusing dynamic time warping (DTW). We demonstrate the benefits of our approach\nby using it in an expected return forecasting task to drive investment\ndecisions. In an investment simulation in a broad international equity universe\nbetween 2003-2017, our approach significantly outperforms FFNN base models. We\nalso illustrate how CLA's memory addressing works in practice, using a worked\nexample to demonstrate the explainability of our approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Dec 2018 04:26:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Dec 2018 17:26:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 10:19:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 25 Jan 2019 09:51:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Philps", "Daniel", ""], ["Weyde", "Tillman", ""], ["Garcez", "Artur d'Avila", ""], ["Batchelor", "Roy", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.03453", "submitter": "Ralf Wunderlich", "authors": "Abdelali Gabih, Hakam Kondakji, Ralf Wunderlich", "title": "Asymptotic Filter Behavior for High-Frequency Expert Opinions in a\n  Market with Gaussian Drift", "comments": "Some changes of notation, minor revisions of Subsections 2.3, 3.1,\n  3.2 and 4.1, new Figure 1, 20 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.MF q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates a financial market where stock returns depend on a\nhidden Gaussian mean reverting drift process.

Analogous to Bell and Cover (1988) in discrete time, the players start\nby choosing fair randomizations of the initial dollar, by exchanging it for a\nrandom wealth whose mean is at most 1. Each player then deposits the resulting\ncapital into some continuously-rebalanced portfolio that must be adhered to\nover $[0,t]$. We solve the corresponding `investment $\\phi$-game,' namely the\nzero-sum game with payoff kernel\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\phi\\{\\textbf{W}_1V_t(b)/(\\textbf{W}_2V_t(c))\\}]$, where\n$\\textbf{W}_i$ is player $i$'s fair randomization, $V_t(b)$ is the final wealth\nthat accrues to a one dollar deposit into the rebalancing rule $b$, and\n$\\phi(\\bullet)$ is any increasing function meant to measure relative\nperformance. We show that the unique saddle point is for both players to use\nthe (leveraged) Kelly rule for jump diffusions, which is ordinarily defined by\nmaximizing the asymptotic almost-sure continuously-compounded capital growth\nrate. Thus, the Kelly rule for jump diffusions is the correct behavior for\npractically anybody who wants to outperform other traders (on any time frame)\nwith respect to practically any measure of relative performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Dec 2018 18:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Garivaltis", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.07635", "submitter": "Omid Mohaddesi", "authors": "Mostafa Zandieh, Seyed Omid Mohaddesi", "title": "Portfolio Rebalancing under Uncertainty Using Meta-heuristic Algorithm", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we solve portfolio rebalancing problem when security returns\nare represented by uncertain variables considering transaction costs.
