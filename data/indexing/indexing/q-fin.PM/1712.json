An investor with an initial capital, is interested in\nconstructing a portfolio of securities. If the prices of securities change, the\ninvestor shall decide on reallocation of the portfolio. At each moment of time,\nthe prices of securities change and the investor is interested in constructing\na dynamic portfolio of securities. The investor wishes to maximize the value of\nhis portfolio at the end of time $T$. We use a novel theoretical approach based\non dynamic programming to solve the age old problem of dynamic programming.

What is the likelihood\nof having a successful market timing strategy? With an emphasis on modeling\nsimplicity, I calculate the feasible set of market timing portfolios using\nindex mutual fund data for perfectly timed (by hindsight) all or nothing\nquarterly switching between two asset classes, US stocks and bonds over the\ntime period 1993--2017. The historical optimal timing path of switches is shown\nto be indistinguishable from a random sequence. The key result is that the\nprobability distribution function of market timing returns is asymetric, that\nthe highest probability outcome for market timing is a below median return. Put\nanother way, simple math says market timing is more likely to lose than to\nwin---even before accounting for costs. The median of the market timing return\nprobability distribution can be directly calculated as a weighted average of\nthe returns of the model assets with the weights given by the fraction of time\neach asset has a higher return than the other. For the time period of the data\nthe median return was close to, but not identical with, the return of a static\n60:40 stock:bond portfolio. These results are illustrated through Monte Carlo\nsampling of timing paths within the feasible set and by the observed return\npaths of several market timing mutual funds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Dec 2017 22:24:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-20", "authors_parsed": [["Metcalfe", "Guy", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.05676", "submitter": "Xiang Yu", "authors": "Lijun Bo, Huafu Liao and Xiang Yu", "title": "Risk Sensitive Portfolio Optimization with Default Contagion and\n  Regime-Switching", "comments": "Final version.
