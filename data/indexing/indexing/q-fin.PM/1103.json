We consider a multidimensional continuous time model, in\nwhich the discounted stock price process satisfies the conditional full support\nproperty. We show that the super-replication price is the cheapest cost of a\ntrivial super-replication strategy. This result is an extension of previous\npapers (see [3] and [7]) which considered only European options. In these\npapers the authors showed that with the presence of proportional transaction\ncosts the super--replication price of a European option is given in terms of\nthe concave envelope of the payoff function. In the present work we prove that\nfor game options the super-replication price is given by a game variant analog\nof the standard concave envelope term. The treatment of game options is more\ncomplicated and requires additional tools. We combine the theory of consistent\nprice systems together with the theory of extended weak convergence which was\ndeveloped in [1]. The second theory is essential in dealing with hedging which\ninvolves stopping times, like in the case of game options.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Mar 2011 21:20:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 14:10:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Mar 2012 16:28:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dolinsky", "Yan", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1729", "submitter": "Damir Filipovic", "authors": "Damir Filipovi\\'c, Robert Kremslehner, Alexander Muermann", "title": "Optimal Investment and Premium Policies under Risk Shifting and Solvency\n  Regulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Limited liability creates a conflict of interests between policyholders and\nshareholders of insurance companies.

In so doing, the paper evaluates behavioral hypotheses\nadvanced by Case and Shiller (1988, 2002, 2009) in studies of boom and\npost-boom housing markets. The paper specifies and tests a multi-factor housing\nasset pricing model. In that model, we evaluate whether the market factor as\nwell as other measures of risk, including idiosyncratic risk, momentum, and MSA\nsize effects, have explanatory power for metropolitan-specific housing returns.\nFurther, we test the robustness of the asset pricing results to inclusion of\ncontrols for socioeconomic variables commonly represented in the house price\nliterature, including changes in employment, affordability, and foreclosure\nincidence. We find a sizable and statistically significant influence of the\nmarket factor on MSA house price returns. Moreover we show that market betas\nhave varied substantially over time. Also, results are largely robust to the\ninclusion of other explanatory variables, including standard measures of risk\nand other housing market fundamentals. Additional tests of model validity using\nthe Fama-MacBeth framework offer further strong support of a positive risk and\nreturn relationship in housing. Our findings are supportive of the application\nof a housing investment risk-return framework in explanation of variation in\nmetro-area cross-section and time-series US house price returns.
