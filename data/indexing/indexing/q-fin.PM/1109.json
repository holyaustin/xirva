The diversification return of a rebalanced portfolio is\noften incorrectly ascribed to a reduction in variance. We argue that the\nunderlying source of the diversification return is the rebalancing, which\nforces the investor to sell assets that have appreciated in relative value and\nbuy assets that have declined in relative value, as measured by their weights\nin the portfolio. In contrast, the incremental return of a buy-and-hold\nportfolio is driven by the fact that the assets that perform the best become a\ngreater fraction of the portfolio. We use these results to resolve two puzzles\nassociated with the Gorton and Rouwenhorst index of commodity futures, and\nthereby obtain a clear understanding of the source of the return of that index.\nDiversification return can be a significant source of return for any rebalanced\nportfolio of volatile assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 18:21:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Willenbrock", "Scott", "", "University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign"]]}, {"id": "1109.2945", "submitter": "Stephan Sturm", "authors": "Maxim Bichuch and Stephan Sturm", "title": "Portfolio Optimization under Convex Incentive Schemes", "comments": "39 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Finance and Stochastics, 18:4, pp. 873-915 (2014)", "doi": "10.1007/s00780-014-0236-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the terminal wealth utility maximization problem from the point\nof view of a portfolio manager who is paid by an incentive scheme, which is\ngiven as a convex function $g$ of the terminal wealth.
