To obtain an edge in a\nhighly competitive environment, the analyst needs to proper fine-tune its\nstrategy, or discover how to combine weak signals in novel alpha creating\nmanners. Both aspects, namely fine-tuning and combination, have been\nextensively researched using several methods, but emerging techniques such as\nGenerative Adversarial Networks can have an impact into such aspects.\nTherefore, our work proposes the use of Conditional Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (cGANs) for trading strategies calibration and aggregation. To this\npurpose, we provide a full methodology on: (i) the training and selection of a\ncGAN for time series data; (ii) how each sample is used for strategies\ncalibration; and (iii) how all generated samples can be used for ensemble\nmodelling. To provide evidence that our approach is well grounded, we have\ndesigned an experiment with multiple trading strategies, encompassing 579\nassets. We compared cGAN with an ensemble scheme and model validation methods,\nboth suited for time series. Our results suggest that cGANs are a suitable\nalternative for strategies calibration and combination, providing\noutperformance when the traditional techniques fail to generate any alpha.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2019 11:19:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2019 22:57:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 30 Mar 2019 14:19:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Koshiyama", "Adriano", ""], ["Firoozye", "Nick", ""], ["Treleaven", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.03030", "submitter": "Jiayu Zheng", "authors": "Jie Xiong, Zuo quan Xu and Jiayu Zheng", "title": "Mean-variance portfolio selection under partial information with drift\n  uncertainty", "comments": "23 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the mean-variance portfolio selection problem under\npartial information with drift uncertainty.
