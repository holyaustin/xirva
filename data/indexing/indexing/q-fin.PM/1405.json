The\nsuper-replication theorem states that there is no duality gap in the problem of\nsuper-replicating a contingent claim under transaction costs and the associated\ndual problem.

The portfolio\nselection methodologies include K-means clustering, graphical lasso and a\ncombination of the two. Our results show that clustering appears to yield\nbetter candidate portfolios on average than naively using graphical lasso over\nthe entire equity pool. A hybrid approach of using the combination of graphical\nlasso and clustering yields better results still. We also examine the effects\nof an adaptive approach during the trading period, by re-computing potential\nportfolios once to account for change in relationships with passage of time.\nHowever, the adaptive approach does not produce better results than the one\nwithout re-learning. Our results managed to pass the test for the presence of\nstatistical arbitrage test at a statistically significant level. Additionally\nwe were able to validate our findings over a separate dataset for formation and\ntrading periods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 May 2014 03:37:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Wenbin", ""], ["Dai", "Zhen", ""], ["Pan", "Bindu", ""], ["Djabirov", "Milan", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2442", "submitter": "Giorgio Ferrari", "authors": "Tiziano De Angelis, Giorgio Ferrari, John Moriarty", "title": "A Non Convex Singular Stochastic Control Problem and its Related Optimal\n  Stopping Boundaries", "comments": "24 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Equivalences are known between problems of singular stochastic control (SSC)\nwith convex performance criteria and related questions of optimal stopping, see\nfor example Karatzas and Shreve [SIAM J.
