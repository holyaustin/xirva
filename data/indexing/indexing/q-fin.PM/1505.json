In this paper, we show, for a class of price processes which are\nnot necessarily semimartingales, the existence of an optimal trading strategy\nfor utility maximisation under transaction costs by establishing the existence\nof a so-called shadow price. This is a semimartingale price process, taking\nvalues in the bid ask spread, such that frictionless trading for that price\nprocess leads to the same optimal strategy and utility as the original problem\nunder transaction costs. Our results combine arguments from convex duality with\nthe stickiness condition introduced by P. Guasoni. They apply in particular to\nexponential utility and geometric fractional Brownian motion. In this case, the\nshadow price is an Ito process. As a consequence we obtain a rather surprising\nresult on the pathwise behaviour of fractional Brownian motion: the\ntrajectories may touch an Ito process in a one-sided manner without reflection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 May 2015 18:04:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2016 07:02:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Czichowsky", "Christoph", ""], ["Schachermayer", "Walter", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.03980", "submitter": "Hansjoerg Albrecher", "authors": "Hansjoerg Albrecher and Pablo Azcue and Nora Muler", "title": "Optimal Dividend Strategies for Two Collaborating Insurance Companies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a two-dimensional optimal dividend problem in the context of two\ninsurance companies with compound Poisson surplus processes, who collaborate by\npaying each other's deficit when possible. We solve the stochastic control\nproblem of maximizing the weighted sum of expected discounted dividend payments\n(among all admissible dividend strategies) until ruin of both companies, by\nextending results of univariate optimal control theory. In the case that the\ndividends paid by the two companies are equally weighted, the value function of\nthis problem compares favorably with the one of merging the two companies\ncompletely. We identify this optimal value function as the smallest viscosity\nsupersolution of the respective Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and provide an\niterative approach to approximate it numerically. Curve strategies are\nidentified as the natural analogue of barrier strategies in this\ntwo-dimensional context. A numerical example is given for which such a curve\nstrategy is indeed optimal among all admissible dividend strategies, and for\nwhich this collaboration mechanism also outperforms the suitably weighted\noptimal dividend strategies of the two stand-alone companies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2015 07:54:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Albrecher", "Hansjoerg", ""], ["Azcue", "Pablo", ""], ["Muler", "Nora", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.04045", "submitter": "Georg Mainik", "authors": "Georg Mainik, Georgi Mitov, Ludger R\\\"uschendorf", "title": "Portfolio optimization for heavy-tailed assets: Extreme Risk Index vs.\n  Markowitz", "comments": "Manuscript accepted in the Journal of Empirical Finance", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jempfin.2015.03.003", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Using daily returns of the S&P 500 stocks from 2001 to 2011, we perform a\nbacktesting study of the portfolio optimization strategy based on the extreme\nrisk index (ERI).
