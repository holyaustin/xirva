We present a compositional state space model for\nestimation of an investment portfolio's unobserved asset allocation weightings\non a set of candidate assets when the only observed information is the time\nseries of portfolio returns and the candidate asset returns. In this paper, we\nexhibit both sequential Monte Carlo numerical and conditionally Normal\nanalytical approaches to solve for estimates of the unobserved asset weight\ntime series. This methodology is motivated by the estimation of monthly asset\nclass weights on the aggregate hedge fund industry from 1996 to 2012.\nFurthermore, we show how to implement the results as predictive investment\nweightings in order to construct hedge fund replicating portfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 22:40:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Korsos", "Laszlo F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2508", "submitter": "Matthias Raddant", "authors": "Matthias Raddant and Friedrich Wagner", "title": "Phase Transition in the S&P Stock Market", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Economic Interaction and Coordination, 11(2), 229-246,\n  2016", "doi": "10.1007/s11403-015-0160-x", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.ST q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We analyze the stock prices of the S&P market from 1987 until 2012 with the\ncovariance matrix of the firm returns determined in time windows of several\nyears.

Moments of arbitrary order, as well as non-polynomial moments\ncan be included in the formulation. We show that this gives rise to a hierarchy\nof optimization problems with decreasing levels of risk-aversion, with classic\nrobust optimization at one end of the spectrum, and stochastic programming at\nthe other. Although our primary motivation is to solve distributionally robust\noptimization problems with moment uncertainty, the cutting surface method for\ngeneral semi-infinite convex programs is also of independent interest. The\nproposed method is applicable to problems with non-differentiable semi-infinite\nconstraints indexed by an infinite-dimensional index set. Examples comparing\nthe cutting surface algorithm to the central cutting plane algorithm of\nKortanek and No demonstrate the potential of our algorithm even in the solution\nof traditional semi-infinite convex programming problems whose constraints are\ndifferentiable and are indexed by an index set of low dimension. After the rate\nof convergence analysis of the cutting surface algorithm, we extend the\nauthors' moment matching scenario generation algorithm to a probabilistic\nalgorithm that finds optimal probability distributions subject to moment\nconstraints. The combination of this distribution optimization method and the\ncentral cutting surface algorithm yields a solution to a family of\ndistributionally robust optimization problems that are considerably more\ngeneral than the ones proposed to date.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Jun 2013 16:01:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 17:15:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 15:08:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mehrotra", "Sanjay", ""], ["Papp", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.4958", "submitter": "M.
