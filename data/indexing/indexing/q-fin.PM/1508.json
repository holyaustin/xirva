We compare the optimal investment strategy\nwith those for three related goal-seeking problems and learn that the\nindividual is myopic in her investing behavior, as expected from other\ngoal-seeking research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Aug 2015 15:04:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2015 15:58:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 23 Aug 2015 20:30:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Angoshtari", "Bahman", ""], ["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.04883", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze", "title": "Heterotic Risk Models", "comments": "41 pages; a trivial typo corrected", "journal-ref": "Wilmott Magazine 2015(80) (2015) 40-55", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a complete algorithm and source code for constructing what we refer\nto as heterotic risk models (for equities), which combine: i) granularity of an\nindustry classification; ii) diagonality of the principal component factor\ncovariance matrix for any sub-cluster of stocks; and iii) dramatic reduction of\nthe factor covariance matrix size in the Russian-doll risk model construction.\nThis appears to prove a powerful approach for constructing out-of-sample stable\nshort-lookback risk models.
