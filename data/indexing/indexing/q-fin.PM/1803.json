For a fixed annuitization\ntime, to achieve higher final annuity, we consider a variable consumption rate.\nMoreover, to have a minimum guarantee for the final annuity, a safety level for\nthe wealth process is considered. To solve the stochastic optimal control\nproblem via dynamic programming, we obtain a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)\nequation on a bounded domain. The existence and uniqueness of classical\nsolutions are proved through the dual transformation. We apply the finite\ndifference method to find numerical approximations of the solution of the HJB\nequation. Finally, the simulation results for the optimal\ninvestment-consumption strategies, optimal wealth process and the final annuity\nfor different admissible ranges of consumption are given. Furthermore, by\ntaking into account the market present value of the cash flows before and after\nthe annuitization, we compare the outcomes of different scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Feb 2018 08:46:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Aug 2020 19:47:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Dadashi", "Hassan", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.01381", "submitter": "Zhongzhi Lawrence He", "authors": "Zhongzhi Lawrence He", "title": "Generalized Information Ratio", "comments": "47 pages, 1 figure, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Alpha-based performance evaluation may fail to capture correlated residuals\ndue to model errors.

The parameters of the posterior predictive\ndistributions are functions of the observed data values and, consequently, the\nsolution of the optimization problem is expressed in terms of data only and\ndoes not depend on unknown quantities.
