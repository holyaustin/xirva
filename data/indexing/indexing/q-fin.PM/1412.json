We\nextend Bayraktar and Young (2015) by allowing the individual to purchase term\nlife insurance to reach her bequest goal. The premium rate for life insurance,\n$h$, serves as a parameter to connect two seemingly unrelated problems. As the\npremium rate approaches $0$, covering the bequest goal becomes costless, so the\nindividual simply wants to avoid ruin that might result from her consumption.\nThus, as $h$ approaches $0$, the problem in this paper becomes equivalent to\nminimizing the probability of lifetime ruin, which is solved in Young (2004).\nOn the other hand, as the premium rate becomes arbitrarily large, the\nindividual will not buy life insurance to reach her bequest goal. Thus, as $h$\napproaches infinity, the problem in this paper becomes equivalent to maximizing\nthe probability of reaching the bequest goal when life insurance is not\navailable in the market, which is solved in Bayraktar and Young (2015).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Dec 2014 19:04:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 00:48:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 19:55:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Promislow", "David", ""], ["Young", "Virginia", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.4342", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze", "title": "Russian-Doll Risk Models", "comments": "25 pages; expanded version", "journal-ref": "Journal of Asset Management 16(3) (2015) 170-185", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give a simple explicit algorithm for building multi-factor risk models.

We discuss in detail how to implement this\nalgorithm in the case of (binary) industry classification based risk factors\n(e.g., \"sector -> industry -> sub-industry\"), and also in the presence of\n(non-binary) style factors. Our algorithm is particularly useful when long\nhistorical lookbacks are unavailable or undesirable, e.g., in short-horizon\nquant trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 11:57:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2015 20:10:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 15:30:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2015 03:44:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 4 Nov 2017 16:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Kakushadze", "Zura", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.4698", "submitter": "Julio Daniel Backhoff Veraguas", "authors": "Julio Backhoff, Ulrich Horst", "title": "Conditional Analysis and a Principal-Agent problem", "comments": "27 pages.

Pricing includes\nvaluation adjustments collectively known as XVA (at least credit, funding,\ncapital and tax), so management must also include XVA. In trading book\nmanagement we focus on pricing, hedging, and allocation of prices or hedging\ncosts to desks on an individual trade basis. We show how to combine three\ntechnical elements to radically simplify XVA management, both in terms of the\ncalculations, and the implementation of the calculations. The three technical\nelements are: trade-level regression; analytic computation of sensitivities;\nand global conditioning. All three are required to obtain the radical\nefficiency gains and implementation simplification. Moreover, many of the\ncalculations are inherently parallel and suitable for GPU implementation. The\nresulting methodology for XVA management is sufficiently general that we can\ncover pricing, first- and second-order sensitivities, and exact trade-level\nallocation of pricing and sensitivities within the same framework. Managing\nincremental changes to portfolios exactly is also radically simplified.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 10:56:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 19:58:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kenyon", "Chris", ""], ["Green", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.7269", "submitter": "Jun-ichi Inoue", "authors": "Mitsuaki Murota, Jun-ichi Inoue", "title": "Large-scale empirical study on pairs trading for all possible pairs of\n  stocks listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange", "comments": "19 pages, 14 figures, using svjour3.cls", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR q-fin.CP q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We carry out a large-scale empirical data analysis to examine the efficiency\nof the so-called pairs trading.
