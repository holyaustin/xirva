The Kelly criterion offers another approach, rooted in information\ntheory, that always implies logarithmic utility. The two approaches seem\nincompatible, too loosely or too tightly constraining investors' risk\npreferences, from their respective perspectives. The conflict can be understood\non the basis that the multiplicative models used in both approaches are\nnon-ergodic which leads to ensemble-average returns differing from time-average\nreturns in single realizations. The classic treatments, from the very beginning\nof probability theory, use ensemble-averages, whereas the Kelly-result is\nobtained by considering time-averages. Maximizing the time-average growth rates\nfor an investment defines an optimal leverage, whereas growth rates derived\nfrom ensemble-average returns depend linearly on leverage. The latter measure\ncan thus incentivize investors to maximize leverage, which is detrimental to\ntime-average growth and overall market stability. The Sharpe ratio is\ninsensitive to leverage. Its relation to optimal leverage is discussed. A\nbetter understanding of the significance of time-irreversibility and\nnon-ergodicity and the resulting bounds on leverage may help policy makers in\nreshaping financial risk controls.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2009 18:23:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Aug 2010 16:27:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Ole", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.3836", "submitter": "Woo-Sung Jung", "authors": "Cheoljun Eom, Jongwon Park, Woo-Sung Jung, Taisei Kaizoji, Yong H.
