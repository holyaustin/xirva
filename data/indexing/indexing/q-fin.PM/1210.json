This captures a type of contagion where each\ndownward jump in an asset's price results in increased likelihood of further\njumps, both in that asset and in the other assets. We solve in closed-form the\ndynamic consumption-investment problem of a log-utility investor in such a\ncontagion model, prove a theorem verifying its optimality and discuss features\nof the solution, including flight-to-quality. The exponential and power utility\ninvestors are also considered: in these cases, the optimal strategy can be\ncharacterized as a distortion of the strategy of a corresponding non-contagion\ninvestor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Oct 2012 21:21:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["A\u00eft-Sahalia", "Yacine", ""], ["Hurd", "T.

We propose a quantitative\nframework for studying this order placement problem by formulating it as a\nconvex optimization problem. This formulation allows to study how the interplay\nbetween the state of order books, the fee structure, order flow properties and\npreferences of a trader determine the optimal placement decision. In the case\nof a single exchange, we derive an explicit solution for the optimal split\nbetween limit and market orders. For the general problem of order placement\nacross multiple exchanges, we propose a stochastic algorithm for computing the\noptimal policy and study the sensitivity of the solution to various parameters\nusing a numerical implementation of the algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Oct 2012 02:01:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 May 2013 17:11:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Jul 2013 04:30:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 15:59:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Cont", "Rama", ""], ["Kukanov", "Arseniy", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.3800", "submitter": "Erhan Bayraktar", "authors": "Nicole Bauerle and Erhan Bayraktar", "title": "A Note on Applications of Stochastic Ordering to Control Problems in\n  Insurance and Finance", "comments": "To appear in Stochastics.
