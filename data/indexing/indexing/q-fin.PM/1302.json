The risk is often estimated by a\nsubstitution of a good estimator of the volatility matrix. However, the\naccuracy of such a risk estimator for large portfolios is largely unknown, and\na simple inequality in the previous literature gives an infeasible upper bound\nfor the estimation error. In addition, numerical studies illustrate that this\nupper bound is very crude. In this paper, we propose factor-based risk\nestimators under a large amount of assets, and introduce a high-confidence\nlevel upper bound (H-CLUB) to assess the accuracy of the risk estimation. The\nH-CLUB is constructed based on three different estimates of the volatility\nmatrix: sample covariance, approximate factor model with known factors, and\nunknown factors (POET, Fan, Liao and Mincheva, 2013). For the first time in the\nliterature, we derive the limiting distribution of the estimated risks in high\ndimensionality. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed upper\nbounds significantly outperform the traditional crude bounds, and provide\ninsightful assessment of the estimation of the portfolio risks. In addition,\nour simulated results quantify the relative error in the risk estimation, which\nis usually negligible using 3-month daily data. Finally, the proposed methods\nare applied to an empirical study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2013 03:02:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Liao", "Yuan", ""], ["Shi", "Xiaofeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.2231", "submitter": "Chuancun Yin", "authors": "Chuancun Yin, Yuzhen Wen, Yongxia Zhao", "title": "On the optimal dividend problem for a spectrally positive Levy process", "comments": "to appear in Astin Bull", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we study the optimal dividend problem for a company whose\nsurplus process evolves as a spectrally positive Levy process.

With respect to the comparison\nof the two strategies, various criteria are applied such as comparison of\nterminal payoffs and payoff distributions.
