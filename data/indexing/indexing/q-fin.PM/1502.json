In addition to maximizing the expected discounted\nreturn from option sale, we incorporate a path-dependent risk penalty based on\nshortfall or quadratic variation of the option price up to the liquidation\ntime. We establish the conditions under which it is optimal to immediately\nliquidate or hold the option position through expiration. Furthermore, we study\nthe variational inequality associated with the optimal stopping problem, and\nprove the existence and uniqueness of a strong solution. A series of analytical\nand numerical results are provided to illustrate the non-trivial optimal\nliquidation strategies under geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and exponential\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck models. We examine the combined effects of price dynamics\nand risk penalty on the sell and delay regions for various options. In\naddition, we obtain an explicit closed-form solution for the liquidation of a\nstock with quadratic penalty under the GBM model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 04:47:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Leung", "Tim", ""], ["Shirai", "Yoshihiro", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.01658", "submitter": "Michael Ho", "authors": "Michael Ho, Zheng Sun, Jack Xin", "title": "Weighted Elastic Net Penalized Mean-Variance Portfolio Design and\n  Computation", "comments": "Added comparisons to SCAD and other techniques", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is well known that the out-of-sample performance of Markowitz's\nmean-variance portfolio criterion can be negatively affected by estimation\nerrors in the mean and covariance. In this paper we address the problem by\nregularizing the mean-variance objective function with a weighted elastic net\npenalty. We show that the use of this penalty can be motivated by a robust\nreformulation of the mean-variance criterion that directly accounts for\nparameter uncertainty. With this interpretation of the weighted elastic net\npenalty we derive data driven techniques for calibrating the weighting\nparameters based on the level of uncertainty in the parameter estimates. We\ntest our proposed technique on US stock return data and our results show that\nthe calibrated weighted elastic net penalized portfolio outperforms both the\nunpenalized portfolio and uniformly weighted elastic net penalized portfolio.\n  This paper also introduces a novel Adaptive Support Split-Bregman approach\nwhich leverages the sparse nature of $\\ell_{1}$ penalized portfolios to\nefficiently compute a solution of our proposed portfolio criterion. Numerical\nresults show that this modification to the Split-Bregman algorithm results in\nsignificant improvements in computational speed compared with other techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Feb 2015 17:57:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 05:59:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 03:34:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-16", "authors_parsed": [["Ho", "Michael", ""], ["Sun", "Zheng", ""], ["Xin", "Jack", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.02286", "submitter": "Tatiana Belkina", "authors": "Tatiana Belkina and Shangzhen Luo", "title": "Asymptotic Investment Behaviors under a Jump-Diffusion Risk Process", "comments": "23 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study an optimal investment control problem for an insurance company.
