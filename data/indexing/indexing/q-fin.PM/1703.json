The authors develop the idea\nfurther and propose a fractal distribution of returns as a core. This class of\ndistributions is more general as it does not imply strict limitations on risk\nevolution. The proposed model allows for modifying a rule for volatility\nestimation, thus, enhancing its explanatory power. It turns out that the latter\nimproves the performance metrics of an investment portfolio over the ten year\nperiod. The fractal model of volatility plays a significant protective role\nduring the periods of market abnormal drawdowns.
