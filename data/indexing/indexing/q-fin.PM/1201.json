The objective is to proceed from a\nmodel of the loss distribution, given through probabilities, correlations and\nthe like, to an analytical approximation of the distribution. Once this is done\nwe show how to derive the so-called risk contributions which are the\nderivatives of risk measures, such as a given quantile (VaR) or expected\nshortfall, to the allocations in the underlying assets. These show, informally,\nwhere the risk is coming from, and also indicate how to go about optimising the\nportfolio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2011 11:10:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Richard J", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.0625", "submitter": "Leonidas Sandoval", "authors": "Leonidas Sandoval Junior, Adriana Bruscato, Maria Kelly Venezuela", "title": "Building portfolios of stocks in the S\\~ao Paulo Stock Exchange using\n  Random Matrix Theory", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": "Physica A 410 (2013) 94-109", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2014.05.006", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  By using Random Matrix Theory, we build covariance matrices between stocks of\nthe BM&F-Bovespa (Bolsa de Valores, Mercadorias e Futuros de S\\~ao Paulo) which\nare cleaned of some of the noise due to the complex interactions between the\nmany stocks and the finiteness of available data. We also use a regression\nmodel in order to remove the market effect due to the common movement of all\nstocks. These two procedures are then used to build stock portfolios based on\nMarkowitz's theory, trying to obtain better predictions of future risk based on\npast data. This is done for years of both low and high volatility of the\nBrazilian stock market, from 2004 to 2010. The results show that the use of\nregression to subtract the market effect on returns greatly increases the\naccuracy of the prediction of risk, and that, although the cleaning of the\ncorrelation matrix often leads to portfolios that better predict risks, in\nperiods of high volatility of the market this procedure may fail to do so.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2012 13:10:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 17:08:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-11", "authors_parsed": [["Junior", "Leonidas Sandoval", ""], ["Bruscato", "Adriana", ""], ["Venezuela", "Maria Kelly", ""]]}]
