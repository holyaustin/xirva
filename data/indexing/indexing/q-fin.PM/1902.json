It appears that the mathematical problem is\nmore complex than the traditional risk budgeting problem. The formulation of\nthe optimization program is particularly critical in order to determine the\nright risk budgeting portfolio. We also show that numerical solutions can be\nfound using methods that are used in large-scale machine learning problems.\nIndeed, we develop an algorithm that mixes the method of cyclical coordinate\ndescent (CCD), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal\noperators and Dykstra's algorithm. This theoretical body is then applied to\nsome investment problems. In particular, we show how to dynamically control the\nturnover of a risk parity portfolio and how to build smart beta portfolios\nbased on the ERC approach by improving the liquidity of the portfolio or\nreducing the small cap bias. Finally, we highlight the importance of the\nhomogeneity property of risk measures and discuss the related scaling puzzle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Feb 2019 07:41:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Richard", "Jean-Charles", ""], ["Roncalli", "Thierry", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06053", "submitter": "Vassilis Polimenis", "authors": "Vassilis Polimenis and Ioannis Neokosmidis", "title": "Non-Stationary Dividend-Price Ratios", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1057/s41260-019-00143-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.GN q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dividend yields have been widely used in previous research to relate stock\nmarket valuations to cash flow fundamentals.

Here, we extend that paper by\nperforming multivariate regressions based on the Campbell-Shiller\napproximation, by utilizing a dynamic econometric procedure to estimate the\nmodified dp, and by testing the modified ratios against reinvested\ndividend-yields. By comparing the performance of mdp and dp in the period after\n1965, we are not only able to enhance the robustness of the findings, but also\nto debunk a possible false explanation that the enhanced mdp performance in\npredicting future returns comes from a capacity to predict the risk-free return\ncomponent. Depending on whether one uses the recursive or population\nmethodology to measure the performance of mdp, the Out-of-Sample performance\ngain is between 30% to 50%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 16 Feb 2019 06:40:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Polimenis", "Vassilis", ""], ["Neokosmidis", "Ioannis", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.06294", "submitter": "Kristoffer Lindensj\\\"o", "authors": "Kristoffer Lindensj\\\"o and Filip Lindskog", "title": "Optimal dividends and capital injection under dividend restrictions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a singular stochastic control problem faced by the owner of an\ninsurance company that dynamically pays dividends and raises capital in the\npresence of the restriction that the surplus process must be above a given\ndividend payout barrier in order for dividend payments to be allowed.\nBankruptcy occurs if the surplus process becomes negative and there are\nproportional costs for capital injection.

This is done by analyzing the corresponding linear\npartial differential equation (PDE) via regular and singular perturbation\ntechniques, as in the single-scale cases.

This phenomenon affects\nmajor financial services, including wealth management, employee savings plans,\nasset managers, etc. Since the robo-advisory model is in its early stages, we\nestimate that robo-advisors will help to manage around $1 trillion of assets in\n2020 (OECD, 2017). And this trend is not going to stop with future generations,\nwho will live in a technology-driven and social media-based world. In the\ninvestment industry, robo-advisors face different challenges: client profiling,\ncustomization, asset pooling, liability constraints, etc. In its primary sense,\nrobo-advisory is a term for defining automated portfolio management. This\nincludes automated trading and rebalancing, but also automated portfolio\nallocation. And this last issue is certainly the most important challenge for\nrobo-advisory over the next five years. Today, in many robo-advisors, asset\nallocation is rather human-based and very far from being computer-based. The\nreason is that portfolio optimization is a very difficult task, and can lead to\noptimized mathematical solutions that are not optimal from a financial point of\nview (Michaud, 1989). The big challenge for robo-advisors is therefore to be\nable to optimize and rebalance hundreds of optimal portfolios without human\nintervention. In this paper, we show that the mean-variance optimization\napproach is mainly driven by arbitrage factors that are related to the concept\nof hedging portfolios. This is why regularization and sparsity are necessary to\ndefine robust asset allocation. However, this mathematical framework is more\ncomplex and requires understanding how norm penalties impacts portfolio\noptimization. From a numerical point of view, it also requires the\nimplementation of non-traditional algorithms based on ADMM methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Feb 2019 08:30:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bourgeron", "Thibault", ""], ["Lezmi", "Edmond", ""], ["Roncalli", "Thierry", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10044", "submitter": "Marcin Pitera", "authors": "Tomasz R.
