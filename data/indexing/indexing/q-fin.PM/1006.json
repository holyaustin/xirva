In this system, causal relationships are represented as\nlogical formulas, allowing us to test arbitrarily complex hypotheses in a\ncomputationally efficient way. We simulate return time series using a common\nfactor model, and show that on this data the method described significantly\noutperforms Granger causality (a primary approach to this type of problem).\nFinally we apply the method to real return data, showing that the method can\ndiscover novel relationships between stocks. The approach described is a\ngeneral one that will allow combination of price and volume data with\nqualitative information at varying time scales (from interest rate\nannouncements, to earnings reports to news stories) shedding light on some of\nthe previously invisible common causes of seemingly correlated price movements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 12:57:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Kleinberg", "Samantha", ""], ["Kolm", "Petter N.", ""], ["Mishra", "Bud", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.2555", "submitter": "Yaroslav Ivanenko", "authors": "Yaroslav Ivanenko", "title": "Price as a matter of choice and nonstochastic randomness", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.PM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A version of indifference valuation of a European call option is proposed\nthat includes statistical regularities of nonstochastic randomness.

The weighting scheme is based\non a similarity measure which compares the current correlation structure of the\nmarket to the structures at past times.
