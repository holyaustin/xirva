We present a mean-field approach that reduces the multi-asset\nproblem to a single-asset problem, with an effective predictor that includes a\nrisk averse component. We obtain a simple approximate solution in the case of\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck predictors and maximum position constraints. The optimal\nstrategy is of the \"bang-bang\" type similar to that obtained in [de Lataillade\net al., 2012]. When the risk aversion parameter is small, we find that the\ntrading threshold is an affine function of the instantaneous global position,\nwith a slope coefficient that we compute exactly. We relate the risk aversion\nparameter to the desired target risk and provide numerical simulations that\nsupport our analytical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 May 2019 01:40:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2020 23:15:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Emschwiller", "Matt", ""], ["Petit", "Benjamin", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.04842", "submitter": "Jessie(Zexi) Sun", "authors": "Jessie Sun", "title": "A Stock Selection Method Based on Earning Yield Forecast Using Sequence\n  Prediction Models", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE q-fin.MF q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Long-term investors, different from short-term traders, focus on examining\nthe underlying forces that affect the well-being of a company.

In order to attain certain desired return\nprofiles, quantitative strategists must determine a large array of trading\nparameters. Backtesting, the attempt to identify the appropriate parameters\nusing historical data available, has been highly criticized due to the\nabundance of misleading results. Hence, there is an increasing interest in\ndevising procedures for the assessment and comparison of strategies, that is,\ndevising schemes for preventing what is known as backtesting overfitting. So\nfar, many financial researchers have proposed different ways to tackle this\nproblem that can be broadly categorised in three types: Data Snooping,\nOverestimated Performance, and Cross-Validation Evaluation. In this paper, we\npropose a new approach to dealing with financial overfitting, a\nCovariance-Penalty Correction, in which a risk metric is lowered given the\nnumber of parameters and data used to underpins a trading strategy. We outlined\nthe foundation and main results behind the Covariance-Penalty correction for\ntrading strategies. After that, we pursue an empirical investigation, comparing\nits performance with some other approaches in the realm of Covariance-Penalties\nacross more than 1300 assets, using Ordinary and Total Least Squares. Our\nresults suggest that Covariance-Penalties are a suitable procedure to avoid\nBacktesting Overfitting, and Total Least Squares provides superior performance\nwhen compared to Ordinary Least Squares.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 08:39:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Koshiyama", "Adriano", ""], ["Firoozye", "Nick", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.05371", "submitter": "Bingyan Han", "authors": "Bingyan Han and Hoi Ying Wong", "title": "Merton's portfolio problem under Volterra Heston model", "comments": "14 pages, 3 figures, exponential utility added", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper investigates Merton's portfolio problem in a rough stochastic\nenvironment described by Volterra Heston model.

In this paper we leverage information obtained\nfrom a heterogeneous simultaneous graphical dynamic linear model (H-SGDLM) and\npropose a novel formulation of the mean reversion problem, which is phrased in\nterms of a quasi-convex minimisation with a normalisation constraint. This new\nformulation allows us to employ a cyclical coordinate descent algorithm for\nefficiently computing an exact sparse solution, even in a large universe of\nassets, while the use of H-SGDLM data allows us to easily control the required\nlevel of sparsity.
