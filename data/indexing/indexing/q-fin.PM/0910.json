The only user\ninput in our framework is a multi-factor model (a \"prior\" model hereafter) for\nindex portfolios, such as CDX.NA.IG or iTraxx Europe, that are chosen as\nbenchmark securities for the pricing of a given bespoke CDO. Parameters of the\nprior model are fixed, and not tuned to match prices of benchmark index\ntranches. Instead, our calibration procedure amounts to a proper reweightening\nof the prior measure using the Minimum Cross Entropy method. As the latter\nproblem reduces to convex optimization in a low dimensional space, our model is\ncomputationally efficient. Both the static (one-period) and dynamic versions of\nthe model are presented. The latter can be used for pricing and risk management\nof more exotic instruments referencing bespoke portfolios, such as\nforward-starting tranches or tranche options, and for calculation of credit\nvaluation adjustment (CVA) for bespoke tranches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 19:52:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Halperin", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.3936", "submitter": "Ale\\v{s}  \\v{C}ern\\'y", "authors": "Sara Biagini and Ale\\v{s} \\v{C}ern\\'y", "title": "Admissible Strategies in Semimartingale Portfolio Selection", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": "SIAM J.

We propose a novel notion of admissibility that has many pleasant\nfeatures - admissibility is characterized purely under the objective measure;\neach admissible strategy can be approximated by simple strategies using finite\nnumber of trading dates; the wealth of any admissible strategy is a\nsupermartingale under all pricing measures; local boundedness of the price\nprocess is not required; neither strict monotonicity, strict concavity nor\ndifferentiability of the utility function are necessary; the definition\nencompasses both the classical mean-variance preferences and the monotone\nexpected utility. For utility functions finite on the whole real line, our\nclass represents a minimal set containing simple strategies which also contains\nthe optimizer, under conditions that are milder than the celebrated reasonable\nasymptotic elasticity condition on the utility function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2009 19:51:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2010 16:15:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 1 Sep 2010 07:05:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sat, 16 Oct 2010 16:47:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 11 Dec 2010 11:50:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-25", "authors_parsed": [["Biagini", "Sara", ""], ["\u010cern\u00fd", "Ale\u0161", ""]]}]
