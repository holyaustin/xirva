Although MPT has\nmade huge impacts on the investment world and prompted the success and\nprevalence of passive investing, it still has shortcomings in real-world\napplications. One of the main challenges is that the level of risk an investor\ncan endure, known as \\emph{risk-preference}, is a subjective choice that is\ntightly related to psychology and behavioral science in decision making. This\npaper presents a novel approach of measuring risk preference from existing\nportfolios using inverse optimization on the mean-variance portfolio allocation\nframework. Our approach allows the learner to continuously estimate real-time\nrisk preferences using concurrent observed portfolios and market price data. We\ndemonstrate our methods on real market data that consists of 20 years of asset\npricing and 10 years of mutual fund portfolio holdings. Moreover, the\nquantified risk preference parameters are validated with two well-known risk\nmeasurements currently applied in the field. The proposed methods could lead to\npractical and fruitful innovations in automated/personalized portfolio\nmanagement, such as Robo-advising, to augment financial advisors' decision\nintelligence in a long-term investment horizon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Oct 2020 21:29:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 22 Oct 2020 03:09:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 12 Feb 2021 17:15:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Shi", ""], ["Wang", "Haoran", ""], ["Dong", "Chaosheng", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.04404", "submitter": "Miquel Noguer Alonso", "authors": "Miquel Noguer i Alonso and Sonam Srivastava", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Asset Allocation in US Equities", "comments": "Submitting to Journal of Machine Learning in Finance", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Reinforcement learning is a machine learning approach concerned with solving\ndynamic optimization problems in an almost model-free way by maximizing a\nreward function in state and action spaces. This property makes it an exciting\narea of research for financial problems. Asset allocation, where the goal is to\nobtain the weights of the assets that maximize the rewards in a given state of\nthe market considering risk and transaction costs, is a problem easily framed\nusing a reinforcement learning framework. It is first a prediction problem for\nexpected returns and covariance matrix and then an optimization problem for\nreturns, risk, and market impact. Investors and financial researchers have been\nworking with approaches like mean-variance optimization, minimum variance, risk\nparity, and equally weighted and several methods to make expected returns and\ncovariance matrices' predictions more robust. This paper demonstrates the\napplication of reinforcement learning to create a financial model-free solution\nto the asset allocation problem, learning to solve the problem using time\nseries and deep neural networks. We demonstrate this on daily data for the top\n24 stocks in the US equities universe with daily rebalancing. We use a deep\nreinforcement model on US stocks using different architectures. We use Long\nShort Term Memory networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks and compare them with more traditional portfolio management. The Deep\nReinforcement Learning approach shows better results than traditional\napproaches using a simple reward function and only being given the time series\nof stocks. In Finance, no training to test error generalization results come\nguaranteed. We can say that the modeling framework can deal with time series\nprediction and asset allocation, including transaction costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2020 07:25:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Alonso", "Miquel Noguer i", ""], ["Srivastava", "Sonam", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.08900", "submitter": "Tetsuo Kurosaki", "authors": "Tetsuo Kurosaki, Young Shin Kim", "title": "Cryptocurrency portfolio optimization with multivariate normal tempered\n  stable processes and Foster-Hart risk", "comments": "15 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study portfolio optimization of four major cryptocurrencies.

Recently, robust\noptimization (RO) models have attracted a lot of interest in this area. RO\nprovides a computationally tractable framework for portfolio optimization based\non relatively general assumptions on the probability distributions of the\nuncertain risk parameters. Thus, RO extends the framework of traditional linear\nand non-linear models (e.g., the well-known mean-variance model), incorporating\nuncertainty through a formal and analytical approach into the modeling process.\nRobust counterparts of existing models can be considered as worst-case\nre-formulations as far as deviations of the uncertain parameters from their\nnominal values are concerned.
