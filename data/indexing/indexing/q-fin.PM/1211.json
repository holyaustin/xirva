Furthermore, the\nequivalent probability measure ---under which the utility maximization problems\nhave solutions--- can be chosen as close to the real-world probability measure\nas we want (but might not be equal). Without changing the underlying\nprobability measure and under mild assumptions, our second contribution proves\nthat the NUPBR is equivalent to the \"{\\it local}\" existence of the optimal\nportfolio.

The\nimpact of parameter imperfections on the quality of expected loss (EL) in the\nsense of a fair, unbiased estimate of risk expenses however is barely covered.\nSo far there are no established backtesting procedures for EL, quantifying its\nimpact with regards to pricing or risk adjusted profitability measures. In this\npaper, a practically oriented, top-down approach to assess the quality of EL by\nbacktesting with a properly defined risk measure is introduced. In a first\nstep, the concept of risk expenses (Cost of Risk) has to be extended beyond the\nclassical provisioning view, towards a more adequate capital consumption\napproach (Impact of Risk, IoR). On this basis, the difference between\nparameter-based EL and actually reported Impact of Risk is decomposed into its\nkey components. The proposed method will deepen the understanding of practical\nproperties of EL, reconciles the EL with a clearly defined and observable risk\nmeasure and provides a link between upcoming IFRS 9 accounting standards for\nloan loss provisioning with IRBA regulatory capital requirements. The method is\nrobust irrespective whether parameters are simple, expert based values or\nhighly predictive and perfectly calibrated IRBA compliant methods, as long as\nparameters and default identification procedures are stable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Nov 2012 06:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 21 Apr 2013 12:39:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 13:34:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Reitgruber", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.5816", "submitter": "Moawia Alghalith", "authors": "Moawia Alghalith", "title": "General Smooth Solutions to the HJB PDE: Applications to Finance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We overcome a major obstacle in mathematical optimization.
