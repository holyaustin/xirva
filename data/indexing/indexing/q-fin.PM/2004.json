For this to be a viable financial product, it is necessary to\nknow how to manage the fund even when it is heterogeneous: that is when\ndifferent investors have different preferences, wealth and mortality. There is\nno obvious way to define a single objective for a heterogeneous fund, so this\nis not an optimal control problem. In lieu of an objective function, we take an\naxiomatic approach. Subject to our axioms on the management of the fund, we\nfind an upper bound on the utility that can be achieved for each investor,\nassuming a complete markets and the absence of systematic longevity risk.

In spite of the\navailability of data from multiple markets, current approaches in trading rely\nmainly on learning trading strategies per individual market. In this paper, we\ntake a step towards developing fully end-to-end global trading strategies that\nleverage systematic trends to produce superior market-specific trading\nstrategies. We introduce QuantNet: an architecture that learns market-agnostic\ntrends and use these to learn superior market-specific trading strategies. Each\nmarket-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder\ntransforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is\nprocessed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a\nmarket-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information\nfrom the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent\nadvances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are\nfree to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters\nare driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over\nidiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding\nthe problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns. We\nevaluate QuantNet on historical data across 3103 assets in 58 global equity\nmarkets. Against the top performing baseline, QuantNet yielded 51% higher\nSharpe and 69% Calmar ratios. In addition we show the benefits of our approach\nover the non-transfer learning variant, with improvements of 15% and 41% in\nSharpe and Calmar ratios.

The focal point of this paper is to extend upon the\nresults of our previous work to obtain various optimality characterizations on\nthe portfolio. To be more specific, using Kelly's criterion in our\nfrequency-based formulation, we first prove necessary and sufficient conditions\nfor the frequency-based Kelly optimal portfolio. With the aid of these\nconditions, we then show several new optimality characterizations such as\nexpected ratio optimality and asymptotic relative optimality, and a result\nwhich we call the Extended Dominant Asset Theorem.

The word \"extended\" on the theorem comes\nfrom the fact that it was only a sufficiency result that was proved in our\nprevious work. Hence, in this paper, we improve it to involve a proof of the\nnecessity part. In addition, the trader's survivability issue (no bankruptcy\nconsideration) is also studied in detail in our frequency-based trading\nframework.
