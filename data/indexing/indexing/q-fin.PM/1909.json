Due to multi-dimensional performance fees that are\ncharged whenever each fund profit exceeds its historical maximum, the value\nfunction is expected to be multi-dimensional. New mathematical challenges arise\nas the standard dimension reduction cannot be applied, and the convexity of the\nvalue function and Isaacs condition may not hold in our ruin probability\nminimization problem with drift uncertainty. We propose to employ the\nstochastic Perron's method to characterize the value function as the unique\nviscosity solution to the associated Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) equation\nwithout resorting to the proof of dynamic programming principle. The required\ncomparison principle is also established in our setting to close the loop of\nstochastic Perron's method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Sep 2019 12:46:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 13 Jun 2020 07:27:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 25 Oct 2020 12:33:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Junbeom", ""], ["Yu", "Xiang", ""], ["Zhou", "Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.01830", "submitter": "Dorothee Westphal", "authors": "J\\\"orn Sass, Dorothee Westphal", "title": "Robust Utility Maximizing Strategies under Model Uncertainty and their\n  Convergence", "comments": "31 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we investigate a utility maximization problem with drift\nuncertainty in a multivariate continuous-time Black-Scholes type financial\nmarket which may be incomplete.

The relatively low volume of daily returns in\nfinancial market data is addressed via data augmentation (a generative\napproach) and a choice of pre-training strategies, both of which are validated\nagainst current state-of-the-art models.

However, it also has one well-established\nfailing since it can lead to portfolios that are not optimal from a financial\npoint of view. Nevertheless, very few models have succeeded in providing a real\nalternative solution to the Markowitz model. The main reason lies in the fact\nthat most academic portfolio optimization models are intractable in real life\nalthough they present solid theoretical properties. By intractable we mean that\nthey can be implemented for an investment universe with a small number of\nassets using a lot of computational resources and skills, but they are unable\nto manage a universe with dozens or hundreds of assets. However, the emergence\nand the rapid development of robo-advisors means that we need to rethink\nportfolio optimization and go beyond the traditional mean-variance optimization\napproach. Another industry has faced similar issues concerning large-scale\noptimization problems. Machine learning has long been associated with linear\nand logistic regression models. Again, the reason was the inability of\noptimization algorithms to solve high-dimensional industrial problems.\nNevertheless, the end of the 1990s marked an important turning point with the\ndevelopment and the rediscovery of several methods that have since produced\nimpressive results. The goal of this paper is to show how portfolio allocation\ncan benefit from the development of these large-scale optimization algorithms.\nNot all of these algorithms are useful in our case, but four of them are\nessential when solving complex portfolio optimization problems.
