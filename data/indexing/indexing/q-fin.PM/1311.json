Defaults come as\nPoisson events and the default intensities of the different components in the\nsystem interact through the empirical default rate and via systematic effects\nthat are common to all components. We establish the large deviations principle\nfor the empirical default rate for such an interacting particle system. The\nrate function is derived in an explicit form that is amenable to numerical\ncomputations and derivation of the most likely path to failure for the system\nitself. Numerical studies illustrate the theoretical findings. An understanding\nof the role of the preferred paths to large default rates and the most likely\nways in which contagion and systematic risk combine to lead to large default\nrates would give useful insights into how to optimally safeguard against such\nevents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Nov 2013 17:56:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 21:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Spiliopoulos", "Konstantinos", ""], ["Sowers", "Richard B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.1715", "submitter": "Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "authors": "Ren Liu, Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "title": "Portfolio Choice with Stochastic Investment Opportunities: a User's\n  Guide", "comments": "31 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This survey reviews portfolio choice in settings where investment\nopportunities are stochastic due to, e.g., stochastic volatility or return\npredictability.

A promising alternative is\nthat of employing community detection techniques developed in network theory.\nUnfortunately, this approach has focused predominantly on replacing network\ndata with correlation matrices, a procedure that tends to be intrinsically\nbiased due to its inconsistency with the null hypotheses underlying the\nexisting algorithms.
