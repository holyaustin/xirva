As compared to market-cap based SMB, CMH portfolios are much less\nanti-correlated to the Low-Vol anomaly. In contrast with standard risk premia,\nsize-based portfolios are found to be virtually unskewed. In fact, the extreme\nrisk of these portfolios is dominated by the large cap leg; small caps actually\nhave a positive (rather than negative) skewness. The only argument that favours\na risk premium interpretation at the individual stock level is that the extreme\ndrawdowns are more frequent for small cap/turnover stocks, even after\naccounting for volatility. This idiosyncratic risk is however clearly\ndiversifiable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 08:31:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 10:16:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ciliberti", "Stefano", ""], ["S\u00e9ri\u00e9", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Simon", "Guillaume", ""], ["Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re", "Yves", ""], ["Bouchaud", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02424", "submitter": "Juan  Monge", "authors": "Juan Francisco Monge", "title": "Cardinality constrained portfolio selection via factor models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Optimization Letters, 2020", "doi": "10.1007/s11590-020-01571-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we propose and discuss different 0-1 linear models in order to\nsolve the cardinality constrained portfolio problem by using factor models.\nFactor models are used to build portfolios to track indexes, together with\nother objectives, also need a smaller number of parameters to estimate than the\nclassical Markowitz model. The addition of the cardinality constraints limits\nthe number of securities in the portfolio. Restricting the number of securities\nin the portfolio allows us to obtain a concentrated portfolio, reduce the risk\nand limit transaction costs. To solve this problem, a pure 0-1 model is\npresented in this work, the 0-1 model is constructed by means of a piecewise\nlinear approximation. We also present a new quadratic combinatorial problem,\ncalled a minimum edge-weighted clique problem, to obtain an equality weighted\ncardinality constrained portfolio. A piecewise linear approximation for this\nproblem is presented in the context of a multi factor model. For a single\nfactor model, we present a fast heuristic, based on some theoretical results to\nobtain an equality weighted cardinality constraint portfolio. The consideration\nof a piecewise linear approximation allow us to reduce significantly the\ncomputation time required for the equivalent quadratic problem. Computational\nresults from the 0-1 models are compared to those using a state-of-the-art\nQuadratic MIP solver.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 09:35:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Monge", "Juan Francisco", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02984", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Willie Yu", "title": "Decoding Stock Market with Quant Alphas", "comments": "20 pages; to appear in Journal of Asset Management", "journal-ref": "Journal of Asset Management 19(1) (2018) 38-48", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.MF q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give an explicit algorithm and source code for extracting expected returns\nfor stocks from expected returns for alphas.

As important properties, the EVaR is strongly monotone over its domain\nand strictly monotone over a broad sub-domain including all continuous\ndistributions, while well-known monotone risk measures, such as VaR and CVaR\nlack these properties. A key feature for a risk measure, besides its financial\nproperties, is its applicability in large-scale sample-based portfolio\noptimization. If the negative return of an investment portfolio is a\ndifferentiable convex function, the portfolio optimization with the EVaR\nresults in a differentiable convex program whose number of variables and\nconstraints is independent of the sample size, which is not the case for the\nVaR and CVaR. This enables us to design an efficient algorithm using\ndifferentiable convex optimization. Our extensive numerical study shows the\nhigh efficiency of the algorithm in large scales, compared to the existing\nconvex optimization software packages. The computational efficiency of the EVaR\nportfolio optimization approach is also compared with that of CVaR-based\nportfolio optimization. This comparison shows that the EVaR approach generally\nperforms similarly, and it outperforms as the sample size increases. Moreover,\nthe comparison of the portfolios obtained for a real case by the EVaR and CVaR\napproaches shows that the EVaR approach can find portfolios with better\nexpectations and VaR values at high confidence levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 15:38:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ahmadi-Javid", "Amir", ""], ["Fallah-Tafti", "Malihe", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.07567", "submitter": "Michael McCourt", "authors": "Kevin Tee, Michael McCourt, Ruben Martinez-Cantin, Ian Dewancker,\n  Frank Liu", "title": "Active Preference Learning for Personalized Portfolio Construction", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures, 1 algorithm, ICML Human in the Loop workshop", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In financial asset management, choosing a portfolio requires balancing\nreturns, risk, exposure, liquidity, volatility and other factors.
