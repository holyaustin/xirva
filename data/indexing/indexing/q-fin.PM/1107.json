In a Brownian\nsetting we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a\nsolution but show that uniqueness fails to hold in the sense that there exists\na continuum of distinct square-integrable solutions. This feature occurs since,\ncontrary to the classical Ito representation theorem, a representation of\nrandom variables in terms of stochastic exponentials is not unique. We study in\ndetail when the BSDE has a bounded solution and derive a new dynamic\nexponential moments condition which is shown to be the minimal sufficient\ncondition in a general filtration. The main results are complemented by several\ninteresting examples which illustrate their sharpness as well as important\nproperties of the utility maximization BSDE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jul 2011 10:22:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Feb 2012 20:18:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Frei", "Christoph", ""], ["Mocha", "Markus", ""], ["Westray", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.0190", "submitter": "Markus Mocha", "authors": "Markus Mocha and Nicholas Westray", "title": "The Stability of the Constrained Utility Maximization Problem - A BSDE\n  Approach", "comments": "30 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article studies the sensitivity of the power utility maximization\nproblem with respect to the investor's relative risk aversion, the statistical\nprobability measure, the investment constraints and the market price of risk.\nWe extend previous descriptions of the dual domain then exploit the link\nbetween the constrained utility maximization problem and continuous\nsemimartingale quadratic BSDEs to reduce questions on sensitivity to results on\nstability for such equations.
