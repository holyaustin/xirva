Arbitrage trades have been shown to align the prices reported by\nCFMMs with those of external markets. These trades impose costs on Liquidity\nProviders (LPs) who supply reserves to CFMMs. Trading fees have been proposed\nas a mechanism for compensating LPs for arbitrage losses. However, large fees\nreduce the accuracy of the prices reported by CFMMs and can cause reserves to\ndeviate from desirable asset compositions. CFMM designers are therefore faced\nwith the problem of how to optimally select fees to attract liquidity. We\ndevelop a framework for determining the value to LPs of supplying liquidity to\na CFMM with fees when the underlying process follows a general diffusion.\nFocusing on a popular class of CFMMs which we call Geometric Mean Market Makers\n(G3Ms), our approach also allows one to select optimal fees for maximizing LP\nvalue. We illustrate our methodology by showing that an LP with mean-variance\nutility will prefer a G3M over all alternative trading strategies as fees\napproach zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Apr 2021 13:03:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Alex", ""], ["Angeris", "Guillermo", ""], ["Chitra", "Tarun", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.00668", "submitter": "Jerome Garnier-Brun", "authors": "Jerome Garnier-Brun, Michael Benzaquen, Stefano Ciliberti,\n  Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "title": "A new spin on optimal portfolios and ecological equilibria", "comments": "37 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.PE q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the classical problem of optimal portfolio construction with the\nconstraint that no short position is allowed, or equivalently the valid\nequilibria of multispecies Lotka-Volterra equations with self-regulation in the\nspecial case where the interaction matrix is of unit rank, corresponding to\nspecies competing for a common resource.
