Instead, the stock price is prone\nto volatility due to rather random perception/interpretation of earnings\nannouncements (among other data) by market participants. We present empirical\nevidence indicating that dividend paying stocks on average are less volatile,\neven factoring out market cap. We further ponder possible ways of increasing\nmarket efficiency via 1) instituting such a mechanism, 2) a taxation scheme\nthat would depend on holding periods, and 3) a universal crossing\nengine/exchange for mutual and pension funds (and similar long holding horizon\nvehicles) with no dark pools, 100% transparency, and no advantage for timing\norders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 16:55:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kakushadze", "Zura", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.04764", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze", "title": "Shrinkage = Factor Model", "comments": "5 pages; a trivial typo corrected; to appear as an Invited Editorial\n  in Journal of Asset Management", "journal-ref": "Journal of Asset Management 17(2) (2016) 69-72, Invited Editorial", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Shrunk sample covariance matrix is a factor model of a special form combining\nsome (typically, style) risk factor(s) and principal components with a\n(block-)diagonal factor covariance matrix.
