We prove a separation principle for the associated robust\ncontrol problem, which allows to reduce the determination of the optimal\ndynamic strategy to the parametric computation of the minimal risk premium\nfunction.

In\nparticular, we show that an investor with a poor confidence in the expected\nreturn estimation does not hold any risky asset, and on the other hand, trades\nonly one risky asset when the level of ambiguity on correlation matrix is\nlarge.

Accurate tracking with a sparse portfolio\nis extensively studied as a classic finance problem. However in practice, a\ntracking portfolio must also be diverse in order to minimise risk -- a\nrequirement which has only been dealt with by ad-hoc methods before. We\nintroduce the first index tracking method that explicitly optimises both\ndiversity and sparsity in a single joint framework. Diversity is realised by a\nregulariser based on pairwise similarity of assets, and we demonstrate that\nlearning similarity from data can outperform some existing heuristics. Finally,\nwe show that the way we model diversity leads to an easy solution for sparsity,\nallowing both constraints to be optimised easily and efficiently. we run\nout-of-sample backtesting for a long interval of 15 years (2003 -- 2018), and\nthe results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Sep 2018 13:43:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Feb 2020 17:03:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Yu", ""], ["Hospedales", "Timothy M.", ""], ["Yang", "Yongxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.03641", "submitter": "Yu Feng Dr", "authors": "Yu Feng and Erik Schl\\\"ogl", "title": "Model Risk Measurement under Wasserstein Distance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "QFRC working paper 393", "categories": "q-fin.MF math.PR q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper proposes a new approach to model risk measurement based on the\nWasserstein distance between two probability measures.
