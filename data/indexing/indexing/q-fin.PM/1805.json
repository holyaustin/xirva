It avoids GLOS's complex CDF estimation process,hence resists the\n\"Butterfly Effect\" caused by estimation error. Besides,RLOS retains GLOS's\nprofitability and the optimization problem involved in RLOS is computationally\nfar more practical compared to GLOS. Further, we combine RLOS with\nReinforcement Learning (RL) and propose the so-called Robust Log-Optimal\nStrategy with Reinforcement Learning (RLOSRL), where the RL agent receives the\nanalyzed results from RLOS and observes the trading environment to make\ncomprehensive investment decisions. The RLOSRL's performance is compared to\nsome traditional strategies on several back tests, where we randomly choose a\nselection of constituent stocks of the CSI300 index as assets under management\nand the test results validate its profitability and stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2018 06:40:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Yifeng", ""], ["Fu", "Xingyu", ""], ["Shi", "Yuyan", ""], ["Liu", "Mingwen", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.05584", "submitter": "Michele Leonardo Bianchi", "authors": "Michele Leonardo Bianchi and Gian Luca Tassinari", "title": "Forward-looking portfolio selection with multivariate non-Gaussian\n  models and the Esscher transform", "comments": "29 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study we suggest a portfolio selection framework based on\noption-implied information and multivariate non-Gaussian models.

The agent acts in a stochastic market environment driven by various\nexogenous \"alpha\" signals, agent's own actions (via market impact), and noise.\nUnlike traditional agent-based models, our agent aggregates all traders in the\nmarket, rather than being a representative agent. Therefore, it can be\nidentified with a bounded-rational component of the market itself, providing a\nparticular implementation of an Invisible Hand market mechanism. In such\nsetting, market dynamics are modeled as a fictitious self-play of such\nbounded-rational market-agent in its adversarial stochastic environment. As\nrewards obtained by such self-playing market agent are not observed from market\ndata, we formulate and solve a simple model of such market dynamics based on a\nneuroscience-inspired Bounded Rational Information Theoretic Inverse\nReinforcement Learning (BRIT-IRL). This results in effective asset price\ndynamics with a non-linear mean reversion - which in our model is generated\ndynamically, rather than being postulated. We argue that our model can be used\nin a similar way to the Black-Litterman model. In particular, it represents, in\na simple modeling framework, market views of common predictive signals, market\nimpacts and implied optimal dynamic portfolio allocations, and can be used to\nassess values of private signals.

In a setting\nwith unhedgeable mortality risk and complete financial market, the optimal\nsolution is given explicitly for contracts with mortality risk using a\nmartingale approach for constrained non-concave optimization problems. We show\nthat regulatory VaR constraints for participating insurance contracts lead to\nmore prudent investment than in the case of no regulation. This result is\ncontrary to the situation where the insurer maximizes the utility of the total\nwealth of the company (without distinguishing between contributions of equity\nholders and policyholders), in which case a VaR constraint may induce the\ninsurer to take excessive risks leading to higher losses than in the case of no\nregulation. Compared to the unregulated problem, the VaR-constrained strategy\nleads to a higher expected utility for the policyholders, highlighting the\npotential usefulness of a VaR-regulation in the context of insurance. The\nprudent investment behavior is more significant if a VaR-type regulation is\nreplaced by a portfolio insurance (PI)-type regulation. Furthermore, a stricter\nregulation (a smaller allowed default probability in the VaR problem or a\nhigher minimum guarantee level in the PI problem) enhances the benefit of the\npolicyholder but deteriorates that of the insurer. For both types of\nregulation, the gains in terms of expected utility are greater for higher\nparticipation rates, while being smaller for higher bonus rates.

The stock price\nevolution is driven by the aggregated investment decision of all agents. In\nfact, we are faced with a differential game since all agents aim to invest\noptimal. Mathematically such a problem is ill posed and we introduce the\nconcept of Nash equilibrium solutions to ensure the existence of a solution.\nEspecially, we denote an agent who solves this Nash equilibrium exactly a\nrational agent. As next step we use model predictive control to approximate the\ncontrol problem. This enables us to derive a precise mathematical\ncharacterization of the degree of rationality of a financial agent.

In a second step we consider the case of a fully myopic agent, where\nwe can solve the optimal investment decision of investors analytically. We\nselect the running cost to be the expected missed revenue of an agent and we\nassume quadratic transaction costs. More precisely the expected revenues are\ndetermined by a combination of a fundamentalist or chartist strategy. Then we\nderive the mean field limit of the microscopic model in order to obtain a\nmacroscopic portfolio model. The novelty in comparison to existent\nmacroeconomic models in literature is that our model is derived from\nmicroeconomic dynamics.
