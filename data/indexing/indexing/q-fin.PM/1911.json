The viability of robo-advisors\ncrucially depends on their ability to offer personalized financial advice. We\nintroduce a novel framework, in which a robo-advisor interacts with a client to\nsolve an adaptive mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. The risk-return\ntradeoff adapts to the client's risk profile, which depends on idiosyncratic\ncharacteristics, market returns, and economic conditions. We show that the\noptimal investment strategy includes both myopic and intertemporal hedging\nterms which are impacted by the dynamics of the client's risk profile. We\ncharacterize the optimal portfolio personalization via a tradeoff faced by the\nrobo-advisor between receiving client information in a timely manner and\nmitigating behavioral biases in the risk profile communicated by the client. We\nargue that the optimal portfolio's Sharpe ratio and return distribution improve\nif the robo-advisor counters the client's tendency to reduce market exposure\nduring economic contractions when the market risk-return tradeoff is more\nfavorable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Nov 2019 18:25:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2020 09:08:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Olafsson", "Sveinn", ""], ["Zariphopoulou", "Thaleia", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.02067", "submitter": "Humoud Alsabah", "authors": "Humoud Alsabah, Agostino Capponi, Octavio Ruiz Lacedelli, and Matt\n  Stern", "title": "Robo-advising: Learning Investors' Risk Preferences via Portfolio\n  Choices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1093/jjfinec/nbz040", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a reinforcement learning framework for retail robo-advising.
