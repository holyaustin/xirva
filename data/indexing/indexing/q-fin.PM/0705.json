We obtain\ntwo such theorems by considering a financial market both with and without a\nriskless asset for random consumption. The striking result is that we obtain\ntwo-fund theorems despite the additional source of randomness from consumption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2007 01:21:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2007 04:22:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Mar 2008 21:14:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.1949", "submitter": "Chiu Fan Lee", "authors": "Siu Lung Law, Chiu Fan Lee, Sam Howison and Jeff N.
