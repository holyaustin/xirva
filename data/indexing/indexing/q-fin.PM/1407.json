Using the change of measure\ntechniques, the partial observation context can be transformed into a full\ninformation context such that coefficients depend only on past history of\nobserved prices (filters processes). Adapting the stochastic non-linear\nfiltering, we show that under some assumptions on the model coefficients, the\nestimation of the filters depend on a priorimodels for the trend and the\nstochastic volatility. Moreover, these filters satisfy a stochastic partial\ndifferential equations named \"Kushner-Stratonovich equations\". Using the\nmartingale duality approach in this partially observed incomplete model, we can\ncharacterize the value function and the optimal portfolio. The main result here\nis that the dual value function associated to the martingale approach can be\nexpressed, via the dynamic programmingapproach, in terms of the solution to a\nsemilinear partial differential equation. We illustrate our results with some\nexamples of stochastic volatility models popular in the financial literature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2014 06:50:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Jul 2015 07:52:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ibrahim", "Dalia", "", "MAS, FiQuant"], ["Abergel", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", "", "MAS, FiQuant"]]}, {"id": "1407.3154", "submitter": "Ljudmila  Bordag A.", "authors": "Ljudmila A.

The buyer proposes the price that can differ greatly from the paper\nvalue estimated by the seller, the seller, on the other hand, can not liquidate\nhis portfolio instantly and waits for a more favorable offer. To minimize\nlosses in this case we need to develop new methods. One of the steps moving the\ntheory towards practical needs is to take into account the time lag of the\nliquidation of an illiquid asset. This task became especially significant for\nthe practitioners in the time of the global financial crises. Working in the\nMerton's optimal consumption framework with continuous time we consider an\noptimization problem for a portfolio with an illiquid, a risky and a risk-free\nasset. While a standard Black-Scholes market describes the liquid part of the\ninvestment the illiquid asset is sold at a random moment with prescribed\nliquidation time distribution. In the moment of liquidation it generates\nadditional liquid wealth dependent on illiquid assets paper value. The investor\nhas the logarithmic utility function as a limit case of a HARA-type utility.\nDifferent distributions of the liquidation time of the illiquid asset are under\nconsideration - a classical exponential distribution and Weibull distribution\nthat is more practically relevant. Under certain conditions we show the\nexistence of the viscosity solution in both cases. Applying numerical methods\nwe compare classical Merton's strategies and the optimal consumption-allocation\nstrategies for portfolios with different liquidation-time distributions of an\nilliquid asset.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Jul 2014 13:37:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bordag", "Ljudmila A.", ""], ["Yamshchikov", "Ivan P.", ""], ["Zhelezov", "Dmitry", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.3372", "submitter": "Przemys{\\l}aw Rola", "authors": "Przemys{\\l}aw Rola", "title": "Arbitrage in markets with bid-ask spreads", "comments": "18 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper a finite discrete time market with an arbitrary state space and\nbid-ask spreads is considered.

We\nachieve this by using a \"trick\" of observing this problem in the context of\nmodel uncertainty via a two person zero sum stochastic differential game\nbetween the investor and an antagonistic market that provides a probability\nmeasure. We obtain some startling insights. Firstly, if short-selling is not\npermitted and if the factor process evolves under the minimal martingale\nmeasure then the investor's optimal strategy can only be to invest in the\nriskless asset (i.e. the no-regret strategy). Secondly, if the factor process\nand the stock price process have independent noise, then even if the market\nallows short selling, the optimal strategy for the investor must be the\nno-regret strategy while the factor process will evolve under the minimal\nmartingale measure .\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Jul 2014 16:58:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 21:48:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Deshpande", "Amogh", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.7717", "submitter": "Peter Bank", "authors": "Peter Bank and Helena Kauppila", "title": "Convex duality for stochastic singular control problems", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop a general theory of convex duality for certain singular control\nproblems, taking the abstract results by Kramkov and Schachermayer (1999) for\noptimal expected utility from nonnegative random variables to the level of\noptimal expected utility from increasing, adapted controls.
