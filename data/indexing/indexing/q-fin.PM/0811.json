The\ninvestor's preferences are represented by a multivariate utility function,\nallowing for simultaneous consumption of any prescribed selection of the\ncurrencies at a given terminal date. We prove the existence of an optimal\nportfolio process under the assumption of asymptotic satiability of the value\nfunction. Sufficient conditions for asymptotic satiability of the value\nfunction include reasonable asymptotic elasticity of the utility function, or a\ngrowth condition on its dual function. We show that the portfolio optimization\nproblem can be reformulated in terms of maximization of a terminal liquidation\nutility function, and that both problems have a common optimizer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Nov 2008 15:07:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2009 09:43:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Campi", "Luciano", ""], ["Owen", "Mark P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.4715", "submitter": "Thomas Lim", "authors": "Thomas Lim (PMA), Marie-Claire Quenez (PMA)", "title": "Utility maximization in incomplete markets with default", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We adress the maximization problem of expected utility from terminal wealth.\nThe special feature of this paper is that we consider a financial market where\nthe price process of risky assets can have a default time.
