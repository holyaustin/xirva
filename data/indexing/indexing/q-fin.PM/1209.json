Moreover, we include proportional\ntransaction costs to make the portfolio problem more realistic. We provide a\nVerification Theorem to compute the optimal growth rate as well as an optimal\ntrading strategy. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a constant boundary\nstrategy which is optimal. At the end, we compare our approach to other\ndiscrete-time growth rate maximization problems in numerical examples. It turns\nout that constant boundary strategies with a small average number of trades per\nunit perform nearly as good as the classical optimal solutions with infinite\nactivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Sep 2012 11:09:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Jun 2013 09:05:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Christensen", "S\u00f6ren", ""], ["Wittlinger", "Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.2555", "submitter": "Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "authors": "Jan Kallsen, Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "title": "Option Pricing and Hedging with Small Transaction Costs", "comments": "20 pages, to appear in \"Mathematical Finance\"", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PR math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An investor with constant absolute risk aversion trades a risky asset with\ngeneral It\\^o-dynamics, in the presence of small proportional transaction\ncosts.
