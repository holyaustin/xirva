This shows, on the one hand, that CPPI and DPPI are completely\nindependent of any choice of a particular model for the dynamics of asset\nprices. They even make sense beyond the class of semimartingale sample paths\nand can be successfully defined for models admitting arbitrage, including some\nmodels based on fractional Brownian motion.
