The utility for luxury goods is not necessarily a\nconcave function. The optimal heterogeneous consumption strategies for a class\nof non-homothetic utility maximizer are shown to consume only basic goods when\nthe wealth is small, to consume basic goods and make savings when the wealth is\nintermediate, and to consume small portion in basic goods and large portion in\nluxury goods when the wealth is large. The optimal retirement policy is shown\nto be both universal, in the sense that all individuals should retire at the\nsame level of marginal utility that is determined only by income, labor cost,\ndiscount factor as well as market parameters, and not universal, in the sense\nthat all individuals can achieve the same marginal utility with different\nutility and wealth. It is also shown that individuals prefer to retire as time\ngoes by if the marginal labor cost increases faster than that of income. The\nmain tools used in analysing the problem are from PDE and stochastic control\ntheory including viscosity solution, variational inequality and dual\ntransformation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Aug 2020 03:47:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Zuo Quan", ""], ["Zheng", "Harry", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.00863", "submitter": "Rui Zhou", "authors": "Rui Zhou, Daniel P.

However, the\nreal world distribution of assets return is usually asymmetric and\nheavy-tailed, which is far from being a Gaussian distribution. The asymmetry\nand the heavy-tailedness are characterized by the third and fourth central\nmoments, i.e., skewness and kurtosis, respectively. Higher skewness and lower\nkurtosis are preferred to reduce the probability of extreme losses. However,\nincorporating high-order moments in the portfolio design is very difficult due\nto their non-convexity and rapidly increasing computational cost with the\ndimension.

To avoid wash\nsales (in which some realized capital losses are disallowed), we assume that we\ntrade monthly, and cannot simultaneously buy and sell the same asset.\n  The tax-aware portfolio construction problem is not convex, but it becomes\nconvex when we specify, for each asset, whether we buy or sell it. It can be\nsolved using standard mixed-integer convex optimization methods at the cost of\nvery long solve times for some problem instances. We present a custom convex\nrelaxation of the problem that borrows curvature from the risk model. This\nrelaxation can provide a good approximation of the true tax liability, while\ngreatly enhancing computational tractability. This method requires the solution\nof only two convex optimization problems: the first determines whether we buy\nor sell each asset, and the second generates the final trade list. In our\nnumerical experiments, our method almost always solves the nonconvex problem to\noptimality, and when it does not, it produces a trade list very close to\noptimal.
