It shows how the FI\noptimizes its trading to account for market illiquidity using an extension of\nthe Almgren-Chriss market impact model of multiple risky assets. This expected\nutility optimization problem over the set of adapted strategies turns out to\nhave the same solutions as a mean-variance optimization over deterministic\ntrading strategies. That means the optimal adapted trading strategy is both\ndeterministic and time-consistent. It is also found to have an explicit closed\nform that clearly displays interesting properties. For example, the classic\nconstant Merton portfolio strategy, a particular solution of the frictionless\nlimit of the problem, behaves like an attractor in the space of more general\nsolutions. The main effect of temporary market impact is to slow down the speed\nof convergence to this constant Merton portfolio. The effect of permanent\nmarket impact is to incentivize the FI to buy additional risky assets near the\nend of the period. This property, that we name the Ponzi property, is related\nto the creation and bursting of bubbles in the market. The proposed model can\nbe used as a stylized dynamic model of a typical FI in the study of the asset\nfire sale channel relevant to understanding systemic risk and financial\nstability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 03:08:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hurd", "T.
