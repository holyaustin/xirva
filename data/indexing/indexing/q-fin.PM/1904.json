A fundamental challenge is how to reconcile the time-consistent\nnature of forward performance criteria with the time-inconsistency stemming\nfrom probability distortions. For this, we first propose two distinct\ndefinitions, one based on the preservation of performance value and the other\non the time-consistency of policies and, in turn, establish their equivalence.\nWe then fully characterize the viable class of probability distortion\nprocesses, providing a bifurcation-type result. Specifically, it is either the\ncase that the probability distortions are degenerate in the sense that the\ninvestor would never invest in the risky assets, or the marginal probability\ndistortion equals to a normalized power of the quantile function of the pricing\nkernel. We also characterize the optimal wealth process, whose structure\nmotivates the introduction of a new, distorted measure and a related market. We\nthen build a striking correspondence between the forward rank-dependent\ncriteria in the original market and forward criteria without probability\ndistortions in the auxiliary market. This connection also provides a direct\nconstruction method for forward rank-dependent criteria. A byproduct of our\nwork are some new results on the so-called dynamic utilities and on\ntime-inconsistent problems in the classical (backward) setting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 02:29:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["He", "Xue Dong", ""], ["Strub", "Moris S.", ""], ["Zariphopoulou", "Thaleia", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.04973", "submitter": "Yoshiharu Sato", "authors": "Yoshiharu Sato", "title": "Model-Free Reinforcement Learning for Financial Portfolios: A Brief\n  Survey", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial portfolio management is one of the problems that are most\nfrequently encountered in the investment industry. Nevertheless, it is not\nwidely recognized that both Kelly Criterion and Risk Parity collapse into Mean\nVariance under some conditions, which implies that a universal solution to the\nportfolio optimization problem could potentially exist. In fact, the process of\nsequential computation of optimal component weights that maximize the\nportfolio's expected return subject to a certain risk budget can be\nreformulated as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and hence as a\nstochastic optimal control, where the system being controlled is a portfolio\nconsisting of multiple investment components, and the control is its component\nweights. Consequently, the problem could be solved using model-free\nReinforcement Learning (RL) without knowing specific component dynamics. By\nexamining existing methods of both value-based and policy-based model-free RL\nfor the portfolio optimization problem, we identify some of the key unresolved\nquestions and difficulties facing today's portfolio managers of applying\nmodel-free RL to their investment portfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 01:48:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 May 2019 09:29:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Sato", "Yoshiharu", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.06628", "submitter": "Alex Garivaltis", "authors": "Alex Garivaltis", "title": "Nash Bargaining Over Margin Loans to Kelly Gamblers", "comments": "24 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Risks, 7(3), 93 (2019)", "doi": "10.13140/RG.2.2.29080.65286", "report-no": null, "categories": "econ.GN econ.TH q-fin.EC q-fin.GN q-fin.MF q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  I derive practical formulas for optimal arrangements between sophisticated\nstock market investors (namely, continuous-time Kelly gamblers or, more\ngenerally, CRRA investors) and the brokers who lend them cash for leveraged\nbets on a high Sharpe asset (i.e. the market portfolio).
