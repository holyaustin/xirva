Yet, the two-step procedure sometimes encounter the\n\"error maximization\" problem where inaccuracy in parameter estimation\ntranslates to unwise allocation decisions. In this paper, we combine the\nprediction and optimization tasks in a single feed-forward neural network and\nimplement an end-to-end approach, where we learn the portfolio allocation\ndirectly from the input features. Two end-to-end portfolio constructions are\nincluded: a model-free network and a model-based network. The model-free\napproach is seen as a black-box, whereas in the model-based approach, we learn\nthe optimal risk contribution on the assets and solve the allocation with an\nimplicit optimization layer embedded in the neural network.

However, it is difficult to compute optimal VaR\nportfolios; that is, an optimal risk-reward portfolio allocation using VaR as\nthe risk measure. This is due to VaR being non-convex and of combinatorial\nnature. In particular, it is well known that the VaR portfolio problem can be\nformulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that is difficult to solve\nwith current MILP solvers for medium to large-scale instances of the problem.\nHere, we present an algorithm to compute near-optimal VaR portfolios that takes\nadvantage of this MILP formulation and provides a guarantee of the solution's\nnear-optimality. As a byproduct, we obtain an algorithm to compute tight lower\nbounds on the VaR portfolio problem that outperform related algorithms proposed\nin the literature for this purpose. The near-optimality guarantee provided by\nthe proposed algorithm is obtained thanks to the relation between minimum risk\nportfolios satisfying a reward benchmark and the corresponding maximum reward\nportfolios satisfying a risk benchmark.
