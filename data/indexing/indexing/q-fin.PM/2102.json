In this paper, we propose MSPM, a modularized\nand scalable, multi-agent RL-based system for financial portfolio management.\nMSPM involves two asynchronously updated units: an Evolving Agent Module (EAM)\nand Strategic Agent Module (SAM). A self-sustained EAM produces\nsignal-comprised information for a specific asset using heterogeneous data\ninputs, and each EAM employs its reusability to have connections to multiple\nSAMs. An SAM is responsible for asset reallocation in a portfolio using\nprofound information from the connected EAMs. With the elaborate architecture\nand the multi-step condensation of volatile market information, MSPM aims to\nprovide a customizable, stable, and dedicated solution to portfolio management,\nunlike existing approaches. We also tackle the data-shortage issue of\nnewly-listed stocks by transfer learning, and validate the indispensability of\nEAM with four different portfolios. Experiments on 8-year U.S. stock market\ndata prove the effectiveness of MSPM in profit accumulation, by its\noutperformance over existing benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Feb 2021 04:04:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2021 16:19:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 11 Jun 2021 08:42:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Zhenhan", ""], ["Tanaka", "Fumihide", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.05398", "submitter": "Souhir Ben Amor", "authors": "Souhir Ben Amor, Michael Althof, Wolfgang Karl H\\\"ardle", "title": "FRM Financial Risk Meter for Emerging Markets", "comments": "47 pages, 35 figures, submitted in SoFie Conference", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The fast-growing Emerging Market (EM) economies and their improved\ntransparency and liquidity have attracted international investors. However, the\nexternal price shocks can result in a higher level of volatility as well as\ndomestic policy instability. Therefore, an efficient risk measure and hedging\nstrategies are needed to help investors protect their investments against this\nrisk. In this paper, a daily systemic risk measure, called FRM (Financial Risk\nMeter) is proposed. The FRM-EM is applied to capture systemic risk behavior\nembedded in the returns of the 25 largest EMs FIs, covering the BRIMST (Brazil,\nRussia, India, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey), and thereby reflects the\nfinancial linkages between these economies. Concerning the Macro factors, in\naddition to the Adrian and Brunnermeier (2016) Macro, we include the EM\nsovereign yield spread over respective US Treasuries and the above-mentioned\ncountries currencies. The results indicated that the FRM of EMs FIs reached its\nmaximum during the US financial crisis following by COVID 19 crisis and the\nMacro factors explain the BRIMST FIs with various degrees of sensibility. We\nthen study the relationship between those factors and the tail event network\nbehavior to build our policy recommendations to help the investors to choose\nthe suitable market for in-vestment and tail-event optimized portfolios. For\nthat purpose, an overlapping region between portfolio optimization strategies\nand FRM network centrality is developed. We propose a robust and\nwell-diversified tail-event and cluster risk-sensitive portfolio allocation\nmodel and compare it to more classical approaches\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Feb 2021 12:08:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Amor", "Souhir Ben", ""], ["Althof", "Michael", ""], ["H\u00e4rdle", "Wolfgang Karl", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.06233", "submitter": "Kumar Yashaswi", "authors": "Kumar Yashaswi", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization using Latent\n  Feature State Space (LFSS) Module", "comments": "14 Pages, 13 Figures, 3 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Dynamic Portfolio optimization is the process of distribution and rebalancing\nof a fund into different financial assets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies,\netc, in consecutive trading periods to maximize accumulated profits or minimize\nrisks over a time horizon. This field saw huge developments in recent years,\nbecause of the increased computational power and increased research in\nsequential decision making through control theory. Recently Reinforcement\nLearning(RL) has been an important tool in the development of sequential and\ndynamic portfolio optimization theory. In this paper, we design a Deep\nReinforcement Learning(DRL) framework as an autonomous portfolio optimization\nagent consisting of a Latent Feature State Space(LFSS) Module for filtering and\nfeature extraction of financial data which is used as a state space for deep RL\nmodel. We develop an extensive RL agent with high efficiency and performance\nadvantages over several benchmarks and model-free RL agents used in prior work.\nThe noisy and non-stationary behaviour of daily asset prices in the financial\nmarket is addressed through Kalman Filter. Autoencoders, ZoomSVD, and\nrestricted Boltzmann machines were the models used and compared in the module\nto extract relevant time series features as state space. We simulate weekly\ndata, with practical constraints and transaction costs, on a portfolio of S&P\n500 stocks. We introduce a new benchmark based on technical indicator Kd-Index\nand Mean-Variance Model as compared to equal weighted portfolio used in most of\nthe prior work. The study confirms that the proposed RL portfolio agent with\nstate space function in the form of LFSS module gives robust results with an\nattractive performance profile over baseline RL agents and given benchmarks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 19:33:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Yashaswi", "Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.09287", "submitter": "Andrew Butler", "authors": "Andrew Butler and Roy H.
