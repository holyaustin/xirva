This is a singular stochastic control problem,inherently in a finite\ntime horizon. With a series of transformations, the problem is turned into a\nso-called double obstacle problem, a well studied problem in physics and\npartial differential equation literature, featuring two time-varying free\nboundaries. The two boundaries, which define the buy, sell, and no-trade\nregions, are proved to be smooth in time. This in turn characterizes the\noptimal strategy, via a Skorokhod problem, as one that tries to keep a certain\nadjusted bond-stock position within the no-trade region. Several features of\nthe optimal strategy are revealed that are remarkably different from its\nno-transaction-cost counterpart. It is shown that there exists a critical\nlength in time, which is dependent on the stock excess return as well as the\ntransaction fees but independent of the investment target and the stock\nvolatility, so that an expected terminal return may not be achievable if the\nplanning horizon is shorter than that critical length (while in the absence of\ntransaction costs any expected return can be reached in an arbitrary period of\ntime). It is further demonstrated that anyone following the optimal strategy\nshould not buy the stock beyond the point when the time to maturity is shorter\nthan the aforementioned critical length. Moreover, the investor would be less\nlikely to buy the stock and more likely to sell the stock when the maturity\ndate is getting closer. These features, while consistent with the widely\naccepted investment wisdom, suggest that the planning horizon is an integral\npart of the investment opportunities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2009 16:43:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-10", "authors_parsed": [["Dai", "Min", ""], ["Xu", "Zuo Quan", ""], ["Zhou", "Xun Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.0999", "submitter": "Chun Hung Chiu", "authors": "Chun Hung Chiu and Xun Yu Zhou", "title": "The premium of dynamic trading", "comments": "24 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  It is well established that in a market with inclusion of a risk-free asset\nthe single-period mean-variance efficient frontier is a straight line tangent\nto the risky region, a fact that is the very foundation of the classical CAPM.\nIn this paper, it is shown that in a continuous-time market where the risky\nprices are described by Ito's processes and the investment opportunity set is\ndeterministic (albeit time-varying), any efficient portfolio must involve\nallocation to the risk-free asset at any time. As a result, the dynamic\nmean-variance efficient frontier, though still a straight line, is strictly\nabove the entire risky region. This in turn suggests a positive premium, in\nterms of the Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, arising from the dynamic\ntrading. Another implication is that the inclusion of a risk-free asset boosts\nthe Sharpe ratio of the efficient frontier, which again contrasts sharply with\nthe single-period case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Jun 2009 21:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-06-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chiu", "Chun Hung", ""], ["Zhou", "Xun Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.2271", "submitter": "Carl Lindberg", "authors": "Carl Lindberg", "title": "Portfolio optimization when expected stock returns are determined by\n  exposure to risk", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/08-BEJ163 the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)", "journal-ref": "Bernoulli 2009, Vol. 15, No. 2, 464-474", "doi": "10.3150/08-BEJ163", "report-no": "IMS-BEJ-BEJ163", "categories": "math.ST q-fin.PM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is widely recognized that when classical optimal strategies are applied\nwith parameters estimated from data, the resulting portfolio weights are\nremarkably volatile and unstable over time.

The results on the benchmark suggest\nthat a dynamic model of 13 lags is the optimal to forecast spot price direction\nfor the short-term. Further, the forecast accuracy of the direction of the\nmarket was 78%, 66%, and 53% for one, two, and three days in future\nconclusively. For all the experiments, that include futures data as an input,\nthe results show that on the short-term, futures prices do hold new information\non the spot price direction.
