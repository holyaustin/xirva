This\npaper generalizes the problems of minimizing the probability of lifetime ruin\nand minimizing expected lifetime occupation, with the poverty function serving\nas a bridge between the two. To illustrate our model, we compute the optimal\ninvestment strategies for a specific poverty function and two consumption\nfunctions, and we prove some interesting properties of those investment\nstrategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Sep 2015 11:35:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cohen", "Asaf", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.04135", "submitter": "Claudia Nunes cnunes", "authors": "Cl\\'audia Nunes and Rita Pimentel", "title": "Analytical solution to an investment problem under uncertainties with\n  shocks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive the optimal investment decision in a project where both demand and\ninvestment costs are stochastic processes, eventually subject to shocks.

Attention is paid to consequences of\nestimating auto-covariance matrices from small finite samples, and\nauto-covariance matrix cleaning strategies to mitigate against these are\ninvestigated.
