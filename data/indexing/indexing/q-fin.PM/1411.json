Such a relation and the Wiener Hopf factorization allow us to derive\nan integral equation for the optimal investment boundary. In case the\nunderlying L\\'evy process hits any real point with positive probability we show\nthat the integral equation for the investment boundary is uniquely satisfied by\nthe unique solution of another equation which is easier to handle.
