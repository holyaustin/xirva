The regret-based notion of a perfect stopping time is\nintroduced. A perfect stopping time is uniquely characterized by its optimality\nproperties and has the following form: one should sell the asset if its price\ndeviates from the running maximum by a certain time-dependent quantity. The\nrelated selling rule improves any earlier one and cannot be improved by further\ndelay. The results, which are applicable to a quite general price model, are\nillustrated by several examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Jan 2016 13:43:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 09:12:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Rokhlin", "Dmitry B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.00712", "submitter": "Robert Bassett", "authors": "Robert Bassett and Khoa Le", "title": "Multistage Portfolio Optimization: A Duality Result in Conic Market\n  Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove a general duality result for multi-stage portfolio optimization\nproblems in markets with proportional transaction costs.
