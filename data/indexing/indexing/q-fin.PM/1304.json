We abstract from utility, bequest and consumption preference\nissues by treating the VA as liquid and tradable. This allows us to use an\nAmerican option pricing framework to derive a so-called optimal initiation\nregion. Our main practical finding is that given current design parameters in\nwhich volatility (asset allocation) is restricted to less than 20%, while\nguaranteed payout rates (GPR) as well as bonus (roll-up) rates are less than\n5%, GLWBs that are in-the-money should be turned on by the late 50s and\ncertainly the early 60s. The exception to the rule is when a non-constant GPR\nis about to increase (soon) to a higher age band, in which case the optimal\npolicy is to wait until the new GPR is hit and then initiate immediately. Also,\nto offer a different perspective, we invert the model and solve for the bonus\n(roll-up) rate that is required to justify delaying initiation at any age. We\nfind that the required bonus is quite high and more than what is currently\npromised by existing products. Our methodology and results should be of\ninterest to researchers as well as to the individuals that collectively have\nover \\$1 USD trillion in aggregate invested in these products. We conclude by\nsuggesting that much of the non-initiation at older age is irrational (which\nobviously benefits the insurance industry.)\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Apr 2013 20:59:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "H.", ""], ["Milevsky", "M.

Academic research has argued that Optimism Bias and Black\nSwan Blindness cause forecasts to fall short of actual costs. Firstly, optimism\nbias has been linked to effects of deception and delusion, which is caused by\ntaking the inside-view and ignoring distributional information when making\ndecisions. Secondly, we argued before that Black Swan Blindness makes\ndecision-makers ignore outlying events even if decisions and judgements are\nbased on the outside view. Using a sample of 1,471 ICT projects with a total\nvalue of USD 241 billion - we answer the question: Can we show the different\neffects of Normal Performance, Delusion, and Deception? We calculated the\ncumulative distribution function (CDF) of (actual-forecast)/forecast. Our\nresults show that the CDF changes at two tipping points - the first one\ntransforms an exponential function into a Gaussian bell curve. The second\ntipping point transforms the bell curve into a power law distribution with the\npower of 2. We argue that these results show that project performance up to the\nfirst tipping point is politically motivated and project performance above the\nsecond tipping point indicates that project managers and decision-makers are\nfooled by random outliers, because they are blind to thick tails.
