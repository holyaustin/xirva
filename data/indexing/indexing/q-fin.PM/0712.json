For lognormally distributed asset returns, we derive\napproximate analytical results for the optimal investment fractions in various\nsettings. We show that when mean returns and volatilities of the assets are\nsmall and there is no risk-free asset, the Kelly-optimal portfolio lies on\nMarkowitz Efficient Frontier. Since in the investigated case the Kelly approach\nforbids short positions and borrowing, often only a small fraction of the\navailable assets is included in the Kelly-optimal portfolio. This phenomenon,\nthat we call condensation, is studied analytically in various model scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2007 16:53:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2008 12:01:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2009 15:10:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Laureti", "Paolo", ""], ["Medo", "Matus", ""], ["Zhang", "Yi-Cheng", ""]]}]
