We first\nderive the Markov property of a forward--backward system (FBSDE) if the\ngenerating martingale is a strong Markov process. Then we establish the\ndifferentiability of a FBSDE with respect to the initial value of its forward\ncomponent. This enables us to obtain the main result of this article, namely a\nrepresentation formula for the control component of its solution. The latter is\nrelevant in the context of securitization of random liabilities arising from\nexogenous risk, which are optimally hedged by investment in a given financial\nmarket with respect to exponential preferences. In a purely stochastic\nformulation, the control process of the backward component of the FBSDE steers\nthe system into the random liability and describes its optimal derivative hedge\nby investment in the capital market, the dynamics of which is given by the\nforward component.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2009 09:31:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Aug 2010 14:07:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 10:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Imkeller", "Peter", ""], ["R\u00e9veillac", "Anthony", ""], ["Richter", "Anja", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.1827", "submitter": "Ryan Woodard", "authors": "K.

In\nthis paper we propose one approach to optimal portfolio construction based on\nrecent results on stochastic reachability, which overcome some of the limits of\ncurrent approaches. Given a sequence of target sets that the investors would\nlike their portfolio to stay within, the optimal portfolio allocation is\nsynthesized in order to maximize the joint probability for the portfolio value\nto fulfill the target sets requirements. A case study in the US market is given\nwhich shows benefits from the proposed methodology in portfolio construction.
