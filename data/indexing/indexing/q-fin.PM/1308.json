The significant\nincrease in capital requirements renders it necessary for banks to take into\naccount the constraint of capital requirement when they make asset allocation\ndecisions. In this paper, we propose a new asset allocation model that\nincorporates the regulatory capital requirements under both the Basel 2.5\nAccord, which is currently in effect, and the Basel III Accord, which was\nrecently proposed and is currently under discussion. We propose an unified\nalgorithm based on the alternating direction augmented Lagrangian method to\nsolve the model; we also establish the first-order optimality of the limit\npoints of the sequence generated by the algorithm under some mild conditions.\nThe algorithm is simple and easy to implement; each step of the algorithm\nconsists of solving convex quadratic programming or one-dimensional\nsubproblems. Numerical experiments on simulated and real market data show that\nthe algorithm compares favorably with other existing methods, especially in\ncases in which the model is non-convex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 15:55:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wen", "Zaiwen", ""], ["Peng", "Xianhua", ""], ["Liu", "Xin", ""], ["Sun", "Xiaoling", ""], ["Bai", "Xiaodi", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2254", "submitter": "Sergey Nadtochiy", "authors": "Sergey Nadtochiy and Michael Tehranchi", "title": "Optimal investment for all time horizons and Martin boundary of\n  space-time diffusions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is concerned with the axiomatic foundation and explicit\nconstruction of a general class of optimality criteria that can be used for\ninvestment problems with multiple time horizons, or when the time horizon is\nnot known in advance.
