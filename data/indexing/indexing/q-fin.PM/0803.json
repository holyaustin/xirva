We introduce\ngeneralizations to the classic Kelly investment game [Kelly (1956)] that\nincorporates these features, and use them to investigate the influence of\ndiversification and limited information on Kelly-optimal portfolios. In\nparticular we present approximate formulas for optimizing diversified\nportfolios and exact results for optimal investment in unknown games where the\nonly available information is past outcomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Mar 2008 08:57:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jul 2008 10:04:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Medo", "Matus", ""], ["Pis'mak", "Yury M.", ""], ["Zhang", "Yi-Cheng", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3093", "submitter": "Constantinos Kardaras", "authors": "Robert Fernholz, Ioannis Karatzas, Constantinos Kardaras", "title": "Diversity and relative arbitrage in equity markets", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": "Finance & Stochastics.

In the context\nof the standard Ito-process model initiated by Samuelson (1965) we formulate\nthis property (and the allied, successively weaker notions of \"weak diversity\"\nand \"asymptotic weak diversity\") in precise terms. We show that diversity is\npossible to achieve, but delicate. Several illustrative examples are provided,\nwhich demonstrate that weakly-diverse financial markets contain relative\narbitrage opportunities: it is possible to outperform (or underperform) such\nmarkets over sufficiently long time-horizons, and to underperform them\nsignificantly over arbitrary time-horizons. The existence of such relative\narbitrage does not interfere with the development of option pricing, and has\ninteresting consequences for the pricing of long-term warrants and for put-call\nparity. Several open questions are suggested for further study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2008 22:53:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Fernholz", "Robert", ""], ["Karatzas", "Ioannis", ""], ["Kardaras", "Constantinos", ""]]}]
