One is the striking negative correlation between past\nrealized volatility and dividend yield. Second is the fact that ex-dividend\nreturns themselves are weakly dependent on the volatility level, leading to\nbetter risk-adjusted returns for low-vol stocks. This effect is further\namplified by compounding. We find that the low-vol strategy is not associated\nto short term reversals, nor does it qualify as a Risk-Premium strategy, since\nits overall skewness is slightly positive. For practical purposes, the strong\ndividend bias and the resulting correlation with other valuation metrics (such\nas Earnings to Price or Book to Price) does make the low-vol strategies to some\nextent redundant, at least for equities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 17:50:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Oct 2015 09:19:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ciliberti", "S.", ""], ["Lemp\u00e9ri\u00e8re", "Y.", ""], ["Beveratos", "A.", ""], ["Simon", "G.", ""], ["Laloux", "L.", ""], ["Potters", "M.", ""], ["Bouchaud", "J.
