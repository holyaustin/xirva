Three types of practical optimization problems faced by a company\nthat can control its liquid reserves by paying dividends and injecting capital.\nIn the first problem, we consider the classical dividend problem without\ncapital injections. The second problem aims at maximizing the expected\ndiscounted dividend payments minus the expected discounted costs of capital\ninjections over strategies with positive surplus at all times. The third\nproblem has the same objective as the second one, but without the constraints\non capital injections. Under the assumption of proportional transaction costs,\nwe identify the value function and the optimal strategies for any distribution\nof gains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2014 13:16:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yin", "Chuancun", ""], ["Yuen", "Kam Chuen", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.0665", "submitter": "Giorgio Ferrari", "authors": "Maria B.

We assume a general exponential L\\'evy process\nfor the commodity's spot price, rather than the commonly used geometric\nBrownian motion, and general convex holding costs.\n  We obtain necessary and sufficient first order conditions for optimality and\nwe provide the optimal procurement policy in terms of a \"base inventory\"\nprocess; that is, a minimal time-dependent desirable inventory level that the\nfirm's manager must reach at any time. In particular, in the case of linear\nholding costs and exponentially distributed demand, we are also able to obtain\nthe explicit analytic form of the optimal policy and a probabilistic\nrepresentation of the optimal revenue. The paper is completed by some computer\ndrawings of the optimal inventory when spot prices are given by a geometric\nBrownian motion and by an exponential jump-diffusion process.

When\nthe portfolio is built using noisy data, the expected value of the signal-noise\nratio is bounded from above via a Cramer-Rao bound, for the case of Gaussian\nreturns. The bound holds for `biased' estimators, thus there appears to be no\nbias-variance tradeoff for the problem of maximizing the signal-noise ratio. An\napproximate distribution of the signal-noise ratio for the Markowitz portfolio\nis given, and shown to be fairly accurate via Monte Carlo simulations, for\nGaussian returns as well as more exotic returns distributions. These findings\nimply that if the maximal population signal-noise ratio grows slower than the\nuniverse size to the 1/4 power, there may be no diversification benefit, rather\nexpected signal-noise ratio can decrease with additional assets. As a practical\nmatter, this may explain why the Markowitz portfolio is typically applied to\nsmall asset universes. Finally, the theorem is expanded to cover more general\nmodels of returns and trading schemes, including the conditional expectation\ncase where mean returns are linear in some observable features, subspace\nconstraints (i.e., dimensionality reduction), and hedging constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Sep 2014 03:42:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Pav", "Steven E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.7269", "submitter": "Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "authors": "Jan Kallsen, Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "title": "High-Resilience Limits of Block-Shaped Order Books", "comments": "12 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.TR math.OC math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that wealth processes in the block-shaped order book model of\nObizhaeva/Wang converge to their counterparts in the reduced-form model\nproposed by Almgren/Chriss, as the resilience of the order book tends to\ninfinity.
