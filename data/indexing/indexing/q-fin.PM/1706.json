More specifically, we are interested in the NIG\n(normal inverse Gaussian) the VG (variance gamma) models. The exponential Levy\nmodels produce incomplete markets. There are therefore an infinite number of\nequivalent martingale measures. We are interested in two methods of\nconstructing of the risk-neutral measures. The first is based on the Esscher\ntransform, and the other consists of bringing a risk-neutral correction on the\ndynamics of the trajectories. It turns out, according to the numerical results\nobtained, that the two methods generally produce the same prices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 23:35:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-07", "authors_parsed": [["Berdjane", "Belkacem", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.03139", "submitter": "Ruimeng Hu", "authors": "Jean-Pierre Fouque, Ruimeng Hu", "title": "Optimal Portfolio under Fast Mean-reverting Fractional Stochastic\n  Environment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Empirical studies indicate the existence of long range dependence in the\nvolatility of the underlying asset.

In\nthis paper, we analyze the nonlinear optimal portfolio allocation problem under\nthis model and in the regime where the fOU process is fast mean-reverting. We\nfirst consider the case of power utility, and rigorously give first order\napproximations of the value and the optimal strategy by a martingale distortion\ntransformation. We also establish the asymptotic optimality in all admissible\ncontrols of a zeroth order trading strategy. Then, we extend the discussions to\ngeneral utility functions using the epsilon-martingale decomposition technique,\nand we obtain similar asymptotic optimality results within a specific family of\nadmissible strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 22:14:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 9 Feb 2018 03:12:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Fouque", "Jean-Pierre", ""], ["Hu", "Ruimeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.06832", "submitter": "Renata Rendek", "authors": "Eckhard Platen and Renata Rendek", "title": "Market Efficiency and Growth Optimal Portfolio", "comments": "32 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper predicts an Efficient Market Property for the equity market, where\nstocks, when denominated in units of the growth optimal portfolio (GP), have\nzero instantaneous expected returns.

Then, when the underlying\nlog-price follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we deduce analytical\nexpressions for expected First-Exit-Times and we derive the long-run return of\nthe strategy as an elementary function of the stop-loss.\n  Following industry practice of pairs trading we consider an example of pair\nin the energy futures' market, reporting in detail the analysis for a spread on\nHeating-Oil and Gas-Oil futures in one year sample of half-an-hour market\nprices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 17:31:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Baviera", "Roberto", ""], ["Baldi", "Tommaso Santagostino", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.10059", "submitter": "Jinjun Liang", "authors": "Zhengyao Jiang, Dixing Xu, Jinjun Liang", "title": "A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for the Financial Portfolio\n  Management Problem", "comments": "30 pages, 5 figures, submitting to JMLR", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP cs.AI q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Financial portfolio management is the process of constant redistribution of a\nfund into different financial products.
