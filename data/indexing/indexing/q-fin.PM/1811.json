This indicator\nreflects the investment behavior of funds' managers as a function of the\npopularity of the assets they held. We show that $ACC$ provides useful\ninformation to discriminate between funds investing in niche markets and those\ninvesting in more popular assets. More importantly, we find that $ACC$ is able\nto provide indication on the performance of the funds. In particular, we find\nthat funds investing in less popular assets generally outperform those\ninvesting in more popular financial instruments, even when correcting for\nstandard factors. Moreover, funds with a low $ACC$ have been less affected by\nthe 2007-08 global financial crisis, likely because less exposed to fire sales\nspillovers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Nov 2018 11:43:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Flori", "Andrea", ""], ["Lillo", "Fabrizio", ""], ["Pammolli", "Fabio", ""], ["Spelta", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.02382", "submitter": "Hayette Gatfaoui", "authors": "Hayette Gatfaoui", "title": "Diversifying portfolios of U.S. stocks with crude oil and natural gas: A\n  regime-dependent optimization with several risk measures", "comments": "29 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables, Submitted on 23rd November 2016,\n  Second major revision of 6 August 2018 still under review", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several\ncommodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers.\nSuch competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as\nportfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and\nfluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty\nattracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First,\nenergy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy\nderivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and\ncommodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that\nreason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.)\nnatural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui's (2015) time varying\nmultivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach\nhandles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications\nfor portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios\nwith natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio's variance,\nsemi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on\nthe portfolio's expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return\nconstraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the\nregime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active\nmanagement strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint,\nthe semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff,\nwhereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence\nof a return constraint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Nov 2018 14:45:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gatfaoui", "Hayette", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.06893", "submitter": "Huyen Pham", "authors": "Carmine De Franco, Johann Nicolle (LPSM UMR 8001), Huy\\^en Pham (LPSM\n  UMR 8001, CREST)", "title": "Bayesian learning for the Markowitz portfolio selection problem", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC q-fin.CP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the Markowitz portfolio selection problem with unknown drift vector\nin the multidimensional framework.
