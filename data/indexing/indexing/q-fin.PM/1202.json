Within a\ncontinuous-time financial market framework and assuming that asset prices are\nmodelled by semimartingales, we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for\nthe well-posedness of the optimisation problem in the case of piecewise-power\nprobability distortion and utility functions. Finally, under straightforwardly\nverifiable conditions, we further demonstrate the existence of an optimal\nstrategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 08:42:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 10:27:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 27 Apr 2013 13:14:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rasonyi", "Miklos", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Andrea M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.2999", "submitter": "Daniel Fernholz", "authors": "Daniel Fernholz, Ioannis Karatzas", "title": "Optimal arbitrage under model uncertainty", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/10-AAP755 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Probability 2011, Vol. 21, No. 6, 2191-2225", "doi": "10.1214/10-AAP755", "report-no": "IMS-AAP-AAP755", "categories": "math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In an equity market model with \"Knightian\" uncertainty regarding the relative\nrisk and covariance structure of its assets, we characterize in several ways\nthe highest return relative to the market that can be achieved using\nnonanticipative investment rules over a given time horizon, and under any\nadmissible configuration of model parameters that might materialize. One\ncharacterization is in terms of the smallest positive supersolution to a fully\nnonlinear parabolic partial differential equation of the\nHamilton--Jacobi--Bellman type. Under appropriate conditions, this smallest\nsupersolution is the value function of an associated stochastic control\nproblem, namely, the maximal probability with which an auxiliary\nmultidimensional diffusion process, controlled in a manner which affects both\nits drift and covariance structures, stays in the interior of the positive\northant through the end of the time-horizon. This value function is also\ncharacterized in terms of a stochastic game, and can be used to generate an\ninvestment rule that realizes such best possible outperformance of the market.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 11:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-15", "authors_parsed": [["Fernholz", "Daniel", ""], ["Karatzas", "Ioannis", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6131", "submitter": "Halil Mete Soner", "authors": "H.
