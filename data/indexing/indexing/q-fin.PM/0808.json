Gaussian linear state-space processes have\nrecently been proposed as a model for such spreads under the assumption that\nthe observed process is a noisy realization of some hidden states. Real-time\nestimation of the unobserved spread process can reveal temporary market\ninefficiencies which can then be exploited to generate excess returns. Building\non previous work, we embrace the state-space framework for modeling spread\nprocesses and extend this methodology along three different directions. First,\nwe introduce time-dependency in the model parameters, which allows for quick\nadaptation to changes in the data generating process. Second, we provide an\non-line estimation algorithm that can be constantly run in real-time. Being\ncomputationally fast, the algorithm is particularly suitable for building\naggressive trading strategies based on high-frequency data and may be used as a\nmonitoring device for mean-reversion. Finally, our framework naturally provides\ninformative uncertainty measures of all the estimated parameters. Experimental\nresults based on Monte Carlo simulations and historical equity data are\ndiscussed, including a co-integration relationship involving two\nexchange-traded funds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 Aug 2008 18:57:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 8 Feb 2009 17:47:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2009 09:32:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Triantafyllopoulos", "Kostas", ""], ["Montana", "Giovanni", ""]]}]
