Rather than base the dual domain on (local)\nmartingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale deflators such that\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale for\nall admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the\nenlarged dual domain of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed,\nwithout invoking its closure. In this way we automatically reach the bipolar of\nthe set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving that the set of\nprocesses dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain,\nconfirming that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the\noptimal consumption and deflator, we characterise the optimal wealth process.\nAt the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale and a potential, while\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable\nmartingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in\nthe terminal wealth problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a\nuniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions involving equivalent\nlocal martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically\ndo not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR,\nwhich does not require their existence.
