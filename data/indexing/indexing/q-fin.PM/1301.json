It adheres to determining\nan optimal combination of weights associated with financial assets held in a\nportfolio. In practice, it faces challenges by virtue of varying math.\nformulations, parameters, business constraints and complex financial\ninstruments. Empirical nature of data is no longer one-sided; thereby\nreflecting upside and downside trends with repeated yet unidentifiable cyclic\nbehaviours potentially caused due to high frequency volatile movements in asset\ntrades. Portfolio optimization under such circumstances is theoretically and\ncomputationally challenging. This work presents a novel mechanism to reach an\noptimal solution by encoding a variety of optimal solutions in a solution bank\nto guide the search process for the global investment objective formulation. It\nconceptualizes the role of individual solver agents that contribute optimal\nsolutions to a bank of solutions, a super-agent solver that learns from the\nsolution bank, and, thus reflects a knowledge-based computationally guided\nagents approach to investigate, analyse and reach to optimal solution for\ninformed investment decisions.\n  Conceptual understanding of classes of solver agents that represent varying\nproblem formulations and, mathematically oriented deterministic solvers along\nwith stochastic-search driven evolutionary and swarm-intelligence based\ntechniques for optimal weights are discussed. Algorithmic implementation is\npresented by an enhanced neighbourhood generation mechanism in Simulated\nAnnealing algorithm.
