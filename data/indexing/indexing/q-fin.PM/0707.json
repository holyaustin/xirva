There are transaction costs with a\nstructure that covers, in particular, the case of fixed plus proportional\ncosts. We prove that there exists a self-financing trading strategy maximizing\nthe average growth rate of the portfolio wealth. We show that this strategy has\na Markovian form. Our result is obtained by large deviations estimates on\nempirical measures of the price process and by a generalization of the\nvanishing discount method to discontinuous transition operators.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 21 Jul 2007 09:25:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Palczewski", "Jan", ""], ["Stettner", "Lukasz", ""]]}]
