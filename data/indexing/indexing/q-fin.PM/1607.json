We\nalso compare them with their classical counterparts and derive a parity result.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 09:47:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 15:30:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 09:09:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Chong", "Wing Fung", ""], ["Hu", "Ying", ""], ["Liang", "Gechun", ""], ["Zariphopoulou", "Thaleia", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04153", "submitter": "Giorgio Ferrari", "authors": "Giorgio Ferrari", "title": "On the Optimal Management of Public Debt: a Singular Stochastic Control\n  Problem", "comments": "39 pages.

The government aims at choosing a\ndebt reduction policy which minimises the total expected cost of having debt,\nplus the total expected cost of interventions on the debt ratio. We model this\nproblem as a singular stochastic control problem over an infinite time-horizon.\nIn a general not necessarily Markovian framework, we first show by\nprobabilistic arguments that the optimal debt reduction policy can be expressed\nin terms of the optimal stopping rule of an auxiliary optimal stopping problem.\nWe then exploit such link to characterise the optimal control in a\ntwo-dimensional Markovian setting in which the state variables are the level of\nthe debt-to-GDP ratio and the current inflation rate of the country. The latter\nfollows uncontrolled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics and affects the growth rate of\nthe debt ratio. We show that it is optimal for the government to adopt a policy\nthat keeps the debt-to-GDP ratio under an inflation-dependent ceiling. This\ncurve is given in terms of the solution of a nonlinear integral equation\narising in the study of a fully two-dimensional optimal stopping problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 14:40:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 09:12:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Dec 2017 10:51:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrari", "Giorgio", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04883", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Willie Yu", "title": "Statistical Industry Classification", "comments": "44 pages; trivial misprints corrected", "journal-ref": "Journal of Risk & Control 3(1) (2016) 17-65, Invited Editorial", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.ST", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We give complete algorithms and source code for constructing (multilevel)\nstatistical industry classifications, including methods for fixing the number\nof clusters at each level (and the number of levels).
