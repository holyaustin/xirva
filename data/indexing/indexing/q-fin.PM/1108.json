We construct the unique trading\nstrategy with the highest expected return. This optimal strategy may be\nimplemented directly, or its expected return may be used as a benchmark to\nevaluate how far away from the optimal other proposed strategies for the given\nindicators are. Separately, we also construct the unique trading strategy with\nthe highest information ratio. In the normal case, when the traded security\nreturn is near zero, and for reasonable correlations, the performance\ndifferences are economically insignificant. However, when the correlation\napproaches one, the trading strategy with the highest expected return\napproaches its maximum information ratio of 1.32 while the trading strategy\nwith the highest information ratio goes to infinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 13:09:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Maymin", "Philip Z.", ""], ["Maymin", "Zakhar G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.0945", "submitter": "Constantinos Kardaras", "authors": "Constantinos Kardaras", "title": "On the closure in the Emery topology of semimartingale wealth-process\n  sets", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/12-AAP872 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Probability 2013, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1355-1376", "doi": "10.1214/12-AAP872", "report-no": "IMS-AAP-AAP872", "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A wealth-process set is abstractly defined to consist of nonnegative\nc\\`{a}dl\\`{a}g processes containing a strictly positive semimartingale and\nsatisfying an intuitive re-balancing property.
