In this paper we investigate the dynamic mean-LPM and\nmean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems in continuous-time, while the current\nliterature has only witnessed their static versions. Our contributions are\ntwo-fold, in both building up tractable formulations and deriving corresponding\nanalytical solutions.

The limit funding level not only enables us to solve both\ndynamic mean-LPM and mean-CVaR portfolio optimization problems, but also offers\na flexibility to tame the aggressiveness of the portfolio policies generated\nfrom such mean - downside risk models. More specifically, for a general market\nsetting, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the Lagrangian multiplies,\nwhich is a key step in applying the martingale approach, and establish a\ntheoretical foundation for developing efficient numerical solution approaches.\nMoreover, for situations where the opportunity set of the market setting is\ndeterministic, we derive analytical portfolio policies for both dynamic\nmean-LPM and mean-CVaR formulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Feb 2014 13:58:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gao", "Jianjun", ""], ["Zhou", "Ke", ""], ["Li", "Duan", ""], ["Cao", "Xiren", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.3560", "submitter": "Bin Zou", "authors": "Bin Zou and Abel Cadenillas", "title": "Optimal Investment and Risk Control Problem for an Insurer: Expected\n  Utility Maximization", "comments": "27 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the AIG bailout case in the financial crisis of 2007-2008, we\nconsider an insurer who wants to maximize the expected utility of the terminal\nwealth by selecting optimal investment and risk control strategies.
