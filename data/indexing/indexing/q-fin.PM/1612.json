The no-short selling constraint acts as\nan asymmetric $\\ell_1$ regularizer, setting some of the portfolio weights to\nzero and keeping the out of sample estimator for the variance bounded, avoiding\nthe divergence present in the non-regularized case. However, the\nsusceptibility, i.e. the sensitivity of the optimal portfolio weights to\nchanges in the returns, diverges at a critical value $r=2$. This means that a\nban on short positions does not prevent the phase transition in the\noptimization problem, it merely shifts the critical point from its\nnon-regularized value of $r=1$ to $2$. At $r=2$ the out of sample estimator for\nthe portfolio variance stays finite and the estimated in-sample variance\nvanishes. We have performed numerical simulations to support the analytic\nresults and found perfect agreement for $N/T<2$. Numerical experiments on\nfinite size samples of symmetrically distributed returns show that above this\ncritical point the probability of finding solutions with zero in-sample\nvariance increases rapidly with increasing $N$, becoming one in the large $N$\nlimit. However, these are not legitimate solutions of the optimization problem,\nas they are infinitely sensitive to any change in the input parameters, in\nparticular they will wildly fluctuate from sample to sample.
