We propose to add to the objective function a penalty proportional to\nthe sum of the absolute values of the portfolio weights. This penalty\nregularizes (stabilizes) the optimization problem, encourages sparse portfolios\n(i.e. portfolios with only few active positions), and allows to account for\ntransaction costs. Our approach recovers as special cases the\nno-short-positions portfolios, but does allow for short positions in limited\nnumber. We implement this methodology on two benchmark data sets constructed by\nFama and French. Using only a modest amount of training data, we construct\nportfolios whose out-of-sample performance, as measured by Sharpe ratio, is\nconsistently and significantly better than that of the naive evenly-weighted\nportfolio which constitutes, as shown in recent literature, a very tough\nbenchmark.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2007 22:59:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2008 23:57:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2008 09:08:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Brodie", "Joshua", ""], ["Daubechies", "Ingrid", ""], ["De Mol", "Christine", ""], ["Giannone", "Domenico", ""], ["Loris", "Ignace", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0588", "submitter": "Traian A.

This gives rise to time-inconsistency\nof the decision-maker. If the decision-maker at time t=0 can commit his/her\nsuccessors, he/she can choose the policy that is optimal from his/her point of\nview, and constrain the others to abide by it, although they do not see it as\noptimal for them. If there is no commitment mechanism, one must seek a\nsubgame-perfect equilibrium strategy between the successive decision-makers. In\nthe line of the earlier work by Ekeland and Lazrak we give a precise definition\nof equilibrium strategies in the context of the portfolio management problem,\nwith finite horizon, we characterize it by a system of partial differential\nequations, and we show existence in the case when the utility is CRRA and the\nterminal time T is small. We also investigate the infinite-horizon case and we\ngive two different explicit solutions in the case when the utility is CRRA (in\ncontrast with the case of exponential discount, where there is only one). Some\nof our results are proved under the assumption that the discount function h(t)\nis a linear combination of two exponentials, or is the product of an\nexponential by a linear function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2007 21:45:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ekeland", "Ivar", ""], ["Pirvu", "Traian A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1715", "submitter": "Ale\\v{s} \\v{C}ern\\'y", "authors": "Ale\\v{s} \\v{C}ern\\'y, Jan Kallsen", "title": "On the Structure of General Mean-Variance Hedging Strategies", "comments": "Published at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009117906000000872 in the\n  Annals of Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aop/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Probability 2007, Vol. 35, No. 4, 1479-1531", "doi": "10.1214/009117906000000872", "report-no": "IMS-AOP-AOP0215", "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a new characterization of mean-variance hedging strategies in a\ngeneral semimartingale market.
