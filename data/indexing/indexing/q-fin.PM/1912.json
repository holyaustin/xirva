This\neffect measures the loss in wealth of trading strategies due to renewing the\nportfolio constituent stocks. Theoretically, the leakage effect of a trading\nstrategy is expressed explicitly by a finite-variation term. The computation of\nthe leakage is different from what previous research has suggested. The method\nto estimate leakage in discrete time is then introduced with some practical\nconsiderations. An empirical example illustrates the leakage of the\ncorresponding trading strategies under different constituent list sizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Dec 2019 17:56:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Xie", "Kangjianan", ""]]}, {"id": "1912.04492", "submitter": "Zurab Kakushadze", "authors": "Zura Kakushadze and Juan Andr\\'es Serur", "title": "151 Estrategias de Trading (151 Trading Strategies)", "comments": "398 pages; in Spanish; complete English version is freely\n  downloadable from https://ssrn.com/abstract=3247865; English edition: Z.\n  Kakushadze and J.A.
