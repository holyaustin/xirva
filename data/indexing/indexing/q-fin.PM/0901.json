Based on the chosen\ntrading strategy they determine their prediction of the movement for the\nfollowing time period of a single asset. We find empirically using stocks from\nthe S&P500 that our prediction model yields a high success rate of over 51.5%\nand produces higher returns than a buy-and-hold strategy. Even when taking into\naccount trading costs we find that using the predictions will generate superior\ninvestment portfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2009 09:25:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Krause", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.2070", "submitter": "Jose Figueroa-Lopez", "authors": "Jose E.

One of the main features here is that the domain of the\ndual problem enjoys an explicit \"parametrization\", built on a multiplicative\noptional decomposition for nonnegative supermartingales due to F\\\"ollmer and\nKramkov (1997). As a key step in obtaining the representation result we prove a\nclosure property for integrals with respect to Poisson random measures, a\nresult of interest on its own that extends the analog property for integrals\nwith respect to a fixed semimartingale due to M\\'emin (1980).
