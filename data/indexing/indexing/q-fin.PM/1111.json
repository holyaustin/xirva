As ETFs are in nature similar to index\nmutual funds, in this paper we examined if this growing demand for ETFs can be\nexplained through their outperformance as compared to index mutual funds. We\nconsidered the population of all ETFs with inception dates prior to 2002 and\nthen for each ETF found all the passive index mutual funds that had the same\ninvestment style as the selected ETF and had inception date prior to 2002.\nWithin each investment style we matched every ETF with all the passive index\nfunds in that investment style and compared the performances of the matched\npairs in terms of Sharp Ratios and risk adjusted buy and hold total returns for\nthe period 2002-2010. We then applied the Wilcoxon signed rank test to examine\nif ETFs had better performances than index mutual funds during the sample\nperiod. Out of the 230 paired matches of all the styles, ETFs outperformed\nindex mutual funds in 134 of the times in terms of Sharpe Ratio, however, the\ntest of the hypothesis showed no statistically significant difference between\nETFs and index funds performances in terms of Sharpe ratio. Out of the 230\npaired matches of all the styles, ETFs outperformed index mutual funds in 125\nof the times in terms of risk adjusted buy and hold total return, however, the\ntest of hypothesis showed no statistically significant difference between ETFs\nand index funds performances in terms of risk adjusted buy and hold total\nreturn. These findings indicate there is statistically no significant\ndifference between ETFs and passive index mutual funds performances at the fund\nlevel and investors' choice between the two is related to product\ncharacteristics and tax advantages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Nov 2011 05:10:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sharifzadeh", "Mohammad", ""], ["Hojat", "Simin", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.0818", "submitter": "Hanqing Jin", "authors": "Ying Hu, Hanqing Jin and Xun Yu Zhou", "title": "Time-Inconsistent Stochastic Linear--Quadratic Control", "comments": "24 pages.

The time-inconsistency arises from the\npresence of a quadratic term of the expected state as well as a state-dependent\nterm in the objective functional. We define an equilibrium, instead of optimal,\nsolution within the class of open-loop controls, and derive a sufficient\ncondition for equilibrium controls via a flow of forward--backward stochastic\ndifferential equations. When the state is one dimensional and the coefficients\nin the problem are all deterministic, we find an explicit equilibrium control.\nAs an application, we then consider a mean-variance portfolio selection model\nin a complete financial market where the risk-free rate is a deterministic\nfunction of time but all the other market parameters are possibly stochastic\nprocesses. Applying the general sufficient condition, we obtain explicit\nequilibrium strategies when the risk premium is both deterministic and\nstochastic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Nov 2011 12:46:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Ying", ""], ["Jin", "Hanqing", ""], ["Zhou", "Xun Yu", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1113", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Bruneton", "authors": "Jean-Philippe Bruneton", "title": "Copula-based Hierarchical Aggregation of Correlated Risks.

We define rigorously this\nprocedure and then study extensively the Gaussian Tree of quite arbitrary size\nand shape, where individual risks are normal, and where the Gaussian copula is\nused. We derive exact analytical results for the diversification benefit of the\nGaussian tree as a function of its shape and of the dependency parameters.\n  Such a \"toy-model\" of an aggregation tree enables one to understand the basic\nphenomena's at play while aggregating risks in this way. In particular, it is\nshown that, for a fixed number of individual risks, \"thin\" trees diversify\nbetter than \"fat\" trees. Related to this, it is shown that hierarchical trees\nhave the natural tendency to lower the overall dependency with respect to the\ndependency parameter chosen at each step of the aggregation. We also show that\nthese results hold in more general cases outside the gaussian world, and apply\nnotably to more realistic portfolios (LogNormal trees). We believe that any\ninsurer or reinsurer using such a tool should be aware of these systematic\neffects, and that this awareness should strongly call for designing trees that\nadequately fit the business.\n  We finally address the issue of specifying the full joint distribution\nbetween the risks. We show that the hierarchical mechanism does not require nor\nspecify the joint distribution, but that the latter can be determined exactly\n(in the Gaussian case) by adding conditional independence hypotheses between\nthe risks and their sums.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Nov 2011 12:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Nov 2011 08:51:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Bruneton", "Jean-Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.1133", "submitter": "Xi Luo", "authors": "Xi Luo", "title": "Recovering Model Structures from Large Low Rank and Sparse Covariance\n  Matrix Estimation", "comments": "35 pages, 3 figures.

The nonparametric PBR method\npenalizes portfolios with large variability in mean and CVaR estimations. The\nparametric PBR method solves the empirical Markowitz problem instead of the\nempirical mean-CVaR problem, as the solutions of the Markowitz and mean-CVaR\nproblems are equivalent when the log-return distribution is elliptical. We\nderive the asymptotic behavior of the nonparametric PBR solution, which leads\nto insight into the effect of penalization, and justification of the parametric\nPBR method. We also show via simulations that the PBR methods produce efficient\nfrontiers that are, on average, closer to the population efficient frontier\nthan the empirical approach to the mean-CVaR problem, with less variability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 02:37:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 22:32:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Karoui", "Noureddine El", ""], ["Lim", "Andrew E.
