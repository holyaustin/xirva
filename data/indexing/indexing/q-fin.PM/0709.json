Unlike the conventional expected utility maximization model, such\na behavioral model could be easily mis-formulated (a.k.a. ill-posed) if its\ndifferent components do not coordinate well with each other. Certain classes of\nan ill-posed model are identified. A systematic approach, which is\nfundamentally different from the ones employed for the utility model, is\ndeveloped to solve a well-posed model, assuming a complete market and general\nIt\\^o processes for asset prices. The optimal terminal wealth positions,\nderived in fairly explicit forms, possess surprisingly simple structure\nreminiscent of a gambling policy betting on a good state of the world while\naccepting a fixed, known loss in case of a bad one. An example with a two-piece\nCRRA utility is presented to illustrate the general results obtained, and is\nsolved completely for all admissible parameters. The effect of the behavioral\ncriterion on the risky allocations is finally discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2007 13:55:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Jin", "Hanqing", ""], ["Zhou", "Xunyu", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3630", "submitter": "Frank Schweitzer", "authors": "Emeterio Navarro, Ruben Cantero, Joao Rodrigues, Frank Schweitzer", "title": "Investments in Random Environments", "comments": "19 pp., corrections and extensions to compare with other approaches", "journal-ref": "Physica A, vol. 387, no. 8-9 (2008), pp. 2035-2046", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2007.11.029", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present analytical investigations of a multiplicative stochastic process\nthat models a simple investor dynamics in a random environment. The dynamics of\nthe investor's budget, $x(t)$, depends on the stochasticity of the return on\ninvestment, $r(t)$, for which different model assumptions are discussed. The\nfat-tail distribution of the budget is investigated and compared with\ntheoretical predictions. Weare mainly interested in the most probable value\n$x_mp$ of the budget that reaches a constant value over time. Based on an\nanalytical investigation of the dynamics, we are able to predict $x_mp^stat$.\nWe find a scaling law that relates the most probable value to the\ncharacteristic parameters describing the stochastic process. Our analytical\nresults are confirmed by stochastic computer simulations that show a very good\nagreement with the predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Sep 2007 12:21:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Sep 2008 14:04:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Navarro", "Emeterio", ""], ["Cantero", "Ruben", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Joao", ""], ["Schweitzer", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.4358", "submitter": "Edward W.
