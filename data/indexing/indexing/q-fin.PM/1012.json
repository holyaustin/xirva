We walk the reader\nthrough the theory and we detail an extremely efficient algorithm to easily\nimplement this methodology under fully general assumptions. As it turns out, no\nrepricing is ever necessary, hence the methodology can be readily applied to\nbooks with complex derivatives. We also present an analytical solution, useful\nfor benchmarking, which per se generalizes notable previous results. Code\nillustrating this methodology in practice is available at\nhttp://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/21307\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 20:16:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Meucci", "Attilio", ""]]}]
