To do this, we apply an analytical approach of statistical mechanics.\nWe note that the optimization problem considered in this paper is the dual\nproblem of the portfolio optimization problem discussed in the literature, and\nwe verify that these optimal solutions are also dual. We also present numerical\nexperiments, in which we use the method of steepest descent that is based on\nLagrange's method of undetermined multipliers, and we compare the numerical\nresults to those obtained by replica analysis in order to assess the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 09:12:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Shinzato", "Takashi", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.05024", "submitter": "Nettey Boevi Gilles Koumou", "authors": "Gilles Boevi Koumou", "title": "Risk reduction and Diversification within Markowitz's Mean-Variance\n  Model: Theoretical Revisit", "comments": "16 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The conventional wisdom of mean-variance (MV) portfolio theory asserts that\nthe nature of the relationship between risk and diversification is a decreasing\nasymptotic function, with the asymptote approximating the level of portfolio\nsystematic risk or undiversifiable risk. This literature assumes that investors\nhold an equally-weighted or a MV portfolio and quantify portfolio\ndiversification using portfolio size. However, the equally-weighted portfolio\nand portfolio size are MV optimal if and only if asset returns distribution is\nexchangeable or investors have no useful information about asset expected\nreturn and risk. Moreover, the whole of literature, absolutely all of it,\nfocuses only on risky assets, ignoring the role of the risk free asset in the\nefficient diversification. Therefore, it becomes interesting and important to\nanswer this question: how valid is this conventional wisdom when investors have\nfull information about asset expected return and risk and asset returns\ndistribution is not exchangeable in both the case where the risk free rate is\navailable or not? Unfortunately, this question have never been addressed in the\ncurrent literature.
