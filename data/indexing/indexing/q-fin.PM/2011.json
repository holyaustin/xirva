The assumption made by these models is a sparsity of the\nprecision matrix. However, when stock returns are driven by common factors,\nsuch assumption does not hold. We address this limitation and develop a\nframework, Factor Graphical Lasso (FGL), which integrates graphical models with\nthe factor structure in the context of portfolio allocation by decomposing a\nprecision matrix into low-rank and sparse components. Our theoretical results\nand simulations show that FGL consistently estimates the portfolio weights and\nrisk exposure and also that FGL is robust to heavy-tailed distributions which\nmakes our method suitable for financial applications.
