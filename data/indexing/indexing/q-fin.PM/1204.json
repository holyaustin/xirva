Making use of the completeness of\nthe model without transaction costs, we reformulate and reduce the\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for this singular stochastic control problem\nto a non-standard free-boundary problem for a first-order ODE with an integral\nconstraint. Having shown that the free boundary problem has a smooth solution,\nwe use it to construct the solution of the original optimal\ninvestment/consumption problem in a self-contained manner and without any\nrecourse to the dynamic programming principle. Furthermore, we provide an\nexplicit characterization of model parameters for which the value function is\nfinite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2012 03:12:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jun 2012 19:32:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Choi", "Jin Hyuk", ""], ["Sirbu", "Mihai", ""], ["Zitkovic", "Gordan", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.0637", "submitter": "Masaaki Fukasawa", "authors": "Masaaki Fukasawa", "title": "Efficient Discretization of Stochastic Integrals", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-fin.CP q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Sharp asymptotic lower bounds of the expected quadratic variation of\ndiscretization error in stochastic integration are given. The theory relies on\ninequalities for the kurtosis and skewness of a general random variable which\nare themselves seemingly new. Asymptotically efficient schemes which attain the\nlower bounds are constructed explicitly. The result is directly applicable to\npractical hedging problem in mathematical finance; it gives an asymptotically\noptimal way to choose rebalancing dates and portofolios with respect to\ntransaction costs. The asymptotically efficient strategies in fact reflect the\nstructure of transaction costs. In particular a specific biased rebalancing\nscheme is shown to be superior to unbiased schemes if transaction costs follow\na convex model.
