We describe a framework for\nsingle-period optimization, where the trades in each period are found by\nsolving a convex optimization problem that trades off expected return, risk,\ntransaction cost and holding cost such as the borrowing cost for shorting\nassets. We then describe a multi-period version of the trading method, where\noptimization is used to plan a sequence of trades, with only the first one\nexecuted, using estimates of future quantities that are unknown when the trades\nare chosen. The single-period method traces back to Markowitz; the multi-period\nmethods trace back to model predictive control. Our contribution is to describe\nthe single-period and multi-period methods in one simple framework, giving a\nclear description of the development and the approximations made. In this paper\nwe do not address a critical component in a trading algorithm, the predictions\nor forecasts of future quantities. The methods we describe in this paper can be\nthought of as good ways to exploit predictions, no matter how they are made.
