We explore the idea of\napplying a smart strategy in reverse, yielding a \"bad beta\" portfolio which can\nbe shorted, thus allowing long and short positions on independent smart beta\nstrategies to generate beta neutral returns. In this article we detail the\nconstruction of a monthly reweighted portfolio involving two independent smart\nbeta strategies; the first component is a long-short beta-neutral strategy\nderived from running an adaptive boosting classifier on a suite of momentum\nindicators. The second component is a minimized volatility portfolio which\nexploits the observation that low-volatility stocks tend to yield higher\nrisk-adjusted returns than high-volatility stocks. Working off a market\nbenchmark Sharpe Ratio of 0.42, we find that the market neutral component\nachieves a ratio of 0.61, the low volatility approach achieves a ratio of 0.90,\nwhile the combined leveraged strategy achieves a ratio of 0.96.
