The\nconstruction of a Fund of Hedge Funds portfolio requires a correlation matrix\nwhich often has to be estimated using a relatively small sample of monthly\nreturns data which induces noise. In this paper random matrix theory (RMT) is\napplied to a cross-correlation matrix C, constructed using hedge fund returns\ndata. The analysis reveals a number of eigenvalues that deviate from the\nspectrum suggested by RMT. The components of the deviating eigenvectors are\nfound to correspond to distinct groups of strategies that are applied by hedge\nfund managers. The Inverse Participation ratio is used to quantify the number\nof components that participate in each eigenvector. Finally, the correlation\nmatrix is cleaned by separating the noisy part from the non-noisy part of C.\nThis technique is found to greatly reduce the difference between the predicted\nand realised risk of a portfolio, leading to an improved risk profile for a\nfund of hedge funds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 May 2010 10:20:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Conlon", "Thomas", ""], ["Ruskin", "Heather J.", ""], ["Crane", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.5082", "submitter": "Yu-Min Yen", "authors": "Yu-Min Yen", "title": "A Note on Sparse Minimum Variance Portfolios and Coordinate-Wise Descent\n  Algorithms", "comments": "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial sign\n  error in equation 1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.ST stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this short report, we discuss how coordinate-wise descent algorithms can\nbe used to solve minimum variance portfolio (MVP) problems in which the\nportfolio weights are constrained by $l_{q}$ norms, where $1\\leq q \\leq 2$.
