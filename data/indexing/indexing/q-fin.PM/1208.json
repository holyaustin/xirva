To\ncharacterize diversification potential, we provide estimates of integration,\nspatial correlation, and contagion among US metropolitan housing markets.\nResults reveal a high and increasing level of integration among US markets over\nthe decade of the 2000s, especially in California. We apply integration results\nto assess the risk of alternative housing investment portfolios. Portfolio\nsimulation indicates reduced diversification potential and increased risk in\nthe wake of estimated increases in metropolitan housing market integration.\nResearch findings provide new insights regarding the synchronous\nnon-performance of geographically-disparate MBS investments during the late\n2000s.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 21:42:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Cotter", "John", ""], ["Gabriel", "Stuart", ""], ["Roll", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0763", "submitter": "Dylan Possama\\\"i", "authors": "M.

This conclusion is valid both for a hedge fund\nmanager, who is paid performance fees with a high-water mark provision, and for\na mutual fund manager, who is paid management fees proportional to the fund's\nassets. The manager invests earned fees in the safe asset, allocating remaining\nprivate wealth in a constant-proportion portfolio, while the fund is managed as\nanother constant-proportion portfolio.
