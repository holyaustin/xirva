Turnover reduction can be modeled using the\ncorrelation structure of the alpha streams. As more and more alphas are added,\ngenerally turnover reduces. In this note we use a factor model approach to\naddress the question of whether the turnover goes to zero or a finite limit as\nthe number of alphas N goes to infinity. We argue that the limiting turnover\nvalue is determined by the number of alpha clusters F, not the number of alphas\nN. This limiting value behaves according to the \"power law\" ~ F^(-3/2). So, to\nachieve zero limiting turnover, the number of alpha clusters must go to\ninfinity along with the number of alphas. We further argue on general grounds\nthat, if the number of underlying tradable instruments is finite, then the\nturnover cannot go to zero, which implies that the number of alpha clusters\nalso appears to be finite.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 May 2014 02:33:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2014 14:56:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Aug 2014 23:49:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 17:49:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Kakushadze", "Zura", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.0437", "submitter": "Nestor Parolya Jun.-Prof. Dr.", "authors": "Taras Bodnar, Nestor Parolya and Wolfgang Schmid", "title": "Estimation of the Global Minimum Variance Portfolio in High Dimensions", "comments": "38 pages inc. 16 figures.
