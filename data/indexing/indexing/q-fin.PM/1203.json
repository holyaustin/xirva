The abstracted problem\ncorresponds to finding a probability measure that minimizes the relative\nentropy (also called $I$-divergence) with respect to a known measure while it\nsatisfies certain moment constraints on functions of underlying assets. In this\npaper, we show that under $I$-divergence, the optimal solution may not exist\nwhen the underlying assets have fat tailed distributions, ubiquitous in\nfinancial practice. We note that this drawback may be corrected if\n`polynomial-divergence' is used. This divergence can be seen to be equivalent\nto the well known (relative) Tsallis or (relative) Renyi entropy. We discuss\nexistence and uniqueness issues related to this new optimization problem as\nwell as the nature of the optimal solution under different objectives. We also\nidentify the optimal solution structure under $I$-divergence as well as\npolynomial-divergence when the associated constraints include those on marginal\ndistribution of functions of underlying assets. These results are applied to a\nsimple problem of model calibration to options prices as well as to portfolio\nmodeling in Markowitz framework, where we note that a reasonable view that a\nparticular portfolio of assets has heavy tailed losses may lead to fatter and\nmore reasonable tail distributions of all assets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Mar 2012 11:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Dey", "Santanu", ""], ["Juneja", "Sandeep", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.1399", "submitter": "Paolo Guasoni", "authors": "Paolo Guasoni, Scott Robertson", "title": "Portfolios and risk premia for the long run", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/11-AAP767 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Probability 2012, Vol. 22, No. 1, 239-284", "doi": "10.1214/11-AAP767", "report-no": "IMS-AAP-AAP767", "categories": "math.PR q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops a method to derive optimal portfolios and risk premia\nexplicitly in a general diffusion model for an investor with power utility and\na long horizon.
