The derivation allows for inference which is\nrobust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation of moments up to order four.\nAs a side effect, one can estimate the proportion of error in the Markowitz\nportfolio due to mis-estimation of the covariance matrix. A likelihood ratio\ntest is given which generalizes Dempster's Covariance Selection test to allow\ninference on linear combinations of the precision matrix and the Markowitz\nportfolio. Extensions of the main method to deal with hedged portfolios,\nconditional heteroskedasticity, conditional expectation, and constrained\nestimation are given. It is shown that the Hotelling-Lawley statistic\ngeneralizes the (squared) Sharpe ratio under the conditional expectation model.\nAsymptotic distributions of all four of the common `MGLH' statistics are found,\nassuming random covariates. Examples are given demonstrating the possible uses\nof these results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 19:26:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 20:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 14 Mar 2015 05:41:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 9 Feb 2018 06:53:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 22 Mar 2018 05:40:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sun, 16 Jun 2019 05:02:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 06:24:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Pav", "Steven E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.1578", "submitter": "Arthur M.

These sparse solutions reduce the complexity of\nportfolio implementation and management. Theoretical results are established to\nguarantee the sparsity of the second-order KKT points of the $\\ell_p$-norm\nregularized models.

Our\nanalysis of a combined model lead us to conclude that sparsity is not directly\nrelated to overfitting at all. Instead, we find that sparsity moderates\noverfitting only indirectly.
