FGPs have been formulated to yield a master equation - a description\nof their return relative to a passive (buy-and-hold) benchmark portfolio\nserving as the num\\'eraire. This description has proven to be analytically very\nuseful, as it is both pathwise and free of stochastic integrals. Here we\ngeneralize the class of FGPs in several ways: (1) the num\\'eraire may be any\nstrictly positive wealth process, not necessarily the market portfolio or even\na passive portfolio; (2) generating functions may be stochastically dynamic,\nadjusting to changing market conditions through an auxiliary continuous-path\nstochastic argument of finite variation. These generalizations do not forfeit\nthe important tractability properties of the associated master equation. We\nshow how these generalizations can be usefully applied to scenario analysis,\nstatistical arbitrage, portfolio risk immunization, and the theory of mirror\nportfolios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2012 11:17:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Oct 2013 13:39:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Strong", "Winslow", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.2129", "submitter": "Bin Li", "authors": "Bin Li and Steven C.
