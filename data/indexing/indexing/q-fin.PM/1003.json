First there is a\nso-called solvency region given by the minimum margin requirement in the\nproblem formulation. Then the associated utility maximization is formulated as\nan optimal switching problem. The diffusion turns out to be degenerate and the\nboundary of domain is an unbounded set. One no longer has the continuity of the\nvalue function without posing further conditions due to the degeneracy and the\ndependence of the random terminal time on the initial data. This paper provides\nsufficient conditions under which the continuity of the value function is\nobtained. The essence of our approach is to find a sequence of continuous\nfunctions locally uniformly converging to the desired value function. Thanks to\ncontinuity, the value function can be characterized by using the notion of\nviscosity solution of certain quasi-variational inequality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2010 14:43:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Qingshuo", ""], ["Yin", "G.", ""], ["Zhu", "Chao", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.3582", "submitter": "Marcel Nutz", "authors": "Marcel Nutz", "title": "Risk Aversion Asymptotics for Power Utility Maximization", "comments": "45 pages", "journal-ref": "Probability Theory and Related Fields, Vol. 152, No. 3-4, pp.\n  703-749, 2012", "doi": "10.1007/s00440-010-0334-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the economic problem of optimal consumption and investment with\npower utility.
