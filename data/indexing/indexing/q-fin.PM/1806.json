To this end, we construct 244\ntechnical and fundamental features to characterize each stock, and label stocks\naccording to their ranking with respect to the return-to-volatility ratio.\nAlgorithms ranging from traditional statistical learning methods to recently\npopular deep learning method, e.g. Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest\n(RF), Deep Neural Network (DNN), and the Stacking, are trained to solve the\nclassification task. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is also used to implement feature\nselection. The effectiveness of the stock selection strategy is validated in\nChinese stock market in both statistical and practical aspects, showing that:\n1) Stacking outperforms other models reaching an AUC score of 0.972; 2) Genetic\nAlgorithm picks a subset of 114 features and the prediction performances of all\nmodels remain almost unchanged after the selection procedure, which suggests\nsome features are indeed redundant; 3) LR and DNN are radical models; RF is\nrisk-neutral model; Stacking is somewhere between DNN and RF. 4) The portfolios\nconstructed by our models outperform market average in back tests.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 15:23:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Aug 2018 09:54:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "XingYu", ""], ["Du", "JinHong", ""], ["Guo", "YiFeng", ""], ["Liu", "MingWen", ""], ["Dong", "Tao", ""], ["Duan", "XiuWen", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.03294", "submitter": "Nils Bertschinger", "authors": "Rajbir-Singh Nirwan and Nils Bertschinger", "title": "Applications of Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models in Finance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Estimating covariances between financial assets plays an important role in\nrisk management.

We use a quantile-on-quantile regression approach to capture\nthe dependence structure between gold returns and changes in uncertainty under\ndifferent gold market conditions, while considering the nuances of uncertainty\nlevels. To capture the core uncertainty effects on gold returns, a dynamic\nfactor model is used. This technique allows summarizing the impact of six\ndifferent indexes (namely economic, macroeconomic, microeconomic, monetary\npolicy, financial and political uncertainties) within one aggregate measure of\nuncertainty. In doing so, we show that the gold's role as a hedge and safe\nhaven cannot be assumed to hold at all times. This ability seems to be\nsensitive to the gold's various market states (bearish, normal or bullish) and\nto whether the uncertainty is low, middle or high. Interestingly, we find a\npositive and strong relationship between gold returns and the uncertainty\ncomposite indicator when the uncertainty attains its highest level and under\nnormal gold market scenario. This suggests that holding a diversified portfolio\ncomposed of gold could help protecting against exposure to uncertain risks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2018 09:18:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Bouoiyour", "Jamal", "", "CATT"], ["Selmi", "Refk", "", "CATT"], ["Wohar", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.08005", "submitter": "Nestor Parolya Dr.", "authors": "Taras Bodnar, Dmytro Ivasiuk, Nestor Parolya and Wofgang Schmid", "title": "Mean-Variance Efficiency of Optimal Power and Logarithmic Utility\n  Portfolios", "comments": "31 pages, 4 figures, UPDATE: the log-normal approximation is now\n  appropriately motivated analytically", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We derive new results related to the portfolio choice problem for power and\nlogarithmic utilities.
