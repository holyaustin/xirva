The\nmarket coefficients are assumed to depend on the market regime in place, which\nis modeled by a finite state continuous time Markov process. We rigorously\ndeduce the dynamics of the defaultable bond price process in terms of a Markov\nmodulated stochastic differential equation. Then, by separating the utility\nmaximization problem into the pre-default and post-default scenarios, we deduce\ntwo coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the post and pre-default\noptimal value functions and show a novel verification theorem for their\nsolutions. We obtain explicit optimal investment strategies and value functions\nfor an investor with logarithmic utility. We finish with an economic analysis\nin the case of a market with two regimes and homogenous transition rates, and\nshow the impact of the default intensities and loss rates on the optimal\nstrategies and value functions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Apr 2011 03:05:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 14:53:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Capponi", "Agostino", ""], ["Figueroa-Lopez", "Jose E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1488", "submitter": "Nikolai Dokuchaev", "authors": "Nikolai Dokuchaev", "title": "The structure of optimal portfolio strategies for continuous time\n  markets", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cs.SY math.OC math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The paper studies problem of continuous time optimal portfolio selection for\na incom- plete market diffusion model.

We\npresent here a study of the Limited Asset Markowitz (LAM), of the Limited Asset\nMean Absolute Deviation (LAMAD) and of the Limited Asset Conditional\nValue-at-Risk (LACVaR) models, where the assets are limited with the\nintroduction of quantity and cardinality constraints. We propose a completely\nnew approach for solving the LAM model, based on reformulation as a Standard\nQuadratic Program and on some recent theoretical results. With this approach we\nobtain optimal solutions both for some well-known financial data sets used by\nseveral other authors, and for some unsolved large size portfolio problems. We\nalso test our method on five new data sets involving real-world capital market\nindices from major stock markets. Our computational experience shows that,\nrather unexpectedly, it is easier to solve the quadratic LAM model with our\nalgorithm, than to solve the linear LACVaR and LAMAD models with CPLEX, one of\nthe best commercial codes for mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problems.\nFinally, on the new data sets we have also compared, using out-of-sample\nanalysis, the performance of the portfolios obtained by the Limited Asset\nmodels with the performance provided by the unconstrained models and with that\nof the official capital market indices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 May 2011 11:32:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Cesarone", "Francesco", ""], ["Scozzari", "Andrea", ""], ["Tardella", "Fabio", ""]]}]
