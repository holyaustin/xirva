All results are derived under weak conditions on the asset\nreturns. No assumption on the correlation structure between different time\npoints is needed and no assumption on the distribution is imposed. All\nexpressions are presented in terms of the conditional mean vectors and the\nconditional covariance matrices. If the multivariate process of the asset\nreturns is independent it is shown that in the case without a riskless asset\nthe solution is presented as a sequence of optimal portfolio weights obtained\nby solving the single-period Markowitz optimization problem. The process\ndynamics are included only in the shape parameter of the utility function. If a\nriskless asset is present then the multi-period optimal portfolio weights are\nproportional to the single-period solutions multiplied by time-varying\nconstants which are depending on the process dynamics. Remarkably, in the case\nof a portfolio selection with the tangency portfolio the multi-period solution\ncoincides with the sequence of the simple-period solutions. Finally, we compare\nthe suggested strategies with existing multi-period portfolio allocation\nmethods for real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 14:51:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 16:28:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Bodnar", "Taras", ""], ["Parolya", "Nestor", ""], ["Schmid", "Wolfgang", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.1029", "submitter": "Nestor Parolya", "authors": "Taras Bodnar, Nestor Parolya and Wolfgang Schmid", "title": "On the Equivalence of Quadratic Optimization Problems Commonly Used in\n  Portfolio Theory", "comments": "Revised preprint.

The conditions for the mean-variance efficiency\nof the solutions depend on the unknown parameters of the asset returns.

Because these\nprobabilities deviate from one the above mentioned quadratic optimization\nproblems are not stochastically equivalent.
