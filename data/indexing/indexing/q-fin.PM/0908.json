However, the complex web of market interactions often\nimpedes rational decisions that would absolutely minimize the risk. Here we\nshow that, for any given expected return, investors can overcome this\ncomplexity and globally minimize their financial risk in portfolio selection\nmodels, which is mathematically equivalent to computing the ground state of\nspin glass models in physics, provided the margin requirement remains below a\ncritical, empirically measurable value. For markets with centrally regulated\nmargin requirements, this result suggests a potentially stabilizing\nintervention strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2009 15:21:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Lisewski", "Andreas Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1014", "submitter": "Goran Peskir", "authors": "Jacques du Toit, Goran Peskir", "title": "Selling a stock at the ultimate maximum", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AAP566 the Annals of\n  Applied Probability (http://www.imstat.org/aap/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Probability 2009, Vol. 19, No. 3, 983-1014", "doi": "10.1214/08-AAP566", "report-no": "IMS-AAP-AAP566", "categories": "q-fin.PM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Assuming that the stock price $Z=(Z_t)_{0\\leq t\\leq T}$ follows a geometric\nBrownian motion with drift $\\mu\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and volatility $\\sigma>0$, and\nletting $M_t=\\max_{0\\leq s\\leq t}Z_s$ for $t\\in[0,T]$, we consider the optimal\nprediction problems \\[V_1=\\inf_{0\\leq\\tau\\leq\nT}\\mathsf{E}\\biggl(\\frac{M_T}{Z_{\\tau}}\\biggr)\\quadand\\quad\nV_2=\\sup_{0\\leq\\tau\\leq T}\\mathsf{E}\\biggl(\\frac{Z_{\\tau}}{M_T}\\biggr),\\] where\nthe infimum and supremum are taken over all stopping times $\\tau$ of $Z$.

The reserve process of the insurance company is described by a\nstochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian motion and a Poisson\nrandom measure, representing the randomness from the financial market and the\ninsurance claims, respectively. The random safety loading and stochastic\ninterest rates are allowed in the model so that the reserve process is\nnon-Markovian in general. The insurance company can manage the reserves through\nboth portfolios of the investment and a reinsurance policy to optimize a\ncertain utility function, defined in a generic way. The main feature of the\nproblem lies in the intrinsic constraint on the part of reinsurance policy,\nwhich is only proportional to the claim-size instead of the current level of\nreserve, and hence it is quite different from the optimal\ninvestment/consumption problem with constraints in finance. Necessary and\nsufficient conditions for both well posedness and solvability will be given by\nmodifying the ``duality method'' in finance and with the help of the\nsolvability of a special type of backward stochastic differential equations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2009 13:38:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Yuping", ""], ["Ma", "Jin", ""]]}]
