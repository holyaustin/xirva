Our aim is to study the dependence between her risk aversion\nand the distribution of the optimal terminal payoff.\n  Economic intuition suggests that high risk aversion leads to a rather\nconcentrated distribution, whereas lower risk aversion results in a higher\naverage payoff at the expense of a more widespread distribution.\n  Dybvig and Wang [J. Econ. Theory, 2011, to appear] find that this idea can\nindeed be turned into a rigorous mathematical statement in one-period models.\nMore specifically, they show that lower risk aversion leads to a payoff which\nis larger in terms of second order stochastic dominance.\n  In the present study, we extend their results to (weakly) complete\ncontinuous-time models. We also complement an ad-hoc counterexample of Dybvig\nand Wang, by showing that these results are \"fragile\", in the sense that they\nfail in essentially any model, if the latter is perturbed on a set of\narbitrarily small probability. On the other hand, we establish that they hold\nfor power investors in models with (conditionally) independent increments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Apr 2011 08:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Sep 2011 11:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Beiglboeck", "Mathias", ""], ["Muhle-Karbe", "Johannes", ""], ["Temme", "Johannes", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.2124", "submitter": "Michel Fliess", "authors": "Michel Fliess (LIX), C\\'edric Join (CRAN, INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France), Fr\\'ed\\'eric Hatt", "title": "Is a probabilistic modeling really useful in financial engineering? -\n  A-t-on vraiment besoin d'un mod\\`ele probabiliste en ing\\'enierie\n  financi\\`ere ?", "comments": "Conf\\'erence M\\'editerran\\'eenne sur l'Ing\\'enierie S\\^ure des\n  Syst\\`emes Complexes, MISC 2011, Agadir : Maroc (2011)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP cs.CE q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new standpoint on financial time series, without the use of any\nmathematical model and of probabilistic tools, yields not only a rigorous\napproach of trends and volatility, but also efficient calculations which were\nalready successfully applied in automatic control and in signal processing.
