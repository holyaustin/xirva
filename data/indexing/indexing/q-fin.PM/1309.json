We deal with an\ninvestor who behaves consistently with principles of Cumulative Prospect\nTheory, and whose utility function on gains is bounded above. The\nwell-posedness of the optimisation problem is trivial, and a necessary\ncondition for the existence of an optimal trading strategy is derived. This\ncondition requires that the investor's probability distortion function on\nlosses does not tend to 0 near 0 faster than a given rate, which is determined\nby the utility function. Under additional assumptions, we show that this\ncondition is indeed the borderline for attainability, in the sense that for\nslower convergence of the distortion function there does exist an optimal\nportfolio.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 10:59:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 11:48:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["R\u00e1sonyi", "Mikl\u00f3s", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Andrea Meireles", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.0474", "submitter": "Paulwin Graewe", "authors": "Paulwin Graewe, Ulrich Horst, Eric S\\'er\\'e", "title": "Smooth solutions to portfolio liquidation problems under price-sensitive\n  market impact", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.spa.2017.06.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the stochastic control problem of a financial trader that needs\nto unwind a large asset portfolio within a short period of time.
