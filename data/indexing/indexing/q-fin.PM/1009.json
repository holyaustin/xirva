For instance, financial leverage can be\nregarded as an object of choice or a decision. We show how the optics of\ndecision theory allows perceiving the recently introduced metrics of\nsee-through-leverage, which proved to be very useful in understanding the\nphenomenology of the recent economic crisis. The importance for practical\ndecision making of specification of the statistical regularity of the random\nphenomena at hand as well as of the rationality class of the decision maker is\ndiscussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Sep 2010 10:44:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 8 Oct 2010 16:26:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 May 2012 09:21:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 13:26:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ivanenko", "Yaroslav", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3638", "submitter": "Richard Warnung", "authors": "Nikolaus Rab and Richard Warnung", "title": "Scaling portfolio volatility and calculating risk contributions in the\n  presence of serial cross-correlations", "comments": "26 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.RM q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In practice daily volatility of portfolio returns is transformed to longer\nholding periods by multiplying by the square-root of time which assumes that\nreturns are not serially correlated. Under this assumption this procedure of\nscaling can also be applied to contributions to volatility of the assets in the\nportfolio. Close prices are often used to calculate the profit and loss of a\nportfolio. Trading at exchanges located in distant time zones this can lead to\nsignificant serial cross-correlations of the closing-time returns of the assets\nin the portfolio. These serial correlations cause the square-root-of-time rule\nto fail. Moreover volatility contributions in this setting turn out to be\nmisleading due to non-synchronous correlations. We address this issue and\nprovide alternative procedures for scaling volatility and calculating risk\ncontributions for arbitrary holding periods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 19 Sep 2010 13:32:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2011 21:17:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2011 10:45:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Rab", "Nikolaus", ""], ["Warnung", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.3753", "submitter": "Matus Medo", "authors": "Yu Feng, Matus Medo, Liang Zhang, Yi-Cheng Zhang", "title": "Transaction fees and optimal rebalancing in the growth-optimal portfolio", "comments": "17 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Physica A 390, 1635-1645 (2011)", "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2010.12.031", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The growth-optimal portfolio optimization strategy pioneered by Kelly is\nbased on constant portfolio rebalancing which makes it sensitive to transaction\nfees. We examine the effect of fees on an example of a risky asset with a\nbinary return distribution and show that the fees may give rise to an optimal\nperiod of portfolio rebalancing. The optimal period is found analytically in\nthe case of lognormal returns. This result is consequently generalized and\nnumerically verified for broad return distributions and returns generated by a\nGARCH process.
