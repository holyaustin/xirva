When volatility is constant, the transaction costs optimal\ninvestment problem has a long history, especially in the use of asymptotic\napproximations when the cost is small. Under stochastic volatility, but with no\ntransaction costs, the Merton problem under general utility functions can also\nbe analyzed with asymptotic methods. Here, we look at the long-run growth rate\nproblem when both complexities are present, using separation of time scales\napproximations. This leads to perturbation analysis of an eigenvalue problem.\nWe find the first term in the asymptotic expansion in the time scale parameter,\nof the optimal long-term growth rate, and of the optimal strategy, for fixed\nsmall transaction costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 23:15:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Aug 2014 19:12:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bichuch", "Maxim", ""], ["Sircar", "Ronnie", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.1639", "submitter": "Frank Riedel", "authors": "Qian Lin and Frank Riedel", "title": "Optimal consumption and portfolio choice with ambiguity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider optimal consumption and portfolio choice in the presence of\nKnightian uncertainty in continuous-time.

In addition to the\nmarket risk, fund and insurance managers have to be prepared for sudden and\npossibly contagious changes in the investment flows from their clients so that\nthey can avoid the over- as well as under-hedging. In this work, the prices of\nsecurities, the occurrences of insured events and (possibly a network of) the\ninvestment flows are used to infer their drifts and intensities by a stochastic\nfiltering technique. We utilize the inferred information to provide the optimal\nhedging strategy based on the mean-variance (or quadratic) risk criterion. A\nBSDE approach allows a systematic derivation of the optimal strategy, which is\nshown to be implementable by a set of simple ODEs and the standard Monte Carlo\nsimulation. The presented framework may also be useful for manufactures and\nenergy firms to install an efficient overlay of dynamic hedging by financial\nderivatives to minimize the costs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 12:47:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Jul 2014 05:38:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fujii", "Masaaki", ""], ["Takahashi", "Akihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.2531", "submitter": "Weiyin Fei", "authors": "Weiyin Fei", "title": "Optimal control of uncertain stochastic systems with Markovian switching\n  and its applications to portfolio decisions", "comments": "21 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Cybernetics and Systems: An International Journal, Volume 45,\n  Issue 1, 2014", "doi": "10.1080/01969722.2014.862445", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper first describes a class of uncertain stochastic control systems\nwith Markovian switching, and derives an It\\^o-Liu formula for Markov-modulated\nprocesses.
