However, risk-based investors should be aware of four things.\nFirst, theoretical considerations and empirical studies show that apparently\ndictinct risk-based investment strategies are manifestations of a single\neffect. Second, turnover and associated transaction costs can be a substantial\ndrag on return. Third, capital diversification benefits may be reduced. Fourth,\nthere is an apparent connection between performance and risk diversification.\nTo analyze risk diversification benefits in a consistent way, we introduce the\nRisk Diversification Index (RDI) which measures risk concentrations and\ncomplements the Herfindahl-Herschman Index (HHI) for capital concentrations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Jun 2013 15:21:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2013 16:44:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Goldberg", "Lisa R.", ""], ["Mahmoud", "Ola", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.0450", "submitter": "Mircea Andrecut Dr", "authors": "M.

While this design appealed to the gambling\ninstinct, it is a suboptimal way to manage longevity risk during retirement.\nThis is why fair life annuities making constant payments -- where the insurance\ncompany is exposed to the longevity risk -- induces greater lifetime utility.\nHowever, tontines do not have to be designed using a winner-take-all approach\nand insurance companies do not actually sell fair life annuities, partially due\nto aggregate longevity risk.\n  In this paper we derive the tontine structure that maximizes lifetime\nutility, but doesn't expose the sponsor to any longevity risk. We examine its\nsensitivity to the size of the tontine pool; individual longevity risk\naversion; and subjective health status. The optimal tontine varies with the\nindividual's longevity risk aversion $\\gamma$ and the number of participants\n$n$, which is problematic for product design. That said, we introduce a\nstructure called a natural tontine whose payout declines in exact proportion to\nthe (expected) survival probabilities, which is near-optimal for all $\\gamma$\nand $n$. We compare the utility of optimal tontines to the utility of loaded\nlife annuities under reasonable demographic and economic conditions and find\nthat the life annuity's advantage over tontines, is minimal.\n  We also review and analyze the first-ever mortality-derivative issued by the\nBritish government, known as King Williams's tontine of 1693. We shed light on\nthe preferences and beliefs of those who invested in the tontines vs. the\nannuities and argue that tontines should be re-introduced and allowed to\nco-exist with life annuities. Individuals would likely select a portfolio of\ntontines and annuities that suit their personal preferences for consumption and\nlongevity risk, as they did over 320 years ago.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2013 15:20:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Milevsky", "Moshe A.", ""], ["Salisbury", "Thomas S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.2849", "submitter": "Giorgio Ferrari", "authors": "Giorgio Ferrari, Frank Riedel, Jan-Henrik Steg", "title": "Continuous-Time Public Good Contribution under Uncertainty: A Stochastic\n  Control Approach", "comments": "38 pages.
