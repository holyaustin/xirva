Under his framework, the theoretical optimal allocation\nvector can be very different from the estimated one for large portfolios due to\nthe intrinsic difficulty of estimating a vast covariance matrix and return\nvector. This can result in adverse performance in portfolio selected based on\nempirical data due to the accumulation of estimation errors. We address this\nproblem by introducing the gross-exposure constrained mean-variance portfolio\nselection. We show that with gross-exposure constraint the theoretical optimal\nportfolios have similar performance to the empirically selected ones based on\nestimated covariance matrices and there is no error accumulation effect from\nestimation of vast covariance matrices. This gives theoretical justification to\nthe empirical results in Jagannathan and Ma (2003). We also show that the\nno-short-sale portfolio is not diversified enough and can be improved by\nallowing some short positions. As the constraint on short sales relaxes, the\nnumber of selected assets varies from a small number to the total number of\nstocks, when tracking portfolios or selecting assets. This achieves the optimal\nsparse portfolio selection, which has close performance to the theoretical\noptimal one. Among 1000 stocks, for example, we are able to identify all\noptimal subsets of portfolios of different sizes, their associated allocation\nvectors, and their estimated risks. The utility of our new approach is\nillustrated by simulation and empirical studies on the 100 Fama-French\nindustrial portfolios and the 400 stocks randomly selected from Russell 3000.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Dec 2008 06:17:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Zhang", "Jingjin", ""], ["Yu", "Ke", ""]]}]
