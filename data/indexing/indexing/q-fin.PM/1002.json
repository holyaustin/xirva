This study investigates how the strategy evaluation\nschemes adopted by agents affect their performance in conjunction with the\nmarket circumstances. We observe the performance of three strategy evaluation\nschemes, the history-dependent wealth game, the trend-opposing minority game,\nand the trend-following majority game, in a stock market where the price is\nexogenously determined. The price is either directly adopted from the real\nstock market indices or generated with a Markov chain of order $\\le 2$. Each\nscheme's success is quantified by average wealth accumulated by the traders\nequipped with the scheme. The wealth game, as it learns from the history, shows\nrelatively good performance unless the market is highly unpredictable. The\nmajority game is successful in a trendy market dominated by long periods of\nsustained price increase or decrease. On the other hand, the minority game is\nsuitable for a market with persistent zig-zag price patterns. We also discuss\nthe consequence of implementing finite memory in the scoring processes of\nstrategies. Our findings suggest under which market circumstances each\nevaluation scheme is appropriate for modeling the behavior of real market\ntraders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Feb 2010 10:49:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Aug 2010 04:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Baek", "Yongjoo", ""], ["Lee", "Sang Hoon", ""], ["Jeong", "Hawoong", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4817", "submitter": "Giacomo Bormetti", "authors": "Giacomo Bormetti, Valentina Cazzola, Danilo Delpini, Giacomo Livan", "title": "Accounting for risk of non linear portfolios: a novel Fourier approach", "comments": "10 pages, 12 figures.
