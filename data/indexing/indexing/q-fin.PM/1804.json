I\nshow that optimal portfolio weights can be estimated using a machine learning\n(ML) framework, where the outcome to be predicted is a constant and the vector\nof explanatory variables is the asset returns. It follows that ML specifically\ntargets estimation risk when estimating portfolio weights, and that\n\"off-the-shelf\" ML algorithms can be used to estimate the optimal portfolio in\nthe presence of parameter uncertainty. The framework nests the traditional\napproach and recently proposed shrinkage approaches as special cases. By\nrelying on results from the ML literature, I derive new insights for existing\napproaches and propose new estimation methods. Based on simulation studies and\nseveral datasets, I find that ML significantly reduces estimation risk compared\nto both the traditional approach and the equal weight strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2018 10:27:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Jul 2018 10:36:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Kinn", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.05103", "submitter": "Jamel Henchiri", "authors": "Mounira Chniguir, Mohamed Kefi (INAT), Jamel Henchiri", "title": "The Determinants of Home Bias in Stock Portfolio: An Emerging and\n  Developed Markets Study", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues\n  International Journal of Economics and Financial Issues, 2017, 7, pp.182 -\n  191", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The objective of this paper is to measure the degree of home bias (HB) within\nholdings portfolio and to identify their determining factors. By following\nliterature and an international capital asset pricing model, we have chosen\nquite a number of susceptible factors that impact HB. This model is, hence,\nestimated for 20 countries, with cross-section econometrics, between 2008 and\n2013. Our results show that all countries have recorded a high level of HB in\ntheir holdings portfolio. After that, we test if the HB of the emerging markets\nand that of the developed markets react differently to the determining factors.\nThe volatility of the exchange rate is statistically significant with emerging\nmarkets, while it is hardly remarkable for the developed countries.\nCo-variance, size, distance, language, legal framework and foreign organization\nstocks prevents American investors to invest abroad.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2018 08:13:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chniguir", "Mounira", "", "INAT"], ["Kefi", "Mohamed", "", "INAT"], ["Henchiri", "Jamel", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.05454", "submitter": "Tony Jebara", "authors": "Tony Jebara", "title": "A refinement of Bennett's inequality with applications to portfolio\n  optimization", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST cs.LG q-fin.PM stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A refinement of Bennett's inequality is introduced which is strictly tighter\nthan the classical bound.
