Their spatial\nstructure corresponds to that of utility functions, while the temporal one\nreflects a Nisio-type semigroup property, referred to as self-generation. In\nthe setting of semimartingale financial markets, we provide a dual formulation\nof self-generation in addition to the original one, and show equivalence\nbetween the two, thus giving a dual characterization of forward performances.\nThen we focus on random fields with an exponential structure and provide\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for self-generation in that case. Finally,\nwe illustrate our methods in financial markets driven by It\\^o-processes, where\nwe obtain an explicit parametrization of all exponential forward performances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2008 02:48:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 15 Nov 2008 23:45:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2009 16:46:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Dec 2009 08:02:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["\u017ditkovi\u0107", "Gordan", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.4615", "submitter": "Michele Tumminello", "authors": "M.

Correlation matrices play an important role in portfolio\noptimization and in several other quantitative descriptions of asset price\ndynamics in financial markets. Specifically, we discuss how to define and\nobtain hierarchical trees, correlation based trees and networks from a\ncorrelation matrix. The hierarchical clustering and other procedures performed\non the correlation matrix to detect statistically reliable aspects of the\ncorrelation matrix are seen as filtering procedures of the correlation matrix.\nWe also discuss a method to associate a hierarchically nested factor model to a\nhierarchical tree obtained from a correlation matrix. The information retained\nin filtering procedures and its stability with respect to statistical\nfluctuations is quantified by using the Kullback-Leibler distance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 13:03:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Tumminello", "M.", ""], ["Lillo", "F.", ""], ["Mantegna", "R.
