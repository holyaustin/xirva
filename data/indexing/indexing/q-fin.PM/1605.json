Our approach is deeply rooted in Stochastic\nPortfolio Theory (SPT), a stochastic analysis framework introduced by Robert\nFernholz that aims at flexibly analysing the performance of certain investment\nstrategies in stock markets relative to benchmark indices. In particular, SPT\nhas exhibited some investment strategies based on company sizes that, under\nrealistic assumptions, outperform benchmark indices with probability 1 over\ncertain time horizons. Galvanised by this result, we consider the inverse\nproblem that consists of learning (from historical data) an optimal investment\nstrategy based on any given set of trading characteristics, and using a\nuser-specified optimality criterion that may go beyond outperforming a\nbenchmark index. Although this inverse problem is of the utmost interest to\ninvestment management practitioners, it can hardly be tackled using the SPT\nframework. We show that our machine learning approach learns investment\nstrategies that considerably outperform existing SPT strategies in the US stock\nmarket.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2016 16:53:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Samo", "Yves-Laurent Kom", ""], ["Vervuurt", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.04600", "submitter": "Fayyaaz Loonat", "authors": "Tim Gebbie and Fayyaaz Loonat", "title": "Learning zero-cost portfolio selection with pattern matching", "comments": "28 pages, 21 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 13(9): e0202788 (2018)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0202788", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.CP q-fin.PM q-fin.TR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider and extend the adversarial agent-based learning approach of\nGy{\\\"o}rfi {\\it et al} to the situation of zero-cost portfolio selection\nimplemented with a quadratic approximation derived from the mutual fund\nseparation theorems.
