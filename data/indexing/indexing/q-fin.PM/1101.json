In a general semimartingale\nsetting, the abstract turnpike states that optimal final payoffs and portfolios\nconverge under their myopic probabilities. In diffusion models with several\nassets and a single state variable, the classic turnpike demonstrates that\noptimal portfolios converge under the physical probability; meanwhile the\nexplicit turnpike identifies the limit of finite-horizon optimal portfolios as\na long-run myopic portfolio defined in terms of the solution of an ergodic HJB\nequation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Jan 2011 12:06:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Feb 2012 17:37:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Guasoni", "Paolo", ""], ["Kardaras", "Constantinos", ""], ["Robertson", "Scott", ""], ["Xing", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1148", "submitter": "Garfield Brown", "authors": "Winston Buckley and Garfield Brown and Mario Marshall", "title": "A Mispricing Model of Stocks Under Asymmetric Information", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM q-fin.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We extend the theory of asymmetric information in mispricing models for\nstocks following geometric Brownian motion to constant relative risk averse\ninvestors.

Instead of specifying an agent's utility function and deriving her\nactions, we assume we observe her actions (i.e. her consumption and investment\nstrategies) and ask if it is possible to derive a utility function for which\nthe observed behaviour is optimal. We work in continuous time both in a\ndeterministic and stochastic setting. In the deterministic setup, we find that\nthere are infinitely many utility functions generating a given consumption\npattern. In the stochastic setting of the Black-Scholes complete market it\nturns out that the consumption and investment strategies have to satisfy a\nconsistency condition (PDE) if they are to come from a classical utility\nmaximisation problem. We show further that important characteristics of the\nagent such as her attitude towards risk (e.g. DARA) can be deduced directly\nfrom her consumption/investment choices.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Jan 2011 21:58:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 25 Mar 2011 16:56:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 24 Oct 2011 08:44:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 16:40:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cox", "Alexander M.
