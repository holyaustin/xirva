The market model considered is continuous in time and\nincomplete. the prices of financial assets are modeled by It\\^o processes. The\ndynamic risk constraints, which are time and state dependent, are generated by\nrisk measures. Optimal trading strategies are characterized by a quadratic\nBSDE. Within the class of \\textit{time consistent distortion risk measures}, a\nthree-fund separation result is established. Numerical results emphasize the\neffects of imposing risk constraints on trading.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 04:43:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 10:36:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Moreno-Bromberg", "Santiago", ""], ["Pirvu", "Traian", ""], ["R\u00e9veillac", "Anthony", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.2980", "submitter": "Roman Muraviev", "authors": "Roman Muraviev", "title": "Additive habit formation: Consumption in incomplete markets with random\n  endowments", "comments": "To appear in Mathematics and Financial Economics", "journal-ref": "Mathematics and Financial Economics 5(2), 67--99, 2011", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We provide a detailed characterization of the optimal consumption stream for\nthe additive habit-forming utility maximization problem, in a framework of\ngeneral discrete-time incomplete markets and random endowments.
