The underlying model is the industry\nstandard multi-factor Merton-type model with arbitrary valuation function at\nhorizon (in contrast to the simplistic default-only case).

This poses a fundamental problem, because solutions that are\nnot stable under sample fluctuations may look optimal for a given sample, but\nare, in effect, very far from optimal with respect to the average risk. In this\npaper, we approach the problem from the point of view of statistical learning\ntheory. The occurrence of the instability is intimately related to over-fitting\nwhich can be avoided using known regularization methods. We show how\nregularized portfolio optimization with the expected shortfall as a risk\nmeasure is related to support vector regression. The budget constraint dictates\na modification. We present the resulting optimization problem and discuss the\nsolution. The L2 norm of the weight vector is used as a regularizer, which\ncorresponds to a diversification \"pressure\". This means that diversification,\nbesides counteracting downward fluctuations in some assets by upward\nfluctuations in others, is also crucial because it improves the stability of\nthe solution. The approach we provide here allows for the simultaneous\ntreatment of optimization and diversification in one framework that enables the\ninvestor to trade-off between the two, depending on the size of the available\ndata set.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2009 15:16:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Still", "Susanne", ""], ["Kondor", "Imre", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3043", "submitter": "Revaz Tevzadze", "authors": "R.

Developed to evaluate the\nrisk of hedge funds, the SVaR appears to be applicable to a wide range of\ninvestments. Its principle is to use the fairly short and sparse history of the\nhedge fund returns to identify relevant risk factors among a very broad set of\npossible risk sources. This risk profile is obtained by calibrating a\ncollection of nonlinear single-factor models as opposed to a single\nmulti-factor model. We then use the risk profile and the very long and rich\nhistory of the factors to asses the possible impact of known past crises on the\nfunds, unveiling their hidden risks and so called \"black swans\".\n  In backtests using data of 1060 hedge funds we demonstrate that the SVaR has\nbetter or comparable properties than several common VaR measures - shows less\nVaR exceptions and, perhaps even more importantly, in case of an exception, by\nsmaller amounts.\n  The ultimate test of the StressVaR however, is in its usage as a fund\nallocating tool. By simulating a realistic investment in a portfolio of hedge\nfunds, we show that the portfolio constructed using the StressVaR on average\noutperforms both the market and the portfolios constructed using common VaR\nmeasures.\n  For the period from Feb. 2003 to June 2009, the StressVaR constructed\nportfolio outperforms the market by about 6% annually, and on average the\ncompeting VaR measures by around 3%. The performance numbers from Aug. 2007 to\nJune 2009 are even more impressive. The SVaR portfolio outperforms the market\nby 20%, and the best competing measure by 4%.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2009 13:05:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Coste", "Cyril", ""], ["Douady", "Raphael", ""], ["Zovko", "Ilija I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.4801", "submitter": "Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "authors": "Jan Kallsen, Johannes Muhle-Karbe", "title": "Existence of Shadow Prices in Finite Probability Spaces", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A shadow price is a process lying within the bid/ask prices of a market with\nproportional transaction costs, such that maximizing expected utility from\nconsumption in the frictionless market with this price process leads to the\nsame maximal utility as in the original market with transaction costs.
