Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors\nuse historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an\nunbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great\namount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not\nmuch bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the\ncovariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is\nproposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a\ncluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by\nreducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this\ndissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after\nclustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single\ngroup. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order\nto limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not\nonly the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility\ndecreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced. It implies that\nwe need a bounded clustering algorithm so that maximum clustering size can be\nprecisely controlled to find the best portfolio performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jan 2020 13:27:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 06:23:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 11:15:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-20", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Jinwoo", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.08240", "submitter": "Lawrence Middleton", "authors": "Graham Baird, James Dodd, Lawrence Middleton", "title": "A growth adjusted price-earnings ratio", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.GN q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new growth adjusted\nprice-earnings measure (GA-P/E) and assess its efficacy as measure of value and\npredictor of future stock returns.

Our\nexperiments are promising: on synthetic data, we show that our proposed method\ndoes indeed diversify among time series with highly similar structural breaks,\nand enjoys advantages over existing metrics between sets. On real data,\nexperiments illustrate that our proposed optimization method produces higher\nrisk-adjusted returns than mean-variance portfolio optimization. Moreover, the\npredictive distribution is superior in every measure analyzed, producing a\nhigher mean, lower standard deviation and lower kurtosis.
