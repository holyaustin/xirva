To limit investment\nrisk, we place an upper bound on the total number of shares kept at any time.\nAssuming that prices evolve according to an ergodic process with a mild\ndecaying memory property, and assuming constraints on the total number of\nshares that can be bought and sold at any time, we develop a trading policy\nthat comes arbitrarily close to achieving the profit of an ideal policy that\nhas perfect knowledge of future events. Proximity to the optimal profit comes\nwith a corresponding tradeoff in the maximum required stock level and in the\ntimescales associated with convergence. We then consider arbitrary (possibly\nnon-ergodic) price processes, and show that the same algorithm comes close to\nthe profit of a frame based policy that can look a fixed number of slots into\nthe future.
