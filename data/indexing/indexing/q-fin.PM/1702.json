We prove the existence of an optimal investment without introducing\nthe associated dual problem. We rely on a recent result of Orlicz space theory,\ndue to Delbaen and Owari which leads to a simple and transparent proof.\n  Our results apply to non-smooth utilities and even strict concavity can be\nrelaxed. We can handle certain random endowments with non-hedgeable risks,\ncomplementing earlier papers. Constraints on the terminal wealth can also be\nincorporated.\n  As examples, we treat frictionless markets with finitely many assets and\nlarge financial markets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 12:11:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 16:32:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 13:29:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 21 Mar 2018 18:20:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Rasonyi", "Miklos", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.01354", "submitter": "Md Mahmudul Alam Dr.", "authors": "Md.

And if\nmarkets are inefficient, investors can use available information ignored by the\nmarket to earn abnormally high returns on their investments. In this context\nthis paper tries to find evidence supporting the reality of weak-form\nefficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining the issues of market\nrisk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE. The study uses\na data set of daily market index and returns for the period of 1994 to 2005 and\nweekly market capital turnover in proportion of total market capital for the\nperiod of 1994 to 2005. The paper also looks about the market risk (systemic\nrisk) and return where it is found that market rate of return of DSE is very\nlow or sometimes negative. Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which\nenvisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a\nrisky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return\nrelationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is\nnot liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very\ninsignificant. All these issues are very noteworthy to the security analysts,\ninvestors and security exchange regulatory bodies in their policy making\ndecisions to progress the market condition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 5 Feb 2017 00:23:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Alam", "Md.
