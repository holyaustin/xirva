We show that, by considering the entire\nconditional distribution of the dependent variable, it is possible to optimize\ndifferent risk and performance indicators. In particular, we introduce a\nrisk-adjusted profitability measure, useful in evaluating financial portfolios\nunder a pessimistic perspective, since the reward contribution is net of the\nmost favorable outcomes. Moreover, as we consider large portfolios, we also\ncope with the dimensionality issue by introducing an l1-norm penalty on the\nassets weights.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2015 14:52:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bonaccolto", "Giovanni", ""], ["Caporin", "Massimiliano", ""], ["Paterlini", "Sandra", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.02025", "submitter": "Ola Mahmoud", "authors": "Enrico G.

This paper studies axiomatizations of the concept of\ndiversification and their relationship to the related notions of risk aversion\nand convex preferences within different choice theoretic models. Implications\nof these notions on portfolio choice are discussed. We cover model-independent\ndiversification preferences, preferences within models of choice under risk,\nincluding expected utility theory and the more general rank-dependent expected\nutility theory, as well as models of choice under uncertainty axiomatized via\nChoquet expected utility theory. Remarks on interpretations of diversification\npreferences within models of behavioral choice are given in the conclusion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 04:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 11:02:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 07:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["De Giorgi", "Enrico G.", ""], ["Mahmoud", "Ola", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06850", "submitter": "Xun Li", "authors": "Xun Li and Zuo Quan Xu", "title": "Continuous-Time Mean-Variance Portfolio Selection with Constraints on\n  Wealth and Portfolio", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider continuous-time mean-variance portfolio selection with bankruptcy\nprohibition under convex cone portfolio constraints.
