The individual consumes at a constant rate $c$, so the level of wealth\nrequired for risklessly meeting consumption equals $c/r$, in which $r$ is the\nrate of return of the riskless asset.\n  Our problem is related to, but different from, the goal-reaching problems of\nBrowne (1997). First, Browne (1997, Section 3.1) maximizes the probability that\nwealth reaches $b < c/r$ before it reaches $a < b$. Browne's game ends when\nwealth reaches $b$. By contrast, for the problem we consider, the game\ncontinues until the individual dies or until wealth reaches 0; reaching $b$ and\nthen falling below it before death does not count.\n  Second, Browne (1997, Section 4.2) maximizes the expected discounted reward\nof reaching $b > c/r$ before wealth reaches $c/r$. If one interprets his\ndiscount rate as a hazard rate, then our two problems are {\\it mathematically}\nequivalent for the special case for which $b > c/r$, with ruin level $c/r$.\nHowever, we obtain different results because we set the ruin level at 0,\nthereby allowing the game to continue when wealth falls below $c/r$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 14:51:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 00:52:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 14:09:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Young", "Virginia R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.01802", "submitter": "Amogh Deshpande Dr.", "authors": "Amogh Deshpande and Saul D.

The\nperformance of the optimized portfolio relies on the accuracy of the estimated\ncovariance matrix of the portfolio asset returns. For large portfolios, the\nnumber of available market returns is often of similar order to the number of\nassets, so that the sample covariance matrix performs poorly as a covariance\nestimator. Additionally, financial market data often contain outliers which, if\nnot correctly handled, may further corrupt the covariance estimation. We\naddress these shortcomings by studying the performance of a hybrid covariance\nmatrix estimator based on Tyler's robust M-estimator and on Ledoit-Wolf's\nshrinkage estimator while assuming samples with heavy-tailed distribution.\nEmploying recent results from random matrix theory, we develop a consistent\nestimator of (a scaled version of) the realized portfolio risk, which is\nminimized by optimizing online the shrinkage intensity. Our portfolio\noptimization method is shown via simulations to outperform existing methods\nboth for synthetic and real market data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 10:40:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Liusha", ""], ["Couillet", "Romain", ""], ["McKay", "Matthew R.", ""]]}]
