Namely, we consider a risk neutral investor\nwho owns one risky stock from which she assumes that it has a lower expected\nreturn than the riskless bank account and determine the optimal stopping time\nat which she sells the stock to invest the proceeds in the bank account up to\nthe maturity date. In the case of linear taxes and a positive riskless interest\nrate, the problem is nontrivial because at the selling time the investor has to\nrealize book profits which triggers tax payments. We derive a boundary that is\ncontinuous and increasing in time and decreasing in the volatility of the stock\nsuch that the investor sells the stock at the first time its price is smaller\nor equal to this boundary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 21:51:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["K\u00fchn", "Christoph", ""], ["Surya", "Budhi Arta", ""], ["Ulbricht", "Bj\u00f6rn", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01126", "submitter": "Zizhuo Wang", "authors": "Pengyu Qian, Zizhuo Wang, Zaiwen Wen", "title": "A Composite Risk Measure Framework for Decision Making under Uncertainty", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC q-fin.PM q-fin.RM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we present a unified framework for decision making under\nuncertainty.
