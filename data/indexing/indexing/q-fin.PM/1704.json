The proposed strategy maximizes the expected portfolio\nvalue bounded within a targeted range, composed of a conservative lower target\nrepresenting a need for capital protection and a desired upper target\nrepresenting an investment goal. This strategy favorably shapes the entire\nprobability distribution of returns, as it simultaneously seeks a desired\nexpected return, cuts off downside risk and implicitly caps volatility and\nhigher moments. To illustrate the effectiveness of this investment strategy, we\nstudy a multiperiod portfolio optimization problem with transaction costs and\ndevelop a two-stage regression approach that improves the classical least\nsquares Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm when dealing with difficult payoffs, such\nas highly concave, abruptly changing or discontinuous functions. Our numerical\nresults show substantial improvements over the classical LSMC algorithm for\nboth the constant relative risk-aversion (CRRA) utility approach and the\nproposed skewed target range strategy (STRS). Our numerical results illustrate\nthe ability of the STRS to contain the portfolio value within the targeted\nrange. When compared with the CRRA utility approach, the STRS achieves a\nsimilar mean-variance efficient frontier while delivering a better downside\nrisk-return trade-off.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 03:50:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 06:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 06:21:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 02:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Rongju", ""], ["Langren\u00e9", "Nicolas", ""], ["Tian", "Yu", ""], ["Zhu", "Zili", ""], ["Klebaner", "Fima", ""], ["Hamza", "Kais", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.01366", "submitter": "Takashi Shinzato", "authors": "Takashi Shinzato", "title": "Replica Analysis for Portfolio Optimization with Single-Factor Model", "comments": "4 pages, no figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.7566/JPSJ.86.063802", "report-no": "J.
