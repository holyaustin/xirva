These longer horizon deals can be viewed as contracts with\noptionality embedded in them and can be priced using established methods from\nderivatives theory, becoming to our limited knowledge, the first application\nthat can lead to greater synergies between the operations of derivative and\ndelta-one trading desks, perhaps even being able to combine certain aspects of\nthe day to day operations of these seemingly disparate entities. We run\nnumerical simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability of these\nmodels. These models are part of one of the least explored yet profit laden\nareas of modern investment management.\n  We develop a heuristic that can mitigate the loss of information that sets in\nwhen parameters are estimated first and then the valuation is performed by\ndirectly calculating the valuation using the historical time series. This can\nlead to reduced models errors and greater financial stability. We illustrate\nhow the methodologies developed here could be useful for inventory management.\nAll these techniques could have applications for dealing with other financial\ninstruments, non-financial commodities and many forms of uncertainty. An\nunintended consequence of our efforts, has become a review of the vast\nliterature on options pricing, which can be useful for anyone that attempts to\napply the corresponding techniques to the problems mentioned here.\n  Admittedly, our initial ambitions to produce a normative theory on long term\nloan valuations are undone by the present state of affairs in social science\nmodeling. Though we consider many elements of a securities lending system at\nface value, this cannot be termed a positive theory. For now, if it ends up\nproducing a useful theory, our work is done.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 05:45:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 05:30:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:22:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 11:36:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 20 Oct 2018 04:26:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Sat, 20 Jul 2019 13:36:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kashyap", "Ravi", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.01655", "submitter": "Tiziano De Angelis Dr", "authors": "Tiziano De Angelis and Erik Ekstr\\\"om", "title": "The dividend problem with a finite horizon", "comments": "21 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.OC q-fin.PM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We characterise the value function of the optimal dividend problem with a\nfinite time horizon as the unique classical solution of a suitable\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

For the popular risk measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), it is now known that their worst-case\ncounterparts can be evaluated in closed form when only the first two moments\nare known for the underlying distribution. These results are remarkable since\nthey not only simplify the use of worst-case risk measures but also provide\ngreat insight into the connection between the worst-case risk measures and\nexisting risk measures. We show in this paper that somewhat surprisingly\nsimilar closed-form solutions also exist for the general class of law invariant\ncoherent risk measures, which consists of spectral risk measures as special\ncases that are arguably the most important extensions of CVaR. We shed light on\nthe one-to-one correspondence between a worst-case law invariant risk measure\nand a worst-case CVaR (and a worst-case VaR), which enables one to carry over\nthe development of worst-case VaR in the context of portfolio optimization to\nthe worst-case law invariant risk measures immediately.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 22:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-15", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Jonathan Yu-Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.05475", "submitter": "Takashi Shinzato", "authors": "Takashi Shinzato", "title": "Replica Analysis for the Duality of the Portfolio Optimization Problem", "comments": "6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.94.052307", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-fin.PM cond-mat.dis-nn math.OC stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the present paper, the primal-dual problem consisting of the investment\nrisk minimization problem and the expected return maximization problem in the\nmean-variance model is discussed using replica analysis.
