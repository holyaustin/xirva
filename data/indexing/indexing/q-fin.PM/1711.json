The investment decision of\ninvestors, derived through an optimization, drives the stock price. The model\nhas been inspired by the econophysical Levy-Levy-Solomon model (Economics\nLetters, 45). The goal of this work is to gain insights into the stock price\nand wealth distribution. We especially want to discover the causes for the\nappearance of power-laws in financial data. We follow a kinetic approach\nsimilar to (D. Maldarella, L. Pareschi, Physica A, 391) and derive the mean\nfield limit of our microscopic agent dynamics. The novelty in our approach is\nthat the financial agents apply model predictive control (MPC) to approximate\nand solve the optimization of their utility function. Interestingly, the MPC\napproach gives a mathematical connection between the two opponent economic\nconcepts of modeling financial agents to be rational or boundedly rational.\nFurthermore, this is to our knowledge the first kinetic portfolio model which\nconsiders a wealth and stock price distribution simultaneously. Due to our\nkinetic approach, we can study the wealth and price distribution on a\nmesoscopic level. The wealth distribution is characterized by a lognormal law.\nFor the stock price distribution, we can either observe a lognormal behavior in\nthe case of long-term investors or a power-law in the case of high-frequency\ntrader. Furthermore, the stock return data exhibits a fat-tail, which is a well\nknown characteristic of real financial data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Nov 2017 08:23:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 22:32:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 26 May 2018 23:00:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2019 22:08:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-21", "authors_parsed": [["Trimborn", "Torsten", ""], ["Pareschi", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Frank", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04717", "submitter": "Jean-Philippe Bouchaud", "authors": "J.

Building on the intuition that robust optimization reduces\nthe sensitivity of the expected reward to errors in the model by controlling\nthe spread of the reward distribution, we show that the first-order benefit of\n``little bit of robustness\" (i.e., $\\delta$ small, positive) is a significant\nreduction in the variance of the out-of-sample reward while the corresponding\nimpact on the mean is almost an order of magnitude smaller. One implication is\nthat substantial variance (sensitivity) reduction is possible at little cost if\nthe robustness parameter is properly calibrated. To this end, we introduce the\nnotion of a robust mean-variance frontier to select the robustness parameter\nand show that it can be approximated using resampling methods like the\nbootstrap. Our examples show that robust solutions resulting from \"open loop\"\ncalibration methods (e.g., selecting a $90\\%$ confidence level regardless of\nthe data and objective function) can be very conservative out-of-sample, while\nthose corresponding to the robustness parameter that optimizes an estimate of\nthe out-of-sample expected reward (e.g., via the bootstrap) with no regard for\nthe variance are often insufficiently robust.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Nov 2017 14:47:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2020 02:37:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gotoh", "Jun-Ya", ""], ["Kim", "Michael Jong", ""], ["Lim", "Andrew E.
