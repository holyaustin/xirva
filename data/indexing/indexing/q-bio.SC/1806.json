We develop a modeling framework\nfor tumor ablation, and present the simplest possible model for drug diffusion\nin a spherical tumor with leaky boundaries and assuming cell death eventually\nleads to ablation of that cell effectively making the two quantities\nnumerically equivalent. The death of a cell after a given exposure time depends\non both the concentration of the drug and the amount of oxygen available to the\ncell. Higher oxygen availability leads to cell death at lower drug\nconcentrations. It can be assumed that a minimum concentration is required for\na cell to die, effectively connecting diffusion with efficacy. The\nconcentration threshold decreases as exposure time increases, which allows us\nto compute dose-response curves. Furthermore, these curves can be plotted at\nmuch finer time intervals compared to that of experiments, which is used to\nproduce a dose-threshold-response surface giving an observer a complete picture\nof the drug's efficacy for an individual. In addition, since the diffusion,\nleak coefficients, and the availability of oxygen is different for different\nindividuals and tumors, we produce artificial replication data through\nbootstrapping to simulate error. While the usual data-driven model with\nSigmoidal curves use 12 free parameters, our mechanistic model only has two\nfree parameters, allowing it to be open to scrutiny rather than forcing\nagreement with data. Even so, the simplest model in our framework, derived\nhere, shows close agreement with the bootstrapped curves, and reproduces well\nestablished relations, such as Haber's rule.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jun 2018 03:53:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Rahman", "Aminur", ""], ["Ghosh", "Souparno", ""], ["Pal", "Ranadip", ""]]}, {"id": "1806.02310", "submitter": "Kelath Murali Manoj", "authors": "Kelath Murali Manoj, Abhinav Parashar", "title": "Unveiling ADP-binding sites and channels in respiratory complexes:\n  Validation of Murburn concept as a holistic explanation for oxidative\n  phosphorylation", "comments": "96 pages, 9 figures and three tables in the main manuscript, along\n  with a supplementary information file", "journal-ref": "Journal of Biomolecular Structure and Dynamics, 2018", "doi": "10.1080/07391102.2018.1552896", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (mOxPhos) makes ATP, the energy\ncurrency of life.
