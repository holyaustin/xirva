In this review, these questions are addressed from a theoretical\nperspective. We focus on models in which the membranes are described as elastic\nsheets, and the receptors and ligands as anchored molecules. In these models,\nthe thermal membrane roughness on the nanometer scale leads to a cooperative\nbinding of anchored receptor and ligand molecules, since the receptor-ligand\nbinding smoothens out the membranes and facilitates the formation of additional\nbonds. Patterns of receptor domains observed in Monte Carlo simulations point\ntowards a joint role of spontaneous and active processes in cell adhesion.
