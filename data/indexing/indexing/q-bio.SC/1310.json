Each sister\nchromosome is bound to a separate proteinous structure, called kinetochore\n(kt), that captures the tip of a filamentous protein, called microtubule (MT).\nTwo oppositely oriented MTs pull the two kts attached to two sister chromosomes\nthereby pulling the two sisters away from each other. Here we theoretically\nstudy an even simpler system, namely an isolated kt coupled to a single MT;\nthis system mimics an {\\it in-vitro} experiment where a single kt-MT attachment\nis reconstituted using purified extracts from budding yeast. Our models not\nonly account for the experimentally observed \"catch-bond-like\" behavior of the\nkt-MT coupling, but also make new predictions on the probability distribution\nof the lifetimes of the attachments. In principle, our new predictions can be\ntested by analyzing the data collected in the {\\it in-vitro} experiments\nprovided the experiment is repeated sufficiently large number of times. Our\ntheory provides a deep insight into the effects of (a) size, (b) energetics,\nand (c) stochastic kinetics of the kt-MT coupling on the distribution of the\nlifetimes of these attachments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Oct 2013 12:35:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 17:05:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Ajeet K.", ""], ["Shtylla", "Blerta", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.2391", "submitter": "David Head", "authors": "D.

Microscopic modelling can\nhelp to quantify the relationship between individual motors plus filaments to\norganisation and dynamics on molecular and supra-molecular length scales. Here\nwe present results of extensive numerical simulations of active gels where the\nmotors and filaments are confined between two infinite parallel plates. Thermal\nfluctuations and excluded-volume interactions between filaments are included. A\nsystematic variation of rates for motor motion, attachment and detachment,\nincluding a differential detachment rate from filament ends, reveals a range of\nnon-equilibrium behaviour. Strong motor binding produces structured filament\naggregates that we refer to as asters, bundles or layers, whose stability\ndepends on motor speed and differential end-detachment. The gross features of\nthe dependence of the observed structures on the motor rate and the filament\nconcentration can be captured by a simple one-filament model. Loosely bound\naggregates exhibit super-diffusive mass transport, where filament translocation\nscales with lag time with non-unique exponents that depend on motor kinetics.\nAn empirical data collapse of filament speed as a function of motor speed and\nend-detachment is found, suggesting a dimensional reduction of the relevant\nparameter space. We conclude by discussing the perspectives of microscopic\nmodelling in the field of active gels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2013 08:38:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Feb 2014 18:52:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Head", "D.

We consider different\nreaction kinetics, spatial dimensions, and loss mechanisms for intermediate\nsubstrate molecules. Our systematic analysis of the different regimes of this\nmodel reveals both universal features and distinct characteristics in the\nphenomenology of these different systems. In particular, the distribution of\nthe second pathway enzyme that maximizes the reaction flux undergoes a generic\ntransition from co-localization with the first enzyme when the catalytic\nefficiency of the second enzyme is low, to an extended profile when the\ncatalytic efficiency is high. However, the critical transition point and the\nshape of the extended optimal profile is significantly affected by specific\nfeatures of the model.

Its characteristic signature is the biphasic kill curve,\nwhereby microbes exposed to a bactericidal agent are initially killed very\nrapidly but then much more slowly. Here we relate this problem to the more\ngeneral problem of understanding the emergence of distinct growth phenotypes in\nclonal populations. We address the problem mathematically by adopting the\nframework of the phenomenon of so-called weak ergodicity breaking, well known\nin dynamical physical systems, which we extend to the biological context. We\nshow analytically and by direct stochastic simulations that distinct growth\nphenotypes can emerge as a consequence of slow-down of stochastic fluctuations\nin the expression of a gene controlling growth rate. In the regime of fast gene\ntranscription, the system is ergodic, the growth rate distribution is unimodal,\nand accounts for one phenotype only. In contrast, at slow transcription and\nfast translation, weakly non-ergodic components emerge, the population\ndistribution of growth rates becomes bimodal, and two distinct growth\nphenotypes are identified. When coupled to the well-established growth rate\ndependence of antibiotic killing, this model describes the observed fast and\nslow killing phases, and reproduces much of the phenomenology of bacterial\npersistence. The model has major implications for efforts to develop control\nstrategies for persistent infections.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 17:07:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Rocco", "Andrea", ""], ["Kierzek", "Andrzej M.", ""], ["McFadden", "Johnjoe", ""]]}]
