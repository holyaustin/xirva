Several mechanisms are at work towards the formation of the\nspindle, one of which is the `capture' of chromosome pairs, held together by\nkinetochores, by randomly searching microtubules. Although the entire cell\ncycle can be up to 24 hours long, the mitotic phase typically takes only less\nthan an hour. How does the cell keep the duration of mitosis within this limit?\nPrevious theoretical studies have suggested that the chromosome search and\ncapture is optimized by tuning the microtubule dynamic parameters to minimize\nthe search time. In this paper, we examine this conjecture. We compute the mean\nsearch time for a single target by microtubules from a single nucleating site,\nusing a systematic and rigorous theoretical approach, for arbitrary kinetic\nparameters. The result is extended to multiple targets and nucleating sites by\nphysical arguments. Estimates of mitotic time scales are then obtained for\ndifferent cells using experimental data. In yeast and mammalian cells, the\nobserved changes in microtubule kinetics between interphase and mitosis are\nbeneficial in reducing the search time. In {\\it Xenopus} extracts, by contrast,\nthe opposite effect is observed, in agreement with the current understanding\nthat large cells use additional mechanisms to regulate the duration of the\nmitotic phase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2009 09:32:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 03:58:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 21 Jan 2011 09:12:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"], ["Govindan", "Bindu S.", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"]]}, {"id": "0904.0438", "submitter": "Thierry Mora", "authors": "Thierry Mora, Howard Yu, Yoshiyuki Sowa and Ned S.
