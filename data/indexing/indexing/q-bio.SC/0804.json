Performing a linear stability analysis of the\ninitial state due to perturbations of the fragment boundary, we find, in the\nlimit of very large friction, that the perturbed actin velocity and pressure\nfields obey the very same laws governing the viscous fingering instability of\nan interface between immiscible fluids in a Hele-Shaw cell.

This is puzzling\nas more than a billion years of natural selection should have optimized the\nmotor protein for its speed and efficiency.

The proposed method allows for predicting the\nasymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the\nnoise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an\nexample model of the lac operon regulatory network: a reduced Yildirim-Mackey\nmodel with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate\nanalytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of\nnoise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement\nwith the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation\nresults suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying\nbiochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization\nmechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the\nconsequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of\nfluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although\nthe extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose\nmetabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Apr 2008 11:09:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 14:57:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2008 10:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ochab-Marcinek", "Anna", ""]]}]
