We\nconstructed a rate equation model incorporating the molecular crowding effects\nof rhodopsin according to experimental results, which may hinder the diffusion\nof molecules on the disk mem- brane. The present model could effectively\nreproduce and explain the mechanisms of the following phenomena observed in\nexperiments. First, the activations and relaxation of the wild-type mouse rod\ncell progressed more slowly than those of mutant cells containing half the\namount of rhodopsin on the disk membrane. Second, the strong photoactivated\nstate of the cell was sustained for a longer period when the light stimuli were\nstrong. Finally, the lifetime of photoactivation exhibited a logarithmic\nincrease with increasing light strength given exposure to strong light stimuli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 02:01:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Takamoto", "Rei", ""], ["Nishimori", "Hiraku", ""], ["Awazu", "Akinori", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.01790", "submitter": "Debashish Chowdhury", "authors": "Annwesha Dutta and Debashish Chowdhury", "title": "A generalized Michaelis-Menten equation in protein synthesis: effects of\n  mis-charged cognate tRNA and mis-reading of codon", "comments": "This is an author-created, un-copyedited version of an article\n  published in BULLETIN OF MATHEMATICAL BIOLOGY (Official Journal of The\n  Society for Mathematical Biology)", "journal-ref": "Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (Society for Mathematical\n  Biology), vol. 79, 1005 (2017)", "doi": "10.1007/s11538-017-0266-5", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The sequence of amino acid monomers in the primary structure of a protein is\ndecided by the corresponding sequence of codons (triplets of nucleic acid\nmonomers) on the template messenger RNA (mRNA).

Recent single-cell studies in prokaryotes have uncovered\nthe adder principle, where cells on average, add a fixed size (volume) from\nbirth to division. Interestingly, this added volume differs considerably among\ngenetically-identical newborn cells with similar sizes suggesting a stochastic\ncomponent in the timing of cell-division. To mechanistically explain the adder\nprinciple, we consider a time-keeper protein that begins to get stochastically\nexpressed after cell birth at a rate proportional to the volume. Cell-division\ntime is formulated as the first-passage time for protein copy numbers to hit a\nfixed threshold. Consistent with data, the model predicts that while the mean\ncell-division time decreases with increasing size of newborns, the noise in\ntiming increases with size at birth. Intriguingly, our results show that the\ndistribution of the volume added between successive cell-division events is\nindependent of the newborn cell size. This was dramatically seen in\nexperimental studies, where histograms of the added volume corresponding to\ndifferent newborn sizes collapsed on top of each other. The model provides\nfurther insights consistent with experimental observations: the distributions\nof the added volume and the cell-division time when scaled by their respective\nmeans become invariant of the growth rate. Finally, we discuss various\nmodifications to the proposed model that lead to deviations from the adder\nprinciple. In summary, our simple yet elegant model explains key experimental\nfindings and suggests a mechanism for regulating both the mean and fluctuations\nin cell-division timing for size control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 17:13:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Ghusinga", "Khem Raj", ""], ["Vargas-Garcia", "Cesar A.", ""], ["Singh", "Abhyudai", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09160", "submitter": "Mark Catherall", "authors": "Mark Catherall", "title": "Modelling the Role of Nitric Oxide in Cerebral Autoregulation", "comments": "Thesis submitted for Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering at the\n  University of Oxford, October 2014", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.CB q-bio.QM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Malfunction of the system which regulates the bloodflow in the brain is a\nmajor cause of stroke and dementia, costing many lives and many billions of\npounds each year in the UK alone. This regulatory system, known as cerebral\nautoregulation, has been the subject of much experimental and mathematical\ninvestigation yet our understanding of it is still quite limited. One area in\nwhich our understanding is particularly lacking is that of the role of nitric\noxide, understood to be a potent vasodilator. The interactions of nitric oxide\nwith the better understood myogenic response remain un-modelled and poorly\nunderstood. In this thesis we present a novel model of the arteriolar control\nmechanism, comprising a mixture of well-established and new models of\nindividual processes, brought together for the first time. We show that this\nmodel is capable of reproducing experimentally observed behaviour very closely\nand go on to investigate its stability in the context of the vasculature of the\nwhole brain. In conclusion we find that nitric oxide, although it plays a\ncentral role in determining equilibrium vessel radius, is unimportant to the\ndynamics of the system and its responses to variation in arterial blood\npressure. We also find that the stability of the system is very sensitive to\nthe dynamics of Ca$^{2+}$ within the muscle cell, and that self-sustaining\nCa$^{2+}$ waves are not necessary to cause whole-vessel radius oscillations\nconsistent with vasomotion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 21:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Catherall", "Mark", ""]]}]
