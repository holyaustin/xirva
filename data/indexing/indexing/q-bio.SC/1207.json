These unidimensional substrates are typically\nnon-static: affected by a fluctuating environment, they can undergo\nconformational changes. This is particularly true in biological cells, where\nthe state of the substrate is often coupled to the active motion of\nmacromolecular complexes, such as motor proteins on microtubules or ribosomes\non mRNAs, causing new interesting phenomena. Inspired by biological processes\nsuch as protein synthesis by ribosomes and motor protein transport, we\nintroduce the concept of localized dynamical sites coupled to a driven lattice\ngas dynamics. We investigate the phenomenology of transport in the presence of\ndynamical defects and find a novel regime characterized by an intermittent\ncurrent and subject to severe finite-size effects. Our results demonstrate the\nimpact of the regulatory role of the dynamical defects in transport, not only\nin biology but also in more general contexts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 7 Jul 2012 15:26:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Aug 2012 09:01:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 11:14:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Turci", "Francesco", ""], ["Parmeggiani", "Andrea", ""], ["Pitard", "Estelle", ""], ["Romano", "M.

Our hypothesis is that an internal\nskeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an\nexternal skeleton. By growing the organism inside-out an external skeleton\nbecomes an internal skeleton. Our hypothesis is supported by a computational\ntheory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process.\nInside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the\ndevelopment of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism,\na mutation that reverses the internal mirror orientation of those bilateral\nfounder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is\nepigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell\ncontained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops\naccording to the very same downstream developmental control network that\ndirects the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their\ngenomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the\ncell's inverted orientation. The result is inside-out bilateral symmetric\ndevelopment generating an inside-out organism with an internal skeleton.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jul 2012 10:52:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Werner", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.4574", "submitter": "Ulrich S.

Different theoretical models\nconsidering the interplay between the underlying processes of polymerization,\ncapping and branching have resulted in conflicting predictions. One of the main\nreasons for this discrepancy is the assumption of a branching reaction that is\neither first order (autocatalytic) or zeroth order in the number of existing\nfilaments. Here we introduce a unifying framework from which the two\nestablished scenarios emerge as limiting cases for low and high filament\nnumber. A smooth transition between the two cases is found at intermediate\nconditions. We also derive a threshold for the capping rate, above which\nautocatalytic growth is predicted at sufficiently low filament number. Below\nthe threshold, zeroth order characteristics are predicted to dominate the\ndynamics of the network for all accessible filament numbers. Together, this\nallows cells to grow stable actin networks over a large range of different\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jul 2012 07:48:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 22 Feb 2013 19:18:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Weichsel", "Julian", "", "UC\n  Berkeley and U Heidelberg"], ["Baczynski", "Krzysztof", "", "UC\n  Berkeley and U Heidelberg"], ["Schwarz", "Ulrich S.", "", "UC\n  Berkeley and U Heidelberg"]]}, {"id": "1207.5956", "submitter": "Pawel Domagala", "authors": "Violetta Sulzyc-Bielicka, Pawel Domagala, Jolanta Hybiak, Anna\n  Majewicz-Broda, Krzysztof Safranow, Wenancjusz Domagala", "title": "Colorectal cancers differ in respect of PARP-1 protein expression", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Polish Journal of Pathology 2012; 2: 87-92", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent findings raise the possibility of PARP inhibitor therapy in colorectal\ncancers(CRCs).

High\nPARP nuclear immunoreactivity was found in 68.2% (103/151) of all cases. In\nturn, 31.8% (48/151)of tumors showed low PARP expression, including 9 (6%)\nPARP-1 negative CRCs. There was a significant association of PARP-1 expression\nwith the site of CRC and Astler-Coller stage. A high PARP expression was noted\nin 79.1% of colon vs. 53.9% of rectal tumors (p = 0.001). The mean PARP-1 score\nwas 1.27 times higher in colon vs. rectal cancers (p = 0.009) and it was higher\nin stage B2 vs. stage C of CRCs (p = 0.018). In conclusion, the level of PARP-1\nprotein nuclear expression is associated with the tumor site and heterogeneous\nacross clinical specimens of CRC, with the majority of CRCs expressing a high\nlevel but minority - low or no PARP-1 expression.

One such feature is that of binary gene expression in which the\nexpression level is either low or high, i.e., digital in nature.

The fraction of cells in the high expression state is raised as the\nstrength of the inducing signal is increased indicating that the response is\nnot graded. In this review, we discuss the possible origins of binary gene\nexpression with emphasis on three principal mechanisms: purely stochastic,\npositive feedback-based and emergent bistability. In the latter case, two\nstable expression states are obtained due to an autoregulatory positive\nfeedback loop in protein synthesis along with cell growth retardation by the\nproteins synthesized.
