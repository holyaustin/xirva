When two\ncells touch, an adhesion link is created between them by means of transmembrane\nE-cadherin proteins. Simultaneously, their actin filaments stop polymerizing in\nthe direction perpendicular to the membrane and reorganize to create an apical\nbelt that colocalizes with the adhesion links. Here, we propose a detailed\nquantitative model of the role of the cytoplasmic $\\beta$-catenin and\n$\\alpha$-catenin proteins in this process, treated as a reaction-diffusion\nsystem. Upon cell-cell contact, the concentration in $\\alpha$-catenin dimers\nincreases, inhibiting actin branching and thereby reducing cellular motility\nand expansion pressure. This model provides a mechanism for contact inhibition\nthat could explain previously unrelated experimental findings on the role\nplayed by E-cadherin, $\\beta$-catenin and $\\alpha$-catenin in the cellular\nphenotype and in tumorigenesis.

Although both mechanisms have been observed in biological systems,\nthe question of when it is beneficial for cells to use either AM or FM is\nlargely unanswered.

This suggests that modulation\nbased on bursts may be more common in signaling networks than in gene\nregulation. We then extend our model to multiple receptors, where continuous\nand bursty signaling are equivalent to AM and FM respectively, finding that AM\nis always more accurate.

Chemical concentration measurements start with the binding of\nligand molecules to receptor proteins, which is an inherently noisy process,\nespecially at low concentrations. The signaling networks that transmit the\ninformation on the ligand concentration from the receptors into the cell have\nto filter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much as possible. These networks,\nhowever, are also stochastic in nature, which means that they will also add\nnoise to the transmitted signal. In this review, we will first discuss how the\ndiffusive transport and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor\ncorrelation time, and then how downstream signaling pathways integrate the\nnoise in the receptor state; we will discuss how the number of receptors, the\nreceptor correlation time, and the effective integration time together set a\nfundamental limit on the precision of sensing. We then discuss how cells can\nremove the receptor noise while simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise\nin the signaling network. We describe why this mechanism of time integration\nrequires three classes of resources---receptors and their integration time,\nreadout molecules, energy---and how each resource class sets a fundamental\nsensing limit. We also briefly discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood\nestimation, the role of receptor cooperativity, and how cellular copy protocols\ndiffer from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the computational\nliterature, explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the\nLandauer limit on the optimal trade-off between accuracy and energetic cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 May 2015 09:27:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Becker", "Nils B.", ""], ["Ouldridge", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Mugler", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1505.07133", "submitter": "Andreas Carlson AC", "authors": "Andreas Carlson and L.
