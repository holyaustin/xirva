If one applies this to the\n(unknown) subset of current species that will still be present at some future\ntime, then this `future phylogenetic diversity' provides a measure of the\nimpact of various extinction scenarios in biodiversity conservation. In this\npaper we study the distribution of future phylogenetic diversity under a simple\nmodel of extinction (a generalized `field of bullets' model). We show that the\ndistribution of future phylogenetic diversity converges to a normal\ndistribution as the number of species grows (under mild conditions, which are\nnecessary). We also describe an algorithm to compute the distribution\nefficiently, provided the edge lengths are integral, and briefly outline the\nsignificance of our findings for biodiversity conservation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2007 22:22:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Faller", "Beata", ""], ["Pardi", "Fabio", ""], ["Steel", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0528", "submitter": "Andrew D.

Furthermore, in combination with aspirin, ascorbic acid\naugmented the inhibitory effect of aspirin on PGE2 synthesis. However, ascorbic\nacid had no synergistic effect along with other COX inhibitors (SC-58125 and\nindomethacin). The inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated PGE2 synthesis by ascorbic\nacid was not due to the inhibition of the expression of COX-2 or microsomal\nprostaglandin E synthase (mPGES-1). Rather, ascorbic acid dose-dependently\n(0.1-100 microM) produced a significant reduction in IL-1beta-mediated\nproduction of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2alpha), a reliable\nindicator of free radical formation, suggesting that the effects of ascorbic\nacid on COX-2-mediated PGE2 biosynthesis may be the result of the maintenance\nof the neuronal redox status since COX activity is known to be enhanced by\noxidative stress. Our results provide in vitro evidence that the\nneuroprotective effects of ascorbic acid may depend, at least in part, on its\nability to reduce neuronal COX-2 activity and PGE2 synthesis, owing to its\nantioxidant properties. Further, these experiments suggest that a combination\nof aspirin with ascorbic acid constitutes a novel approach to render COX-2 more\nsensitive to inhibition by aspirin, allowing an anti-inflammatory therapy with\nlower doses of aspirin, thereby avoiding the side effects of the usually high\ndose aspirin treatment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2007 16:46:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Candelario-Jalil", "E.", ""], ["Akundi", "R.

In\nthis paper, we studied the response of a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley neuron to\ntransient input subthreshold pulses. It was found that the average response\ntime decreases but variance increases as the amplitude of channel noise\nincreases. In the case of single pulse detection, we show that channel noise\nenables one neuron to detect the subthreshold signals and an optimal membrane\narea (or channel noise intensity) exists for a single neuron to achieve optimal\nperformance. However, the detection ability of a single neuron is limited by\nlarge errors. Here, we test a simple neuronal network that can enhance the\npulse detecting abilities of neurons and find dozens of neurons can perfectly\ndetect subthreshold pulses. The phenomenon of intrinsic stochastic resonance is\nalso found both at the level of single neurons and at the level of networks. At\nthe network level, the detection ability of networks can be optimized for the\nnumber of neurons comprising the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2007 05:15:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2008 00:25:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yong", ""], ["Yu", "Lianchun", ""], ["Qin", "Shao-Meng", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.4065", "submitter": "Manoj Gopalakrishnan", "authors": "Shivam Ghosh (St.Stephens College, Delhi), Manoj Gopalakrishnan (HRI,\n  Allahabad), Kimberly Forsten-Williams (Virginia Tech)", "title": "Self-consistent theory of reversible ligand binding to a spherical cell", "comments": "23 pages with 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
