As hair bundles move, the viscous\nfriction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental\nchallenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part\nof the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for\nfrequency-selective sound amplification. Here we demonstrate that a\ncomplementary part involves the fluid-structure interaction between the liquid\nwithin the hair bundle and the stereocilia. Using force measurement on a\ndynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of\nhydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric\nmeasurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the\nforces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections. We\nfind that the close apposition of stereocilia effectively immobilizes the\nliquid between them, which reduces the drag and suppresses the relative\nsqueezing but not the sliding mode of stereociliary motion. The obliquely\noriented tip links couple the mechanotransduction channels to this least\ndissipative coherent mode, whereas the elastic horizontal top connectors\nstabilize the structure, further reducing the drag. As measured from the\ndistortion products associated with channel gating at physiological stimulation\namplitudes of tens of nanometres, the balance of forces in a hair bundle\npermits a relative mode of motion between adjacent stereocilia that encompasses\nonly a fraction of a nanometre. A combination of high-resolution experiments\nand detailed numerical modelling of fluid-structure interactions reveals the\nphysical principles behind the basic structural features of hair bundles and\nshows quantitatively how these organelles are adapted to the needs of sensitive\nmechanotransduction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Jan 2012 20:12:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kozlov", "Andrei S.", ""], ["Baumgart", "Johannes", ""], ["Risler", "Thomas", ""], ["Versteegh", "Corstiaen P.

The\nclassic example is striated muscle, where actomyosin contractility is mediated\nby highly organized sarcomeres which act as fundamental contractile units.\nHowever, many contractile bundles in vivo and in vitro lack sarcomeric\norganization. Here we propose a model for how contractility can arise in\nactomyosin bundles without sarcomeric organization and validate its predictions\nwith experiments on a reconstituted system. In the model, internal stresses in\nfrustrated arrangements of motors with diverse velocities cause filaments to\nbuckle, leading to overall shortening. We describe the onset of buckling in the\npresence of stochastic actin-myosin detachment and predict that\nbuckling-induced contraction occurs in an intermediate range of motor\ndensities. We then calculate the size of the \"contractile units\" associated\nwith this process. Consistent with these results, our reconstituted actomyosin\nbundles contract at relatively high motor density, and we observe buckling at\nthe predicted length scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Jan 2012 17:02:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lenz", "Martin", ""], ["Thoresen", "Todd", ""], ["Gardel", "Margaret L.", ""], ["Dinner", "Aaron R.", ""]]}]
