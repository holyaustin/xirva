One current\nfocus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic\nefficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially\nunknown. It is therefore challenging to discover a successful treatment to be\napproved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological\nprocesses of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS)\nthat play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These\ninclude why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of\nH2O2, are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why\nthe amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant\ndoses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced\nin the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in\nphagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification\nmechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions\nenhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological\nfunctions, which are activated by H2O2 and deactivated by NO signaling\nmolecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands\nof times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold\nin phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the\nstratosphere. It is unraveled that H2O2 is a required protective signaling\nmolecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can\ncause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and\ncancer.
