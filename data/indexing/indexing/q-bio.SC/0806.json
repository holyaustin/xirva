Three of these complexes pump protons across the membrane,\nfuelled by the energy of food-stuff electrons. Despite extensive biochemical\nand biophysical studies, the physical mechanism of this proton pumping is still\nnot well understood. Here we present a nanoelectromechanical model of the\nelectron-driven proton pump related to the second loop of the respiratory\nchain, where a lipid-soluble ubiquinone molecule shuttles between the Complex I\nand Complex III, carrying two electrons and two protons. We show that the\nenergy of electrons can be converted to the transmembrane proton potential\ngradient via the electrostatic interaction between electrons and protons on the\nshuttle.

This demonstrates that in vivo, the\nosmotically stressed cell cytoplasm will promote phage DNA ejection rather than\nresisting it. The further addition of DNA-binding proteins under crowding\nconditions is shown to enhance the extent of ejection.
