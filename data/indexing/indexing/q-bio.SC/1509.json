In cells with turgor, pressure\nopposes membrane defor- mations, and increases the amount of force that has to\nbe generated by the endocytic machinery. To determine this force, and calculate\nthe shape of the membrane, we used physical theory to model an elastic surface\nunder pressure. Accurate fits of experimental profiles are obtained assuming\nthat the coated membrane is highly rigid and preferentially curved at the\nendocytic site. The forces required from the actin machinery peaks at the onset\nof deformation, indicating that once invagination has been initiated,\nendocytosis is unlikely to stall before completion. Coat proteins do not lower\nthe initiation force but may affect the process by the curvature they induce.\nIn the presence of isotropic curvature inducers, pulling the tip of the\ninvagination can trigger the formation of a neck at the base of the\ninvagination. Hence direct neck constriction by actin may not be required,\nwhile its pulling role is essential. Finally, the theory shows that anisotropic\ncurvature effectors stabilize membrane invaginations, and the loss of\ncrescent-shaped BAR domain proteins such as Rvs167 could therefore trigger\nmembrane scission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 13:41:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Dmitrieff", "Serge", ""], ["N\u00e9d\u00e9lec", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00811", "submitter": "Eric Cytrynbaum", "authors": "Kelly M.
