We consider both the effect of DNA\norganisation in 3D, and of sequence heterogeneity. We find that in a network of\nDNA loops, as are thought to be present in bacterial DNA, the search process is\nvery sensitive to the spatial location of the target within such loops.\nTherefore, specific genes might be repressed or promoted by changing the local\ntopology of the genome. On the other hand, sequence heterogeneity creates traps\nwhich normally slow down facilitated diffusion. When suitably positioned,\nthough, these traps can, surprisingly, render the search process much more\nefficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 13:04:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Brackley", "C.
