We use a quantitative approach to\ncompare and contrast sRNAs with conventional transcription factors (TFs) to\nbetter understand the advantages of each form of regulation. In particular, we\ncalculate the steady-state behavior, noise properties, frequency-dependent gain\n(amplification), and dynamical response to large input signals of both forms of\nregulation. While the mean steady-state behavior of sRNA-regulated proteins\nexhibits a distinctive tunable threshold-linear behavior, our analysis shows\nthat transcriptional bursting leads to significantly higher intrinsic noise in\nsRNA-based regulation than in TF-based regulation in a large range of\nexpression levels and limits the ability of sRNAs to perform quantitative\nsignaling. Nonetheless, we find that sRNAs are better than TFs at filtering\nnoise in input signals. Additionally, we find that sRNAs allow cells to respond\nrapidly to large changes in input signals. These features suggest a niche for\nsRNAs in allowing cells to transition quickly yet reliably between distinct\nstates. This functional niche is consistent with the widespread appearance of\nsRNAs in stress-response and quasi-developmental networks in prokaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Sep 2008 22:14:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Mehta", "Pankaj", ""], ["Goyal", "Sidhartha", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.0559", "submitter": "Yuriy Shckorbatov G", "authors": "Y.G.

The most common formulation of\nstochastic models for biochemical networks is the chemical master equation\n(CME). While stochastic simulations are a practical way to realise the CME,\nanalytical approximations offer more insight into the influence of noise.\nTowards that end, the two-moment approximation (2MA) is a promising addition to\nthe established analytical approaches including the chemical Langevin equation\n(CLE) and the related linear noise approximation (LNA). The 2MA approach\ndirectly tracks the mean and (co)variance which are coupled in general. This\ncoupling is not obvious in CME and CLE and ignored by LNA and conventional ODE\nmodels. We extend previous derivations of 2MA by allowing a) non-elementary\nreactions and b) relative concentrations. Often, several elementary reactions\nare approximated by a single step. Furthermore, practical situations often\nrequire the use relative concentrations. We investigate the applicability of\nthe 2MA approach to the well established fission yeast cell cycle model. Our\nanalytical model reproduces the clustering of cycle times observed in\nexperiments. This is explained through multiple resettings of MPF, caused by\nthe coupling between mean and (co)variance, near the G2/M transition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Sep 2008 08:54:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Feb 2009 12:03:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2009 10:56:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ullah", "Mukhtar", ""], ["Wolkenhauer", "Olaf", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.1063", "submitter": "Gene-Wei Li", "authors": "Gene-Wei Li, Otto G.

While the presence of other proteins prevents sliding from the flanking\nDNA, DNA looping provides an alternative path to transfer from neighboring\nsites to the target efficiently.

As three\nmodel systems with distinctly different properties we consider the pairs\nbarnase:barstar, cytochrome c:cytochrome c peroxidase and p53:MDM2. In each\ncase, proteins are modeled either as spherical particles, as dipolar spheres or\nas collection of several small beads with one dipole. Spherical reaction\npatches are placed on the model proteins according to the known experimental\nstructures of the protein complexes. In the computer simulations, concentration\nis varied by changing box size. Encounter is defined as overlap of the reaction\npatches and the corresponding first passage times are recorded together with\nthe number of unsuccessful contacts before encounter. We find that encounter\nfrequency scales linearly with protein concentration, thus proving that our\nmicroscopic model results in a well-defined macroscopic encounter rate. The\nnumber of unsuccessful contacts before encounter decreases with increasing\nencounter rate and ranges from 20-9000. For all three models, encounter rates\nare obtained within one order of magnitude of the experimentally measured\nassociation rates. Electrostatic steering enhances association up to 50-fold.\nIf diffusional encounter is dominant (p53:MDM2) or similarly important as\nelectrostatic steering (barnase:barstar), then encounter rate decreases with\ndecreasing patch radius. More detailed modeling of protein shapes decreases\nencounter rates by 5-95 percent.

Moreover it allows us to assess different coarse-graining\nstrategies for the future modelling of the dynamics of large protein complexes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Sep 2008 08:14:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Schluttig", "Jakob", "", "1 and 2"], ["Alamanova", "Denitsa", "", "1 and 2"], ["Helms", "Volkhard", "", "1 and 2"], ["Schwarz", "Ulrich S.", "", "1 and 2"]]}, {"id": "0809.4310", "submitter": "Namiko Mitarai", "authors": "Namiko Mitarai, Kim Sneppen, and Steen Pedersen", "title": "Ribosome collisions and Translation efficiency: Optimization by codon\n  usage and mRNA destabilization", "comments": "5 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "J.
