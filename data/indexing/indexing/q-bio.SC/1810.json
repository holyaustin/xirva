With a simple extension of the\nHodgkin-Huxley Markov model we have mainly investigated three types of drug\nblocking mechanisms and showed that the major experimental and physiological\nobservations such as ionic currents, spiking frequency trends, change in action\npotential shape and duration, altered gating dynamics etc due to the presence\nof ion channel blockers can be well reproduced. The nature of action potential\ntermination process in presence of sodium and potassium channel blockers are\ndistinct and physiologically very different from each other. Channel blockers\nhave distinct signatures on ionic currents. In presence of only sodium channel\nblockers the frequency of action potential generation falls off exponentially\nwith increasing drug affinity, whereas in contrast, for only potassium channel\nblockers initially an enhanced spiking activity of action potential is found\nfollowed by a gradual decrease of the spiking frequency as the drug affinity\nincreases. In case of dual type blockers with equal sodium and potassium\nchannel binding affinity, the spiking frequency passes through maxima and\nminima due to the competition between channel number fluctuation and overall\nsodium and potassium conductances. We have found that sodium channel blockers\nshorten the duration of action potential while the potassium channel blockers\ndelay it. We have also shown how the ion channel blockers alter the gating\ndynamics. Some experimental results of ion channel blocking in diverse systems\nhave been validated through our site selected binding scheme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2018 13:39:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Pal", "Krishnendu", ""], ["Gangopadhyay", "Gautam", ""]]}, {"id": "1810.02046", "submitter": "David Sivak", "authors": "Steven Blaber and David A.

The strategy adopted by a protein,\ncalled transcription factor (TF), for searching its specific binding site on\nthe DNA has been investigated over several decades. In recent times the effects\nobstacles, like DNA-binding proteins, on the search by TF has begun to receive\nattention. RNA polymerase (RNAP) motors collectively move along a segment of\nthe DNA during a genomic process called transcription. This RNAP traffic is\nbound to affect the diffusive scanning of the same segment of the DNA by a TF\nsearching for its binding site. Motivated by this phenomenon, here we develop a\nkinetic model where a `particle', that represents a TF, searches for a specific\nsite on a one-dimensional lattice. On the same lattice another species of\nparticles, each representing a RNAP, hop from left to right exactly as in a\ntotally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) which forbids simultaneous\noccupation of any site by more than one particle, irrespective of their\nidentities. Although the TF is allowed to attach to or detach from any lattice\nsite, the RNAPs can attach only to the first site at the left edge and detach\nfrom only the last site on the right edge of the lattice. We formulate the\nsearch as a {\\it first-passage} process; the time taken to reach the target\nsite {\\it for the first time}, starting from a well defined initial state, is\nthe search time. By approximate analytical calculations and Monte Carlo (MC)\ncomputer simulations, we calculate the mean search time. We show that RNAP\ntraffic rectifies the diffusive motion of TF to that of a Brownian ratchet, and\nthe mean time of successful search can be even shorter than that required in\nthe absence of RNAP traffic. Moreover, we show that there is an optimal rate of\ndetachment that corresponds to the shortest mean search time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Oct 2018 05:34:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Soumendu", "", "IIT, Kanpur, India"], ["Mishra", "Bhavya", "", "IIT, Kanpur,\n  India"], ["Kolomeisky", "Anatoly B.", "", "Rice University, Houston, USA"], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", "", "IIT, Kanpur, India"]]}, {"id": "1810.07272", "submitter": "David Holcman", "authors": "Matteo Dora, David Holcman", "title": "Active unidirectional network flow generates a packet molecular\n  transport in cells", "comments": "2 figs", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.other physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Internet, social media, neuronal or blood vessel are organized in complex\nnetworks.

The\nobserved dose-dependent post-treatment dynamics of phase shift variations\ndemonstrated several scenarios of cell death. In particular the phase shift\nincrease at low doses can be associated with apoptosis while its decrease at\nhigh doses can be associated with necrosis. Two cell types were shown to be\ndifferently responsive to treatment at the same doses. Although the sequence of\ndeath scenarios with increasing irradiation dose was demonstrated to be the\nsame, each specific scenario was realized at substantially different doses.\nResults obtained by holographic microscopy were confirmed by confocal\nfluorescence microscopy with the commonly used test assay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Oct 2018 14:43:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Belashov", "A.
