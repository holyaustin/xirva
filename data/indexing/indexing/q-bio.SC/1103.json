We show\nthat bundles can generate forces by a zipping mechanism, which is not limited\nby buckling and operates in the fully buckled state. The critical zipping\nforce, i.e. the maximal force that a bundle can generate, is given by the\nadhesive energy gained during bundle formation. For opposing forces larger than\nthe critical zipping force, bundles undergo a force-induced unbinding\ntransition. For larger bundles, the critical zipping force depends on the\ninitial configuration of the bundles. Our results are corroborated by Monte\nCarlo simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Mar 2011 11:34:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kuehne", "Torsten", ""], ["Lipowsky", "Reinhard", ""], ["Kierfeld", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.1971", "submitter": "Sthitadhi Roy", "authors": "Sthitadhi Roy (IIT, Kanpur)", "title": "Relative velocity of sliding of microtubules by the action of Kinesin-5", "comments": "6 pages Revtex, 5 eps figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Kinesin-5, also known as Eg5 in vertebrates is a processive motor with 4\nheads, which moves on filamentous tracks called microtubules.

Interposed boundaries or insulators\nare able to block these long distance regulatory interactions. The mechanistic\nbasis for insulator activity and how it relates to enhancer\naction-at-a-distance remains unclear. Here we explore the idea that topological\nloops could simultaneously account for regulatory interactions of distal\nenhancers and the insulating activity of boundary elements. We show that while\nloop formation is not in itself sufficient to explain action at a distance,\nincorporating transient non-specific and moderate attractive interactions\nbetween the chromatin fibers strongly enhances long-distance regulatory\ninteractions and is sufficient to generate a euchromatin-like state. Under\nthese same conditions, the subdivision of the loop into two topologically\nindependent loops by insulators inhibits inter-domain interactions. The\nunderlying cause of this effect is a suppression of crossings in the contact\nmap at intermediate distances. Thus our model simultaneously accounts for\nregulatory interactions at a distance and the insulator activity of boundary\nelements. This unified model of the regulatory roles of chromatin loops makes\nseveral testable predictions that could be confronted with \\emph{in vitro}\nexperiments, as well as genomic chromatin conformation capture and fluorescent\nmicroscopic approaches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2011 03:09:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Mukhopadhyay", "Swagatam", ""], ["Schedl", "Paul D.", ""], ["Studitsky", "Vasily M.", ""], ["Sengupta", "Anirvan M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.3606", "submitter": "Simone K\\\"ohler", "authors": "Simone K\\\"ohler, Volker Schaller and Andreas R.
