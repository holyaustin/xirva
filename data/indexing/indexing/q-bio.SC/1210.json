Remarkably, it\nis becoming clear that spatiotemporal correlations between just a few molecules\ncan have profound effects on the signaling behavior of the entire cell. While\nsuch correlations are often explicitly imposed by molecular structures such as\nrafts, clusters, or scaffolds, they also arise intrinsically, due strictly to\nthe small numbers of molecules involved, the finite speed of diffusion, and the\neffects of macromolecular crowding. In this chapter we review examples of both\nexplicitly imposed and intrinsic correlations, focusing on the mechanisms by\nwhich microscopic heterogeneity is amplified to macroscopic effect.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 29 Sep 2012 13:22:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Oct 2012 09:41:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Mugler", "Andrew", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.0168", "submitter": "Sepehr Ehsani", "authors": "Sepehr Ehsani", "title": "Time in the cell: a plausible role for the plasma membrane", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  All cells must keep time to consistently perform vital biological functions.\nTo that end, the coupling and interrelatedness of diverse subsecond events in\nthe complex cellular environment, such as protein folding or translation rates,\ncannot simply result from the chance convergence of the inherent chemical\nproperties of these phenomena, but may instead be synchronized through a\ncell-wide pacemaking mechanism.

In recent\nyears, computational models based on differential equations have become useful\ntools for dissecting and quantifying the complex regulatory relationships\nunderlying the clock's oscillatory dynamics. However, optimizing the large\nparameter sets characteristic of these models places intense demands on both\ncomputational and experimental resources, limiting the scope of in silico\nstudies. Here, we develop an approach based on Boolean logic that dramatically\nreduces the parametrization, making the state and parameter spaces finite and\ntractable. We introduce efficient methods for fitting Boolean models to\nmolecular data, successfully demonstrating their application to synthetic time\ncourses generated by a number of established clock models, as well as\nexperimental expression levels measured using luciferase imaging. Our results\nindicate that despite their relative simplicity, logic models can (i) simulate\ncircadian oscillations with the correct, experimentally observed phase\nrelationships among genes and (ii) flexibly entrain to light stimuli,\nreproducing the complex responses to variations in daylength generated by more\ndetailed differential equation formulations. Our work also demonstrates that\nlogic models have sufficient predictive power to identify optimal regulatory\nstructures from experimental data.
