The role of\nmetabolism, and particularly mitochondria, is increasingly being recognised as\nan important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic\ncells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA\n(mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each\nmolecule can vary. Hence intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is\npossible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may\ndrive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of\nmitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell,\nand mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both\ngenetic and non-genetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype\nlinks. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the\nobservation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (we term\n`microheteroplasmy') and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular\nmtDNA mutation (`macroheteroplasmy'). We point to the relationship between\nmitochondrial supercomplexes, cristal structure, pH and cardiolipin as a\npotential amplifier of the mitochondrial genotype-phenotype link. We also\ndiscuss mitochondrial membrane potential and networks as sources of\nmitochondrial heterogeneity, and their influence upon the mitochondrial genome.\nFinally, we revisit the idea of mitochondrial complementation as a means of\ndampening mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links in light of recent\nexperimental developments.

Their structures share some similarities with photosynthetic antenna\ncomplexes, particularly in the ordered arrangement of photoactive molecules\nwith large transition dipole moments. As the role of photoexcitations in\nmicrotubules remains an open question, here we analyze tryptophan molecules,\nthe amino acid building block of microtubules with the largest transition\ndipole strength. By taking their positions and dipole orientations from\nrealistic models capable of reproducing tubulin experimental spectra, and using\na Hamiltonian widely employed in quantum optics to describe light-matter\ninteractions, we show that such molecules arranged in their native microtubule\nconfiguration exhibit a superradiant ground state, which represents an\nexcitation fully extended on the chromophore lattice. We also show that such a\nsuperradiant ground state emerges due to supertransfer coupling between the\nground states of smaller blocks of the microtubule. In the dynamics we find\nthat the spreading of excitation is ballistic in the absence of external\nsources of disorder and strongly dependent on initial conditions. The velocity\nof photoexcitation spreading is shown to be enhanced by the supertransfer\neffect with respect to the velocity one would expect from the strength of the\nnearest-neighbor coupling between tryptophan molecules in the microtubule.\nFinally, such structures are shown to have an enhanced robustness to static\ndisorder when compared to geometries that include only short-range\ninteractions.

Centrioles, the structural cores of\ncentrosomes and cilia, must duplicate every cell cycle to ensure their faithful\ninheritance through cellular divisions. Work in model organisms identified\nconserved proteins required for centriole duplication and found that altering\ntheir abundance affects centriole number. However, the biophysical principles\nthat ensure that, under physiological conditions, only a single procentriole is\nproduced on each mother centriole remain enigmatic. Here we propose a\nmechanistic biophysical model for the initiation of procentriole formation in\nmammalian cells. The model faithfully recapitulates the experimentally observed\ntransition from PLK4 uniformly distributed around the mother centriole, the\n\"ring\", to a unique PLK4 focus, the \"spot\", that triggers the assembly of a new\nprocentriole. This symmetry breaking requires a dual positive feedback based on\nautocatalytic activation of PLK4 and enhanced centriolar anchoring of PLK4-STIL\ncomplexes by phosphorylated STIL. We find that, contrary to previous proposals,\nin situ degradation of active PLK4 is insufficient to break symmetry. Instead,\nthe model predicts that competition between transient PLK4 activity maxima for\nPLK4-STIL complexes explains both the instability of the PLK4 ring and\nformation of the unique PLK4 spot. In the model, strong competition at\nphysiologically normal parameters robustly produces a single procentriole,\nwhile increasing overexpression of PLK4 and STIL weakens the competition and\ncauses progressive addition of procentrioles in agreement with experimental\nobservations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2018 13:00:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Leda", "Marcin", ""], ["Holland", "Andrew J.", ""], ["Goryachev", "Andrew B.", ""]]}]
