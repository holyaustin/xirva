Here, we propose a new biophysical mechanism that can\nestablish and maintain robust yet plastic epigenetic domains via genomic\nbookmarking (GBM). We model chromatin as a recolourable polymer whose segments\nbear non-permanent histone marks (or colours) which can be modified by \"writer\"\nproteins. The three-dimensional chromatin organisation is mediated by protein\nbridges, or \"readers\", such as Polycomb Repressive Complexes and Transcription\nFactors. The coupling between readers and writers drives spreading of\nbiochemical marks and sustains the memory of local chromatin states across\nreplication and mitosis. In contrast, GBM-targeted perturbations destabilise\nthe epigenetic patterns. Strikingly, we demonstrate that GBM alone can explain\nthe full distribution of Polycomb marks in a whole Drosophila chromosome. We\nfinally suggest that our model provides a starting point for an understanding\nof the biophysics of cellular differentiation and reprogramming.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 10:22:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 17:09:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Michieletto", "Davide", ""], ["Chiang", "Michael", ""], ["Coli", "Davide", ""], ["Papantonis", "Argyris", ""], ["Orlandini", "Enzo", ""], ["Cook", "Peter R.", ""], ["Marenduzzo", "Davide", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.02703", "submitter": "Sami Al-Izzi Mr", "authors": "Sami C.

In order to analyze the\nefficiency of such intracellular search strategies we formulate a random\nvelocity model with intermittent arrest states. We evaluate efficiency in terms\nof mean first passage times for three different, frequently encountered\nintracellular transport tasks: i) the narrow escape problem, which emerges\nduring cargo transport to a synapse or other specific region of the cell\nmembrane, ii) the reaction problem, which considers the binding time of two\nparticles within the cell, and iii) the reaction-escape problem, which arises\nwhen cargo must be released at a synapse only after pairing with another\nparticle. Our results indicate that cells are able to realize efficient search\nstrategies for various intracellular transport tasks economically through a\nspatial cytoskeleton organization that involves only a narrow actin cortex\nrather than a cell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 09:51:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 11:17:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hafner", "Anne E.", ""], ["Rieger", "Heiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.08246", "submitter": "Martin Lenz", "authors": "Martin Lenz", "title": "Extensile actomyosin?", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Living cells move thanks to assemblies of actin filaments and myosin motors\nthat range from very organized striated muscle tissue to disordered\nintracellular bundles.

We find that continuous attractor-based free running clocks, such\nas those found in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus and humans, are\nnearly optimal phase estimators since their flat attractor directions\nefficiently project out light intensity fluctuations due to weather patterns\n(`external noise'). However, such flat directions also make these continuous\nlimit cycle attractors highly vulnerable to diffusive 'internal noise'. Given\nsuch unreliable biochemical hardware, we find that point attractor-based damped\nclocks, such as those found in a smaller cyanobacterium with low protein copy\nnumber, Prochlorococcus marinus, outperform continuous attractor-based clocks.\nBy interpolating between the two types of clocks found in these organisms, we\ndemonstrate a family of biochemical phase estimation strategies that are best\nsuited to different relative strengths of external and internal noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 15:29:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Pittayakanchit", "Weerapat", ""], ["Lu", "Zhiyue", ""], ["Chew", "Justin", ""], ["Rust", "Michael J.", ""], ["Murugan", "Arvind", ""]]}]
