In this\nproof-of-concept study, we explored the pain-relief potential of a pepducin\nseries derived from the first intracellular loop of neurotensin receptor type 1\n(NTS1), a class A GPCR that mediates many of the effects of the neurotensin\n(NT) tridecapeptide, including hypothermia, hypotension and analgesia. We used\nBRET-based biosensors to determine the pepducins' ability to engage G protein\nsignaling pathways associated with NTS1 activation. We observed partial Gq and\nG13 activation at a 10 {\\mu}M concentration, indicating that these pepducins\nmay act as allosteric agonists of NTS1. Additionally, we used surface plasmon\nresonance (SPR) as a label-free assay to monitor pepducin-induced responses in\nCHO-K1 cells stably expressing hNTS1. This whole-cell integrated assay enabled\nus to subdivide our pepducin series into three profile response groups. In\norder to determine the pepducins' antinociceptive potential, we then screened\nthe series in an acute pain model (tail-flick test) by measuring tail\nwithdrawal latencies to a thermal nociceptive stimulus, following intrathecal\npepducin administration (275 nmol/kg). We further evaluated promising pepducins\nin a tonic pain model (formalin test), as well as in neuropathic (Chronic\nConstriction Injury) and inflammatory (Complete Freund's Adjuvant) chronic pain\nmodels. We report one pepducin, PP-001, that consistently reduced rat\nnociceptive behaviors, even in chronic pain paradigm. Altogether, these results\nsuggest that NTS1-derived pepducins may represent a promising strategy in\npain-relief.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Mar 2020 14:57:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 Mar 2020 15:06:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-14", "authors_parsed": [["Brouillette", "Rebecca L.", ""], ["Besserer-Offroy", "\u00c9lie", ""], ["Mona", "Christine E.", ""], ["Chartier", "Magali", ""], ["Lavenus", "Sandrine", ""], ["Sousbie", "Marc", ""], ["Belleville", "Karine", ""], ["Longpr\u00e9", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Marsault", "\u00c9ric", ""], ["Grandbois", "Michel", ""], ["Sarret", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.05515", "submitter": "Sean Lawley", "authors": "Sean D Lawley", "title": "The effects of fast inactivation on conditional first passage times of\n  mortal diffusive searchers", "comments": "24 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The first time a searcher finds a target is called a first passage time\n(FPT).

In this paper,\nwe prove a general theorem which yields an explicit formula for all the moments\nof such conditional FPTs in the fast inactivation limit.
