While numerous experiments have revealed details of\nthe molecular structure and working mechanism of DNAP which consists of both a\npolymerase site and an exonuclease (proofreading) site, there were quite few\ntheoretical studies on the fidelity issue. The first model which explicitly\nconsidered both sites was proposed in 1970s' and the basic idea was widely\naccepted by later models. However, all these models did not systematically and\nrigorously investigate the dominant factor on DNAP fidelity, i.e, the\nhigher-order terminal effects through which the polymerization pathway and the\nproofreading pathway coordinate to achieve high fidelity. In this paper, we\npropose a new and comprehensive kinetic model of DNAP based on some recent\nexperimental observations, which includes previous models as special cases. We\npresent a rigorous and unified treatment of the corresponding steady-state\nkinetic equations of any-order terminal effects, and derive analytical\nexpressions for fidelity in terms of kinetic parameters under bio-relevant\nconditions. These expressions offer new insights on how the the higher-order\nterminal effects contribute substantially to the fidelity in an order-by-order\nway, and also show that the polymerization-and-proofreading mechanism is\ndominated only by very few key parameters. We then apply these results to\ncalculate the fidelity of some real DNAPs, which are in good agreements with\nprevious intuitive estimates given by experimentalists.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 10:06:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 7 May 2016 13:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Song", "Yong-Shun", ""], ["Shu", "Yao-Gen", ""], ["Zhou", "Xin", ""], ["Ou-Yang", "Zhong-Can", ""], ["Li", "Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.03355", "submitter": "Ching-Hao Wang", "authors": "Ching-Hao Wang, Pankaj Mehta, and Michael Elbaum", "title": "A thermodynamic paradigm for solution demixing inspired by nuclear\n  transport in living cells", "comments": "6+9 pages, 4+5 figures, to appear in Phys.

It is known that motor proteins work in teams enabling\nunidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular cargo over long\ndistances. Disruptions of the underlying transport mechanisms, often caused by\nmutations that alter single motor characteristics, are known to cause\nneurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor\ndomain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a\nrecent study of phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating\nlowered single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of\nmutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple\nwild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with altered stall\nforces might determine the average velocity and run-length even when they are\noutnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It is shown that mutants gain\na competitive advantage and lead to an increase in expected run-length when\nload on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a\nmultiple of its stalling force. A separate contribution of this article is the\ndevelopment of a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple\nmotors of multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between\nvarious relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the\ntransition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables exact\ncomputation of average velocity and run-length. It can also be used to\nintroduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation\nand to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by\nmultiple motors.
