There exists an optimal concentration at\nwhich the minimum amount of DNA is ejected from the virus. At lower or higher\nconcentrations, more DNA is ejected from the capsid. We propose that this\nphenomenon is the result of DNA overcharging by Mg$^{+2}$ multivalent\ncounterions. As Mg$^{+2}$ concentration increases from zero, the net charge of\nDNA changes from negative to positive. The optimal inhibition corresponds to\nthe Mg$^{+2}$ concentration where DNA is neutral. At lower/higher\nconcentrations, DNA genome is charged. It prefers to be in solution to lower\nits electrostatic self-energy, which consequently leads to an increase in DNA\nejection. By fitting our theory to available experimental data, the strength of\nDNA$-$DNA short range attraction energies, mediated by Mg$^{+2}$, is found to\nbe $-$0.004 $k_BT$ per nucleotide base. This and other fitted parameters agree\nwell with known values from other experiments and computer simulations. The\nparameters are also in aggreement qualitatively with values for tri- and\ntetra-valent counterions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Nov 2008 21:49:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Nov 2008 21:14:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 14 Jan 2010 20:46:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2010 17:15:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 9 Nov 2010 21:59:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "SeIl", ""], ["Tran", "C.

At the\nheart of our model is the assumption that the rotor protein complex can exist\nin two conformational states corresponding to the two respective rotation\ndirections, and that switching between these states depends on interactions\nwith the stator proteins. This naturally couples the switching dynamics to the\nrotation dynamics, making the switch sensitive to torque and speed. Another key\nelement of our model is that after a switching event, it takes time for the\nload to build up, due to polymorphic transitions of the filament. Our model\npredicts that this slow relaxation dynamics of the filament, in combination\nwith the load dependence of the switching frequency, leads to a characteristic\nswitching time, in agreement with recent observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2008 22:53:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["van Albada", "Siebe B.", ""], ["Tanase-Nicola", "Sorin", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.2791", "submitter": "Anton Zilman", "authors": "Anton Zilman", "title": "Effects of multiple occupancy and inter-particle interactions on\n  selective transport through narrow channels: theory versus experiment", "comments": "27 pages, 6 figures, 1 Appendix, in press in Biophysical Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2008.09.058", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Many biological and artificial transport channels function without direct\ninput of metabolic energy during a transport event and without structural\nrearrangements involving transitions from a 'closed' to an 'open' state.\nNevertheless, such channels are able to maintain efficient and selective\ntransport.
