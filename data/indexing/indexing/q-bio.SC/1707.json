These proteins can form complexes on DNA that\nplay a central role in various biological processes, including chromosome\nsegregation. A prominent example is the large ParB-DNA complex, which forms an\nessential component of the segregation machinery in many bacteria. ChIP-Seq\nexperiments show that ParB proteins localize around centromere-like parS sites\non the DNA to which ParB binds specifically, and spreads from there over large\nsections of the chromosome. Recent theoretical and experimental studies suggest\nthat DNA-bound ParB proteins can interact with each other to condense into a\ncoherent 3D complex on the DNA. However, the structural organization of this\nprotein-DNA complex remains unclear, and a predictive quantitative theory for\nthe distribution of ParB proteins on DNA is lacking. Here, we propose the\nLooping and Clustering (LC) model, which employs a statistical physics approach\nto describe protein-DNA complexes. The LC model accounts for the extrusion of\nDNA loops from a cluster of interacting DNA-bound proteins. Conceptually, the\nstructure of the protein-DNA complex is determined by a competition between\nattractive protein interactions and the configurational and loop entropy of\nthis protein-DNA cluster. Indeed, we show that the protein interaction strength\ndetermines the \"tightness\" of the loopy protein-DNA complex. With this approach\nwe consider the genomic organization of such a protein-DNA cluster around a\nsingle high-affinity binding site. Thus, our model provides a theoretical\nframework to quantitatively compute the binding profiles of ParB-like proteins\naround a cognate (parS) binding site.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 15:28:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Dec 2017 12:59:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Walter", "Jean-Charles", ""], ["Walliser", "Nils-Ole", ""], ["David", "Gabriel", ""], ["Dorignac", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["Geniet", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric", ""], ["Palmeri", "John", ""], ["Parmeggiani", "Andrea", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""], ["Broedersz", "Chase P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.01467", "submitter": "Ammar Tareen", "authors": "Ammar Tareen, Ned S.

When large numbers of such forced filaments interact through the\nsurrounding fluid, as in particular stages of oocyte development in\n$Drosophila~melanogaster$, complex dynamics are observed, but the detailed\nmechanics underlying them has remained unclear. Motivated by these\nobservations, we study here perhaps the simplest model for these phenomena: an\nelastic filament, pinned at one end, acted on by a molecular motor treated as a\npoint force. Because the force acts tangential to the filament, no matter what\nits shape, this \"follower-force\" problem is intrinsically non-variational, and\nthereby differs fundamentally from Euler buckling, where the force has a fixed\ndirection, and which, in the low Reynolds number regime, ultimately leads to a\nstationary, energy-minimizing shape. Through a combination of linear stability\ntheory, analytical study of a solvable simplified \"two-link\" model, and\nnumerical studies of the full elastohydrodynamic equations of motion we\nelucidate the Hopf bifurcation that occurs with increasing forcing of a\nfilament, leading to flapping motion analogous to the high Reynolds number\noscillations of a garden hose with a free end.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 20:04:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["De Canio", "Gabriele", ""], ["Lauga", "Eric", ""], ["Goldstein", "Raymond E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.02908", "submitter": "David Holcman", "authors": "Assaf Amitai and David Holcman", "title": "Encounter time of two loci governed by polymer de-condensation and local\n  chromatin interaction", "comments": "3 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Single IFs span M\\\"uller cells (MC)\nlengthwise; cylindrical bundles of IFs (IFBs) appear inside the cone inner\nsegment (CIS) at the outer limiting membrane (OLM) level. IFBs adjoin the cone\ncytoplasmatic membrane, following lengthwise regularly spaced, forming a\nskeleton of the CIS, located above the OLM. IFBs follow along the cone outer\nsegment (COS), with single IFs separating from the IFB, touching and entering\nin-between the light-sensitive disks of the cone membrane.

This includes excitation transfer in\ndonor-acceptor systems, from the IF donors to the rhodopsin acceptors, with\ntheoretic efficiency over 80%. This explains high image contrast in fovea and\nfoveola in daylight, while the classical mechanism that describes M\\\"uller\ncells as optical lightguides operates in night vision, with loss of resolution\ntraded for sensitivity. Our theory receives strong confirmation in morphology\nand function of the cones and pigment cells. In daylight the lateral surface of\nthe photosensor disks is blocked from the (scattered or oblique) light by the\npigment cells. Thus the light energy can only get to the cone via intermediate\nfilaments that absorb photons in the M\\\"uller cell endfeet and conduct excitons\nto the cone. Thus, the disks are consumed at their lateral surfaces, moving to\nthe apex of the cone, with new disks produced below.
