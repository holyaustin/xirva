We here consider the master\nequation for a gene regulatory feedback loop: a gene produces protein which\nthen binds to the promoter of the same gene and regulates its expression. The\nprotein degrades in its free and bound forms. This network breaks detailed\nbalance and involves a single bimolecular reaction step. We provide an exact\nsolution of the steady-state master equation for arbitrary values of the\nparameters, and present simplified solutions for a number of special cases. The\nfull parametric dependence of the analytical non-equilibrium steady-state\nprobability distribution is verified by direct numerical solution of the master\nequations. For the case where the degradation rate of bound and free protein is\nthe same, our solution is at variance with a previous claim of an exact\nsolution (Hornos et al, Phys. Rev. E {\\bf 72}, 051907 (2005) and subsequent\nstudies). We show explicitly that this is due to an unphysical formulation of\nthe underlying master equation in those studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jun 2012 18:32:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 21:19:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Grima", "R.", ""], ["Schmidt", "D.

Persistent increased activity of the enzyme\nprotein kinase M (PKM) is thought essential for maintaining LTP. Additional\nspatial and temporal features that govern LTP and LTD induction are embodied in\nthe synaptic tagging and capture (STC) and cross capture hypotheses. Only\nsynapses that have been \"tagged\" by an stimulus sufficient for LTP and learning\ncan \"capture\" PKM. A model was developed to simulate the dynamics of key\nmolecules required for LTP and LTD. The model concisely represents\nrelationships between tagging, capture, LTD, and LTP maintenance. The model\nsuccessfully simulated LTP maintained by persistent synaptic PKM, STC, LTD, and\ncross capture, and makes testable predictions concerning the dynamics of PKM.\nThe maintenance of LTP, and consequently of at least some forms of long-term\nmemory, is predicted to require continual positive feedback in which PKM\nenhances its own synthesis only at potentiated synapses. This feedback\nunderlies bistability in the activity of PKM. Second, cross capture requires\nthe induction of LTD to induce dendritic PKM synthesis, although this may\nrequire tagging of a nearby synapse for LTP. The model also simulates the\neffects of PKM inhibition, and makes additional predictions for the dynamics of\nCaM kinases.
