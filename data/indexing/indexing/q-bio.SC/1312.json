Meanwhile, according\nto corresponding experimental data, mathematical relationship between BFM\nmembrane voltage and pH value of the environment, and relationship between\ninternal and external sodium concentrations are given. Therefore, with model\nparameter values obtained by fitting theoretical results of torque-speed\nrelation to recent experimental data, many biophysical properties of bacterial\nflagellar motor can be obtained for any pH values and any external sodium\nconcentrations. Including the rotation speed, stall torque (i.e. the torque\ngenerated by BFM), rotation dispersion, and rotation randomness.

Advances in this direction will improve our\ncomprehension of transport process in the natural intracellular medium, where\nprocessive motor enzymes might operate in crowded conditions.
