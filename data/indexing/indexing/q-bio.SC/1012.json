By using Atomic Force\nMicroscopy (AFM) imaging, we have quantitatively studied the RSC- induced\nmobilization of positioned di- and trinucleosomes as well as the directionality\nof mobilization on mononucleosomal template labeled at one end with\nstreptavidin. AFM imaging showed only a limited set of distinct configurational\nstates for the remodeling products. No stepwise or preferred directionality of\nthe nucleosome motion was observed. Analysis of the corresponding reaction\npathways allows deciphering the mechanistic features of RSC-induced nucleosome\nrelocation. The final outcome of RSC remodeling of oligosome templates is the\npacking of the nucleosomes at the edge of the template, providing large\nstretches of DNA depleted of nucleosomes. This feature of RSC may be used by\nthe cell to overcome the barrier imposed by the presence of nucleosomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Dec 2010 13:28:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Montel", "Fabien", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Castelnovo", "Martin", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Menoni", "Herv\u00e9", "", "LBMC"], ["Angelov", "Dimitar", "", "LBMC"], ["Dimitrov", "St\u00e9fan", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Faivre-Moskalenko", "Cendrine", "", "Phys-ENS"]]}, {"id": "1012.1772", "submitter": "Andrieux David", "authors": "David Andrieux and Pierre Gaspard", "title": "Stochastic approach and fluctuation theorem for ion transport", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J.

The model\nconsidered shares many commons with other recently proposed in the literature,\nwith the addition of direct interaction between motors and motor back steps.\nThe cargo is assumed to follow a continuum Langevin dynamics, while individual\nmotors evolve following a Monte Carlo algorithm based on experimentally\naccessible probabilities for discrete forward and backward jumps, and\nattachment and detachment rates. The links between cargo and motors are\nconsidered as non linear springs. By means of numerical simulations we compute\nthe relevant quantities characterizing the dynamical properties of the system,\nand we compare the results to those for non interacting motors. We find that\ninteractions lead to quite relevant changes in the force-velocity relation for\ncargo, with a considerable reduction of the stall force, and cause also a\nnotable decrease of the run length. These effects are mainly due to\ntraffic-like phenomena in the microtubule. The consideration of several\nparallel tracks for motors reduces such effects. However, we find that for\nrealistic values of the number of motors and the number of tracks, the\ninfluence of interactions on the global parameters of transport of cargo are\nfar from being negligible.
