This downhill\nthermodynamic process from the intact virion toward the empty viral capsid plus\nreleased DNA is made possible by the energy stored during active packaging of\nthe genome into the capsid. Only indirect measurements of this energy have been\navailable until now using either single-molecule or osmotic suppression\ntechniques. In this paper, we describe for the first time the use of isothermal\ntitration calorimetry to directly measure the heat released (or equivalently\nthe enthalpy) during DNA ejection from phage lambda, triggered in solution by a\nsolubilized receptor. Quantitative analyses of the results lead to the\nidentification of thermodynamic determinants associated with DNA ejection. The\nvalues obtained were found to be consistent with those previously predicted by\nanalytical models and numerical simulations. Moreover, the results confirm the\nrole of DNA hydration in the energetics of genome confinement in viral capsids.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 12:20:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Jeembaeva", "Meerim", "", "L.U., CMU"], ["J\u00f6nsson", "B.", "", "L.U."], ["Castelnovo", "Martin", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Evilevitch", "Alex", "", "L.U., CMU"]]}, {"id": "1001.1213", "submitter": "Stephen Pankavich", "authors": "Stephen Pankavich, Yinglong Miao, Jamil Ortoleva, Zeina Shreif, and\n  Peter Ortoleva", "title": "Stochastic Dynamics of Bionanosystems: Multiscale Analysis and\n  Specialized Ensembles", "comments": "24 pages", "journal-ref": "Journal of Chemical Physics 128: 234908, 2008", "doi": "10.1063/1.2931572", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.mes-hall physics.chem-ph q-bio.QM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An approach for simulating bionanosystems, such as viruses and ribosomes, is\npresented. This calibration-free approach is based on an all-atom description\nfor bionanosystems, a universal interatomic force field, and a multiscale\nperspective. The supramillion-atom nature of these bionanosystems prohibits the\nuse of a direct molecular dynamics approach for phenomena like viral structural\ntransitions or self-assembly that develop over milliseconds or longer. A key\nelement of these multiscale systems is the cross-talk between, and consequent\nstrong coupling of, processes over many scales in space and time. We elucidate\nthe role of interscale cross-talk and overcome bionanosystem simulation\ndifficulties with automated construction of order parameters (OPs) describing\nsupra-nanometer scale structural features, construction of OP dependent\nensembles describing the statistical properties of atomistic variables that\nultimately contribute to the entropies driving the dynamics of the OPs, and the\nderivation of a rigorous equation for the stochastic dynamics of the OPs. Since\nthe atomic scale features of the system are treated statistically, several\nensembles are constructed that reflect various experimental conditions. The\ntheory provides a basis for a practical, quantitative bionanosystem modeling\napproach that preserves the cross-talk between the atomic and nanoscale\nfeatures. A method for integrating information from nanotechnical experimental\ndata in the derivation of equations of stochastic OP dynamics is also\nintroduced.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Jan 2010 07:57:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Pankavich", "Stephen", ""], ["Miao", "Yinglong", ""], ["Ortoleva", "Jamil", ""], ["Shreif", "Zeina", ""], ["Ortoleva", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3845", "submitter": "Gerardo Aquino", "authors": "Gerardo Aquino and Robert G.
