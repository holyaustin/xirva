However, it remains\npoorly understood how the dynamic interplay of these components and the cell\npolarity determine the emergent migration behavior at the cellular scale. Here,\nwe employ a data-driven theoretical approach to develop a mechanistic model for\nconfined cell migration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining\ngeometries. Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus\nmigration trajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically\ndetermine a model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity,\nprotrusions, and nucleus. Our model indicates that the cellular dynamics adapt\nto confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from a\nnegative to a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. This feedback loop\nleads to stereotypical cycles of protrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the\nmigration of the cell through constrictions. Our data-driven theoretical\napproach therefore identifies polarity feedback adaptation as a key mechanism\nin confined cell migration.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jun 2021 08:26:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00fcckner", "David B.", ""], ["Schmitt", "Matthew", ""], ["Fink", "Alexandra", ""], ["Flommersfeld", "Johannes", ""], ["Arlt", "Nicolas", ""], ["Hannezo", "Edouard", ""], ["R\u00e4dler", "Joachim O.", ""], ["Broedersz", "Chase P.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.03902", "submitter": "Rodrigo Felipe De Oliveira Pena", "authors": "Cesar C.

These currents are characterized by two main properties:\nconductance and kinetics. The hyperpolarization-activated current ($I_{\\rm h}$)\nstrongly modulates subthreshold potential changes by shortening the excitatory\npostsynaptic potentials and decreasing their temporal summation. Whereas the\nshortening of the synaptic potentials caused by the $I_{\\rm h}$ conductance is\nwell understood, the role of the $I_{\\rm h}$ kinetics remains unclear. Here, we\nuse a model of the $I_{\\rm h}$ current model with either fast or slow kinetics\nto determine its influence on the membrane time constant ($\\tau_m$) of a CA1\npyramidal cell model. Our simulation results show that the $I_{\\rm h}$ with\nfast kinetics decreases $\\tau_m$ and attenuates and shortens the excitatory\npostsynaptic potentials more than the slow $I_{\\rm h}$. We conclude that the\n$I_{\\rm h}$ activation kinetics is able to modulate $\\tau_m$ and the temporal\nproperties of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 pyramidal\ncells. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which $I_{\\rm h}$ kinetics\ncontrols $\\tau_m$, we propose a new concept called \"time scaling factor\".
