The lipid molecules that form membranes contain both\npermanent and induced dipoles, and an electric field can induce the formation\nof pores when the transverse field is sufficiently strong (electroporation).\nHere, a phenomenological free energy is constructed to model the response of a\nBLM to a transverse static electric field. The model contains a continuum\ndescription of the membrane dipoles and a coupling between the headgroup\ndipoles and the membrane tilt. The membrane is found to become unstable through\nbuckling modes, which are weakly coupled to thickness fluctuations in the\nmembrane. The thickness fluctuations, along with the increase in interfacial\narea produced by membrane buckling, increase the probability of localized\nmembrane breakdown, which may lead to pore formation. The instability is found\nto depend strongly on the strength of the coupling between the dipolar\nheadgroups and the membrane tilt as well as the degree of dipolar ordering in\nthe membrane.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 11:50:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 10:57:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bingham", "Richard J.", ""], ["Olmsted", "Peter D.", ""], ["Smye", "Stephen W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1159", "submitter": "Igor Kulic", "authors": "Herve Mohrbach, Albert Johner and Igor M.
