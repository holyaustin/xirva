We quantify the effect of the various different competing processes\nin terms of non-equilibrium phase diagrams. The interplay of interconversion\nrates, which allow for flux reversal and evaporation/deposition processes\nintroduce qualitatively new features in the phase diagrams. We observe regimes\nof three-phase coexistence, the possibility of phase re-entrance and a\nsignificant flexibility in how the different phase boundaries shift in response\nto changes in control parameters. The moving steady state solutions of this\nmodel allows for different possibilities for the spatial distribution of cargo\nvesicles, ranging from homogeneous distribution of vesicles to polarized\ndistributions, characterized by inhomogeneities or {\\it shocks}.

Annexin A2 forms heterotetramers (Anx A2t) with the\nS100A10 (p11) protein dimer. The tetramer is capable of bridging phospholipid\nmembranes and it has been suggested to play a role in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis\nand cell-cell adhesion of metastatic cells. Here, we employ x-ray reflectivity\nmeasurements to resolve the conformation of Anx A2t upon Ca2+-dependent binding\nto single supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) composed of different mixtures of\nanionic (POPS) and neutral (POPC) phospholipids. Based on our results we\npropose that Anx A2t binds in a side-by-side configuration, i.e., both Anx A2\nmonomers bind to the bilayer with the p11 dimer positioned on top. Furthermore,\nwe observe a strong decrease of lipid mobility upon binding of Anx A2t to SLBs\nwith varying POPS content. X-ray reflectivity measurements indicate that\nbinding of Anx A2t also increases the density of the SLB. Interestingly, in the\nprotein-facing leaflet of the SLB the lipid density is higher than in the\nsubstrate-facing leaflet. This asymmetric densification of the lipid bilayer by\nAnx A2t and Ca2+ might have important implications for the biochemical\nmechanism of Anx A2t-induced endo- and exocytosis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 16 Sep 2010 12:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fritz", "Kirstin", ""], ["Fritz", "Georg", ""], ["Windschiegl", "Barbara", ""], ["Steinem", "Claudia", ""], ["Nickel", "Bert", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.4167", "submitter": "Giovanni Meacci", "authors": "Elisabeth Fischer-Friedrich, Giovanni Meacci, Joe Lutkenhaus, Hugues\n  Chate, and Karsten Kruse", "title": "Intra- and intercellular fluctuations in Min-protein dynamics decrease\n  with cell length", "comments": "Article and Supplementary Information: 26 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": "PNAS (2010) 107 6134-6139", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.0911708107", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Self-organization of proteins in space and time is of crucial importance for\nthe functioning of cellular processes.

We propose a conceptual explanation of this finding and illustrate it\nusing a simple model in which metabolic and regulatory networks of prokaryotes\nare shaped by horizontal gene transfer of coregulated metabolic pathways.\nAdapting to a new environmental condition monitored by a new transcription\nfactor (e.g., learning to use another nutrient) involves both acquiring new\nenzymes and reusing some of the enzymes already encoded in the genome. As the\nrepertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse\nits enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each\nnew task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of\nfunctional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the\ntotal number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because\nof a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its\nregulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple\nmodels of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and\nreproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling. The distribution of\nlengths of pathway branches in our model agrees with that of the real-life\nmetabolic network of Escherichia coli. Thus, our model provides a qualitative\nexplanation for broad distributions of regulon sizes in prokaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Sep 2010 20:43:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-24", "authors_parsed": [["Maslov", "Sergei", ""], ["Krishna", "Sandeep", ""], ["Pang", "Tin Yau", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}]
