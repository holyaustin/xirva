The\nstandard model of aster growth assumes a fixed number of microtubules\noriginating from the centrosomes. However, aster morphology in this model does\nnot scale with cell size, and we recently found evidence for non-centrosomal\nmicrotubule nucleation. Here, we combine autocatalytic nucleation and\npolymerization dynamics to develop a biophysical model of aster growth. Our\nmodel predicts that asters expand as traveling waves and recapitulates all\nmajor aspects of aster growth. As the nucleation rate increases, the model\npredicts an explosive transition from stationary to growing asters with a\ndiscontinuous jump of the growth velocity to a nonzero value. Experiments in\nfrog egg extract confirm the main theoretical predictions. Our results suggest\nthat asters observed in large frog and amphibian eggs are a meshwork of short,\nunstable microtubules maintained by autocatalytic nucleation and provide a\nparadigm for the assembly of robust and evolvable polymer networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 15:49:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ishihara", "Keisuke", ""], ["Korolev", "Kirill S.", ""], ["Mitchison", "Timothy J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.10035", "submitter": "Serge Dmitrieff", "authors": "Serge Dmitrieff, Adolfo Alsina, Aastha Mathur, Fran\\c{c}ois\n  N\\'ed\\'elec", "title": "Balance of microtubule stiffness and cortical tension determines the\n  size of blood cells with marginal band across species", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fast blood stream of animals is associated with large shear stresses.\nConsequently, blood cells have evolved a special morphology and a specific\ninternal architecture allowing them to maintain their integrity over several\nweeks. For instance, non-mammalian red blood cells, mammalian erythroblasts and\nplatelets have a peripheral ring of microtubules, called the marginal band,\nthat flattens the overall cell morphology by pushing on the cell cortex. In\nthis article, we model how the shape of these cells stems from the balance\nbetween marginal band elasticity and cortical tension. We predict that the\ndiameter of the cell scales with the total microtubule polymer, and verify the\npredicted law across a wide range of species. Our analysis also shows that the\ncombination of the marginal band rigidity and cortical tension increases the\nability of the cell to withstand forces without deformation. Finally, we model\nthe marginal band coiling that occurs during the disc-to-sphere transition\nobserved for instance at the onset of blood platelet activation. We show that\nwhen cortical tension increases faster than crosslinkers can unbind, the\nmarginal band will coil, whereas if the tension increases slower, the marginal\nband may shorten as microtubules slide relative to each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 18:00:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 12:05:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Dmitrieff", "Serge", ""], ["Alsina", "Adolfo", ""], ["Mathur", "Aastha", ""], ["N\u00e9d\u00e9lec", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}]
