However, many cellular cargos are\nobserved to move bidirectionally, involving both plus-end and minus-end\ndirected motors. The presumably simplest mechanism for such bidirectional\ntransport is provided by a tug-of-war between the two motor species. This\nmechanism is studied theoretically using the load-dependent transport\nproperties of individual motors as measured in single-molecule experiments. In\ncontrast to previous expectations, such a tug-of-war is found to be highly\ncooperative and to exhibit seven different motility regimes depending on the\nprecise values of the single motor parameters.

Although scaffolds are widely believed\nto have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms\nthat underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo\nsimulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal\ncharacteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of\nscaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing\nkinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate\nthat a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is\nto control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time.\nScaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases\nto become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at\nboth early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal\nsignal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which\nkinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism\nthat describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a\nscaffold mediated protein kinase cascade.
