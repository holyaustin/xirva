By further analyzing the\nstatics of filaments inside membrane tubes, and through computer simulations\nthat capture membrane and filament fluctuations, we show under which conditions\nfilopodia of arbitrary lengths are stable.

We analyze relevant experiments\nand find that they are in quantitative accordance with the fast initial modes\nof spreading, but not with the slow propagating front.

Unlike regular enveloped\nviruses, retrovirus budding happens {\\em concurrently} with the self-assembly\nof retrovirus protein subunits (Gags) into spherical virus capsids on the cell\nmembrane. Led by this unique budding and assembly mechanism, we study the free\nenergy profile of retrovirus budding, taking into account of the Gag-Gag\nattraction energy and the membrane elastic energy. We find that if the Gag-Gag\nattraction is strong, budding always proceeds to completion. During early stage\nof budding, the zenith angle of partial budded capsids, $\\alpha$, increases\nwith time as $\\alpha \\propto t^{1/3}$. However, when Gag-Gag attraction is\nweak, a metastable state of partial budding appears. The zenith angle of these\npartially spherical capsids is given by\n$\\alpha_0\\simeq(\\tau^2/\\kappa\\sigma)^{1/4}$ in a linear approximation, where\n$\\kappa$ and $\\sigma$ are the bending modulus and the surface tension of the\nmembrane, and $\\tau$ is a line tension of the capsid proportional to the\nstrength of Gag-Gag attraction. Numerically, we find $\\alpha_0<0.3\\pi$ without\nany approximations. Using experimental parameters, we show that HIV budding and\nassembly always proceed to completion in normal biological conditions. On the\nother hand, by changing Gag-Gag interaction strength or membrane rigidity, it\nis relatively easy to tune it back and forth between complete budding and\npartial budding.

Inspired by an\ninsight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda\ngenetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification\nof generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of\nstochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the\npotential function $\\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix\n$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is\nthen precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or\nnot it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear.

One important and persistent question\nis the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with\nmultiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state\nproperties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into\nstochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global\noptimization potential function. First, we provide the construction.
