Here, we investigate how plus-end-directed\ndepolymerases of the kinesin-8 family regulate MT depolymerization dynamics.\nEmploying an individual-based model, we reproduce experimental findings.\nMoreover, crowding is identified as the key regulatory mechanism of\ndepolymerization dynamics. Our analysis gives two qualitatively distinct\nregimes. For motor densities above a particular threshold, a macroscopic\ntraffic jam emerges at the plus-end and the MT dynamics become independent of\nthe motor concentration. Below this threshold, microscopic traffic jams at the\ntip arise which cancel out the effect of the depolymerization kinetics such\nthat the depolymerization speed is solely determined by the motor density.\nBecause this density changes over the MT length, length-dependent regulation is\npossible. Remarkably, motor cooperativity does not affect the depolymerization\nspeed but only the end-residence time of depolymerases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Sep 2011 12:38:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Sep 2011 08:56:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Nov 2011 16:57:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Reese", "Louis", ""], ["Melbinger", "Anna", ""], ["Frey", "Erwin", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1495", "submitter": "Carlo Amoruso Mr", "authors": "Carlo Amoruso, Thibault Lagache, David Holcman", "title": "Modeling the early steps of cytoplasmic trafficking in viral infection\n  and gene delivery", "comments": "31 pages, 11 figures.

These intracellular particles can be found in four different modes of\n(undirected and directed) motion and can fuse with other vesicles. While the\nsize of vesicles follows a log-normal distribution that changes over time due\nto fusion processes, their spatial distribution gives rise to distinct\npatterns. Their occurrence depends on the concentration of proteins which are\nsynthesized based on the transcriptional activities of some genes. Hence,\ndifferences in these spatio-temporal vesicle patterns allow indirect\nconclusions about the (unknown) impact of these genes.\n  By means of agent-based computer simulations we are able to reproduce such\npatterns on real temporal and spatial scales. Our modeling approach is based on\nBrownian agents with an internal degree of freedom, $\\theta$, that represents\nthe different modes of motion. Conditions inside the cell are modeled by an\neffective potential that differs for agents dependent on their value $\\theta$.\nAgent's motion in this effective potential is modeled by an overdampted\nLangevin equation, changes of $\\theta$ are modeled as stochastic transitions\nwith values obtained from experiments, and fusion events are modeled as\nspace-dependent stochastic transitions. Our results for the spatio-temporal\nvesicle patterns can be used for a statistical comparison with experiments.

On\nthe other hand, we show how adjusting reaction rates and substrate amounts may\nlead to higher degrees of ultrasensitivity in intermediate layers.
