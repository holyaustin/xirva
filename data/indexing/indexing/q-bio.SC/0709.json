This endogenous network forms a nonlinear\nstochastic dynamical system, with many stable attractors in its functional\nlandscape. Normal or abnormal robust states can be decided by this network in a\nmanner similar to the neural network. In this context cancer is hypothesized as\none of its robust intrinsic states. This hypothesis implies that a nonlinear\nstochastic mathematical cancer model is constructible based on available\nexperimental data and its quantitative prediction is directly testable. Within\nsuch model the genesis and progression of cancer may be viewed as stochastic\ntransitions between different attractors. Thus it further suggests that\nprogressions are not arbitrary. Other important issues on cancer, such as\ngenetic vs epigenetics, double-edge effect, dormancy, are discussed in the\nlight of present hypothesis. A different set of strategies for cancer\nprevention, cure, and care, is therefore suggested.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2007 14:49:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ao", "P.", ""], ["Galas", "D.", ""], ["Hood", "L.", ""], ["Zhu", "X. -M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.0561", "submitter": "Leonard Harris", "authors": "Leonard A.

However, few\npractical applications of leaping have appeared in the literature to date.\nHere, we address this issue using the \"partitioned leaping algorithm\" (PLA)\n[L.A. Harris and P. Clancy, J. Chem. Phys. 125, 144107 (2006)], a\nrecently-introduced multiscale leaping approach. We use the PLA to investigate\nstochastic effects in two model biochemical reaction networks. The networks\nthat we consider are simple enough so as to be accessible to our intuition but\nsufficiently complex so as to be generally representative of real biological\nsystems. We demonstrate how the PLA allows us to quantify subtle effects of\nstochasticity in these systems that would be difficult to ascertain otherwise\nas well as not-so-subtle behaviors that would strain commonly-used \"exact\"\nstochastic methods. We also illustrate bottlenecks that can hinder the approach\nand exemplify and discuss possible strategies for overcoming them. Overall, our\naim is to aid and motivate future applications of leaping by providing stark\nillustrations of the benefits of the method while at the same time elucidating\nobstacles that are often encountered in practice.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Sep 2007 02:33:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 9 Dec 2008 21:45:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2009 03:41:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Harris", "Leonard A.", ""], ["Piccirilli", "Aaron M.", ""], ["Majusiak", "Emily R.", ""], ["Clancy", "Paulette", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1800", "submitter": "Debashish Chowdhury", "authors": "Debashish Chowdhury", "title": "Molecular motors: design, mechanism and control", "comments": "11 pages, including 8 embedded EPS figures; Invited article, accepted\n  for Publication in \"Computing in Science and Engineering\" (AIP & IEEE)", "journal-ref": "COMPUTING in SCIENCE and ENGINEERING (AIP and IEEE),\n  vol.10(2),70-77 (2008).", "doi": "10.1109/MCSE.2008.58", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.pop-ph q-bio.SC", "license": null, "abstract": "  Biological functions in each animal cell depend on coordinated operations of\na wide variety of molecular motors.

Experiments have shown that,\nfollowing non-specific binding to the surface of a microtubule, depolymerizers\nare transported to the microtubule tip(s) by diffusion or directed walk and,\nthen, depolymerize the microtubule from the tip(s) after accumulating there. We\ndevelop a quantitative model to study the depolymerizing action of such a\ngeneric motor protein, and its possible effects on the length distribution of\nmicrotubules. We show that, when the motor protein concentration in solution\nexceeds a critical value, a steady state is reached where the length\ndistribution is, in general, non-monotonic with a single peak. However, for\nhighly processive motors and large motor densities, this distribution\neffectively becomes an exponential decay. Our findings suggest that such motor\nproteins may be selectively used by the cell to ensure precise control of MT\nlengths. The model is also used to analyze experimental observations of\nmotor-induced depolymerization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2007 17:13:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2007 12:58:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2008 11:50:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 8 Jul 2008 10:01:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Govindan", "Bindu S.", "", "HRI, Allahabad"], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", "", "HRI, Allahabad"], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", "", "IIT Kanpur"]]}, {"id": "0709.3759", "submitter": "Thomas R.
