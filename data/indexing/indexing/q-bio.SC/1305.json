Finding a\nnovel way to inhibit PfAQP, I conducted 3+ microseconds in silico experiments\nof an atomistic model of the PfAQP-membrane system and computed the\nchemical-potential profiles of six permeants (erythritol, water, glycerol,\nurea, ammonia, and ammonium) that can be efficiently transported across P.\nfalciparum's plasma membrane through PfAQP's conducting pore. The profiles show\nthat, with all the existent in vitro data being supportive, erythritol, a\npermeant of PfAQP itself having a deep ditch in its permeation passageway,\nstrongly inhibits PfAQP's functions of transporting water, glycerol, urea,\nammonia, and ammonium (The IC50 is in the range of high nanomolars). This\nsuggests the possibility that erythritol, a sweetener generally considered\nsafe, may be the drug needed to kill the malarial parasite in vivo without\ncausing serious side effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 May 2013 18:14:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 21:35:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Liao Y.", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.2149", "submitter": "Oded Farago", "authors": "Nadiv Dharan, Oded Farago", "title": "Muscle contraction and the elasticity-mediated crosstalk effect", "comments": "Accepted for publication in PRE", "journal-ref": "Phys.

One possible regulator of motor coordination is the\nelasticity-mediated crosstalk (EMC) coupling between myosin II motors whose\norigin is the tensile stress that they collectively generate in actin\nfilaments. Here, we use a statistical mechanical analysis to investigate the\ninfluence of the EMC effect on the sarcomere - the basic contractile unit of\nskeletal muscles. We demonstrate that the EMC effect leads to an increase in\nthe attachment probability of motors located near the end of the sarcomere\nwhile, simultaneously, decreasing the attachment probability of the motors in\nthe central part. Such a polarized attachment probability would impair the\nmotors ability to cooperate efficiently. Interestingly, this undesired\nphenomenon becomes significant only when the system size exceeds that of the\nsarcomere in skeletal muscles, which provides an explanation for the remarkable\nlack of sarcomere variability in vertebrates. Another phenomenon that we\ninvestigate is the recently observed increase in the duty ratio of the motors\nwith the tension in muscle. We reveal that the celebrated Hill's equation for\nmuscle contraction is very closely related to this observation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2013 17:08:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-15", "authors_parsed": [["Dharan", "Nadiv", ""], ["Farago", "Oded", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.2677", "submitter": "Ralf Metzler", "authors": "Otto Pulkkinen and Ralf Metzler", "title": "Distance matters: the impact of gene proximity in bacterial gene\n  regulation", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures; Supplementary material contained in the source\n  files", "journal-ref": "Phys Rev Lett 110, 198101 (2013)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.198101", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Following recent discoveries of colocalization of downstream-regulating genes\nin living cells, the impact of the spatial distance between such genes on the\nkinetics of gene product formation is increasingly recognized.

Currently, science has been established about its cellular structures,\nits metabolic processes, and even the molecular structures of its intrinsic\nmembrane proteins responsible for transporting water, nutrient, and waste\nmolecules across the parasite plasma membrane (PPM). I hypothesize that\nPlasmodium falciparum has an Achilles' heel that can be attacked with\nerythritol, the well-known sweetener that is classified as generally safe. Most\norganisms have in their cell membrane two types of water-channel proteins:\naquaporins to maintain hydro-homeostasis across the membrane and\naquaglyceroporins to uptake glycerols etc. In contrast, P. falciparum has only\none type of such proteins---the multi-functional aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP)\nexpressed in the PPM---to do both jobs. Moreover, the parasite also uses PfAQP\nto excrete its metabolic wastes (ammonia included) produced at a very high rate\nin the blood stage. This extremely high efficiency of the bug using one protein\nfor multiple essential tasks makes the parasite fatally vulnerable. Erythritol\nin the blood stream can kill the parasite by clogging up its PfAQP channel that\nneeds to be open for maintaining hydro-homeostasis and for excreting toxic\nwastes across the bug's PPM. In vitro tests are to measure the growth/death\nrate of P. falciparum in blood with various erythritol concentrations. In vivo\nexperiments are to administer groups of infected mice with various doses of\nerythritol and monitor the parasite growth levels from blood samples drawn from\neach group. Clinic trials can be performed to observe the added effects of\nadministering to patients erythritol along with the known drugs because\nerythritol was classified as a safe food ingredient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 May 2013 21:01:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Liao Y", ""]]}]
