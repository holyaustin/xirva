Although many\nexperimental studies make it clear that viruses are parasitic entities that\nhijack the host's molecular resources, a detailed estimate for the energetic\ncost of viral synthesis is largely lacking. To quantify the energetic cost of\nviruses to their hosts, we enumerated the costs associated with two very\ndistinct but representative DNA and RNA viruses, namely T4 and influenza. We\nfound that for these viruses, translation of viral proteins is the most\nenergetically expensive process. Interestingly, the cost of building a T4 phage\nand a single influenza virus are nearly the same. Due to influenza's higher\nburst size, however, the overall cost of a T4 phage infection is only 2-3% of\nthe cost of an influenza infection. The costs of these infections relative to\ntheir host's estimated energy budget during the infection reveal that a T4\ninfection consumes about a third of its host's energy budget, where as an\ninfluenza infection consumes only 1%. Building on our estimates for T4, we show\nhow the energetic costs of double-stranded DNA viruses scale with virus size,\nrevealing that the dominant cost of building a virus can switch from\ntranslation to genome replication above a critical virus size. Lastly, using\nour predictions for the energetic cost of viruses, we provide estimates for the\nstrengths of selection and genetic drift acting on newly incorporated genetic\nelements in viral genomes, under conditions of energy limitation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 22:09:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Mahmoudabadi", "Gita", ""], ["Milo", "Ron", ""], ["Phillips", "Rob", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.03476", "submitter": "Dhananjay Suresh", "authors": "R Srikar, Dhananjay Suresh, Ajit Zambre, Kristen Taylor, Sarah\n  Chapman, Matthew Leevy, Anandhi Upendran, Raghuraman Kannan", "title": "Targeted nanoconjugate co-delivering siRNA and tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n  to KRAS mutant NSCLC dissociates GAB1-SHP2 post oncogene knockdown", "comments": "14 pages, 9 figures, research article", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports 6, Article number: 30245 (2016)", "doi": "10.1038/srep30245", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  A tri-block nanoparticle (TBN) comprising of an enzymatically cleavable\nporous gelatin nanocore encapsulated with gefitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor\n(TKI)) and surface functionalized with cetuximab-siRNA conjugate has been\nsynthesized.

The SAC delays mitotic progression by preventing activation of\nthe ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) or cyclosome; whose\nactivation by Cdc20 is required for sister-chromatid separation marking the\ntransition into anaphase. The mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which contains\nCdc20 as a subunit, binds stably to the APC/C. Compelling evidence by Izawa and\nPines (Nature 2014; 10.1038/nature13911) indicates that the MCC can inhibit a\nsecond Cdc20 that has already bound and activated the APC/C. Whether or not MCC\nper se is sufficient to fully sequester Cdc20 and inhibit APC/C remains\nunclear. Here, a dynamic model for SAC regulation in which the MCC binds a\nsecond Cdc20 was constructed. This model is compared to the MCC, and the\nMCC-and-BubR1 (dual inhibition of APC) core model variants and subsequently\nvalidated with experimental data from the literature. By using ordinary\nnonlinear differential equations and spatial simulations, it is shown that the\nSAC works sufficiently to fully sequester Cdc20 and completely inhibit APC/C\nactivity.

We encounter two types of icosahedral solidification transitions.\nThe first type is a conventional first-order phase transition from the uniform\nto the icosahedral state. It can be described by a single icosahedral spherical\nharmonic of even $l$. The chiral pseudo-scalar term in the free energy creates\nsecondary terms with chiral character but it does not affect the thermodynamics\nof the transition. The second type, associated with icosahedral spherical\nharmonics with odd $l$, is anomalous. Pure odd $l$ icosahedral states are\nunstable but stability is recovered if admixture with the neighboring $l+1$\nicosahedral spherical harmonic is included, generated by the non-linear terms.\nThis is in conflict with the principle of Landau theory that symmetry-breaking\ntransitions are characterized by only a \\textit{single} irreducible\nrepresentation of the symmetry group of the uniform phase and we argue that\nthis principle should be removed from Landau theory. The chiral term now\ndirectly affects the transition because it lifts the degeneracy between two\nisomeric mixed-$l$ icosahedral states. A direct transition is possible only\nover a limited range of parameters. Outside this range, non-icosahedral states\nintervene.

The currently\naccepted physical model of transcription predicts the existence of a physical\nlimit on the maximal rate of transcription, which does not depend on the\ntranscribed gene. This limit appears as a result of polymerase \"traffic jams\"\nforming in the bulk of the 1D DNA chain at high polymerase concentrations.\nRecent experiments have, for the first time, allowed one to access live gene\nexpression dynamics in the Drosophila fly embryo in vivo under the conditions\nof heavy polymerase load and test the predictions of the model. Our analysis of\nthe data shows that the maximal rate of transcription is indeed the same for\nthe Hunchback, Snail and Knirps gap genes, and modified gene constructs in\nnuclear cycles 13, 14, but the experimentally observed value of the maximal\ntranscription rate corresponds to only 40 % of the one predicted by this model.\nWe argue that such a decrease must be due to a slower polymerase elongation\nrate in the vicinity of the promoter region. This effectively shifts the\nbottleneck of transcription from the bulk to the promoter region of the gene.\nWe suggest a quantitative explanation of the difference by taking into account\nabortive transcription initiation. Our calculations based on the independently\nmeasured abortive initiation constant in vitro confirm this hypothesis and find\nquantitative agreement with MS2 fluorescence live imaging data in the early\nfruit fly embryo. If our explanation is correct, then the transcription rate\ncannot be increased by replacing \"slow codons\" in the bulk with synonymous\ncodons, and experimental efforts must be focused on the promoter region\ninstead.
