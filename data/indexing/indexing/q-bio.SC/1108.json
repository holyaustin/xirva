The GTP cap model has been proposed to\ninterpret the stabilizing mechanism of microtubule growth from the view of\nhydrolysis effects. Besides, the microtubule growth involves the closure of a\ncurved sheet at its growing end. The curvature conversion also helps to\nstabilize the successive growth, and the curved sheet is referred to as the\nconformational cap. However, there still lacks theoretical investigation on the\nmechanical-chemical coupling growth process of microtubules. In this paper, we\nstudy the growth mechanisms of microtubules by using a coarse-grained molecular\nmethod. Firstly, the closure process involving a sheet-to-tube transition is\nsimulated. The results verify the stabilizing effect of the sheet structure,\nand the minimum conformational cap length that can stabilize the growth is\ndemonstrated to be two dimers. Then, we show that the conformational cap can\nfunction independently of the GTP cap, signifying the pivotal role of\nmechanical factors. Furthermore, based on our theoretical results, we describe\na Tetris-like growth style of microtubules: the stochastic tubulin assembly is\nregulated by energy and harmonized with the seam zipping such that the sheet\nkeeps a practically constant length during growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Aug 2011 10:45:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Ji", "Xiang-Ying", ""], ["Feng", "Xi-Qiao", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1924", "submitter": "Yunxin Zhang", "authors": "Yunxin Zhang", "title": "Phenomenological analysis of ATP dependence of motor protein", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0032717", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph math-ph math.MP q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, through phenomenological comparison of the velocity-force data\nof processive motor proteins, including conventional kinesin, cytoplasmic\ndynein and myosin V, we found that, the ratio between motor velocities of two\ndifferent ATP concentrations is almost invariant for any substall, superstall\nor negative external loads. Therefore, the velocity of motor can be well\napproximated by a Michaelis-Menten like formula $V=\\atp k(F)L/(\\atp +K_M)$,\nwith $L$ the step size, and $k(F)$ the external load $F$ dependent rate of one\nmechanochemical cycle of motor motion in saturated ATP solution. The difference\nof Michaelis-Menten constant $K_M$ for substall, superstall and negative\nexternal load indicates, the ATP molecule affinity of motor head for these\nthree cases are different, though the expression of $k(F)$ as a function of $F$\nmight be unchanged for any external load $F$.
