Local fluctuations in the number of\ncalcium ions play a crucial role in the onset of these features. Previous\nmodeling studies of calcium puff dynamics stemming from IP$_3$R channels have\npredominantly focused on stochastic channel models coupled to deterministic\ndiffusion of ions, thereby neglecting local fluctuations of the ion number.\nTracking of individual ions is computationally difficult due to the scale\nseparation in the Ca$^{2+}$ concentration when channels are in the open or\nclosed states. In this paper, a spatial multiscale model for investigating of\nthe dynamics of puffs is presented. It couples Brownian motion (diffusion) of\nions with a stochastic channel gating model. The model is used to analyze\ncalcium puff statistics. Concentration time traces as well as channel state\ninformation are studied. We identify the regime in which puffs can be found and\ndevelop a mean-field theory to extract the boundary of this regime.

It argues that two ideas have been missing. One\nis that oscillation is necessary to achieve the necessary design stability and\nplasticity. The other is that the system must be tuned to criticality to\nstabilize the propagation velocity, thus enabling clocks to function as meter\nsticks. The broader significance is twofold: First, a fundamental piece of the\nmachinery of life is probably invisible to present-day biochemical methods\nbecause they are too slow.
