Two factors impeded the\ndevelopment of such mechanisms: first, a high (room) temperature of a cellular\nenvironment, where a weak, static magnetic field induces a tiny (classically\nzero) equilibrium response. Second, the friction in the cellular environment is\nvery large, preventing a weak field to alter non-equilibrium processes such as\na free diffusion of charges. Here we study a class of non-equilibrium steady\nstates of a cellular ion in a confining potential, where the response to a\n(weak, homogeneous, static) magnetic field survives strong friction and thermal\nfluctuations. The magnetic field induces a rotational motion of the ion that\nproceeds with the cyclotron frequency. In particular, such non-equilibrium\nstates are generated by a white noise acting on the ion additionally to the\n(non-local) friction and noise generated by an equilibrium thermal bath.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jan 2021 16:23:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Matevosyan", "Ashot", ""], ["Allahverdyan", "Armen E.", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.03876", "submitter": "Alfonso Vivanco Lira", "authors": "Alfonso Vivanco-Lira and Jos\\'e-Ra\\'ul Nieto-Saucedo", "title": "In silico model of infection of a CD4(+) T-cell by a human\n  immunodeficiency type 1 virus, and a mini-review on its molecular\n  pathophysiology", "comments": "77 pages, 11 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.CB q-bio.SC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Introduction. Can the infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus type\n1 induce a change in the differentiation status or process in T cells?.\nMethods. We will consider two stochastic Markov chain models, one which will\ndescribe the T-helper cell differentiation process, and another one describing\nthat process of infection of the T-helper cell by the virus; in these Markov\nchains, we will consider a set of states $\\{X_t \\}$ comprised of those proteins\ninvolved in each of the processes and their interactions (either\ndifferentiation or infection of the cell), such that we will obtain two\nstochastic transition matrices ($A,B$), one for each process; afterwards, the\ncomputation of their eigenvalues shall be performed, in which, should the\neigenvalue $\\lambda_i=1$ exist, the computation for the equilibrium\ndistribution $\\pi^n$ will be obtained for each of the matrices, which will\ninform us on the trends of interactions amongst the proteins in the long-term.\nResults. The stochastic processes considered possess an equilibrium\ndistribution, when reaching their equilibrium distribution, there exists an\nincrease in their informational entropy, and their log-rank distributions can\nbe modeled as discrete beta generalized distributions (DGBD). Discussion. The\nequilibrium distributions of both process can be regarded as states in which\nthe cell is well-differentiated, ergo there exists an induction of a novel\nHIV-dependent differentiated state in the T-cell; these processes due to their\nDGBD distribution can be considered complex processes; due to the increasing\nentropy, the equilibrium states are stable ones. Conclusion. The HIV virus can\npromote a novel differentiated state in the T-cell, which can give account for\nclinical features seen in patients; this model, notwithstanding does not give\naccount of YES/NO logical switches involved in the regulatory networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Feb 2021 18:37:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-09", "authors_parsed": [["Vivanco-Lira", "Alfonso", ""], ["Nieto-Saucedo", "Jos\u00e9-Ra\u00fal", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.03878", "submitter": "Paul Bressloff", "authors": "Paul C.

In this paper we use coherent spin states to construct\na new path integral representation of the probability density functional for\nstochastic hybrid systems, which holds outside the weak noise regime. We use\nthe path integral to derive a system of Langevin equations in the\nsemi-classical limit, which extends previous diffusion approximations based on\na quasi-steady-state reduction. We then show how in the weak noise limit the\npath integral is equivalent to an alternative representation that was\npreviously derived using Doi-Peliti operators.

Proteins and nucleic acids can phase separate into\nthree-dimensional liquid droplets in the cytoplasm and nucleus and the plasma\nmembrane of animal cells appears tuned close to a two-dimensional liquid-liquid\ncritical point. In some examples, cytoplasmic proteins aggregate at plasma\nmembrane domains, forming structures such as the post-synaptic density and\ndiverse signaling clusters. Here we examine the physics of these surface\ndensities, employing minimal simulations of co-acervating polymers coupled to\nan Ising membrane surface in conjunction with a complementary Landau theory. We\nargue that these surface densities are a novel phase reminiscent of\npre-wetting, in which a molecularly thin three-dimensional liquid forms on a\nusually solid surface. However, in surface densities the solid surface is\nreplaced by a membrane with an independent propensity to phase separate. We\nshow that proximity to criticality in the membrane dramatically increases the\nparameter regime in which a pre-wetting-like transition occurs, leading to a\nbroad region where coexisting surface phases can form even when a bulk phase is\nunstable. Our simulations naturally exhibit three surface phase coexistence\neven though both the membrane and the polymer bulk can only display two phase\ncoexistence on their own. We argue that the physics of these surface densities\nenables diverse functions seen in Eukaryotic cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 21:50:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Rouches", "Mason", ""], ["Veatch", "Sarah", ""], ["Machta", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.12860", "submitter": "Laura Wadkin PhD", "authors": "L E Wadkin, S Orozco-Fuentes, I Neganova, M Lako, N G Parker, A\n  Shukurov", "title": "A mathematical modelling framework for the regulation of intra-cellular\n  OCT4 in human pluripotent stem cells", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have promising clinical applications in\nregenerative medicine, drug-discovery and personalised medicine due to their\npotential to differentiate into all cell types, a property know as\npluripotency.
