The cytoplasm plays a role of a medium for\nstochastic motion of the virus contained in the endosome as well as the free\nvirus. It is experimentally known that the exponent of anomalous diffusion\nfluctuates in localized areas of the cytoplasm. Here, generalizing fractional\nkinetic theory, such fluctuations are described in terms of the exponent\nlocally distributed over the cytoplasm, and a theoretical proposition is\npresented for its statistical form. The proposed fluctuations may be examined\nin an experiment of heterogeneous diffusion in the infection pathway.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2010 08:56:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Itto", "Yuichi", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.0814", "submitter": "Jack Waddell", "authors": "Jack N.

The multiple targeting ligands on each nanoparticle can bind to\nseveral locations on a cell surface facilitating both drug targeting and\nuptake. Experiments show that the distribution of conjugated ligands is\nunexpectedly broad, and the desorption rate appears to depends exponentially\nupon the mean number of attached ligands. These two findings are explained with\na model in which ligands conjugate to the nanoparticle with a positive\ncooperativity of $\\approx 4kT$, and that nanoparticles bound to a surface by\nmultiple bonds are permanently affixed. This drives new analysis of the data,\nwhich confirms that there is only one time constant for desorption, that of a\nnanoparticle bound to the surface by a single bond.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Mar 2010 15:45:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Waddell", "Jack N.", ""], ["Mullen", "Douglas G.", ""], ["Orr", "Bradford G.", ""], ["Holl", "Mark M.
