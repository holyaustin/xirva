These enzymes operate by toggling between an active (\"ON\")\nguanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and an inactive (\"OFF\") guanosine\ndiphosphate (GDP)-bound state; such a toggle is regulated by GEFs (guanine\nnucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). Here we\ndissect a network motif between monomeric (m) and trimeric (t) GTPases\nassembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms. To this\nend, we develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two\nclasses of GTPases are interlinked conditional to their ON/OFF states within a\nmotif through feedforward and feedback loops. We provide formulas for the\nsteady states of the system and perform local stability analysis to investigate\nthe role of the different connections between the GTPase switches. A\nfeedforward from the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to\nprovide two locally stable states: one where both active/inactive forms of the\nmGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where\nboth m- and tGTPase have high concentrations. When a feedback loop from the GEF\nof the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the feedforward system,\ntwo other locally stable states emerged, both having the tGTPase inactivated\nand being interpreted as having low active tGTPase concentrations. Finally, the\naddition of a second feedback loop, from the active tGTPase to the GAP of the\nmGTPase, gives rise to a family of steady states parametrized by the inactive\ntGTPase concentrations. Our findings reveal that the coupling of these two\ndifferent GTPase motifs can dramatically change their steady state behaviors\nand shed light on how such coupling may impact information processing in\neukaryotic cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Sep 2020 15:09:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Stolerman", "Lucas M.", ""], ["Ghosh", "Pradipta", ""], ["Rangamani", "Padmini", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.10621", "submitter": "Joachim Krug", "authors": "Mario Josupeit and Joachim Krug", "title": "The fitness landscapes of translation", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2021.125768", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by recent experiments on an antibiotic resistance gene, we\ninvestigate genetic interactions between synonymous mutations in the framework\nof exclusion models of translation.

The importance of this interaction has\nlong been recognised, yet very little is understood about both the underlying\nmechanisms and the consequences for the spatial (re)organization of the\ncellular cytoskeleton. At the same time, understanding the causes and the\nconsequences of the interaction between different biomolecular components are\nkey questions for \\emph{in vitro} research involving reconstituted biomolecular\nsystems, especially in the light of current interest in creating minimal\nsynthetic cells. In this light, recent \\emph{in vitro} experiments have shown\nthat the actin-microtubule interaction mediated by the cytolinker TipAct, which\nbinds to actin lattice and microtubule tip, causes the directed transport of\nactin filaments. We develop an analytical theory of dynamically unstable\nmicrotubules, nucleated from the center of a spherical cell, in interaction\nwith actin filaments. We show that, depending on the balance between the\ndiffusion of unbound actin filaments and propensity to bind microtubules, actin\nis either concentrated in the center of the cell, where the density of\nmicrotubules is highest, or becomes localized to the cell cortex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Sep 2020 14:02:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Saltini", "Marco", ""], ["Mulder", "Bela M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.13520", "submitter": "Wasim Huleihel", "authors": "Michael Margaliot and Wasim Huleihel and Tamir Tuller", "title": "Variability in mRNA Translation: A Random Matrix Theory Approach", "comments": "Accepted to Scientific Reports - Nature", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The rate of mRNA translation depends on the initiation, elongation, and\ntermination rates of ribosomes along the mRNA.

In order to estimate the effect of cytoplasmic diffusion on the\nrate of translation, we consider a Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process\n(TASEP) coupled to a finite diffusive reservoir, which we call the Ribosome\nTransport model with Diffusion (RTD). In this model, we derive an analytical\nexpression for the rate of protein synthesis as a function of the diffusion\nconstant of ribosomes, which is corroborated with results from continuous-time\nMonte Carlo simulations.
