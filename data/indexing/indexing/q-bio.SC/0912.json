This interest stems from the realization that glia participates\nin cognitive functions and information processing and is involved in many brain\ndisorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia\ncommunications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the\nmodulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model\nfor glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the\nessential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol\n1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel\nmodel for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the\nIP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state\nmodel (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations\ntriggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external\nglutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models\ninclude a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation\npathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise\nformulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate\nthe existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between\nIP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator\nproperties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure\namplitude modulation ones. These and additional results of our model are in\ngeneral agreement with available experimental data and may have important\nimplications on the role of astrocytes in the synaptic transfer of information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 05:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["De Pitta`", "Maurizio", "", "2 and 3"], ["Goldberg", "Mati", "", "2 and 3"], ["Volman", "Vladislav", "", "2 and 3"], ["Berry", "Hugues", "", "1 and 2"], ["Ben-Jacob", "Eshel", "", "1 and 2"]]}, {"id": "0912.3064", "submitter": "Maurizio De Pitta'", "authors": "Maurizio De Pitta`(1), Vladislav Volman (2 and 3), Herbert Levine (2),\n  Eshel Ben-Jacob (1 and 2) ((1) School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv\n  University, Israel, (2) Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, UCSD, La\n  Jolla, CA, USA, (3) Computational Neurobiology Lab, The Salk Institute, La\n  Jolla, CA, USA)", "title": "Multimodal encoding in a simplified model of intracellular calcium\n  signaling", "comments": "27 pages, 2 Tables, 17 Figures.

Since virtually all\ncells employ a network of biochemical reactions for Ca2+ signalling, much\neffort has been devoted to understand the functional role of Ca2+ responses and\nto decipher how their complex dynamics is regulated by the biochemical network\nof Ca2+-related signal transduction pathways. Experimental observations show\nthat Ca2+ signals in response to external stimuli encode information via\nfrequency modulation or alternatively via amplitude modulation. Although\nminimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to\nexhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation\ntheory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex\nmodes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We\nconsider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding\ncan occur by amplitude modulation (AM) of Ca2+ oscillations, by frequency\nmodulation (FM) or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium\nsignalling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is\nnowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal\nactivity and information processing of the brain. We explain that our results\ncan be crucial for a better understanding of synaptic information transfer.\nFurthermore, our results might also be important for better insight on other\nexamples of physiological processes regulated by Ca2+ signalling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 07:24:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["De Pitta`", "Maurizio", "", "2 and 3"], ["Volman", "Vladislav", "", "2 and 3"], ["Levine", "Herbert", "", "1 and 2"], ["Ben-Jacob", "Eshel", "", "1 and 2"]]}, {"id": "0912.3482", "submitter": "Luca Ciandrini", "authors": "L.
