In the present paper, we explain two coarse-grained\ntheoretical models, the many-molecule (MM) model and the single-molecule (SM)\nmodel, to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic understandings. In\nthe simulation results with these models, ATP hydrolysis drives oscillation of\nindividual KaiC hexamers and ATP hydrolysis is necessary for synchronizing\noscillations of a large number of KaiC hexamers. Sensitive temperature\ndependence of the lifetime of the ADP bound state in the CI domain of KaiC\nhexamers makes the oscillation period temperature insensitive. ATPase activity\nis correlated to the frequency of phosphorylation oscillation in the single\nmolecule of KaiC hexamer, which should be the origin of the observed\nensemble-level correlation between the ATPase activity and the frequency of\nphosphorylation oscillation. Thus, the simulation results with the MM and SM\nmodels suggest that ATP hydrolysis randomly occurring in each CI domain of\nindividual KaiC hexamers is a key process for oscillatory behaviors of the\nensemble of many KaiC hexamers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 Mar 2018 10:34:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-08", "authors_parsed": [["Das", "Sumita", ""], ["Terada", "Tomoki P.", ""], ["Sasai", "Masaki", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.03942", "submitter": "Isabella Graf", "authors": "Mareike Bojer, Isabella R.
