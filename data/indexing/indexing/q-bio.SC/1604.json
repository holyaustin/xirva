At non-zero $F$, $P(v)$\nis non-Gaussian, and is bimodal with peaks at positive and negative values of\n$v$. The prediction that $P(v)$ is bimodal is a consequence of the discrete\nstep-size of kinesin-1, and remains even when the step-size distribution is\ntaken into account. Although the predictions are based on analyses of kinesin-1\ndata, our results are general and should hold for any processive motor, which\nwalks on a track by taking discrete steps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 13:08:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Vu", "Huong T.", ""], ["Chakrabarti", "Shaon", ""], ["Hinczewski", "Michael", ""], ["Thirumalai", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00690", "submitter": "Hui-Shun Kuan", "authors": "Hui-Shun Kuan and Meredith D.

Recent studies show\nthat YAP/TAZ mechanical sensing is dependent on RhoA-regulated stress fibers.\nHowever, current understanding of YAP/TAZ still remains limited due to the\nunknown interaction between the canonical Hippo pathway and cell tension. To\nidentify the roles of key signaling molecules in mechanical signal sensing and\ntransduction, we present a novel computational model of the YAP/TAZ signaling\npathway. This model converts ECM mechanical properties to biochemical signals\nvia adhesion, and integrates intracellular signaling cascades associated with\ncytoskeleton dynamics. Adhesion molecules, such as FAK, are predicted to rescue\nYAP/TAZ activity in soft environments via the RhoA pathway. We found that\nchanges of molecule concentrations result in different pattern of YAP/TAZ\nstiffness response. We also investigate the sensitivity of YAP/TAZ activity to\nECM stiffness. In addition, the model shows that the unresolved synergistic\neffect of YAP/TAZ activity between the mechanosensing and the Hippo pathways\ncan be explained by the interaction of LIMK and LATS. Overall, our model\nprovides a novel platform for studying YAP/TAZ activity in the context of\nintegrating different signaling pathways.
