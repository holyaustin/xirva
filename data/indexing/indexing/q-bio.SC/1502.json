For many viral systems, in particular for\nhuman viruses like hepatitis B, adeno or human immunodeficiency virus, that\nlead to persistent infections, capsomeres are continuously produced in the\ncytoplasm of the host cell while completed capsids exit the cell for a new\nround of infection. Here we use coarse-grained Brownian dynamics simulations of\na generic patchy particle model to elucidate the role of the dynamic supply of\ncapsomeres for the reversible self-assembly of empty T1 icosahedral virus\ncapsids. We find that for high rates of capsomere influx only a narrow range of\nbond strengths exists for which a steady state of continuous capsid production\nis possible. For bond strengths smaller and larger than this optimal value, the\nreaction volume becomes crowded by small and large intermediates, respectively.\nFor lower rates of capsomere influx a broader range of bond strengths exists\nfor which a steady state of continuous capsid production is established,\nalthough now the production rate of capsids is smaller. Thus our simulations\nsuggest that the importance of an optimal bond strength for viral capsid\nassembly typical for in vitro conditions can be reduced by the dynamic influx\nof capsomeres in a cellular environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2015 19:43:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Boettcher", "Marvin A.", "", "Heidelberg University"], ["Klein", "Heinrich C.

Mathematical models for virus self-assembly usually\nassume that the bonds leading to cluster formation have constant reactivity\nover the time course of assembly (direct assembly). In some cases, however,\nbinding sites between the capsomers have been reported to be activated during\nthe self-assembly process (hierarchical assembly). In order to study possible\nadvantages of such hierarchical schemes for icosahedral virus capsid assembly,\nwe use Brownian dynamics simulations of a patchy particle model that allows us\nto switch binding sites on and off during assembly. For T1 viruses, we\nimplement a hierarchical assembly scheme where inter-capsomer bonds become\nactive only if a complete pentamer has been assembled. We find direct assembly\nto be favorable for reversible bonds allowing for repeated structural\nreorganizations, while hierarchical assembly is favorable for strong bonds with\nsmall dissociation rate, as this situation is less prone to kinetic trapping.\nHowever, at the same time it is more vulnerable to monomer starvation during\nthe final phase. Increasing the number of initial monomers does have only a\nweak effect on these general features. The differences between the two assembly\nschemes become more pronounced for more complex virus geometries, as shown here\nfor T3 viruses, which assemble through homogeneous pentamers and heterogeneous\nhexamers in the hierarchical scheme.
