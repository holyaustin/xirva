These tubular networks host many biochemical pathways that rely on\nproteins diffusively searching through the network to encounter binding\npartners or localized target regions. In this work we develop both exact\nanalytical methods to compute mean first passage times and efficient kinetic\nMonte Carlo algorithms to simulate trajectories of particles diffusing in a\ntubular network. Our approach leverages exact propagator functions for the\ndistribution of transition times between network nodes and allows large\nsimulation time steps determined by the network structure. The methodology is\napplied to both synthetic planar networks and organelle network structures,\ndemonstrating key general features such as the heterogeneity of search times in\ndifferent network regions and the functional advantage of broadly distributing\ntarget sites throughout the network.

Receiver saturation renders\nthe system behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly\nneglected in existing analytical models. Furthermore, due to the ligands'\ncompetition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual binding events at\nthe molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial\nmodel for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work,\nwe propose a novel deterministic model for receptor saturation in terms of a\nstate-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion of Fick's diffusion\nequation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally\nefficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation\nat the molecular receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received\nsignal and accelerates the clearance of NTs as compared to the case when\nreceptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical model for the\nreceived signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for\nthe competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs.\nThe proposed statistical model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by\nthe number of released NTs, the number of receptors, and the binding kinetics\nof the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show that\nthe impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative\nnumbers of NTs and receptors. The accuracy of the proposed deterministic and\nstatistical models is verified by particle-based computer simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Mar 2021 10:44:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2021 12:00:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lotter", "Sebastian", ""], ["Sch\u00e4fer", "Maximilian", ""], ["Zeitler", "Johannes", ""], ["Schober", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.10667", "submitter": "Simone Pigolotti", "authors": "Qiao Lu, Deepak Bhat, Darya Stepanenko, and Simone Pigolotti", "title": "Search and localization dynamics of the CRISPR/Cas9 system", "comments": "5 pages, 4 figures, submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The CRISPR/Cas9 system acts as the prokariotic immune system and has\nimportant applications in gene editing.

The mechanism\nunderlying this transition between cooperative and antagonistic dynamics\nremains poorly understood.

We show that this\nminimal model exhibits two transcription modes mediated by the torsional\nstress: a fluid mode when the promoter is active and a torsionally stressed\nmode when the promoter is repressed, in quantitative agreement with\nexperimentally observed dynamics of co-transcribing RNAPs.
