Here we use optical stretching, a non-contact and\nrelatively high-throughput technique for probing cell mechanics, to accumulate\na sufficient data set that demonstrates robustly that cell compliance varies\naccording to the similar but distinct gamma distribution. Additionally, we\nre-examine existing simulations that were originally proposed to justify a\nlog-normal fit, and show that in fact these simulation data also correspond to\nthe gamma distribution. Finally, we propose a general stochastic differential\nequation that analytically predicts a gamma distribution of creep compliance\nduring cell stretching, as well as the Gaussian distribution of cell recovery\nthat we observe experimentally upon removal of applied load. The population\nvariation is well characterized by just a single parameter in each of the creep\nand recovery regimes. We expect our correction of a phenomenological\ndistribution fit, enabled by an expansive data set for mesenchymal stem cells,\nto enable the development of more accurate constitutive laws to describe\ncytoskeletal deformation.
