There has been much speculation as to the role of these pathways, and\nhow their structure is related to their function. A common conclusion is that\nthe cascades serve to amplify biochemical signals so that a single bound ligand\nmolecule might produce a multitude of second messengers. Some recent work has\nfocused on a particular feature present in some MAPK pathways -- a negative\nfeedback loop which spans the length of the cascade. This is a feature that is\nshared by a man-made engineering device, the feedback amplifier. We propose a\nnovel interpretation: that by wrapping a feedback loop around an amplifier,\nthese cascades may be acting as biochemical feedback amplifiers which imparts\ni) increased robustness with respect to internal perturbations; ii) a linear\ngraded response over an extended operating range; iii) insulation from external\nperturbation, resulting in functional modularization. We also report on the\ngrowing list of experimental evidence which supports a graded response of MAPK\nwith respect to Epidermal Growth Factor. This evidence supports our hypothesis\nthat in these circumstances MAPK cascade, may be acting as a feedback\namplifier.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Oct 2007 23:38:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Sauro", "Herbert M", ""], ["Ingalls", "Brian", ""]]}]
