We show that the mean first passage times for several standard search\nproblems - narrow escape, reaction partner finding, reaction-escape - can be\nminimized with a directional distribution that is reminiscent of the spatial\norganization of the cytoskeleton filaments of cells with a centrosome: radial\nballistic transport from center to periphery and back, and ballistic transport\nin random directions within a concentric shell of thickness $\\Delta_{\\rm opt}$\nalong the domain boundary.

Our\nmechanistic simulation for Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrates that at least half\nof the total regulatory interactions must be present to express the circadian\nmolecular profiles observed in wild-type plants. A set of those essential\ninteractions is called herein a kernel of the circadian system. The kernel\nstructure unbiasedly reveals four interlocked negative feedback loops\ncontributing to circadian rhythms, and three feedback loops among them drive\nthe autonomous oscillation itself. Strikingly, the kernel structure, as well as\nthe whole clock circuitry, is overwhelmingly composed of inhibitory, rather\nthan activating, interactions between genes. We found that this tendency\nunderlies plant circadian molecular profiles which often exhibit\nsharply-shaped, cuspidate waveforms. Through the generation of these cuspidate\nprofiles, inhibitory interactions may facilitate the global coordination of\ntemporally-distant clock events that are markedly peaked at very specific times\nof day. Our systematic approach resulting in experimentally-testable\npredictions provides insights into a design principle of biological clockwork,\nwith implications for synthetic biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 03:24:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Foo", "Mathias", ""], ["Somers", "David E.", ""], ["Kim", "Pan-Jun", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.02423", "submitter": "Abhishek Chaudhuri", "authors": "Anil Nair, Sameep Chandel, Mithun K Mitra, Sudipto Muhuri and Abhishek\n  Chaudhuri", "title": "Catch bond mechanism in Dynein motor driven collective transport", "comments": "5 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent experiments have demonstrated that dynein motor exhibits catch bonding\nbehaviour, in which the unbinding rate of a single dynein decreases with\nincreasing force, for a certain range of force. Motivated by these experiments,\nwe propose a model for catch bonding in dynein using a threshold force bond\ndeformation (TFBD) model wherein catch bonding sets in beyond a critical\napplied load force. We study the effect of catch bonding on unidirectional\ntransport properties of cellular cargo carried by multiple dynein motors within\nthe framework of this model. We find catch bonding can result in dramatic\nchanges in the transport properties, which are in sharp contrast to kinesin\ndriven unidirectional transport, where catch bonding is absent. We predict\nthat, under certain conditions, the average velocity of the cellular cargo can\nactually increase as applied load is increased. We characterize the transport\nproperties in terms of a velocity profile phase plot in the parameter space of\nthe catch bond strength and the stall force of the motor. This phase plot\nyields predictions that may be experimentally accessed by suitable\nmodifications of motor transport and binding properties.
