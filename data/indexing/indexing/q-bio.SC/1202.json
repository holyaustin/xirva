Random fluctuations in the formation\nof replication starting points, called origins, and the subsequent activation\nof proteins lead to variations in the replication time. We analyse these\nstochastic properties of DNA and derive the positions of origins corresponding\nto the minimum replication time. We show that under some conditions the\nminimization of replication time leads to the grouping of origins, and relate\nthis to experimental data in a number of species showing origin grouping.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2012 13:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Karschau", "Jens", ""], ["Blow", "J.
