Experiments on vesicles of both\nlipid types show a decrease in vesicle radius which is interpreted as being due\nto lipid loss during the permeabilization process. We show that the decrease in\nsize can be qualitatively explained as a loss of lipid area which is\nproportional to the area of the vesicle which is permeabilized.

This model is closely related to the\nmembrane-embedded F$_0$ motor of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, which\nconverts the energy of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of protons\ninto mechanical motion of the rotor. It is shown that the Coulomb coupling\nbetween the negative charge of the empty rotor site and the positive stator\ncharge, located near the periplasmic proton-conducting channel (proton source),\nplays a dominant role in the torque-generating process. When approaching the\nsource outlet, the rotor site has a proton energy level higher than the energy\nlevel of the site, located near the cytoplasmic channel (proton drain). In the\nfirst stage of this torque-generating process, the energy of the\nelectrochemical potential is converted into potential energy of the\nproton-binding sites on the rotor. Afterwards, the tangential component of the\nCoulomb force produces a mechanical torque. We demonstrate that, at low\ntemperatures, the loaded motor works in the shuttling regime where the energy\nof the electrochemical potential is consumed without producing any\nunidirectional rotation. The motor switches to the torque-generating regime at\nhigh temperatures, when the Brownian ratchet mechanism turns on. In the\npresence of a significant external torque, created by ATP hydrolysis, the\nsystem operates as a proton pump, which translocates protons against the\ntransmembrane potential gradient. Here we focus on the F$_0$ motor, even though\nour analysis is applicable to the bacterial flagellar motor.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2008 13:54:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Smirnov", "A.
