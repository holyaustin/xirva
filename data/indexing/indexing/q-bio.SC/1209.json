Objectives: Examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells. Methods:\nFive cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of 0.025 to 5\nmicroT, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6 days.\nResults: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a\nmostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising\nreturn to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF\nincreases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions.\nOur data suggests that the karyotype contractions are caused by MF interference\nwith mitochondria's ATP synthase (ATPS), compensated by the action of\nAMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). The effects of MFs are similar to those of\nthe ATPS inhibitor oligomycin. They are amplified by metformin, an AMPK\nstimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK inhibitor. Over environmental\nMFs, karyotype contractions of various cancer cell lines show exceptionally\nwide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythro-leukemia cells, which\ndisplay a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microT. Conclusions: The\nbiological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in the structure of\nwater that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels.
