Here, we\ndemonstrate the application of in silico evolution combined with rule-based\nmodelling for exploring design principles of cellular signaling networks. This\napplication is based on a computational platform, called BioJazz, which allows\nin silico evolution of signaling networks with unbounded complexity.

The solubilization of the lipid membrane due to the insertion\nof surfactant molecules induces a reduction of membrane surface area at almost\nconstant vesicle volume. This results in a rate-dependent increase of membrane\ntension and leads to the opening of a micron-sized pore. We show that\nsolubilization kinetics due to surfactants can determine the regimes of pore\ndynamics: either the pores open and reseal within a second (short-lived pore),\nor the pore stays open up to a few minutes (long-lived pore). First, we\nvalidate our model with previously published experimental measurements of pore\ndynamics. Then, we investigate how the solubilization kinetics and membrane\nproperties affect the dynamics of the pore and construct a phase diagram for\nshort and long-lived pores. Finally, we examine the dynamics of sequential pore\nopenings and show that cyclic short-lived pores occur at a period inversely\nproportional to the solubilization rate.

To activate a gene,\na TF has first to diffuse in the available space of the nucleus until it\nreaches a target DNA sequence or protein (target site). This eventually results\nin the recruitment of the whole transcriptional machinery.\n  All these processes take place in the mammalian nucleoplasm, a highly\norganized and dynamic environment, in which some complexes transiently assemble\nand break apart, whereas others appear more stable. This diversity of dynamic\nbehaviors arises from the number of biomolecules that make up the nucleoplasm\nand their pairwise interactions. Indeed, interactions energies that span\nseveral orders of magnitude, from covalent bounds to transient and dynamic\ninteractions can shape nuclear landscapes. Thus, the nuclear environment\ndetermines how frequently and how fast a TF contacts its target site, and\nindirectly gene expression. How exactly transient interactions are involved in\nthe regulation of TF diffusion is unclear, but are reflected by live cell\nimaging techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, fluorescence\nrecovery after photobleaching or single-particle tracking. Overall, the\nmacroscopic result of these microscopic interactions is almost always anomalous\ndiffusion, a phenomenon widely studied and modeled.\n  Here, we review the connections between the anomalous diffusion of a TF and\nthe microscopic organization of the nucleus, including recently described\ntopologically associated domains and dynamic phase-separated compartments.

The combination\nof excluded-volume interactions and self-propulsion leads to several distinct\ndynamic phases as a function of bending rigidity, activity, and aspect ratio of\nindividual filaments. We consider first the case of intermediate filament\ndensity. For high-aspect-ratio filaments, we identify a transition with\nincreasing propulsion from a state of free-swimming filaments to a state of\nspiraled filaments with nearly frozen translational motion. For lower aspect\nratios, this gas-of-spirals phase is suppressed with growing density due to\nfilament collisions; instead, filaments form clusters similar to self-propelled\nrods, as activity increases. Finite bending rigidity strongly effects the\ndynamics and phase behavior. Flexible filaments form small and transient\nclusters, while stiffer filaments organize into giant clusters, similarly as\nself-propelled rods, but with a reentrant phase behavior from giant to smaller\nclusters as activity becomes large enough to bend the filaments. For high\nfilament densities, we identify a nearly frozen jamming state at low\nactivities, a nematic laning state at intermediate activities, and an\nactive-turbulence state at high activities.
