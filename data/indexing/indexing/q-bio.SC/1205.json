The jammed length of MT\nincreases with total MT length, while the non-jammed MT length might not change\nmonotonically with the total MT length. The critical value $N_c$ increases with\nmotor detachment rate from MT, but decreases with motor attachment rate to MT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 May 2012 06:40:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Yunxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.5858", "submitter": "Manoj Gopalakrishnan", "authors": "Deepak Bhat and Manoj Gopalakrishnan (Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras)", "title": "Effectiveness of a dynein team in tug-of-war helped by reduced\n  load-sensitivity of detachment: evidence from study of bidirectional endosome\n  transport in Dictyostelium discoideum", "comments": "20 pages, 8 figures, to appear in Phys.

In this case, teams of oppositely\npulling motors (eg., kinesin and dynein) bind to the cargo simultaneously, and\n`coordinate' their activity such that the motion consists of spells of\npositively and negatively directed segments, separated by pauses of varying\nduration. A set of recent experiments have analyzed the bidirectional motion of\nendosomes in the amoeba D. discoideum in detail. It was found that in between\ndirectional switches, a team of 5-6 dyneins stall a cargo against a stronger\nkinesin in tug of war, which lasts for almost a second. As the mean detachment\ntime of a kinesin under its stall load was also observed to be ~ 1s, we infer\nthat the collective detachment time of the dynein assembly must also be\nsimilar. Here, we analyze this inference from a modeling perspective, using\nexperimentally measured single-molecule parameters as inputs. We find that the\ncommonly assumed exponential load-dependent detachment rate is inconsistent\nwith observations, as it predicts that a 5-dynein assembly will detach under\nits combined stall load in less than a hundredth of a second. A modified model\nwhere the load-dependent unbinding rate is assumed to saturate at stall-force\nlevel for super-stall loads gives results which are in agreement with\nexperimental data. Our analysis suggests that the load-dependent detachment of\na dynein in a team is qualitatively different at sub-stall and super-stall\nloads, a conclusion which is likely to have implications in other situations\ninvolving collective effects of many motors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 May 2012 07:51:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Bhat", "Deepak", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", "", "Department of Physics, IIT\n  Madras"]]}, {"id": "1205.6219", "submitter": "Hong Qian", "authors": "Qingdao Huang and Hong Qian", "title": "The Dynamics of Zeroth-Order Ultrasensitivity: A Critical Phenomenon in\n  Cell Biology", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Discrete and Continuous Dynamical Systems S, vol. 4, 1457-1464\n  (2011)", "doi": "10.3934/dcdss.2011.4.1457", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is well known since the pioneering work of Goldbeter and Koshland [Proc.\nNatl.
