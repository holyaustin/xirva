To investigate the accuracy and stability of\ncentering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle\nduring the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution.

The\nkey question addressed here is the following: how does a synapse bond remain\nstabilized in the presence of high frequency thermal noise that potentially\nequates to a strong detaching force? Focusing on the average time persistence\nof an immature synapse, we show that the high frequency nodes accompanying\nlarge fluctuations are counterbalanced by low frequency nodes that evolve over\nlonger time periods. Our analysis shows that such a behavior could be easily\nexplained from the fact that the survival probability distribution is governed\nby two distinct phases, for the two different time regimes. The relatively\nshorter time scales correspond to the cohesion:adhesion induced immature bond\nformation whereas the larger time reciprocates the association:dissociation\nregime leading to TCR:pMHC signaling. From an estimation of the bond survival\nprobability, we show that at shorter time scales, this probability\n$P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)$ scales with time $\\tau$ as an universal function of a\nrescaled noise amplitude $\\frac{D}{\\Delta^2}$, such that $P_{\\Delta}(\\tau)\\sim\n\\tau^{-(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sqrt{D}}+\\frac{1}{2})}$, $\\Delta$ being the distance\nfrom the mean inter-membrane (T cell:Antigen Presenting Cell) separation\ndistance. The crossover from this shorter to a longer time regime leads to an\nuniversality in the dynamics, at which point the survival probability shows a\ndifferent power-law scaling compared to the one at shorter time scales. In\nbiological terms, such a crossover indicates that the TCR:pMHC bond has a\nsurvival probability with a slower decay rate than the longer LFA-1:ICAM-1 bond\njustifying its stability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 21:26:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bush", "Daniel R.", ""], ["Chattopadhyay", "Amit K.", ""]]}]
