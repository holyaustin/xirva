But the noise is not solved accurately in not so few cases and this\nmay lead to misleading models. Here, we solve the noise. We consider two state\nphoton trajectories from any on off kinetic scheme (KS): the process emitting\nphotons with a rate {\\gamma}on when it is in the on state, and emitting with a\nrate {\\gamma}off when it is in the off state. We develop a filter that removes\nthe noise resulting in clean data also in cases where binning fails. The filter\nis a numerical algorithm with various new statistical treatments. It is based\non a new general likelihood function developed here, with observable dependent\nform. The filter can solve the noise, in the detectable region of the rate\nspace: that is, we also find a region where the data is \"too\" noisy.\nConsistency tests will find the region's type from the data. If the data is\nruled \"too noisy\", binning obviously fails, and one should apply simpler\nmethods on the raw data and realizing that the extracted information is\npartial. We show that not applying the filter while cleaning results in\nerroneous rates. This filter (with minor adjustments) can solve the noise in\nany discrete state trajectories, yet extensions are needed in \"tackling\" the\nnoise from other data, e.g. continuous data and FRET data.\n  The filter developed here is complementary with our previous projects in this\nfield, where we have solved clean two state data with the development of\nreduced dimensions forms (RDFs): only the combined procedures enabling building\nthe most accurate model from noisy trajectories from single molecules\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jun 2013 06:53:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Flomenbom", "Ophir", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.4799", "submitter": "Wilson Poon", "authors": "W C K Poon", "title": "From Clarkia to Escherichia and Janus: the physics of natural and\n  synthetic active colloids", "comments": "21 figures", "journal-ref": "Proceedings of the International School of Physics\"Enrico Ferm'',\n  Course CLXXXIV \"Physics of Complex Colloid'', eds.

An obvious example of active colloids is a suspension of bacteria\nsuch as Escherichia coli, their physical dimensions being almost invariably in\nthe colloidal range. Synthetic self-propelled particles have also become\navailable recently, such as two-faced, or Janus, particles propelled by\ndifferential chemical reactions on their surfaces driving a self-phoretic\nmotion. In these lectures, I give a pedagogical introduction to the physics of\nsingle-particle and collective properties of active colloids, focussing on self\npropulsion. I will compare and contrast phenomena in suspensions of `swimmers'\nwith the behaviour of suspensions of passive particles, where only Brownian\nmotion (discovered by Robert Brown in granules from the pollen of the wild\nflower {\\it Clarkia pulchella}) is relevant. I will pay particular attention to\nissues that pertain to performing experiments using these active particle\nsuspensions, such as how to characterise the suspension's swimming speed\ndistribution, and include an appendix to guide physicists wanting to start\nculturing motile bacteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 09:27:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Poon", "W C K", ""]]}]
