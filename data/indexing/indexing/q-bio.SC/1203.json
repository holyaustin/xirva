But the associated\nnonlinearity - the gating compliance - inevitably distorts signals. Because\nreducing distortion would make the ear a better detector, we sought mechanisms\nwith that effect. Mimicking in vivo stimulation, we used stiff probes to\ndisplace individual hair bundles at physiological amplitudes and measured the\ncoherence and phase of the relative stereociliary motions with a dual-beam\ndifferential interferometer. Although stereocilia moved coherently and in phase\nat the stimulus frequencies, large phase lags at the frequencies of the\ninternally generated distortion products indicated dissipative relative\nmotions. Tip links engaged these relative modes and decreased the coherence in\nboth stimulated and free hair bundles. These results show that a hair bundle\nbreaks into a highly dissipative serial arrangement of stereocilia at\ndistortion frequencies, precluding their amplification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2012 20:30:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Kozlov", "Andrei S.", ""], ["Risler", "Thomas", ""], ["Hinterwirth", "Armin J.", ""], ["Hudspeth", "A.

Just like their macroscopic\ncounterparts, each of these nano-machines has an engine that \"transduces\" input\nenergy into an output form which is then utilized by its coupling to a\ntransmission system for appropriate operations. The theory of heat engines,\npioneered by Carnot, rests on the second law of equilibrium thermodynamics.\nHowever, the engines of molecular machines, operate under isothermal conditions\nfar from thermodynamic equilibrium. Moreover, one of the possible mechanisms of\nenergy transduction, popularized by Feynman and called Brownian ratchet, does\nnot even have any macroscopic counterpart. But, {\\it molecular machine is not\nsynonymous with Brownian ratchet}; a large number of molecular machines\nactually execute a noisy power stroke, rather than operating as Brownian\nratchet. The man-machine analogy, a topic of intense philosophical debate in\nwhich many leading philosophers like Aristotle and Descartes participated, was\nextended to similar analogies at the cellular and subcellular levels after the\ninvention of optical microscope. The idea of molecular machine, pioneered by\nMarcelo Malpighi, has been pursued vigorously in the last fifty years. It has\nbecome a well established topic of current interdisciplinary research as\nevident from the publication of a very influential paper by Alberts towards the\nend of the twentieth century. Here we give a non-technical overview of the\nstrategies for (a) stochastic modeling of mechano-chemical kinetic processes,\nand (b) model selection based on statistical inference drawn from analysis of\nexperimental data.
