In this Letter, we identify a fundamental difference between active\npolymers and passive, equilibrium polymers: for equal mean lengths, active\npolymers can reorganize faster than equilibrium polymers. We show that\nequilibrium polymers are intrinsically limited to linear scaling between mean\nlifetime and mean length, MFPT ~ <L>, by analogy to 1-d Potts models. By\ncontrast, we present a simple active-polymer model that improves upon this\nscaling, such that MFPT ~ <L>^{1/2}. Since to be biologically useful,\nstructural biopolymers must typically be many monomers long, yet respond\ndynamically to the needs of the cell, the difference in reorganization kinetics\nmay help to justify active polymers' greater energy cost.

In recent years, much effort has been put into capturing\nthe dynamics of these fluctuations by means of analytical and numerical models.\nThese attempts have been very successful for, but also remain limited to,\nisotropic polymers. To correctly interpret experimental work on (strongly)\nanisotropic semiflexible polymers, there is a need for a numerical modelling\ntool that accurately captures the dynamics of polymers with anisotropic\nmaterial properties. In the current study, we present a finite element (FE)\nframework for simulating the thermal dynamics of a single anisotropic\nsemiflexible polymer. First, we demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by\ncomparison of the simulated mean square displacement (MSD) of the end-to-end\ndistance with analytical predictions based on the worm-like chain model. Then,\nwe implement a transversely isotropic material model, characteristic for\nbiopolymers such as MTs, and study the persistence length for various ratios\nbetween the longitudinal shear modulus and corresponding Young's modulus.\nFinally, we put our findings in context by addressing a recent experimental\nwork on grafted transversely isotropic MTs. In that research, a simplified\nstatic mechanical model was used to deduce a very high level of MT anisotropy\nto explain the observation that the persistence length of grafted MTs increases\nas contour length increases. We show, by means of our FE framework, that the\nanisotropic properties cannot account for the reported length-dependent\npersistence length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2011 19:11:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-26", "authors_parsed": [["Poelert", "Sander L.", ""], ["Weinans", "Harrie H.", ""], ["Zadpoor", "Amir A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5660", "submitter": "Andrew Mugler", "authors": "Andrew Mugler, Aimee Gotway Bailey, Koichi Takahashi, Pieter Rein ten\n  Wolde", "title": "Membrane clustering and the role of rebinding in biochemical signaling", "comments": "22 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": "Biophys J, 102(5):1069, 2012", "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2012.02.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In many cellular signaling pathways, key components form clusters at the cell\nmembrane. Although much work has focused on the mechanisms behind such cluster\nformation, the implications for downstream signaling remain poorly understood.\nHere, motivated by recent experiments, we study via particle-based simulation a\ncovalent modification network in which the activating component is either\nclustered or randomly distributed on the membrane. We find that while\nclustering reduces the response of a single-modification network, clustering\ncan enhance the response of a double-modification network. The reduction is a\nbulk effect: a cluster presents a smaller effective target to a substrate\nmolecule in the bulk. The enhancement, on the other hand, is a local effect: a\ncluster promotes the rapid rebinding and second activation of singly active\nsubstrate molecules. As such, the enhancement relies upon frequent collisions\non a short timescale, which leads to a diffusion coefficient at which the\nenhancement is optimal. We complement simulation with analytic results at both\nthe mean-field and first-passage distribution levels. Our results emphasize the\nimportance of spatially resolved models, showing that significant effects of\nspatial correlations persist even in spatially averaged quantities such as\nresponse curves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2011 20:38:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Mugler", "Andrew", ""], ["Bailey", "Aimee Gotway", ""], ["Takahashi", "Koichi", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5997", "submitter": "Michael Sheinman", "authors": "M.

By studying the problem analytically, we\ndemonstrate that this effect occurs due to the disordered binding energy of the\ntranscription factor to the DNA molecule and the steric interactions between\nthe different copies of the transcription factor. We show that the enhanced\nHill coefficient implies a significant reduction in the number of copies of the\ntranscription factors which is needed to occupy a cognate site and, in many\ncases, can explain existing estimates for numbers of the transcription factors\nin cells.
