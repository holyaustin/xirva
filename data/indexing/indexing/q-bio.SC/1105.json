This in turn controls glutamate release\ndynamics in the cleft. As a consequence of this, glutamate concentration in the\ncleft has been modeled, in which glutamate reuptake by astrocytes has also been\nincorporated. Finally, dendritic spine-head dynamics has been modeled. As an\napplication, this model clearly shows synaptic potentiation in the hippocampal\nregion, i.e., astrocyte Ca2+ mediates synaptic plasticity, which is in\nconformity with the majority of the recent findings (Perea & Araque, 2007;\nHenneberger et al., 2010; Navarrete et al., 2012).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 May 2011 16:33:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Dec 2011 16:43:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 12 Mar 2012 13:45:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Tewari", "Shivendra", ""], ["Majumdar", "Kaushik", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.0880", "submitter": "Antonio Scialdone", "authors": "Antonio Scialdone and Mario Nicodemi", "title": "Diffusion-based DNA target colocalization by thermodynamic mechanisms", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Development 137:3877 (2010)", "doi": "10.1242/dev.053322", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In eukaryotic cell nuclei, a variety of DNA interactions with nuclear\nelements occur, which, in combination with intra- and inter- chromosomal\ncross-talks, shape a functional 3D architecture.

It\nmainly focuses on the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and cell-motility mechanisms.\nBacterial motility as well as the composition of the prokaryotic cytoskeleton\nis only briefly mentioned. The article is organized as follows. In Section III,\nI first present an overview of the diversity of cellular motility mechanisms,\nwhich might at first glance be categorized into two different types of\nbehaviors, namely \"swimming\" and \"crawling\". Intracellular transport, mitosis -\nor cell division - as well as other extensions of cell motility that rely on\nthe same essential machinery are briefly sketched. In Section IV, I introduce\nthe molecular machinery that underlies cell motility - the cytoskeleton - as\nwell as its interactions with the external environment of the cell and its main\nregulatory pathways. Sections IV D to IV F are more detailed in their\nbiochemical presentations; readers primarily interested in the theoretical\nmodeling of cell motility might want to skip these sections in a first reading.\nI then describe the motility mechanisms that rely essentially on\npolymerization-depolymerization dynamics of cytoskeleton filaments in Section\nV, and the ones that rely essentially on the activity of motor proteins in\nSection VI. Finally, Section VII is devoted to the description of the\nintegrated approaches that have been developed recently to try to understand\nthe cooperative phenomena that underly self-organization of the cell\ncytoskeleton as a whole.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 May 2011 10:57:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Risler", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2992", "submitter": "Yunxin Zhang", "authors": "Yunxin Zhang", "title": "Shock of three-state model for intracellular transport of kinesin KIF1A", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J Stat Phys 152(2013) 1207", "doi": "10.1007/s10955-013-0804-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, a three-state model is presented to describe the intracellular\ntraffic of unconventional (single-headed) kinesin KIF1A [Phys.
