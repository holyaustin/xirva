From this result, we suggest that\nthe variability of patterns among individuals of the same species may have its\nroots in this sensitivity. Furthermore, this study analyzes briefly how the\ninclusion of the advection and the space dependency in the parameters of the\nmodel influences the forms of a specific pattern. The results of this study are\ncompared to the skin patterns that appear in Pseudoplatystom} fishes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 00:00:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Ledesma-Dur\u00e1n", "Aldo", ""], ["Ju\u00e1rez-Valencia", "H\u00e9ctor", ""], ["Santamar\u00eda-Holek", "Iv\u00e1n", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06461", "submitter": "Paul Atzberger", "authors": "Jon Karl Sigurdsson and Paul J.

We investigate relative to flat membranes how the membrane\ncurvature and topology augment hydrodynamic responses. We show how both the\ntranslational and rotational mobility of protein inclusions are effected by the\nmembrane curvature, ratio of intramembrane viscosity to solvent viscosity, and\ninter-monolayer slip.

We then move to a more elaborate\nprotocol in which an intermediate step can be used for error correction.\nFinally, we discuss the operating regimes of two kinetic proofreading\nprotocols: one in which proofreading acts from the final copying step, and one\nin which it acts from an intermediate step.

ATPase is\ncomposed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation\nand compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a\nself-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state\nBrownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the\ncoiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description\nof linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of\nthe $\\gamma$-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer.\nSubstituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent\nexperiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the\n`no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400~rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close\nagreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow,\nstop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to\nsynthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the\nmotor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical\nwork it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in\nthe number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven\noperation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 12:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kulish", "O.", ""], ["Wright", "A.
