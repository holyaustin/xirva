Further, lipid composition and morphology can play a key\nrole in regulating a variety of biological processes. For example, viral\nuptake, plasma membrane tension regulation, and the formation of caveolae all\nrequire the creation and control of groups of lipids that adopt specific\nmorphologies. In this paper, we use a simplified model mixture of lipids and\ncholesterol to examine the interplay between lipid phase-separation and bilayer\nmorphology. We observe and theoretically analyze three main features of\nphase-separated giant unilamellar vesicles. First, by tracking the motion of\n`dimpled' domains, we measure repulsive, elastic interactions that create\nshort--range translational and orientational order, leading to a stable\ndistribution of domain sizes, and hence maintaining lateral heterogeneity on\nrelatively short length scales and long time scales. Second, we examine the\ntransition to `budded' domain morphologies, showing that the transition is\nsize-selective, and has two kinetic regimes, as revealed by a calculated phase\ndiagram. Finally, using observations of the interactions between dimpled and\nbudded domains, we build a theoretical framework with an elastic model that\nmaps the free energies and allowed transitions in domain morphology upon\ncoalescence, to serve as an interpretive tool for understanding the algebra of\ndomain morphology. In all three cases, the two major factors that regulate\ndomain morphology and morphological transitions are the domain size and\nmembrane tension.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2009 13:22:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Ursell", "Tristan", ""], ["Phillips", "Rob", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2145", "submitter": "Peter Borowski", "authors": "Peter Borowski, Eric N.

This\narticle investigates physical limits on brain wiring and corresponding changes\nin brain temperature that are imposed by thermodynamics of heat balance\ndetermined mainly by Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$-ATPase, cerebral blood flow, and heat\nconduction. It is found that even moderate firing rates cause significant\nintracellular Na$^{+}$ build-up, and the ATP consumption rate associated with\npumping out these ions grows nonlinearly with frequency. Surprisingly, the\npower dissipated by the Na$^{+}$/K$^{+}$ pump depends biphasically on\nfrequency, which can lead to the biphasic dependence of brain temperature on\nfrequency as well. Both the total power of sodium pumps and brain temperature\ndiverge for very small fiber diameters, indicating that too thin fibers are not\nbeneficial for thermal balance. For very small brains blood flow is not a\nsufficient cooling mechanism deep in the brain. The theoretical lower bound on\nfiber diameter above which brain temperature is in the operational regime is\nstrongly frequency dependent but finite due to synaptic depression. For normal\nneurophysiological conditions this bound is at least an order of magnitude\nsmaller than average values of empirical fiber diameters, suggesting that\nneuroanatomy of the mammalian brains operates in the thermodynamically safe\nregime. Analytical formulas presented can be used to estimate average firing\nrates in mammals, and relate their changes to changes in brain temperature,\nwhich can have important practical applications.
