Microtubules undergo so-called\ncatastrophes, which are abrupt stochastic transitions from a growing to a\nshrinking state, and rescues, which are transitions back to the growing state.\nMicrotubules can exert pushing or polymerization forces on an obstacle, such as\nan elastic barrier if the growing end is in contact with the obstacle. We use\ndynamical mean-field theory and stochastic simulations to analyze a model where\neach microtubule undergoes catastrophes and rescues and where microtubules\ninteract by force sharing. For zero rescue rate, cooperative growth terminates\nin a collective catastrophe. The maximal polymerization force before\ncatastrophes grows linearly with N for small N or a stiff elastic barrier, in\nagreement with available experimental results, whereas it crosses over to a\nlogarithmic dependence for larger N or a soft elastic barrier. For a nonzero\nrescue rate and a soft elastic barrier, the dynamics becomes oscillatory with\nboth collective catastrophe and rescue events, which are part of a robust limit\ncycle. Both the average and maximal polymerization forces then grow linearly\nwith N, and we investigate their dependence on tubulin on-rates and rescue\nrates, which can be involved in cellular regulation mechanisms. We further\ninvestigate the robustness of the collective catastrophe and rescue\noscillations with respect to different catastrophe models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 11:29:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Zelinski", "Bj\u00f6rn", ""], ["Kierfeld", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.1829", "submitter": "Sandip Ghosal", "authors": "Guohui Hu, Mao Mao, Sandip Ghosal", "title": "Ion transport through a graphene nanopore", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Nanotechnology vol.23 (2012) 395501", "doi": "10.1088/0957-4484/23/39/395501", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.chem-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Molecular dynamics simulation is utilized to investigate the ionic transport\nof NaCl in solution through a graphene nanopore under an applied electric\nfield.
