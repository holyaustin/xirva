These are driven by a chemical fuel, namely, adenosine\ntriphosphate (ATP). CREs actively participate in many cellular processes that\nrequire accessibility of specific segments of DNA which are packaged as\nchromatin. The basic unit of chromatin is a nucleosome where 146 bp $\\sim$ 50\nnm of a double stranded DNA (dsDNA) is wrapped around a spool formed by histone\nproteins. The helical path of histone-DNA contact on a nucleosome is also\ncalled \"footprint\". We investigate the mechanism of footprint traversal by a\nCRE that translocates along the dsDNA. Our two-state model of a CRE captures\neffectively two distinct chemical (or conformational) states in the\nmechano-chemical cycle of each ATP-dependent CRE. We calculate the mean time of\ntraversal. Our predictions on the ATP-dependence of the mean traversal time can\nbe tested by carrying out {\\it in-vitro} experiments on mono-nucleosomes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 16:28:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Jan 2012 19:00:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 14 Mar 2012 18:08:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Garai", "Ashok", ""], ["Mani", "Jesrael", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1507", "submitter": "Carla Goldman", "authors": "Lucas W.

In this context, hopping process expresses the\npossibility for cargo to be exchanged between neighbor motors at a microtubule\nwhere the transport takes place. Jamming of motors is essential for cargos to\nexecute long-range movement in this way. Results from computer simulations\nperformed using the extended model indicate that cargo may execute\nbidirectional movement in the presence of motors of a single polarity,\nconfirming previous analytical results. Moreover, these results suggest the\nexistence of a balance between cargo hopping and the movement of the complex\nthat may control the efficiency of cargo transfer and cargo delivering.\nConsiderations about the energy involved in the transport process show that the\nmodel presented here offers a considerable advantage over other models in the\nliterature for which cargo movement is restricted to the movement of\ncargo-motor complexes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jul 2011 20:09:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2011 20:07:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 15:47:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-27", "authors_parsed": [["Rossi", "Lucas W.", ""], ["Goldman", "Carla", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.1702", "submitter": "Eugene Surdutovich", "authors": "Eugene Surdutovich, David C.

The analysis and assessment of complex damage is important because\ncells in which it occurs are less likely to survive because the DNA repair\nmechanisms may not be sufficiently effective. We studied the flux of secondary\nelectrons through the surface of nucleosomes and calculated the radial dose and\nthe distribution of clustered damage around the ion's track. The calculated\nradial dose distribution is compared to simulations. The radial distribution of\nthe complex damage is found to be different from that of the dose. Comparison\nwith experiments may solve the question of what is more lethal for the cell,\ndamage complexity or absorbed energy. We suggest a way to calculate the\nprobability of cell death based on the complexity of the damage.

New ratcheting molecules bind at rate gamma. Extending\nour previous approach (Depperschmidt and Pfaffelhuber, 2010) we allow the\nratcheting molecules to dissociate (at rate delta) from the protein (Model I).\nWe also provide an approximate model (Model II) which assumes a Poisson\nequilibrium of ratcheting molecules on one side of the current reflection\nboundary. Using analytical methods and simulations we show that the speed of\nboth models are approximately the same.
