We proceed to\nunderstand the general pattern forming potential of aster-motor systems using a\ncomputational model of multiple MT asters interacting with motors in a cellular\nconfinement. In this model dynein motors are attached to the cell cortex and\nplus-ended motors resembling kinesin-5 diffuse in the cell interior. The\nintroduction of 'noise' in the form of MT length fluctuations spontaneously\nresults in the emergence of coordinated, achiral vortex-like rotation of\nasters. The coherence and persistence of rotation requires a threshold density\nof both cortical dyneins and coupling kinesins, while the onset of rotation if\ndiffusion-limited with relation to cortical dynein mobility. The coordinated\nrotational motion arises due to the resolution of the 'tug-of-war' of the\nrotational component due to cortical motors by 'noise' in the form of MT\ndynamic instability, and such transient symmetry breaking is amplified by local\ncoupling by kinesin-5 complexes. The lack of widespread aster rotation across\ncell types suggests biophysical mechanisms that suppress such intrinsic\ndynamics may have evolved. This model is analogous to more general models of\nlocally coupled self-propelled particles (SPP) that spontaneously undergo\ncollective transport in presence of 'noise' that have been invoked to explain\nswarming in birds and fish. However, the aster-motor system is distinct from\nSPP models with regard to particle density and 'noise' dependence, providing a\nset of experimentally testable predictions for a novel sub-cellular pattern\nforming system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2020 06:55:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Khetan", "Neha", ""], ["Athale", "Chaitanya A.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.07772", "submitter": "Manuel Razo-Mejia", "authors": "Muir J.

Precision measurements using a host of different techniques including\nfluorescence and sequencing readouts have raised the bar for what it means to\nquantitatively understand transcriptional regulation. In particular our\nunderstanding of the simplest genetic circuit is sufficiently refined both\nexperimentally and theoretically that it has become possible to carefully\ndiscriminate between different conceptual pictures of how this regulatory\nsystem works. This regulatory motif, originally posited by Jacob and Monod in\nthe 1960s, consists of a single transcriptional repressor binding to a promoter\nsite and inhibiting transcription. In this paper, we show how seven distinct\nmodels of this so-called simple-repression motif, based both on equilibrium and\nkinetic thinking, can be used to derive the predicted levels of gene expression\nand shed light on the often surprising past success of the equilbrium models.\nThese different models are then invoked to confront a variety of different data\non mean, variance and full gene expression distributions, illustrating the\nextent to which such models can and cannot be distinguished, and suggesting a\ntwo-state model with a distribution of burst sizes as the most potent of the\nseven for describing the simple-repression motif.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Jun 2020 02:28:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-09", "authors_parsed": [["Morrison", "Muir J.", ""], ["Razo-Mejia", "Manuel", ""], ["Phillips", "Rob", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.10416", "submitter": "Ad\\'ela\\\"ide Raguin", "authors": "Ad\\'ela\\\"ide Raguin, Norbert Kern, Andrea Parmeggiani", "title": "Stochastic modelling of collective motor protein transport through a\n  crossing of microtubules", "comments": "21 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110370", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The cytoskeleton in eukaryotic cells plays several crucial roles. In terms of\nintracellular transport, motor proteins use the cytoskeletal filaments as a\nbackbone along which they can actively transport biological cargos such as\nvesicles carrying biochemical reactants. Crossings between such filaments\nconstitute a key element, as they may serve to alter the destination of such\npayload. Although motor proteins are known to display a rich behaviour at such\ncrossings, the latter have so far only been modelled as simple branching\npoints. Here we explore a model for a crossing between two microtubules which\nretains the individual tracks consisting of protofilaments, and we construct a\nschematic representation of the transport paths. We study collective transport\nexemplified by the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP), and\nprovide a full analysis of the transport features and the associated phase\ndiagram, by a generic mean-field approach which we confirm through\nparticle-based stochastic simulations. In particular we show that transport\nthrough such a compound crossing cannot be approximated from a coarse-grained\nstructure with a simple branching point. Instead, it gives rise to entirely new\nand counterintuitive features: the fundamental current-density relation for\ntraffic flow is no longer a single-valued function, and it furthermore differs\naccording to whether it is observed upstream or downstream from the crossing.\nWe argue that these novel features may be directly relevant for interpreting\nexperimental measurements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:46:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-20", "authors_parsed": [["Raguin", "Ad\u00e9la\u00efde", ""], ["Kern", "Norbert", ""], ["Parmeggiani", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16486", "submitter": "Andrey Kuznetsov", "authors": "Ivan A.

Two separate sets of kinetic constants were determined, one in the axon\nand the other in the AIS. This was done by fitting the model predictions in the\naxon with experimental results and by fitting the model predictions in the AIS\nwith the assumed linear increase of the total tau concentration in the AIS. The\ncalibrated model was used to make predictions about tau transport in the axon\nand in the AIS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that\npresents a mathematical model of tau transport in the AIS. Our modeling results\nsuggest that binding of free tau to MTs creates a negative gradient of free tau\nin the AIS. This leads to diffusion-driven tau transport from the soma into the\nAIS. The model further suggests that slow axonal transport and diffusion-driven\ntransport of tau work together in the AIS, moving tau anterogradely. Our\nnumerical results predict an interplay between these two mechanisms: as the\ndistance from the soma increases, the diffusion-driven transport decreases,\nwhile motor-driven transport becomes larger. Thus, the machinery in the AIS\nworks as a pump, moving tau into the axon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 02:36:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 15:55:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Kuznetsov", "Ivan A.", ""], ["Kuznetsov", "Andrey V.", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16758", "submitter": "Daniel Wilson", "authors": "Daniel B.

Geometric\nrestrictions in an environment can hinder the motion of individuals and,\ncombined with crowding between the individuals, can have drastic effects on\nglobal transport behaviour. However, in general, the interplay between crowding\nand geometry is poorly understood. Existing techniques to predict the behaviour\nof crowded transport processes approximate complex environments as\nhigh-dimensional meshes and use computationally expensive models that lack the\nability to reveal the functional influence of geometry and crowding on\ntransport. Here, we employ networked representations of complex environments\nand provide an efficient, foundational framework within which the combined\nroles of geometry and crowding can be explored. Multiple models of crowded,\nnetworked transport are derived that are capable of extracting detailed\ninformation at both the level of the whole population or an individual within\nit. A combination of theoretical and numerical analysis identifies critical\ntopological features of environments that enable accurate prediction of\ntemporal and spatial transport statistics, as well as insight into the design\nof optimal networks. Our approach is applicable to transport processes across a\nbroad range of scientific disciplines, bypasses traditional computational\nchallenges of discretisation, and establishes a unified connection between\ngeometry, crowding and transport.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:15:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Jul 2020 11:40:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2020 10:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Wilson", "Daniel B.", ""], ["Woodhouse", "Francis G.", ""], ["Simpson", "Matthew J.", ""], ["Baker", "Ruth E.", ""]]}]
