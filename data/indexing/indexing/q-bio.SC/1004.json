Such tomograms reveal that the inner membrane self-assembles into a\ncomplex structure that contains both tubular and flat lamellar crista\ncomponents. This structure, which contains one matrix compartment, is believed\nto be essential to the proper functioning of mitochondria as the powerhouse of\nthe cell. We find that tensile forces of the order of 10 pN are required to\nstabilize a stress-induced coexistence of tubular and flat lamellar cristae\nphases.

Our current understanding of this motion\nis based on a number of detailed computational models. Although these models\nrealize possible mechanisms for force transduction, they can be extended by\nvariation of any of a large number of poorly measured parameters and there is\nno clear strategy for determining how they might be distinguished\nexperimentally. Here we seek to identify and analyze two distinct mechanisms\npresent in the computational models. In the first the splayed protofilaments at\nthe end of the depolymerizing MT physically prevent the Dam1 ring from falling\noff the end, in the other an attractive binding secures the ring to the\nmicrotubule. Based on this analysis, we discuss how to distinguish between\ncompeting models that seek to explain how the Dam1 ring stays on the MT.

A\nkinetic model with two calcium sensors is formulated specifically for the\nCA3-CA1 synapse. The model includes a sensor for fast synchronous release that\nlasts a few tens of milliseconds and a sensor for slow asynchronous release\nthat lasts a few hundred milliseconds. We show that a variety of extant data on\nCA3-CA1 synapse can be accounted for consistently only when a refractory period\nof the order of few milliseconds between releases is introduced. Including a\nsecond sensor for asynchronous release that has a slow unbinding site and\ntherefore an embedded long memory, is shown to play a role in short-term\nplasticity by facilitating release. For synchronous release mediated by\nSynaptotagmin II a third time scale is revealed in addition to the fast and\nslow release. This third time scale corresponds to \"stimulus-correlated\nsuper-fast\" neurotransmitter release. Our detailed spatial simulation indicates\nthat all three-time scales of neurotransmitter release are an emergent property\nof the calcium sensor and independent of synaptic ultrastructure. Furthermore,\nit allows us to identify features of synaptic transmission that are universal\nand those that are modulated by structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2010 17:23:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Nadkarni", "Suhita", ""], ["Bartol", "Thomas", ""], ["Sejnowski", "Terrence", ""], ["Levine", "Herbert", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.4327", "submitter": "Debashish Chowdhury", "authors": "Ashok Garai and Debashish Chowdhury", "title": "Stochastic kinetics of a single headed motor protein: dwell time\n  distribution of KIF1A", "comments": "Author-edited final version published in EPL", "journal-ref": "EPL (Europhysics Letters), 93 (2011) 59004", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/93/58004", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  KIF1A, a processive single headed kinesin superfamily motor, hydrolyzes\nAdenosine triphosphate (ATP) to move along a filamentous track called\nmicrotubule.
