The following physiological indexes were determined: arterial blood\npressure, pulse frequency, and frequency of breathing. The physical stress\nproduced by the dosed physical activity causes the considerable increase of\ndegree of heterochromatinization in the cell nuclei of human buccal epithelium.\nAs a rule, the level of heterochromatinization increases after first stage of\ntraining, but in some donors it increases significantly only after the second\nstage of training.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Jan 2009 21:25:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Jun 2012 07:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Shckorbatov", "Yuriy", ""], ["Samokhvalov", "Valeriy", ""], ["Bevziuk", "Dariya", ""], ["Kovaliov", "Maxim", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.2766", "submitter": "Thomas Risler", "authors": "Andrei S.

The\nextent to which the gating of independent transduction channels is coordinated\ndepends on how tightly individual stereocilia are constrained to move as a\nunit. Using dual-beam interferometry in the bullfrog's sacculus, we found that\nthermal movements of stereocilia located as far apart as a bundle's opposite\nedges display high coherence and negligible phase lag. Because the mechanical\ndegrees of freedom of stereocilia are strongly constrained, a force applied\nanywhere in the hair bundle deflects the structure as a unit.

In accordance\nwith the prevailing model of LD formation, we assumed that neutral lipids\noil-out between the membrane leaflets of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),\nresulting in LD that bud-off when a critical size is reached.\n  Mathematically, LD were modeled as spherical protuberances in an otherwise\nplanar ER membrane. We estimated the local phospholipid composition, and\ncalculated the change in elastic free energy of the membrane caused by nascent\nLD. Based on this model calculation, we found a gradual demixing of lipids in\nthe membrane leaflet that goes along with an increase in surface curvature at\nthe site of LD formation. During demixing, the phospholipid monolayer was able\nto gain energy during LD growth, which suggested that the formation of curved\ninterfaces was supported by or even driven by lipid demixing. In addition, we\nshow that demixing is thermodynamically necessary as LD cannot bud-off\notherwise.\n  In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae our model predicts a LD bud-off\ndiameter of about 13 nm. This diameter is far below the experimentally\ndetermined size of typical yeast LD. Thus, we concluded that if the standard\nmodel of LD formation is valid, LD biogenesis is a two step process.

However, despite\nexperimental and theoretical efforts undertaken in the last decades, the role\nof this excitability for some kind of dendritic computation has remained\nelusive. Here we show that, owing to very general properties of excitable\nmedia, the average output of a model of active dendritic trees is a highly\nnon-linear function of their afferent rate, attaining extremely large dynamic\nranges (above 50 dB). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response\nfunctions as experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We claim that\nenhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic\nconductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have\nlarger dynamic range and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a\ndecrease of dynamic range.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2009 11:09:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Aug 2009 13:37:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Gollo", "Leonardo L.", ""], ["Kinouchi", "Osame", ""], ["Copelli", "Mauro", ""]]}]
