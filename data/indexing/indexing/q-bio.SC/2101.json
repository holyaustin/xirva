We find its solution in the long time limit describing non-uniform\ndistribution due to a space dependent fractional exponent. In the continuous\nspace limit, the solution of this fractional master equation is found to be\nexactly the same as the space-dependent variable-order fractional diffusion\nequation. In addition, we show that the clustering of lysosomes, an essential\norganelle for healthy functioning of mammalian cells, exhibit space-dependent\nfractional exponents. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the non-uniform\ndistribution of lysosomes in living cells is accurately described by the\nasymptotic solution of the space-dependent variable-order fractional master\nequation. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations of the fractional master equation\nvalidate our analytical solution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2021 18:58:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-22", "authors_parsed": [["Fedotov", "Sergei", ""], ["Han", "Daniel", ""], ["Zubarev", "Andrey Yu.", ""], ["Johnston", "Mark", ""], ["Allan", "Victoria J", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.02947", "submitter": "Michael Grinfeld", "authors": "Michael Grinfeld", "title": "An enzymatic hormesis box", "comments": "7 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  We present a simple enzymatic system that is capable of a biphasic response\nunder competitive inhibition.

The goal of this review is to synthesize published studies on the\nmembrane trafficking of the five major junction transmembrane proteins:\nclaudins, occludin, and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs) in tight junctions;\ncadherins and nectins in adherens junctions; to identify underlying common\nmechanisms; to highlight their functional consequences on barrier function; and\nto identify knowledge gaps. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis appears to be the\nmain, but not exclusive, mode of internalization. Caveolin-mediated endocytosis\nand macropinocytosis are employed less frequently. PDZ-domain binding is the\npredominant mode of interaction between junction protein cytoplasmic tails and\nscaffold proteins. It is shared by claudins, the largest family of junction\nintegral proteins, by junction adhesion molecules A, B, and C, and by the three\nnectins. All eight proteins are destined to either recycling via Rab4/Rab11\nGTPases or to degradation. The sorting mechanisms that underlie the specificity\nof their endocytic pathways and determine their fates are not fully known. New\ndata is presented to introduce an emerging role of junction-associated scaffold\nproteins in claudin membrane trafficking.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Jan 2021 17:34:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2021 15:50:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2021 16:19:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2021 01:51:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2021 00:11:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:12:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Horowitz", "Arie", ""]]}]
