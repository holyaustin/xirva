We define, and analytically calculate, two different measures of the\nefficiency of this machine. However, we arugue that its performance is\nevaluated better in terms of the translational fidelity and the speed with\nwhich it polymerizes a protein. We define both these quantities and calculate\nthese analytically. Fidelity is a measure of the quality of the products while\nthe total quantity of products synthesized in a given interval depends on the\nspeed of polymerization. We show that for synthesizing a large quantity of\nproteins, it is not necessary to sacrifice the quality. We also explore the\neffects of the quality control mechanism on the strength of mechano-chemical\ncoupling. We suggest experiments for testing some of the ideas presented here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2010 10:31:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jun 2010 04:40:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Sep 2010 09:08:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Ajeet K.", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.1503", "submitter": "Pablo Fern\\'andez", "authors": "Pablo Fernandez and Pramod A.

By disrupting the\ncell cytoskeleton with specific drugs we investigate the role of its individual\ncomponents in the volume regulation response. We find that microtubule\ndisruption increases both swelling rate and maximum volume attained, but does\nnot affect the ability of the neurite to recover its initial volume. In\naddition, investigation of axonal beading --also known as pearling\ninstability-- provides additional clues on the mechanical state of the neurite.\nWe conclude that the initial swelling phase is mechanically slowed down by\nmicrotubules, while the volume recovery is driven by passive diffusion of\nosmolites. Our experiments provide a framework to investigate the role of\ncytoskeletal mechanics in volume homeostasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Jun 2010 09:42:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Fernandez", "Pablo", ""], ["Pullarkat", "Pramod A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.4055", "submitter": "M.
