Accompanying differences in signal duration are numerous\ndownstream biological processes that require multiple steps of biochemical\nregulation. Here, we present an analysis that investigates how simple\nbiochemical motifs that involve multiple stages of regulation can be\nconstructed to differentially process signals that persist at different time\nscales. We compute the dynamic gain within these networks and resulting power\nspectra to better understand how biochemical networks can integrate signals at\ndifferent time scales. We identify topological features of these networks that\nallow for different frequency dependent signal processing properties. Our\nstudies suggest design principles for why signal duration in connection with\nmultiple steps of downstream regulation is a ubiquitous control motif in\nbiochemical systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Feb 2008 17:01:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Locasale", "Jason W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3744", "submitter": "Ronald Kwon", "authors": "Ronald Y.

Salient features of the models include the possibility to\nrepresent anisotropic mechanical behavior resulting from anisotropic filament\ndistributions, and a power-law scaling of the mechanical properties with the\nfilament density. Mechanical models within the class are parameterized by seven\ndifferent constants. We demonstrate a procedure for determining these constants\nusing finite element models of three-dimensional actin networks. Actin\nfilaments and cross-links were modeled as elastic rods, and the networks were\nconstructed at physiological volume fractions and at the scale of an image\nvoxel. We show the performance of the model in estimating the mechanical\nbehavior of the networks over a wide range of filament densities and degrees of\nanisotropy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2008 05:07:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kwon", "Ronald Y.", ""], ["Lew", "Adrian J.", ""], ["Jacobs", "Christopher R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.4419", "submitter": "Fernando Falo", "authors": "Javier Munarriz, Juan J.
