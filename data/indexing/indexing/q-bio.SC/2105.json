This is particularly true in the case of the large enzymatic complexes\nknown as metabolons, which contain different enzymes that participate in the\nsame catalytic pathway. One possible explanation for this self-organization is\nthe combination of the catalytic activity of the enzymes and a chemotactic\nresponse to gradients of their substrate, which leads to a substrate-mediated\neffective interaction between enzymes. These interactions constitute a purely\nnon-equilibrium effect and show exotic features such as non-reciprocity. Here,\nwe analytically study a model describing the phase separation of a mixture of\nsuch catalytically-active particles. We show that a Michaelis-Menten-like\ndependence of the particles' activities manifests itself as a screening of the\ninteractions, and that a mixture of two differently-sized active species can\nexhibit phase separation with transient oscillations. We also derive a rich\nstability phase diagram for a mixture of two species with both\nconcentration-dependent activity and size dispersity. This work highlights the\nvariety of possible phase separation behaviours in mixtures of\nchemically-active particles, which provides an alternative pathway to the\npassive interactions more commonly associated with phase separation in cells.\nOur results highlight non-equilibrium organizing principles that can be\nimportant for biologically relevant liquid-liquid phase separation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2021 14:09:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 May 2021 06:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ouazan-Reboul", "Vincent", ""], ["Agudo-Canalejo", "Jaime", ""], ["Golestanian", "Ramin", ""]]}, {"id": "2105.02348", "submitter": "Brian Camley", "authors": "Daniel W.

Experiments tracking\nthe behavior of cell-attached objects have observed anomalous diffusion with a\ndistribution of displacements that is non-Gaussian, with heavy tails. This has\nbeen attributed to \"cytoquakes\" or other spatially extended collective effects.\nWe show, using simulations and analytical theory, that a simple continuum\nactive gel model driven by fluctuating force dipoles naturally creates heavy\npower-law tails in cytoskeletal displacements. We predict that this power law\nexponent should depend on the geometry and dimensionality of where force\ndipoles are distributed through the cell; we find qualitatively different\nresults for force dipoles in a 3D cytoskeleton and a quasi-two-dimensional\ncortex.
