In cells, the MT growth rate is inhibited by cytosolic stathmin,\nwhich, in turn, is inactivated by Rac1. Growing MTs activate Rac1 at the cell\nedge, which closes a positive feedback loop. We investigate both tubulin\nsequestering and catastrophe promotion as mechanisms for MT growth inhibition\nby stathmin. For a homogeneous stathmin concentration in the absence of Rac1,\nwe find a switch-like regulation of the MT mean length by stathmin. For\nconstitutively active Rac1 at the cell edge, stathmin is deactivated locally,\nwhich establishes a spatial gradient of active stathmin. In this gradient, we\nfind a stationary bimodal MT length distributions for both mechanisms of MT\ngrowth inhibition by stathmin. One subpopulation of the bimodal length\ndistribution can be identified with fast growing and long pioneering MTs in the\nregion near the cell edge, which have been observed experimentally. The\nfeedback loop is closed through Rac1 activation by MTs. For tubulin\nsequestering by stathmin, this establishes a bistable switch with two stable\nstates: one stable state corresponds to upregulated MT mean length and bimodal\nMT length distributions, i.e., pioneering MTs; the other stable state\ncorresponds to an interrupted feedback with short MTs. Stochastic effects as\nwell as external perturbations can trigger switching events.

However, most mathematical and\ncomputational models ignore the details of the motor-cargo interaction. Here,\nwe study a generic model in which N motors are elastically coupled to a cargo,\nwhich itself is subjected to thermal noise in the cytoplasm and to an\nadditional external applied force. The motor-hopping rates are chosen to\nsatisfy detailed balance with respect to the energy of elastic stretching. With\nthese assumptions, an (N+1)-variable master equation is constructed for\ndynamics of the motor-cargo complex. By expanding the hopping rates to linear\norder in fluctuations in motor positions, we obtain a linear Fokker-Planck\nequation. The deterministic equations governing the average quantities are\nseparated out and explicit analytical expressions are obtained for the mean\nvelocity and diffusion coefficient of the cargo. We also study the statistical\nfeatures of the force experienced by an individual motor and quantitatively\ncharacterize the load-sharing among the cargo-bound motors. The mean cargo\nvelocity and the effective diffusion coefficient are found to be decreasing\nfunctions of the stiffness. While increase in the number of motors N does not\nincrease the velocity substantially, it decreases the effective diffusion\ncoefficient which falls as 1/N asymptotically. We further show that the\ncargo-bound motors share the force exerted on the cargo equally only in the\nlimit of vanishing elastic stiffness; as stiffness is increased, deviations\nfrom equal load sharing are observed. Numerical simulations agree with our\nanalytical results where expected. Interestingly, we find in simulations that\nthe stall force of a cargo elastically coupled to motors is independent of the\nstiffness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 11:21:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 09:29:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bhat", "Deepak", ""], ["Gopalakrishnan", "Manoj", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5955", "submitter": "Yasushi Saka", "authors": "Yasushi Saka, Claudiu V.

The\ninteraction between kinetochores and microtubules is highly dynamic with\nfrequent attachments and detachments. However, it remains unclear how\nchromosome bi-orientation is achieved with such accuracy in such a dynamic\nprocess.\n  Results: To gain new insight into this essential process, we have developed a\nsimple mathematical model of kinetochore-microtubule interactions during cell\ndivision in general, i.e. both mitosis and meiosis. Firstly, the model reveals\nthat the balance between attachment and detachment probabilities of kMTs is\ncrucial for correct chromosome bi-orientation. With the right balance,\nincorrect attachments are resolved spontaneously into correct bi-oriented\nconformations while an imbalance leads to persistent errors. In addition, the\nmodel explains why errors are more commonly found in the first meiotic division\n(meiosis I) than in mitosis and how a faulty conformation can evade the spindle\nassembly checkpoint, which may lead to a chromosome loss.\n  Conclusions: The proposed model, despite its simplicity, helps us understand\none of the primary causes of chromosomal instability - aberrant\nkinetochore-microtubule interactions. The model reveals that chromosome\nbi-orientation is a probabilistic self-organization, rather than a\nsophisticated process of error detection and correction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 17:23:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 16:53:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Saka", "Yasushi", ""], ["Giuraniuc", "Claudiu V.", ""], ["Ohkura", "Hiroyuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5982", "submitter": "Anna Ochab-Marcinek", "authors": "Anna Ochab-Marcinek and Marcin Tabaka", "title": "Transcriptional leakage versus noise: A simple mechanism of conversion\n  between binary and graded response in autoregulated genes", "comments": "8 pages, 6 figures, published in Physical Review E,\n  http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.91.012704 , copyright APS.
