Each kinetochore has to establish a\ntight bipolar attachment to the spindle apparatus before sister-chromatid\nseparation is initiated. The Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) links the\nbiophysical attachment status of the kinetochores to mitotic progression, and\nensures that even a single misaligned kinetochore keeps the checkpoint active.\nThe mechanism by which this is achieved is still elusive. Current computational\nmodels of the human SAC disregard important biochemical properties by omitting\nany kind of feedback loop, proper kinetochore signals, and other spatial\nproperties such as the stability of the system and diffusion effects. To allow\nfor more realistic in silico study of the dynamics of the SAC model, a minimal\nmathematical framework for SAC activation and silencing is introduced. A\nnonlinear ordinary differential equation model successfully reproduces\nbifurcation signaling switches with attachment of all 92 kinetochores and\nactivation of APC/C by kinetochore-driven feedback. A partial differential\nequation model and mathematical linear stability analyses indicate the\ninfluence of diffusion and system stability. The conclusion is that\nquantitative models of the human SAC should account for the positive feedback\non APC/C activation driven by the kinetochores which is essential for SAC\nsilencing. Experimental diffusion coefficients for MCC sub-complexes are found\nto be insufficient for rapid APC/C inhibition. The presented analysis allows\nfor systems-level understanding of mitotic control and the minimal new model\ncan function as a basis for developing further quantitative-integrative models\nof the cell division cycle\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 13:52:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ibrahim", "Bashar", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.04867", "submitter": "Guillermo Lazaro", "authors": "Guillermo R.

However, the presence of a nucleocapsid core is not required for\nassembly of infectious particles. To determine the role of the nucleocapsid\ncore, we develop a coarse-grained computational model with which we investigate\nbudding dynamics as a function of glycoprotein and nucleocapsid interactions,\nas well as budding in the absence of a nucleocapsid. We find that there is a\ntransition between glycoprotein-directed budding and nucleocapsid-directed\nbudding which occurs above a threshold strength of nucleocapsid interactions.\nThe simulations predict that glycoprotein-directed budding leads to\nsignificantly increased size polydispersity and particle polymorphism. This\npolydispersity can be qualitatively explained by a theoretical model accounting\nfor the competition between bending energy of the membrane and the glycoprotein\nshell. The simulations also show that the geometry of a budding particle leads\nto a barrier to subunit diffusion, which can result in a stalled, partially\nbudded state. We present a phase diagram for this and other morphologies of\nbudded particles. Comparison of these structures against experiments could\nestablish bounds on whether budding is directed by glycoprotein or nucleocapsid\ninteractions. Although our model is motivated by alphaviruses, we discuss\nimplications of our results for other enveloped viruses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 13:47:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 18:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lazaro", "Guillermo R.", ""], ["Mukhopadhyay", "Suchetana", ""], ["Hagan", "Michael F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.07660", "submitter": "Vaibhav Wasnik", "authors": "Vaibhav H.
