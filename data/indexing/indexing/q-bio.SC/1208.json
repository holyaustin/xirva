Many vital molecules and pieces of cellular machinery diffuse within\ncells, moving along random trajectories as they collide with the other\nbiomolecular inhabitants of the cell. Cellular components may block each\nother's progress, be produced or degraded at random times, and become unevenly\nseparated as cells grow and divide. Cellular behaviour, including important\nfeatures of stem cells, tumours and infectious bacteria, is profoundly\ninfluenced by the chaos which is the environment within the cell walls. Here we\nwill look at some important causes and effects of randomness in cellular\nbiology, and some ways in which researchers, helped by the vast amounts of data\nthat are now flowing in, have made progress in describing the randomness of\nnature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 19:01:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Johnston", "Iain G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5360", "submitter": "Filipe Tostevin", "authors": "Marlo Flores, Thomas S.

Here we use numerical simulations to show that an\nintermediate level of noise in the slow methylation dynamics enhances drift\nwhile not compromising localisation near concentration peaks. A minimal model\nshows how such an optimal noise level arises from the interplay of noise and\nthe dependence of the motor response on the network output. Our results suggest\nthat cells can exploit noise to improve chemotactic performance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Aug 2012 11:00:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Oct 2012 08:27:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Flores", "Marlo", ""], ["Shimuzu", "Thomas S.", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Tostevin", "Filipe", ""]]}]
