The author uses a\n\"piston\" analogy for bacterial chromosomes in a cell, which leads to a phase\ndiagram for the organization of two athermal chains confined in a closed\ngeometry characterized by two length scales (length and width). When applied to\nrod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this phase diagram predicts that,\ndespite strong confinement, duplicated chromosomes will demix, i.e., there\nexists a primordial physical driving force for chromosome segregation. The\nauthor discusses segregation of duplicating chromosomes using the\nconcentric-shell model, which predicts that newly synthesized DNA will be found\nin the periphery of the chromosome during replication. In contrast to\nchromosomes, these results suggest that most plasmids will be randomly\ndistributed inside the cell because of their small sizes. An active\npartitioning system is therefore required for accurate segregation of low-copy\nnumber plasmids. Implications of these results are also sketched, e.g., on the\nrole of proteins, segregation mechanisms for bacteria of diverse shapes, cell\ncycle of an artificial cell, and evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Aug 2008 20:18:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 14:16:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jun", "Suckjoon", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.3099", "submitter": "David Pincus", "authors": "D.

Drawing largely on the methods\ndeveloped in our group over the last twenty years, we describe a number of key\napplications ranging from folding of proteins with disulfide bonds to functions\nof molecular machines. After presenting the theoretical basis that justifies\nthe use of CG models, we explore the biophysical basis for the emergence of a\nfinite number of folds from lattice models. The lattice model simulations of\napproach to the folded state show that non-native interactions are relevant\nonly early in the folding process - a finding that rationalizes the success of\nstructure-based models that emphasize native interactions. Applications of\noff-lattice $C_{\\alpha}$ and models that explicitly consider side chains\n($C_{\\alpha}$-SCM) to folding of $\\beta$-hairpin and effects of macromolecular\ncrowding are briefly discussed. Successful application of a new class of\noff-lattice model, referred to as the Self-Organized Polymer (SOP), is shown by\ndescribing the response of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) to mechanical force.\nThe utility of the SOP model is further illustrated by applications that\nclarify the functions of the chaperonin GroEL and motion of the molecular motor\nkinesin. We also present two distinct models for RNA, namely, the Three Site\nInteraction (TIS) model and the SOP model, that probe forced unfolding and\nforce quench refolding of a simple hairpin and {\\it Azoarcus} ribozyme. The\npredictions based on the SOP model show that force-induced unfolding pathways\nof the ribozyme can be dramatically changed by varying the loading rate. We\nconclude with a discussion of future prospects for the use of coarse-grained\nmodels in addressing problems of outstanding interest in biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2008 15:05:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Pincus", "D.
