In this work, we\ninvestigate the non-Gaussian diffusion in static disordered media via a\nquenched trap model, where the diffusivity is spatially correlated. Several\nunique effects due to quenched disorder are reported. We analytically estimate\nthe diffusion coefficient $D_{\\text{dis}}$ and its fluctuation over samples of\nfinite size. We show a mechanism of population splitting in the non-Gaussian\ndiffusion. It results in a sharp peak in the distribution of displacement\n$P(x,t)$ around $x=0$, that has frequently been observed in experiments. We\nexamine the fidelity of the coarse-grained diffusion map, which is\nreconstructed from particle trajectories. Finally, we propose a procedure to\nestimate the correlation length in static disordered environments, where the\ninformation stored in the sample-to-sample fluctuation has been utilized.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Dec 2017 08:12:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Feb 2018 13:37:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 24 Mar 2018 12:25:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Luo", "Liang", ""], ["Yi", "Ming", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.02498", "submitter": "Simon Freedman", "authors": "Simon L.

A major challenge is to understand\nhow diverse structures of the actin cytoskeleton are assembled from a limited\nset of molecular building blocks. Here we study the spontaneous self-assembly\nof a minimal model of cytoskeletal materials, consisting of semiflexible actin\nfilaments, crosslinkers, and molecular motors. Using coarse-grained\nsimulations, we demonstrate that by changing concentrations and kinetics of\ncrosslinkers and motors we can generate three distinct structural phases of\nactomyosin assemblies: bundled, polarity-sorted, and contracted. We introduce\nnew metrics to distinguish these structural phases and demonstrate their\nfunctional roles. We find that the binding kinetics of motors and crosslinkers\ncan be tuned to optimize contractile force generation, motor transport, and\nmechanical response. By quantitatively characterizing the relationships between\nmodes of cytoskeletal self-assembly, the resulting structures, and their\nfunctional consequences, our work suggests new principles for the design of\nactive materials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Dec 2017 05:38:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Apr 2018 20:05:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Freedman", "Simon L.", ""], ["Hocky", "Glen M.", ""], ["Banerjee", "Shiladitya", ""], ["Dinner", "Aaron R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04112", "submitter": "Jian-Sheng Kang", "authors": "Jian-Sheng Kang", "title": "Theoretical Model and Characteristics of Mitochondrial Thermogenesis", "comments": "12 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": "Biophysics Reports 2018", "doi": "10.1007/s41048-018-0054-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Mitochondria of brown adipocyte (BA) are the main intracellular sites for\nthermogenesis, which have been targeted for therapy to reduce obesity.

In an attempt to fill\nthis gap we followed a combined experimental and theoretical approach by\ndissecting and modulating cargo binding, internalization and cellular response\nmediated by KDEL receptors (KDELRs) at the mammalian cell surface after\ninteraction with a model cargo/ligand. Using a fluorescent variant of ricin\ntoxin A chain as KDELR-ligand, eGFP-RTA (H/KDEL), we demonstrate that cargo\nbinding induces dose-dependent receptor cluster formation at and subsequent\ninternalization from the membrane which is associated and counteracted by\nanterograde and microtubule-assisted receptor transport to preferred docking\nsites at the plasma membrane. By means of analytical arguments and extensive\nnumerical simulations we show that cargo-synchronized receptor transport from\nand to the membrane is causative for KDELR/cargo cluster formation at the\nmammalian cell surface.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 17 Dec 2017 17:43:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Becker", "Bjorn", ""], ["Shaebani", "M.

How transcription, a fundamentally noisy molecular process, is\nregulated to achieve reliable embryonic patterning remains unclear. In\nparticular, it is unknown how gene-specific regulation mechanisms affect\nkinetic rates of transcription, and whether there are common, global features\nthat govern these rates across a genetic network. Here, we measure nascent\ntranscriptional activity in the gap gene network of early Drosophila embryos\nand characterize the variability in absolute activity levels across expression\nboundaries. We demonstrate that boundary formation follows a common\ntranscriptional principle: a single control parameter determines the\ndistribution of transcriptional activity, regardless of gene identity, boundary\nposition, or enhancer-promoter architecture. By employing a minimalist model of\ntranscription, we infer kinetic rates of transcriptional bursting for these\npatterning genes; we find that the key regulatory parameter is the fraction of\ntime a gene is in an actively transcribing state, while the rate of Pol II\nloading appears globally conserved. These results point to a universal\nsimplicity underlying the apparently complex transcriptional processes\nresponsible for early embryonic patterning and indicate a path to general rules\nin transcriptional regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Dec 2017 21:20:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Zoller", "Benjamin", ""], ["Little", "Shawn C.", ""], ["Gregor", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.08600", "submitter": "Thomas Risler", "authors": "Francesco Gianoli, Thomas Risler, Andrei S.

The key players involved in this\nprocess are mechanosensitive ion channels. They are located in the stereocilia\nof hair cells and opened by the tension in specialized molecular springs, the\ntip links, connecting adjacent stereocilia. When channels open, the tip links\nrelax, reducing the hair-bundle stiffness. This gating compliance makes hair\ncells especially sensitive to small stimuli. The classical explanation for the\ngating compliance is that the conformational rearrangement of a single channel\ndirectly shortens the tip link. However, to reconcile theoretical models based\non this mechanism with experimental data, an unrealistically large structural\nchange of the channel is required. Experimental evidence indicates that each\ntip link is a dimeric molecule, associated on average with two channels at its\nlower end. It also indicates that the lipid bilayer modulates channel gating,\nalthough it is not clear how. Here, we design and analyze a model of\nmechanotransduction where each tip link attaches to two channels, mobile within\nthe membrane. Their states and positions are coupled by membrane-mediated\nelastic forces arising from the interaction between the channels' hydrophobic\ncores and that of the lipid bilayer. This coupling induces cooperative opening\nand closing of the channels. The model reproduces the main properties of\nhair-cell mechanotransduction using only realistic parameters constrained by\nexperimental evidence. This work provides an insight into the fundamental role\nthat membrane-mediated ion-channel cooperativity can play in sensory\nphysiology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Dec 2017 18:11:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gianoli", "Francesco", ""], ["Risler", "Thomas", ""], ["Kozlov", "Andrei S.", ""]]}]
