Date hubs display low co-expression with\ntheir partners, whilst party hubs have high co-expression. It was proposed that\nparty hubs are local coordinators whereas date hubs are global connectors. Here\nwe show that the reported importance of date hubs to network connectivity can\nin fact be attributed to a tiny subset of them. Crucially, these few, extremely\ncentral, hubs do not display particularly low expression correlation,\nundermining the idea of a link between this quantity and hub function. The\ndate/party distinction was originally motivated by an approximately bimodal\ndistribution of hub co-expression; we show that this feature is not always\nrobust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs\ndo not in general correlate with co-expression. Thus, we suggest that a\ndate/party dichotomy is not meaningful and it might be more useful to conceive\nof roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. We\nfind significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional\nsimilarity of the interacting proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Nov 2009 23:44:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 5 May 2010 19:29:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-21", "authors_parsed": [["Agarwal", "Sumeet", ""], ["Deane", "Charlotte M.", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Jones", "Nick S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.0656", "submitter": "Randen Patterson", "authors": "Gaurav Bhardwaj, Christine P.

Furthermore, knock-out simulations of the IP3R,\nTRPC3, and multiple other proteins recapitulate experimentally derived results.\nThe potential of this approach can be observed by its ability to predict\npreviously undescribed cellular phenotypes using in vitro experimental data.\nIndeed our cellular analysis of the developmental and calcium-regulatory\nprotein, DANGER1a, confirms the counter-intuitive predictions from our Boolean\nmodels in two highly relevant cellular models.
