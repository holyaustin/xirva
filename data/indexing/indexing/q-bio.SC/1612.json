The effects of white noise on the regime shift in bistable systems\nhave been well characterized, however little is known about such effects of\ncolored noise (noise with non-zero correlation time). Here, we show that noise\ncorrelation time, by considering a genetic circuit of autoactivation, can have\nsignificant effect on the regime shift in gene expression. We demonstrate this\ntheoretically, using stochastic potential, stationary probability density\nfunction and first-passage time based on the Fokker-Planck description, where\nthe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is used to model colored noise. We find that\nincrease in noise correlation time in degradation rate can induce a regime\nshift from low to high protein concentration state and enhance the bistable\nregime, while increase in noise correlation time in basal rate retain the\nbimodal distribution. We then show how cross-correlated colored noises in basal\nand degradation rates can induce regime shifts from low to high protein\nconcentration state, but reduce the bistable regime. In addition, we show that\nearly warning indicators can also be used to predict shifts between distinct\nphenotypic states in gene expression. Predictions that a cell is about to shift\nto a harmful phenotype could improve early therapeutic intervention in complex\nhuman diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Dec 2016 11:42:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 17:12:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Yogita", ""], ["Dutta", "Partha Sharathi", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.02108", "submitter": "Stuart Sevier", "authors": "Stuart A.

KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of\ntwo domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the\nCII domain can be phosphorylated, at two residues, in a well-defined sequence.\nWhile this system has been studied extensively, how the clock is driven\nthermodynamically has remained elusive. Inspired by recent experimental\nobservations and building on ideas from previous mathematical models, we\npresent a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of\nthe clock. At its heart are two main ideas: i) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain\nprovides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between\nan active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise\nand an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii) phosphorylation of the CII\ndomain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also\nnaturally explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can\nstimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA\nfor the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order\nof KaiC phosphorylation. As the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises,\nthe release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state\nof KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only\nstabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and\nhence to KaiC dephosphorylation. Using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo\nalgorithm, we show that the model can describe a wealth of experimental data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 16:25:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Lubensky", "David K", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.02744", "submitter": "Igor Kaufman", "authors": "I.Kh.

In 2000,\nElowitz and Leibler showed that by rational design of the reaction network, and\nusing existing biological components, they could create a network that exhibits\nperiodic gene expression, dubbed the repressilator (Elowitz and Leibler,\nNature, 2000). More recently, Stricker et al. presented another synthetic\noscillator, called the dual-feedback oscillator (Stricker et al., 2008), which\nis more stable. How the stability of these oscillators is affected by the\nintrinsic noise of the interactions between the components and the stochastic\nexpression of their genes, has been studied in considerable detail. However, as\nall biological oscillators reside in growing and dividing cells, an important\nquestion is how these oscillators are perturbed by the cell cycle. In previous\nwork we showed that the periodic doubling of the gene copy numbers due to DNA\nreplication can couple not only natural, circadian oscillators to the cell\ncycle (Paijmans et al., PNAS, \\textbf{113}, 4063, (2016)), but also these\nsynthetic oscillators. Here we expand this study. We find that the strength of\nthe locking between oscillators depends not only on the positions of the genes\non the chromosome, but also on the noise in the timing of gene replication:\nnoise tends to weaken the coupling. Yet, even in the limit of high levels of\nnoise in the replication times of the genes, both synthetic oscillators show\nclear signatures of locking to the cell cycle.
