Ten years later, I discovered\nthat a carboxyterminal RB amino acid sequence resembles the catalytic center of\nIDE. This structural homology raised the possibility that insulin degradation\nis a basic mechanism for tumor suppression shared by RB and IDE. Subsequently,\na first immunohistochemical study on the differential expression of human IDE\nin normal tissues, primary tumors and their corresponding lymph node metastases\nfurther corroborated the initial conjecture on IDE being an antineoplastic\nmolecule. In this report, it is shown that IDE harbors ankyrin repeat-like\namino acid sequences through which it might bind and, as a result, antagonize\nthe pro-inflammatory factor NF-kappaB as well as cyclin-dependent kinases\n(CDKs). As equally revealed here, IDE also contains 2 RXL cyclin-binding motifs\nwhich could contribute to its presumed inhibition of CDKs. These new findings\nsuggest that IDE is potentially able to suppress both inflammation and\noncogenesis by several mechanisms that ultimately ensure RB function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2008 18:30:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Radulescu", "Razvan Tudor", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.0191", "submitter": "Jeffrey Dick", "authors": "Jeffrey M.

Calculations of metastable equilibrium for various model systems were\nused to characterize chemical transformations among proteins and groups of\nproteins found in different compartments of yeast cells.\n  Results: With increasing oxygen fugacity, the relative metastability fields\nof model proteins for major subcellular compartments go as mitochondrion,\nendoplasmic reticulum, cytoplasm, nucleus. In a metastable equilibrium setting\nat relatively high oxygen fugacity, proteins making up actin are predominant,\nbut those constituting the microtubule occur with a low chemical activity. A\nreaction sequence involving the microtubule and spindle pole proteins was\npredicted by combining the known intercompartmental interactions with a\nhypothetical program of oxygen fugacity changes in the local environment. In\nfurther calculations, the most-abundant proteins within compartments generally\noccur in relative abundances that only weakly correspond to a metastable\nequilibrium distribution. However, physiological populations of proteins that\nform complexes often show an overall positive or negative correlation with the\nrelative abundances of proteins in metastable assemblages.\n  Conclusions: This study explored the outlines of a thermodynamic description\nof chemical transformations among interacting proteins in yeast cells.

Since the availability of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in cells is dependent\non the growth rate, transcriptional control involves not only the regulation of\npromoters, but also depends on the available (or free) RNAP concentration which\nis difficult to quantify directly. Here we develop a simple physical model\ndescribing the partitioning of cellular RNAP into different classes: RNAPs\ntranscribing mRNA and ribosomal RNA (rRNA), RNAPs non-specifically bound to\nDNA, free RNAP, and immature RNAP. Available experimental data for E. coli\nallow us to determine the two unknown parameters of the model and hence deduce\nthe free RNAP concentration at different growth rates. The results allow us to\npredict the growth-rate dependence of the activities of constitutive\n(unregulated) promoters, and to disentangle the growth-rate dependent\nregulation of promoters (e.g., the promoters of rRNA operons) from changes in\ntranscription due to changes in the free RNAP concentration at different growth\nrates. Our model can quantitatively account for the observed changes in gene\nexpression patterns in mutant E. coli strains with altered levels of RNAP\nexpression without invoking additional parameters. Applying our model to the\ncase of the stringent response following amino acid starvation, we can evaluate\nthe plausibility of various scenarios of passive transcriptional control\nproposed to account for the observed changes in the expression of rRNA and\nbiosynthetic operons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2008 00:12:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Klumpp", "Stefan", ""], ["Hwa", "Terence", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2066", "submitter": "Stephen Whitelam", "authors": "Stephen Whitelam, Till Bretschneider and Nigel J.
