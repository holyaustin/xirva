Any inherent chiral feature in an egg cell can in\nprincipal trigger this spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. Individual\nmicrotubules, major cytoskeletal filaments, are known as chiral objects.\nHowever, to date there lacks convincing evidence of a hierarchical connection\nof the molecular nature of microtubules to large-scale chirality, particularly\nat the length scale of an entire cell. Here we assemble an in-vitro active\nlayer, consisting of microtubules and kinesin motor proteins, on a glass\nsurface. Upon inclusion of methyl cellulose, the layered system exhibits a\nlong-range active nematic phase, characterized by the global alignment of\ngliding MTs. This nematic order spans over the entire system size in the\nmillimeter range and, remarkably, allows hidden collective chirality to emerge\nas counterclockwise global rotation of the active MT layer. The analysis based\non our theoretical model suggests that the emerging global nematic order\nresults from the local alignment of MTs, stabilized by methyl cellulose. It\nalso suggests that the global rotation arises from the MTs' intrinsic\ncurvature, leading to preferential handedness. Given its flexibility, this\nlayered in-vitro cytoskeletal system enables the study of membranous protein\nbehavior responsible for important cellular developmental processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 04:02:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Kyongwan", ""], ["Yoshinaga", "Natsuhiko", ""], ["Bhattacharyya", "Sanjib", ""], ["Nakazawa", "Hikaru", ""], ["Umetsu", "Mitsuo", ""], ["Teizer", "Winfried", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.04832", "submitter": "Konstantin Zloshchastiev", "authors": "Konstantin G.

These quantum effects occur due to the interaction of PBCs with\ntheir environment which can be described by means of the reduced density\noperator and effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NH). Sustainable NH models of\nEET predict the coherence beats, followed by the decrease of coherence down to\na small, yet non-zero value.
