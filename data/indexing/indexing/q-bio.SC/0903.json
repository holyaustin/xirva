To this end we first consider the\nbehavior of one set of motors pulling in a single direction against an external\nforce using a new mean-field approach. Based on these results we analyze a\nsimilar setup with two sets of motors pulling in opposite directions in a\ntug-of-war in the presence of an external force. In both cases we find that the\ninterplay of fluid friction and protein friction leads to a complex phase\ndiagram where the force-velocity relations can exhibit regions of bistability\nand spontaneous symmetry breaking. Finally, motivated by recent work, we turn\nto the case of motility assay experiments where motors bound to a surface push\non a bundle of filaments. We find that, depending on the absence or the\npresence of a bistability in the force-velocity curve at zero force, the bundle\nexhibits anomalous or biased diffusion on long-time and large-length scales.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2009 15:20:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Hexner", "Daniel", ""], ["Kafri", "Yariv", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.1172", "submitter": "George Tsibidis", "authors": "George D Tsibidis", "title": "Quantitative interpretation of binding reactions of rapidly diffusing\n  species using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching", "comments": "14 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal ofMicroscopy, Vol. 233, Pt 3 2009, pp. 384-390", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) measurements offer an\nimportant tool for analyzing diffusion and binding processes.

In the present paper, bleaching laser\nbeam characteristics are incorporated into an improved model to provide a more\nrigorous and accurate method. The proposed model simulates binding inside\nbounded regions, and it leads to FRAP curves that depend on the on and off\nrates that can be employed to determine the rate constants.

A\nribosome can be regarded as a molecular motor which utilizes the input chemical\nenergy to move on a messenger RNA (mRNA) track that also serves as a template\nfor the polymerization of the corresponding protein. The forward movement,\nhowever, is characterized by an alternating sequence of translocation and\npause. Using a quantitative model, which captures the mechanochemical cycle of\nan individual ribosome, we derive an {\\it exact} analytical expression for the\ndistribution of its dwell times at the successive positions on the mRNA track.\nInverse of the average dwell time satisfies a ``Michaelis-Menten-like''\nequation and is consistent with the general formula for the average velocity of\na molecular motor with an unbranched mechano-chemical cycle. Extending this\nformula appropriately, we also derive the exact force-velocity relation for a\nribosome. Often many ribosomes simultaneously move on the same mRNA track,\nwhile each synthesizes a copy of the same protein. We extend the model of a\nsingle ribosome by incorporating steric exclusion of different individuals on\nthe same track. We draw the phase diagram of this model of ribosome traffic in\n3-dimensional spaces spanned by experimentally controllable parameters.

The model shows that this ratio should in fact\nbe independent of the receptor-cargo affinity, though kinetics may be strongly\ninfluenced.

Here, we\nreport the first genome-scale metabolic model of Yersinia pestis biovar\nMediaevalis based both on its recently annotated genome, and physiological and\nbiochemical data from literature. Our model demonstrates excellent agreement\nwith Y. pestis known metabolic needs and capabilities. Since Y. pestis is a\nmeiotrophic organism, we have developed CryptFind, a systematic approach to\nidentify all candidate cryptic genes responsible for known and theoretical\nmeiotrophic phenomena. In addition to uncovering every known cryptic gene for\nY. pestis, our analysis of the rhamnose fermentation pathway suggests that betB\nis the responsible cryptic gene. Despite all of our medical advances, we still\ndo not have a vaccine for bubonic plague. Recent discoveries of antibiotic\nresistant strains of Yersinia pestis coupled with the threat of plague being\nused as a bioterrorism weapon compel us to develop new tools for studying the\nphysiology of this deadly pathogen.
