Despite intense research, the interactions between carbohydrates\nof apposing cells or membranes are not well understood. In this article, we\ninvestigate carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions in membrane adhesion as well\nas in solution with extensive atomistic molecular dynamics simulations that\nexceed the simulation times of previous studies by orders of magnitude. For\nLeX, we obtain association constants of soluble carbohydrates, adhesion\nenergies of lipid-anchored carbohydrates, and maximally sustained forces of\ncarbohydrate complexes in membrane adhesion that are in good agreement with\nexperimental results in the literature. Our simulations thus appear to provide\na realistic, detailed picture of LeX-LeX interactions in solution and during\nmembrane adhesion. In this picture, the LeX-LeX interactions are fuzzy, i.e.\nLeX pairs interact in a large variety of short-lived, bound conformations. For\nthe synthetic tetrasaccharide Lac 2, which is composed of two lactose units, we\nobserve similarly fuzzy interactions and obtain association constants of both\nsoluble and lipid-anchored variants that are comparable to the corresponding\nassociation constants of LeX. The fuzzy, weak carbohydrate-carbohydrate\ninteractions quantified in our simulations thus appear to be a generic feature\nof small, neutral carbohydrates such as LeX and Lac 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Aug 2020 11:35:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kav", "Batuhan", ""], ["Grafm\u00fcller", "Andrea", ""], ["Schneck", "Emanuel", ""], ["Weikl", "Thomas R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.04172", "submitter": "Sara Hamis", "authors": "Sara J Hamis, Fiona R Macfarlane", "title": "A single-cell mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 induced pyroptosis and\n  the effects of anti-inflammatory intervention", "comments": "35 pages including the appendix, 9 figures in the main manuscript,\n  Supporting Information (PDF) included", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Pyroptosis is an inflammatory mode of cell death that can contribute to the\ncytokine storm associated with severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019\n(COVID-19).

Inflammasome formation, and by extension pyroptosis, may be\ninhibited by certain anti-inflammatory drugs. In this study, we present a\nsingle-cell mathematical model that captures the formation of the NLRP3\ninflammasome, pyroptotic cell death and responses to anti-inflammatory\nintervention that hinder the formation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. The model is\nformulated in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that\ndescribe the dynamics of the biological components involved in pyroptosis. Our\nresults demonstrate that an anti-inflammatory drug can delay the formation of\nthe NLRP3 inflammasome, and thus may alter the mode of cell death from\ninflammatory (pyroptosis) to non-inflammatory e.g., apoptosis). The single-cell\nmodel is being implemented in a SARS-CoV-2 Tissue Simulator, in collaboration\nwith a multidisciplinary coalition investigating within host-dynamics of\nCOVID-19.
