The RDME is derived from assumptions about the\nunderlying physical properties of the system, and it may produce unphysical\nresults for models where those assumptions fail. In that case, other more\ncomprehensive models are better suited, such as hard-sphere Brownian dynamics\n(BD). Although the RDME is a model in its own right, and not inferred from any\nspecific microscale model, it proves useful to attempt to approximate a\nmicroscale model by a specific choice of mesoscopic reaction rates. In this\npaper we derive mesoscopic reaction rates by matching certain statistics of the\nRDME solution to statistics of the solution of a widely used microscopic BD\nmodel: the Smoluchowski model with a mixed boundary condition at the reaction\nradius of two molecules. We also establish fundamental limits for the range of\nmesh resolutions for which this approach yields accurate results, and show both\ntheoretically and in numerical examples that as we approach the lower\nfundamental limit, the mesoscopic dynamics approach the microscopic dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 19:10:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 18:07:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Hellander", "Stefan", ""], ["Hellander", "Andreas", ""], ["Petzold", "Linda", ""]]}, {"id": "1411.1553", "submitter": "Vadim Volkov S", "authors": "Vadim Volkov", "title": "Salinity tolerance in plants: attempts to manipulate ion transport", "comments": "67 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ion transport is the major determining factor of salinity tolerance in\nplants.
