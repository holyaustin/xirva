Beauveria bassiana, an\nentomopathogenic fungus, can endophytically colonize a vast number of plant\nspecies and trigger induced systemic resistance against plant pathogens. Spore\ngermination is the most vulnerable in the fungal life cycle and is therefore a\ngood candidate for monitoring the effect of essential oils on the growth of B.\nbassiana. Percentage germination of fungal spores and length of germination\ntubes were recorded from experiments. A mathematical model that was able to\ncapture the effects of cymene, an essential oil produced by Monarda, on the\ngermination and growth was developed. This is the first report of a model for\nthe impact of essential oils on B. bassiana spore germination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Oct 2010 15:31:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Nguyen", "Luong", ""], ["Bodiroga", "Dubravka", ""], ["Kelemen", "Reka", ""], ["Joo", "Jaewook", ""], ["Gwinn", "Kimberly D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.1743", "submitter": "Jaewook Joo", "authors": "Jaewook Joo", "title": "Linear noise approximation of noise-induced oscillation in NF-{\\kappa}B\n  signaling network", "comments": "19 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  NF-{\\kappa}B, one of key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis, and\ndifferentiation, was found to have noisy oscillatory shuttling between the\nnucleus and the cytoplasm in single cells when cells are stimulated by cytokine\nTNF{\\alpha}.

Here, we study how variations in the membrane composition\ncan be driven by fluctuating forces. We show that the membrane steady state is\nnot only controlled by the strength of the forces and how they couple to the\nmembrane, but also by their dynamics: In a simple class of models this is\ncaptured by a single a correlation time. We conclude that the coupling of\nmembrane composition to normal mechanical forces, such as might be exerted by\npolymerizing cytoskeleton filaments, could play an important role in\ncontrolling the steady state of a cell membrane that exhibits transient\nmicrophase separation on lengthscales in the 10-100 nm regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Oct 2010 08:40:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sens", "Pierre", ""], ["Turner", "Matthew S.", ""]]}]
