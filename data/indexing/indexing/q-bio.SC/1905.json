The error-correction mechanism implemented by the\nenzyme determines which of the two cases holds. For example, discrimination in\nthe forward reaction rates tends to grant smaller errors to polymers with\nfaster synthesis. The opposite occurs for discrimination in monomer rejection\nrates. Our results provide an experimentally feasible way to identify\nerror-correction mechanisms by measuring the error-speed correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2019 06:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chiuchi\u00fa", "Davide", ""], ["Tu", "Yuhai", ""], ["Pigolotti", "Simone", ""]]}]
