The spatial variation of chromatin density within\nmouse olfactory sensory neurons is determined from soft X-ray tomography\nreconstructions of five nuclei. We show that there is a division of the nuclear\nspace into regions of low-density euchromatin and high-density heterochromatin.\nVolume exclusion experienced by a diffusing protein caused by this varying\ndensity of chromatin is modeled by a repulsive potential. The value of the\npotential at a given point in space is chosen to be proportional to the density\nof chromatin at that location. The constant of proportionality, called the\nvolume exclusivity, provides a model parameter that determines the strength of\nvolume exclusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the mean time for a\nprotein to locate a binding site localized in euchromatin is minimized for a\nfinite, non-zero volume exclusivity. For binding sites in heterochromatin, the\nmean time is minimized when the volume exclusivity is zero (the protein\nexperiences no volume exclusion). An analytical theory is developed to explain\nthese results. The theory suggests that for binding sites in euchromatin there\nis an optimal level of volume exclusivity that balances a reduction in the\nvolume searched in finding the binding site, with the height of effective\npotential barriers the protein must cross during the search process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:13:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 5 Aug 2013 16:09:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 23:10:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Isaacson", "Samuel A.", ""], ["Larabell", "Carolyn A.", ""], ["Gros", "Mark A.

We test this hypothesis here by showing how it\nmaps onto a one-dimensional random walk in a random environment. Our estimate\nof the amplitude of the fluctuations agrees with experimental observations. We\npoint out that there is an initial transient in the position of the microtubule\nwhere it will typically move of order its own length. We compare the physics of\nthis gliding assay to a recent theory of the role of antagonistic motors on\nrestricting interpolar microtubule sliding of a cell's mitotic spindle during\nprometaphase. It is concluded that randomly positioned antagonistic motors can\nrestrict relative movement of microtubules, however they do so imperfectly.

In skeletal muscle, for\nexample, hundreds of myosin II molecules cooperate in thick filaments. In\nnon-muscle cells, by contrast, small groups with few tens of non-muscle myosin\nII motors contribute to essential cellular processes such as transport, shape\nchanges or mechanosensing. Here we introduce a detailed and analytically\ntractable model for this important situation. Using a three-state crossbridge\nmodel for the myosin II motor cycle and exploiting the assumptions of fast\npower stroke kinetics and equal load sharing between motors in equivalent\nstates, we reduce the stochastic reaction network to a one-step master equation\nfor the binding and unbinding dynamics (parallel cluster model) and derive the\nrules for ensemble movement. We find that for constant external load, ensemble\ndynamics is strongly shaped by the catch bond character of myosin II, which\nleads to an increase of the fraction of bound motors under load and thus to\nfirm attachment even for small ensembles. This adaptation to load results in a\nconcave force-velocity relation described by a Hill relation. For external load\nprovided by a linear spring, myosin II ensembles dynamically adjust themselves\ntowards an isometric state with constant average position and load. The\ndynamics of the ensembles is now determined mainly by the distribution of\nmotors over the different kinds of bound states. For increasing stiffness of\nthe external spring, there is a sharp transition beyond which myosin II can no\nlonger perform the power stroke. Slow unbinding from the pre-power-stroke state\nprotects the ensembles against detachment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 17:56:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Oct 2013 19:32:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Erdmann", "Thorsten", ""], ["Albert", "Philipp J.", ""], ["Schwarz", "Ulrich S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7043", "submitter": "Pierre Sens", "authors": "Serge Dmitrieff, Madan Rao and Pierre Sens", "title": "Quantitative analysis of intra-Golgi transport reveals inter-cisternal\n  exchange for all cargo", "comments": "7 pages, 4 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1303358110", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The mechanisms controlling the transport of proteins across the Golgi stack\nof mammalian and plant cells is the subject of intense debate, with two models,\ncisternal progression and inter-cisternal exchange, emerging as major\ncontenders.

We reevaluate these experiments using a single quantitative\ncoarse-grained framework of intra-Golgi transport that accounts for both\ntransport models and their many variants. Our analysis makes a definitive case\nfor the existence of inter-cisternal exchange both for small membrane proteins\n(VSVG) and large protein complexes (procollagen) -- this implies that membrane\nstructures larger than the typical protein-coated vesicles must be involved in\ntransport. Notwithstanding, we find that current observations on protein\ntransport cannot rule out cisternal progression as contributing significantly\nto the transport process.
