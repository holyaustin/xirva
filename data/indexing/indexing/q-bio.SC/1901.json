In any\ninhomogeneous solution, there are concentration gradients, and particles move\neither up or down these gradients due to a mechanism called diffusiophoresis. I\nestimate that inside metabolically active cells, the dynamics of particles can\nbe strongly accelerated by diffusiophoresis, provided that they are at least\ntens of nanometres across. The dynamics of smaller objects, such as single\nproteins are largely unaffected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2019 16:09:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 Mar 2019 17:27:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Sear", "Richard P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.04432", "submitter": "Gao-De Li Dr", "authors": "Gao-De Li", "title": "Further Thoughts on Abnormal Chromatin Configuration and Oncogenesis", "comments": "5 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  More than 30 years ago, we published a paper entitled as abnormal chromatin\nconfiguration and oncogenesis, which proposed the first hypothesis that links\noncogenesis to abnormal three-dimensional (3D) genome structure.

In prokaryotic cells, a\nsingle-input-module motif with one transcription factor regulating multiple\ntarget genes can generate coordinated gene expression. In eukaryotic cells,\ntranscriptional activity of a gene is affected by not only transcription\nfactors but also the epigenetic modifications and three-dimensional chromosome\nstructure of the gene. To examine how local gene environment and transcription\nfactor regulation are coupled, we performed a combined analysis of time-course\nRNA-seq data of TGF-\\b{eta} treated MCF10A cells and related epigenomic and\nHi-C data. Using Dynamic Regulatory Events Miner (DREM), we clustered\ndifferentially expressed genes based on gene expression profiles and associated\ntranscription factors. Genes in each class have similar temporal gene\nexpression patterns and share common transcription factors. Next, we defined a\nset of linear and radial distribution functions, as used in statistical\nphysics, to measure the distributions of genes within a class both spatially\nand linearly along the genomic sequence. Remarkably, genes within the same\nclass despite sometimes being separated by tens of million bases (Mb) along\ngenomic sequence show a significantly higher tendency to be spatially close\ndespite sometimes being separated by tens of Mb along the genomic sequence than\nthose belonging to different classes do. Analyses extended to the process of\nmouse nervous system development arrived at similar conclusions. Future studies\nwill be able to test whether this spatial organization of chromosomes\ncontributes to concerted gene expression.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Jan 2019 16:21:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jingyu", ""], ["Chen", "Hengyu", ""], ["Li", "Ruoyan", ""], ["Taft", "David A.", ""], ["Yao", "Guang", ""], ["Bai", "Fan", ""], ["Xing", "Jianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.08332", "submitter": "Karsten Kruse", "authors": "N.

One class of such condensates is composed of two\npolymer species, where each consists of repeated binding sites that interact in\na one-to-one fashion with the binding sites of the other polymer. Previous\nbiologically-motivated modeling of such a two-component system surprisingly\nrevealed that phase separation is suppressed for certain combinations of\nnumbers of binding sites. This phenomenon, dubbed the \"magic-number effect\",\noccurs if the two polymers can form fully-bonded small oligomers by virtue of\nthe number of binding sites in one polymer being an integer multiple of the\nnumber of binding sites of the other. Here we use lattice-model simulations and\nanalytical calculations to show that this magic-number effect can be greatly\nenhanced if one of the polymer species has a rigid shape that allows for\nmultiple distinct bonding conformations. Moreover, if one species is rigid, the\neffect is robust over a much greater range of relative concentrations of the\ntwo species. Our findings advance our understanding of the fundamental physics\nof two-component polymer-based phase-separation and suggest implications for\nbiological and synthetic systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Jan 2019 11:14:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 11 Oct 2019 22:25:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Bin", ""], ["He", "Guanhua", ""], ["Weiner", "Benjamin G.", ""], ["Ronceray", "Pierre", ""], ["Meir", "Yigal", ""], ["Jonikas", "Martin C.", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""]]}]
