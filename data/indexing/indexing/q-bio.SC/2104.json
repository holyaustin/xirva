In this paper, we focus on simple ODE systems modeling two molecules\nwhich each negatively (or positively) regulate the other. It is well-known that\nsuch models may lead to monostability or multistability, depending on the\nselected parameters. However, extensive numerical simulations have led systems\nbiologists to conjecture that in the vast majority of cases, there cannot be\nmore than two stable points. Our main result is a proof of this conjecture.\nMore specifically, we provide a criterion ensuring at most bistability, which\nis indeed satisfied by most commonly used functions.

While optogenetic control of polymerization can initiate cell\nmigration by generating protrusion, it is less clear if and how optogenetic\ncontrol of contraction can also affect cell migration.

Optogenetic activation of\ncontraction can then initiate locomotion in a symmetrically spreading cell and\nstrengthen motility in an asymmetrically polymerizing one.

Many living cells, such as budding yeast and fission\nyeast, use cytoskeletal structures to actively transport proteins to one\nlocation on the membrane and create a high density spot of membrane-bound\nproteins. Yet, the thermodynamic constraints on filament-based cell\npolarization remain unknown. We show by mathematical modeling that cell\npolarization requires detailed balance to be broken, and we quantify the\nfree-energy cost of maintaining a polarized state of the cell. Our study\nreveals that detailed balance cannot only be broken via the active transport of\nproteins along filaments, but also via a chemical modification cycle, allowing\ndetailed balance to be broken by the shuttling of proteins between the\nfilament, membrane, and cytosol. Our model thus shows that cell polarization\ncan be established via two distinct driving mechanisms, one based on active\ntransport and one based on non-equilibrium binding. Furthermore, the model\npredicts that the driven binding process dissipates orders of magnitude less\nfree-energy than the transport-based process to create the same membrane spot.\nActive transport along filaments may be sufficient to create a polarized\ndistribution of membrane-bound proteins, but an additional chemical\nmodification cycle of the proteins themselves is more efficient and less\nsensitive to the physical exclusion of proteins on the transporting filaments,\nproviding insight in the design principles of the Pom1/Tea1/Tea4 system in\nfission yeast and the Cdc42 system in budding yeast.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2021 15:33:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Wierenga", "Harmen", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}]
