We consider the question \"can the cell's perception of\ntime be expressed through the length of the shortest telomere?\" The answer is\nthat the absolute time before senescence cannot be expressed by the telomere's\nlength and that a cell can survive many more divisions than intuitively\nexpected. This apparent paradox is due to shortening and elongation of the\ntelomere, which suggests a random walk model of the telomere's length. The\nmodel indicates two phases, first, a determinist drift of the length toward a\nquasi-equilibrium state, and second, persistence of the length near an\nattracting state for the majority of divisions prior to senescence. The measure\nof stability of the latter phase is the expected number of divisions at the\nattractor (\"lifetime\") prior to crossing a threshold to senescence. The\ntelomerase regulates stability by creating an effective potential barrier that\nseparates statistically the shortest lifetime from the next shortest. The\nrandom walk has to overcome the barrier in order to extend the range of the\nfirst regime. The model explains how random telomere dynamics underlies the\nextension of cell survival time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Nov 2017 10:38:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Schuss", "Zeev", ""], ["Tor", "Kimsy", ""], ["Holcman", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04852", "submitter": "Christopher Miles", "authors": "Christopher E.

In our model, the motors change states by\nrandom discrete events (corresponding to stepping and binding/unbinding), while\nthe cargo position follows a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that\ndepends on the discrete states of the motors. The resulting system for the\ncargo position is consequently an SDE that randomly switches according to a\nMarkov jump process governing motor dynamics. To study this system we (1) cast\nthe cargo position in a renewal theory framework and generalize the renewal\nreward theorem and (2) decompose the continuous and discrete sources of\nstochasticity and exploit a resulting pair of disparate timescales. With these\nmathematical tools, we obtain explicit formulas for experimentally measurable\nquantities, such as cargo velocity and run length. Analyzing these formulas\nthen yields some predictions regarding so-called non-processive clustering, the\nphenomenon that a single motor cannot transport cargo, but that two or more\nmotors can. We find that having motor stepping, binding, and unbinding rates\ndepend on the number of bound motors, due to geometric effects, is necessary\nand sufficient to explain recent experimental data on non-processive motors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 13 Nov 2017 21:06:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2018 17:50:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Miles", "Christopher E.", ""], ["Lawley", "Sean D.", ""], ["Keener", "James P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.07383", "submitter": "Ramon Grima", "authors": "Abhyudai Singh and Ramon Grima", "title": "The Linear-Noise Approximation and moment-closure approximations for\n  stochastic chemical kinetics", "comments": "24 pages, 4 figures.

Within its major\ncellular target, the activated T cell, many steps occur between viral entry and\nviral burst, including reverse transcription of viral RNA, integration of the\nviral DNA in the host genome, viral transcription, splicing, translation, host\nand viral regulation, and viral packaging. These steps exploit complex networks\nof macromolecular interactions that exhibit various forms of stochastic\nbehavior. While each of the steps of HIV infection have been individually\nstudied extensively, the combinatorial contribution of rare events in each of\nthe steps, and how series of these rare events lead to different infection\nphenotypes, are not well understood. The complexity of these processes render\nexperimental study challenging. Therefore, we have built a comprehensive\ncomputational model of this large system, by collating the community's\nknowledge of the infection process. It is a stochastic model where rates of\ndifferent events in the system are represented as probabilities of the event\noccurring in a timestep of the simulation. This model enables an understanding\nof the noise and variation in the system. The model also facilitates a\ndissected understanding of each small part of the large complex system, and its\nimpact on the overall system dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 08:55:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Dec 2017 07:05:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sanghvi", "Jayodita C.", ""], ["Mai", "Don", ""], ["Arkin", "Adam P.", ""], ["Schaffer", "David V.", ""]]}]
