L-type Ca2+ channels\ntrigger release of Ca2+ from ryanodine receptors (RyRs) for cellular\ncontraction, while signalling downstream of Gq coupled receptors stimulates\nCa2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), engaging\nhypertrophic signalling pathways. Modulation of the amplitude, duration, and\nduty cycle of the cytosolic Ca2+ contraction signal, and spatial localisation,\nhave all been proposed to encode this hypertrophic signal. Given current\nknowledge of IP3Rs, we develop a model describing the effect of functional\ninteraction (cross-talk) between RyR and IP3R channels on the Ca2+ transient,\nand examine the sensitivity of the Ca2+ transient shape to properties of IP3R\nactivation. A key result of our study is that IP3R activation increases Ca2+\ntransient duration for a broad range of IP3R properties, but the effect of IP3R\nactivation on Ca2+ transient amplitude is dependent on IP3 concentration.\nFurthermore we demonstrate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release in the cytosol\nincreases the duty cycle of the Ca2+ transient, the fraction of the cycle for\nwhich [Ca2+] is elevated, across a broad range of parameter values and IP3\nconcentrations. When coupled to a model of downstream transcription factor\n(NFAT) activation, we demonstrate that there is a high correspondence between\nthe Ca transient duty cycle and the proportion of activated NFAT in the\nnucleus. These findings suggest increased cytosolic Ca2+ duty cycle as a\nplausible mechanism for IP3-dependent hypertrophic signalling via\nCa2+-sensitive transcription factors such as NFAT in ventricular\ncardiomyocytes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Feb 2019 10:51:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2019 04:48:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2020 04:38:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 17 Aug 2020 06:30:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hunt", "Hilary", ""], ["Tilunaite", "Agne", ""], ["Bass", "Greg", ""], ["Soeller", "Christian", ""], ["Roderick", "H.

Mechanotransduction provides\nthe link between modulation of the extracellular matrix and intracellular\nactions. By controlling the balance between the intracellular and extracellular\ndomains, the mechanotransduction process determines optimal functionality of\nthe skeletal dynamics, and it is one of the possible causes of\nosteophatological diseases.\n  Results: Mechanotransduction in a single osteoblast under external mechanical\nperturbations has been modelled in the agent based framework to reproduce the\ndynamics of the stochastic reaction diffusion process among molecules in the\ncytoplasm, nuclear and extracellular domains. The amount of molecules and\nfluctuations of each molecular class has been analysed in terms of recurrences\nof critical events. A numerical approach has been developed to invert\nsubordination processes and to extract the directing processes from the\nmolecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurrence of events.\n  Conclusions: We observed large fluctuations enclose information hidden in the\nnoise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines. Studying\nthe system under different parametric conditions and stimuli, the results have\nshown that the waiting time distributions of each molecule are a signature of\nthe system's dynamics. The behaviours of the molecular waiting times change\nwith the changing of parameters presenting the same variation of patterns for\nsimilar interacting molecules and identifying specific alterations for key\nmolecules in the mechanotransduction pathway.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Feb 2019 00:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ascolani", "Gianluca", ""], ["Skerry", "Timothy M.", ""], ["Lacroix", "Damien", ""], ["Dall'Ara", "Enrico", ""], ["Shuaib", "Aban", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09672", "submitter": "Jay Newby", "authors": "Keshav B.
