As a result, first order repressors cannot build memory or signal\nbuffering elements.

Recent advances in single-molecule fluorescence\nspectroscopy have provided new fundamental insights on the possible mechanisms\nunderlying reactions catalyzed by fluctuating enzymes. Here, we present a\nbottom-up approach to understand enzyme turnover kinetics at physiologically\nrelevant mesoscopic concentrations informed by mechanisms extracted from\nsingle-molecule stochastic trajectories. The stochastic approach, presented\nhere, shows the emergence of dynamic cooperativity in terms of a slowing down\nof the Michaelis-Menten (MM) kinetics resulting in negative cooperativity. For\nfewer enzymes, dynamic cooperativity emerges due to the combined effects of\nenzymatic conformational fluctuations and molecular discreteness. The increase\nin the number of enzymes, however, suppresses the effect of enzymatic\nconformational fluctuations such that dynamic cooperativity emerges solely due\nto the discrete changes in the number of reacting species. These results\nconfirm that the turnover kinetics of fluctuating enzyme based on the\nparallel-pathway MM mechanism switches over to the single-pathway MM mechanism\nwith the increase in the number of enzymes. For large enzyme numbers,\nconvergence to the exact MM equation occurs in the limit of very high substrate\nconcentration as the stochastic kinetics approaches the deterministic\nbehaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Aug 2016 06:24:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Kumar", "Ashutosh", ""], ["Chatterjee", "Sambarta", ""], ["Nandi", "Mintu", ""], ["Dua", "Arti", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.04540", "submitter": "Gabriele Scheler", "authors": "Gabriele Scheler, Jean-Marc Fellous", "title": "Dopamine modulation of prefrontal delay activity-reverberatory activity\n  and sharpness of tuning curves", "comments": "CNS Conference 2001; 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Neurocomputing 38-40:1549-1556; June 2001", "doi": "10.1016/S0925-2312(01)00559-8", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cs.NE q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent electrophysiological experiments have shown that dopamine (D1)\nmodulation of pyramidal cells in prefrontal cortex reduces spike frequency\nadaptation and enhances NMDA transmission.

Cell fate\nspecification is coordinated via Notch's interaction with the canonical Wnt\npathway. Here, we propose a new mathematical model of the Notch and Wnt\npathways, in which the Hes1 promoter acts as a hub for pathway crosstalk.\nComputational simulations of the model can assist in understanding how healthy\nintestinal tissue is maintained, and predict the likely consequences of\nbiochemical knockouts upon cell fate selection processes. Chemical reaction\nnetwork theory (CRNT) is a powerful, generalised framework which assesses the\ncapacity of our model for monostability or multistability, by analysing\nproperties of the underlying network structure without recourse to specific\nparameter values or functional forms for reaction rates. CRNT highlights the\nrole of beta-catenin in stabilising the Notch pathway and damping oscillations,\ndemonstrating that Wnt-mediated actions on the Hes1 promoter can induce\ndynamical transitions in the Notch system, from multistability to\nmonostability. Time-dependent model simulations of cell pairs reveal the\nstabilising influence of Wnt upon the Notch pathway, in which beta-catenin- and\nDsh-mediated action on the Hes1 promoter are key in shaping the subcellular\ndynamics. Where Notch-mediated transcription of Hes1 dominates, there is Notch\noscillation and maintenance of fate flexibility; Wnt-mediated transcription of\nHes1 favours bistability akin to cell fate selection. Cells could therefore\nregulate the proportion of Wnt- and Notch-mediated control of the Hes1 promoter\nto coordinate the timing of cell fate selection as they migrate through the\nintestinal epithelium and are subject to reduced Wnt stimuli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 12:32:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kay", "Sophie K.", ""], ["Harrington", "Heather A.", ""], ["Shepherd", "Sarah", ""], ["Brennan", "Keith", ""], ["Dale", "Trevor", ""], ["Osborne", "James M.", ""], ["Gavaghan", "David J.", ""], ["Byrne", "Helen M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.07139", "submitter": "Jakub J\\k{e}drak", "authors": "Jakub J\\k{e}drak and Anna Ochab-Marcinek", "title": "Time-dependent solutions for a stochastic model of gene expression with\n  molecule production in the form of a compound Poisson process", "comments": "16 pages, 3 figures, accepted in Physical Review E", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.94.032401", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a stochastic model of gene expression, in which protein production\nhas a form of random bursts whose size distribution is arbitrary, whereas\nprotein decay is a first-order reaction.
