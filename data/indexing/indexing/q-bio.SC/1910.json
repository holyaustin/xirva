Depending on the initial\ncarbohydrate concentration in the wort a high concentration of ethanol can be\nachieved in beer, often higher than 20% (v/v). It is noteworthy that the\neffects of elevated ethanol concentrations generated during beer fermentation\nresemble those of heat shock stress, with similar responses observed in both\nsituations, such as the activation of proteostasis and protein quality control\nmechanisms in different cell compartments, including endoplasmic reticulum\n(ER), mitochondria, and cytosol. Despite the extensive published molecular and\nbiochemical data regarding the roles of proteostasis in different organelles of\nyeast cells, little is known about how this mechanism impacts beer fermentation\nand how different proteostasis mechanisms found in ER, mitochondria, and\ncytosol communicate with each other during ethanol/fermentative stress.\nSupporting this integrative view, transcriptome data analysis was applied using\npublicly available information for a lager yeast strain grown under in beer\nproduction conditions. The transcriptome data indicated upregulation of genes\nthat encode chaperones, co-chaperones, unfolded protein response elements in ER\nand mitochondria, ubiquitin ligases, proteasome components, N-glycosylation\nquality control pathway proteins, and components of processing bodies\n(p-bodies) and stress granules (SGs) during lager beer fermentation. Thus, the\nmain purpose of this hypothesis and theory manuscript is to provide a concise\npicture of how inter-organellar proteostasis mechanisms are connected with one\nanother and with biological processes that may modulate the viability and/or\nvitality of yeast populations during HG/VHG beer fermentation and serial\nrepitching.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Oct 2019 12:21:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Dec 2019 12:39:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Telini", "Bianca de Paula", ""], ["Menoncin", "Marcelo", ""], ["Bonatto", "Diego", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.05531", "submitter": "Daniele Cappelletti", "authors": "Daniele Cappelletti, Ankit Gupta, Mustafa Khammash", "title": "A hidden integral structure endows Absolute Concentration Robust systems\n  with resilience to dynamical concentration disturbances", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC math.DS math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biochemical systems that express certain chemical species of interest at the\nsame level at any positive equilibrium are called \"absolute concentration\nrobust\" (ACR).

In the present paper, we\nmathematically prove that a well-known class of ACR systems studied by Shinar\nand Feinberg in 2010 hides an internal integral structure. This structure\nconfers these systems with a higher degree of robustness that what was\npreviously unknown. In particular, disturbances much more general than sudden\nchanges in the species concentrations can be rejected, and robust perfect\nadaptation is achieved. Significantly, we show that these properties are\nmaintained when the system is interconnected with other chemical reaction\nnetworks.

Coarse-grained models are routinely employed to\nstudy the curvature sensing phenomena and membrane morphology at the length\nscale of few micrometers. Two prevalent phenomenological models exist for\nmodeling experimental observations of curvature sensing, (1) the spontaneous\ncurvature model and (2) the curvature mismatch model, which differ in their\ntreatment of the change in elastic energy due to the binding of proteins on the\nmembrane. In this work, the prediction of sensing and generation behaviour, by\nthese two models, are investigated using analytical calculations as well as\nDynamic Triangulation Monte Carlo simulations of quasi-spherical vesicles.\nWhile the spontaneous curvature model yields a monotonically decreasing sensing\ncurve as a function of vesicle radius, the curvature mismatch model results in\na non-monotonic sensing curve. We highlight the main differences in the\ninterpretation of the protein-related parameters in the two models. We further\npropose that the spontaneous curvature model is appropriate for modeling\nperipheral proteins employing the hydrophobic insertion mechanism, with minimal\nmodification of membrane rigidity, while the curvature mismatch model is\nappropriate for modeling curvature generation using scaffolding mechanism where\nthere is significant stiffening of the membrane due to protein binding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Oct 2019 05:39:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Krishnan", "T.
