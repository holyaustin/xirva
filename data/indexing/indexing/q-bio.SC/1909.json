Moreover, the rates\nincrease if the DNA is coiled rather than straight. Here we model how this\nworks $in~vivo$ in mammalian cells. We use chromatin-chromatin contact data\nfrom state-of-the-art Hi-C experiments to map the protein target-search onto a\nnetwork problem. The nodes represent a DNA segment and the weight of the links\nis proportional to measured contact probabilities. We then put forward a master\nequation for the density of searching protein that allows us to calculate the\nassociation rates across the genome analytically. For segments where the rates\nare high, we find that they are enriched with active genes and have high RNA\nexpression levels.
