Here, we address this question by focusing on the\nParABS DNA segregation system, composed of a centromeric-like sequence (parS),\na DNA-binding protein (ParB) and a motor (ParA). We show that parS-ParB\nassociate to form nanometer-sized, round condensates. ParB molecules diffuse\nrapidly within the nucleoid volume, but display confined motions when trapped\ninside ParB condensates. Single ParB molecules are able to rapidly diffuse\nbetween different condensates, and nucleation is strongly favoured by parS.\nNotably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates.\nThese results describe a novel active mechanism that splits, segregates and\nlocalises non-canonical LLPS condensates in the sub-cellular space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2020 06:44:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Guilhas", "B.", ""], ["Walter", "J.

Recent HiC data have revealed a strong bias in favour\nof a particular arrangement of the CTCF binding motifs that stabilize loops,\nand extrusion is the only model to date which can explain this. However, the\nmodel requires a motor to generate the loops, and although cohesin is a strong\ncandidate for the extruding factor, a suitable motor protein (or a motor\nactivity in cohesin itself) has yet to be found.
