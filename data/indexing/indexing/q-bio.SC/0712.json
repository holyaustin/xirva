For proteins binding to the\nspecific sites on the DNA and regulating transcription, the ability of the\nproteins to diffuse in one dimension by sliding along the length of the DNA, in\naddition to their diffusion in bulk solution, would seem to generate a larger\ntarget for DNA binding, consequently reducing the noise in the occupancy of the\nregulatory site. Here we show that this effect is largely cancelled by the\nenhanced temporal correlations in one dimensional diffusion. With realistic\nparameters, sliding along DNA has surprisingly little effect on the physical\nlimits to the precision of transcriptional regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 00:41:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tkacik", "Gasper", ""], ["Bialek", "William", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.1973", "submitter": "Massimo Sandal", "authors": "Massimo Sandal, Francesco Valle, Isabella Tessari, Stefano Mammi,\n  Elisabetta Bergantino, Francesco Musiani, Marco Brucale, Luigi Bubacco, and\n  Bruno Samori'", "title": "Conformational equilibria in monomeric alpha-synuclein at the single\n  molecule level", "comments": "37 pages, 9 figures (including supplementary material)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": null, "abstract": "  Natively unstructured proteins defy the classical \"one sequence-one\nstructure\" paradigm of protein science. Monomers of these proteins in\npathological conditions can aggregate in the cell, a process that underlies\nsocially relevant neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. A\nfull comprehension of the formation and structure of the so-called misfolded\nintermediates from which the aggregated states ensue is still lacking. We\ncharacterized the folding and the conformational diversity of alpha-synuclein\n(aSyn), a natively unstructured protein involved in Parkinson disease, by\nmechanically stretching single molecules of this protein and recording their\nmechanical properties. These experiments permitted us to directly observe\ndirectly and quantify three main classes of conformations that, under in vitro\nphysiological conditions, exist simultaneously in the aSyn sample, including\ndisordered and \"beta-like\" structures. We found that this class of \"beta-like\"\nstructures is directly related to aSyn aggregation. In fact, their relative\nabundance increases drastically in three different conditions known to promote\nthe formation of aSyn fibrils: the presence of Cu2+, the occurrence of the\npathogenic A30P mutation, and high ionic strength. We expect that a critical\nconcentration of aSyn with a \"beta-like\" structure must be reached to trigger\nfibril formation. This critical concentration is therefore controlled by a\nchemical equilibrium. Novel pharmacological strategies can now be tailored to\nact upstream, before the aggregation process ensues, by targeting this\nequilibrium. To this end, Single Molecule Force Spectroscopy can be an\neffective tool to tailor and test new pharmacological agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Dec 2007 16:29:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Sandal", "Massimo", ""], ["Valle", "Francesco", ""], ["Tessari", "Isabella", ""], ["Mammi", "Stefano", ""], ["Bergantino", "Elisabetta", ""], ["Musiani", "Francesco", ""], ["Brucale", "Marco", ""], ["Bubacco", "Luigi", ""], ["Samori'", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.2981", "submitter": "Razvan Radulescu M.D.", "authors": "Razvan Tudor Radulescu", "title": "Oncoprotein metastasis disjoined", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.BM", "license": null, "abstract": "  As the past decade barely dawned, a fundamentally novel view of cancer\nrelating to signal transduction through intracellular hormones/growth factors\nand their subunits began to unfold.
