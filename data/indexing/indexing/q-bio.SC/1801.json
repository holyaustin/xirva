While the steady-state behavior of the pathway\nstimulated by a time-invariant signal is relatively well-understood, we show\nusing a computational model that it exhibits a rich repertoire of transient\nadaptive responses to changes in stimuli. When the signal is switched on, the\nresponse is characterized by long-lived modulations in frequency as well as\namplitude. On withdrawing the stimulus, the activity decays over timescales\nmuch longer than that of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation processes,\nexhibiting reverberations characterized by repeated spiking in the activated\nMAPK concentration. The long-term persistence of such post-stimulus activity\nsuggests that the cascade retains memory of the signal for a significant\nduration following its removal, even in the absence of any explicit feedback or\ncross-talk with other pathways. We find that the molecular mechanism underlying\nthis behavior is related to the existence of distinct relaxation rates for the\ndifferent cascade components. This results in the imbalance of fluxes between\ndifferent layers of the cascade, with the repeated reuse of activated kinases\nas enzymes when they are released from sequestration in complexes leading to\none or more spike events following the removal of the stimulus. The persistent\nadaptive response reported here, indicative of a cellular \"short-term\" memory,\nsuggests that this ubiquitous signaling pathway plays an even more central role\nin information processing by eukaryotic cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jan 2018 05:03:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-07", "authors_parsed": [["Mitra", "Tanmay", ""], ["Menon", "Shakti N.", ""], ["Sinha", "Sitabhra", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.04232", "submitter": "Davide Michieletto", "authors": "Davide Michieletto, Marina Lusic, Davide Marenduzzo, Enzo Orlandini", "title": "Physical Principles of Retroviral Integration in the Human Genome", "comments": "Accepted in Nat Comm.

In the\nbacterium Myxococcus xanthus, the proteins PomX and PomY form a cluster on the\nchromosome that performs a biased random walk to midcell and positively\nregulates cell division there. PomZ, an ATPase, is necessary for tethering of\nthe cluster to the nucleoid and regulates its movement towards midcell. It has\nremained unclear how the cluster dynamics change when the biochemical\nparameters, such as the attachment rates of PomZ to the nucleoid and the\ncluster, the ATP hydrolysis rate of PomZ or the mobility of PomZ dimers\ninteracting with the nucleoid and cluster, are varied. To answer these\nquestions, we investigate a one-dimensional model that includes the nucleoid,\nthe Pom cluster and the PomZ protein. We find that a mechanism based on the\ndiffusive PomZ fluxes on the nucleoid into the cluster can explain the latter's\nmidnucleoid localization for a broad parameter range. Furthermore, there is an\nATP hydrolysis rate that minimizes the time the cluster needs to reach\nmidnucleoid. If the dynamics of PomZ dimers on the nucleoid is slow relative to\nthe cluster's velocity, we observe oscillatory cluster movements around\nmidnucleoid. To understand midnucleoid localization, we developed a\nsemi-analytical approach that dissects the net movement of the cluster into its\ncomponents: the difference in PomZ fluxes into the cluster from either side,\nthe force exerted by a single PomZ dimer on the cluster and the effective\nfriction coefficient of the cluster. Importantly, we predict that the Pom\ncluster oscillates around midnucleoid if the diffusivity of PomZ on the\nnucleoid is reduced.
