In a recent study,\na mycobacterial population of M. smegmatis was shown to develop phenotypic\nheterogeneity under nutrient depletion. The observed heterogeneity is in the\nform of a bimodal distribution of the expression levels of the Green\nFluorescent Protein (GFP) as reporter with the gfp fused to the promoter of the\nrel gene. The stringent response pathway is initiated in the subpopulation with\nhigh rel activity.In the present study, we characterize quantitatively the\nsingle cell promoter activity of the three key genes, namely, mprA, sigE and\nrel, in the stringent response pathway with gfp as the reporter. The origin of\nbimodality in the GFP distribution lies in two stable expression states, i.e.,\nbistability. We develop a theoretical model to study the dynamics of the\nstringent response pathway. The model incorporates a recently proposed\nmechanism of bistability based on positive feedback and cell growth retardation\ndue to protein synthesis. Based on flow cytometry data, we establish that the\ndistribution of GFP levels in the mycobacterial population at any point of time\nis a linear superposition of two invariant distributions, one Gaussian and the\nother lognormal, with only the coefficients in the linear combination depending\non time. This allows us to use a binning algorithm and determine the time\nvariation of the mean protein level, the fraction of cells in a subpopulation\nand also the coefficient of variation, a measure of gene expression noise.The\nresults of the theoretical model along with a comprehensive analysis of the\nflow cytometry data provide definitive evidence for the coexistence of two\nsubpopulations with overlapping protein distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jul 2010 10:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 09:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Ghosh", "Sayantari", ""], ["Sureka", "Kamakshi", ""], ["Ghosh", "Bhaswar", ""], ["Bose", "Indrani", ""], ["Basu", "Joyoti", ""], ["Kundu", "Manikuntala", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.2473", "submitter": "Golan Bel", "authors": "Anton Zilman and Golan Bel", "title": "Crowding effects in non-equilibrium transport through nano-channels", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/0953-8984/22/45/454130", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transport through nano-channels plays an important role in many biological\nprocesses and industrial applications. Gaining insights into the functioning of\nbiological transport processes and the design of man-made nano-devices requires\nan understanding of the basic physics of such transport. A simple exclusion\nprocess has proven to be very useful in ex- plaining the properties of several\nartificial and biological nano-channels. It is particularly useful for modeling\nthe influence of inter-particle interactions on transport characteristics. In\nthis paper, we explore several models of the exclusion process using a mean\nfield approach and computer simulations. We examine the effects of crowding\ninside the channel and its immediate vicinity on the mean flux and the\ntransport times of single molecules. Finally, we discuss the robustness of the\ntheory's predictions with respect to the crucial characteristics of the\nhindered diffusion in nano-channels that need to be included in the model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Jul 2010 04:58:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Zilman", "Anton", ""], ["Bel", "Golan", ""]]}, {"id": "1007.3809", "submitter": "Thomas R.

The domain formation is\nlikely caused by a length difference of the receptor-ligand complexes, and has\nbeen investigated in experiments in which T cells adhere to supported membranes\nwith anchored ligands. For supported membranes with two types of anchored\nligands, MHCp and ICAM1, that bind to the receptors TCR and LFA1 in the cell\nmembrane, the coexistence of domains of TCR-MHCp and LFA1-ICAM1 complexes in\nthe cell adhesion zone has been observed for a wide range of ligand\nconcentrations and affinities. For supported membranes with long and short\nligands that bind to the same cell receptor CD2, in contrast, domain\ncoexistence has been observed for a rather narrow ratio of ligand\nconcentrations. In this article, we determine detailed phase diagrams for cells\nadhering to supported membranes with a statistical-physical model of cell\nadhesion. We find a characteristic difference between the adhesion scenarios in\nwhich two types of ligands in a supported membrane bind (i) to the same cell\nreceptor or (ii) to two different cell receptors, which helps to explain the\nexperimental observations. Our phase diagrams fully include thermal shape\nfluctuations of the cell membranes on nanometer scales, which lead to a\ncritical point for the domain formation and to a cooperative binding of the\nreceptors and ligands.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Jul 2010 07:10:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Rozycki", "Bartosz", ""], ["Lipowsky", "Reinhard", ""], ["Weikl", "Thomas R.", ""]]}]
