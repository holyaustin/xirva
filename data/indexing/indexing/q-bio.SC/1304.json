A central issue is the analysis of\ntwo new perspectives to the scenario (two different quenched systems) in\ndetail. This means that we do not only analyse the total probability of a\nT-Cell activation (the annealed case) but also consider the probability of an\nactivation of one certain T-Cell type and the probability of a T-Cell\nactivation by a certain antigen presenting cell (the quenched cases). Finally,\nwe see analytically that the probability of T-Cell activation increases with\nthe number of presented foreign peptides in all three cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Apr 2013 07:34:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mayer", "Hannah", ""], ["Bovier", "Anton", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3827", "submitter": "Julian Weichsel", "authors": "Julian Weichsel and Ulrich S.

Although the core molecular machinery for actin\nnetwork growth is well preserved in most cases, the geometry of the propelled\nobstacle can vary considerably. In recent years, filament orientation\ndistribution has emerged as an important observable characterizing the\nstructure and dynamical state of the growing network. Here we derive several\ncontinuum equations for the orientation distribution of filaments growing\nbehind stiff obstacles of various shapes and validate the predicted steady\nstate orientation patterns by stochastic computer simulations based on discrete\nfilaments. We use an ordinary differential equation approach to demonstrate\nthat for flat obstacles of finite size, two fundamentally different orientation\npatterns peaked at either +35/-35 or +70/0/-70 degrees exhibit mutually\nexclusive stability, in agreement with earlier results for flat obstacles of\nvery large lateral extension. We calculate and validate phase diagrams as a\nfunction of model parameters and show how this approach can be extended to\nobstacles with piecewise straight contours. For curved obstacles, we arrive at\na partial differential equation in the continuum limit, which again is in good\nagreement with the computer simulations. In all cases, we can identify the same\ntwo fundamentally different orientation patterns, but only within an\nappropriate reference frame, which is adjusted to the local orientation of the\nobstacle contour. Our results suggest that two fundamentally different network\narchitectures compete with each other in growing actin networks, irrespective\nof obstacle geometry, and clarify how simulated and electron tomography data\nhave to be analyzed for non-flat obstacle geometries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 13 Apr 2013 17:51:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Weichsel", "Julian", ""], ["Schwarz", "Ulrich S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.4306", "submitter": "George Bass Ph.D.", "authors": "George Bass and James Chenevey", "title": "Dependence of Substrate Irradiation Reaction Rate Stimulation on Lactic\n  Dehydrogenase Source", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Stimulation of LDH initial reaction rates by timed pre-irradiation of\ncrystalline sodium pyruvate and lithium lactate is reported for enzymes\nisolated from rabbit muscle, pig heart, human erythrocytes and chicken heart.\nThe phenomenon investigated is referred to as the Comorosan effect.

This is a good\napproximation for processes when ionic concentrations vary little during the\ntime course of a simulation. During periods of intense neural signalling,\nhowever, the local extracellular K+ concentration may increase by several\nmillimolars. Clearance of excess K+ likely depends partly on diffusion in the\nextracellular space, partly on local uptake by- and intracellular transport\nwithin astrocytes. This process takes place at the time scale of seconds, and\ncan not be modeled accurately without accounting for the spatiotemporal\nvariations in ion concentrations. The work presented here consists of two main\nparts: First, we developed a general electrodiffusive formalism for modeling\nion concentration dynamics in a one-dimensional geometry, including both an\nintra- and extracellular domain. The formalism was based on the Nernst-Planck\nequations. It ensures (i) consistency between the membrane potential and ion\nconcentrations, (ii) global particle/charge conservation, and (iii) accounts\nfor diffusion and concentration dependent variations in resistivities. Second,\nwe applied the formalism to model how astrocytes exchange ions with the ECS,\nand identified the key astrocytic mechanisms involved in K+ removal from high\nconcentration regions. We found that a local increase in extracellular\nK\\textsuperscript{+} evoked a local depolarization of the astrocyte membrane,\nwhich at the same time (i) increased the local astrocytic uptake of\nK\\textsuperscript{+}, (ii) suppressed extracellular transport of K+, (iii)\nincreased transport of K+ within astrocytes, and (iv) facilitated astrocytic\nrelase of K+ in extracellular low concentration regions. In summary, these\nmechanisms seem optimal for shielding the extracellular space from excess K+.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 20:02:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 12:56:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Halnes", "Geir", ""], ["\u00d8stby", "Ivar", ""], ["Pettersen", "Klas H.", ""], ["Omholt", "Stig W.", ""], ["Einevoll", "Gaute T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.7905", "submitter": "Sergej Mironov", "authors": "S.
