No previous theoretical models of the myosin-V walk reproduce all\nthe observed trends of velocity and run-length with [ADP], [ATP] and external\nforcing. In particular, a result that has eluded all theoretical studies based\nupon rigorous physical chemistry is that run length decreases with both\nincreasing [ADP] and [ATP]. We systematically analyse which mechanisms in\nexisting models reproduce which experimental trends and use this information to\nguide the development of models that can reproduce them all. We formulate\nmodels as reaction networks between distinct mechanochemical states with\nenergetically determined transition rates. For each network architecture, we\ncompare predictions for velocity and run length to a subset of experimentally\nmeasured values, and fit unknown parameters using a bespoke MCSA optimization\nroutine. Finally we determine which experimental trends are replicated by the\nbest-fit model for each architecture. Only two models capture them all: one\ninvolving [ADP]-dependent mechanical detachment, and another including\n[ADP]-dependent futile cycling and nucleotide pocket collapse. Comparing\nmodel-predicted and experimentally observed kinetic transition rates favors the\nlatter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 10:38:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 12:47:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Boon", "Neville J.", ""], ["Hoyle", "Rebecca B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.2945", "submitter": "Jean-Charles Walter", "authors": "Luca Ciandrini, I.

The cytoskeletal\nbinding sites are in contact with the same finite reservoir of motors (either\nthe cytosol or the flow chamber) and hence compete for recruiting the available\nmotors, potentially depleting the reservoir and affecting cytoskeletal\ntransport. In this work we provide a theoretical framework to study,\nanalytically and numerically, how motor density profiles and crowding along\ncytoskeletal filaments depend on the competition of motors for their binding\nsites. We propose two models in which finite processive motor proteins actively\nadvance along cytoskeletal filaments and are continuously exchanged with the\nmotor pool. We first look at homogeneous reservoirs and then examine the\neffects of free motor diffusion in the surrounding medium. We consider as a\nreference situation recent in vitro experimental setups of kinesin-8 motors\nbinding and moving along microtubule filaments in a flow chamber. We\ninvestigate how the crowding of linear motor proteins moving on a filament can\nbe regulated by the balance between supply (concentration of motor proteins in\nthe flow chamber) and demand (total number of polymerised tubulin\nheterodimers). We present analytical results for the density profiles of bound\nmotors, the reservoir depletion, and propose novel phase diagrams that present\nthe formation of jams of motor proteins on the filament as a function of two\ntuneable experimental parameters: the motor protein concentration and the\nconcentration of tubulins polymerized into cytoskeletal filaments. Extensive\nnumerical simulations corroborate the analytical results for parameters in the\nexperimental range and also address the effects of diffusion of motor proteins\nin the reservoir.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2014 08:50:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2014 13:15:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ciandrini", "Luca", ""], ["Neri", "I.", ""], ["Walter", "Jean-Charles", ""], ["Dauloudet", "O.", ""], ["Parmeggiani", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4237", "submitter": "Davide Michieletto", "authors": "Davide Michieletto, Davide Marenduzzo and Matthew S.

During cell division each mini-circle is removed from the network,\nduplicated and then re-attached, along with its progeny. We study this process\nunder the hypothesis that there is a coupling between the topological state of\nthe mini-circles and the expression of genetic information encoded on them,\nleading to the production of Topoisomerase. This model describes a\nself-regulating system capable of full replication that reproduces several\nprevious experimental findings. We find that the fixed point of the system\ndepends on a primary free parameter of the model: the ratio between the rate of\nremoval of mini-circles from the network (R) and their (re)attachment rate (A).\nThe final topological state is found to be that of a marginally linked network\nstructure in which the fraction of mini-circles linked to the largest connected\ncomponent approaches unity as R/A decreases.

The\nmembrane-associated TatA protein is an essential component of the Tat\ntranslocon, and a broad distribution of different sized TatA-clusters is\nobserved in bacterial membranes. We assume that the size dynamics of TatA\nclusters are affected by substrate binding, unbinding, and translocation to\nassociated TatBC clusters, where clusters with bound translocation substrates\nfavour growth and those without associated substrates favour shrinkage. With a\nstochastic model of substrate binding and cluster dynamics, we numerically\ndetermine the TatA cluster size distribution. We include a proportion of\ntargeted but non-translocatable (NT) substrates, with the simplifying\nhypothesis that the substrate translocatability does not directly affect\ncluster dynamical rate constants or substrate binding or unbinding rates. This\namounts to a translocation model without specific quality control.\nNevertheless, NT substrates will remain associated with TatA clusters until\nunbound and so will affect cluster sizes and translocation rates. We find that\nthe number of larger TatA clusters depends on the NT fraction $f$. The\ntranslocation rate can be optimized by tuning the rate of spontaneous substrate\nunbinding, $\\Gamma_U$. We present an analytically solvable three-state model of\nsubstrate translocation without cluster size dynamics that follows our computed\ntranslocation rates, and that is consistent with {\\em in vitro}\nTat-translocation data in the presence of NT substrates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 20:33:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Nayak", "Chitra R.", ""], ["Brown", "Aidan I.", ""], ["Rutenberg", "Andrew D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.4919", "submitter": "S V M Satyanarayana Dr", "authors": "S.Sumathy and S.V.M.
