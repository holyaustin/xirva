Using results from the literature on diffusion-influenced reactions, we\nderive an analytical expression for the lower bound on the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation. In our theory, transcription factors can perform\nmultiple rounds of 1D diffusion along the DNA and 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm\nbefore binding to the promoter. Comparing our expression for the lower bound on\nthe precision against results from Green's Function Reaction Dynamics\nsimulations shows that the theory is highly accurate under biologically\nrelevant conditions. Our results demonstrate that, to an excellent\napproximation, the promoter switches between the transcription-factor bound and\nunbound state in a Markovian fashion. This remains true even in the presence of\nsliding, i.e. with 1D diffusion along the DNA. This has two important\nimplications: (1) minimizing the noise in the promoter state is equivalent to\nminimizing the search time of transcription factors for their promoters; (2)\nthe complicated dynamics of 3D diffusion in the cytoplasm and 1D diffusion\nalong the DNA can be captured in a well-stirred model by renormalizing the\npromoter association and dissociation rates, making it possible to efficiently\nsimulate the promoter dynamics using Gillespie simulations. Based on the recent\nexperimental observation that sliding can speed up the promoter search by a\nfactor of 4, our theory predicts that sliding can enhance the precision of\ntranscriptional regulation by a factor of 2.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 12:46:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Paijmans", "Joris", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1499", "submitter": "Thomas Ouldridge", "authors": "Thomas E.

This motif may reduce cross-talk between signalling pathways, as the\nsecond phosphorylation site allows for proofreading, especially when\nphosphorylation is distributive rather than processive. Recent studies suggest\nthat phosphorylation can be `pseudo-processive' in the crowded cellular\nenvironment, as rebinding after the first phosphorylation is enhanced by slow\ndiffusion. Here, we use a simple model with unsaturated reactants to show that\nspecificity for one substrate over another drops as rebinding increases and\npseudo-processive behavior becomes possible. However, this loss of specificity\nwith increased rebinding is typically also observed if two distinct enzyme\nspecies are required for phosphorylation, i.e. when the system is necessarily\ndistributive. Thus the loss of specificity is due to an intrinsic reduction in\nselectivity with increased rebinding, which benefits inefficient reactions,\nrather than pseudo-processivity itself. We also show that proofreading can\nremain effective when the intended signalling pathway exhibits high levels of\nrebinding-induced pseudo-processivity, unlike other proposed advantages of the\ndual phosphorylation motif.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 14:34:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 12:36:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ouldridge", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.1672", "submitter": "S.

Our particular implementation of subdiffusive transport\nis based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW) description of the motion of\nfluorescent particles, as CTRWs lend themselves particularly well to the\ninclusion of binding/unbinding events.

We find that this model can be used to obtain excellent fits to\nexperimental data. Moreover, recovery curves corresponding to different radii\nof the circular bleach spot can be fitted by a single set of parameters. While\nnot enough evidence has been collected to claim with certainty that CTRW is the\nunderlying transport mechanism in FRAP experiments, the compatibility of our\nresults with experimental data fuels the discussion as to whether normal\ndiffusion or anomalous diffusion is the appropriate model, and as to whether\nanomalous diffusion effects are important to fully understand the outcomes of\nFRAP experiments.
