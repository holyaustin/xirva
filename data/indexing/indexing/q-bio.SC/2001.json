Cyclin D1, in association with CDK4/6,\nacts as a mitogenic sensor and integrates extracellular mitogenic signals and\ncell cycle progression. When deregulated (overexpressed, accumulated,\ninappropriately located), cyclin D1 becomes an oncogene and is recognized as a\ndriver of solid tumors and hemopathies. Recent studies on the oncogenic roles\nof cyclin D1 reported non-canonical functions dependent on the partners of\ncyclin D1 and its location within tumor cells or tissues. Support for these new\nfunctions was provided by various mouse models of oncogenesis. Finally,\nproteomic and transcriptomic data identified complex cyclin D1 networks. This\nreview focuses on these aspects of cyclin D1 pathophysiology, which may be\ncrucial for targeted therapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Jan 2020 13:52:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tchakarska", "Guergana", "", "GPMCND"], ["Sola", "Brigitte", "", "GPMCND"]]}, {"id": "2001.02441", "submitter": "Ramon Grima", "authors": "Chen Jia, Ramon Grima", "title": "Small protein number effects in stochastic models of autoregulated\n  bursty gene expression", "comments": "30 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.5144578", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A stochastic model of autoregulated bursty gene expression by Kumar et al.\n[Phys.

Recently,\nsingle-cell screening experiments have shown the drug synergy between two\ncategories of biomolecules, Activators (AC) and Noise Enhancers (NE): NE can\namplify the reactivation of latent HIV induced by AC, although NE itself cannot\nreactivate HIV latency. Based on an established LTR-two-state effective model,\nwe uncover two necessary conditions for this type of drug synergy: The\ndecreasing of the turning-on rate of LTR induced by NE is highly inhibited when\npresented with AC; The timescale of LTR turning off without AC/NE presented\nshould be no slower than the timescale of Tat transactivation. Then we propose\na detailed LTR-four-state mechanistic model with both AC/NE regulation kinetics\nand Tat transactivation circuit. We show that, in order to achieve drug\nsynergy, the system of HIV gene state transition must operate out of\nthermodynamic equilibrium, which is caused by energy input. The direction of\nenergy input determines whether the inhibition of NE upon the reactivation rate\nof LTR-off states (unbinding of RNAP) can be successfully prevented in the\npresence of AC. The drug synergy can also be significantly enhanced if the\nenergy input is appropriately distributed to more than one reaction. Our model\nreveals a generic nonequilibrium mechanism underpinning the noise enhanced drug\nsynergy, which may apply to identify the same drug synergy on reactivating a\ndiverse class of lentivirus latency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 03:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Guo", "Xiaolu", ""], ["Tang", "Tao", ""], ["Duan", "Minxuan", ""], ["Zhang", "Lei", ""], ["Ge", "Hao", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.05528", "submitter": "M.

Apart from the well-documented retention function, recent findings\nreveal that the cellular KDELRs have more complex roles, e.g. in cell\nsignalling, protein secretion, cell adhesion and tumorigenesis. Furthermore,\nseveral studies suggest that a sub-population of KDELRs is located at the cell\nsurface, where they could form and internalize KDELR/cargo clusters after\nK/HDEL-ligand binding. However, so far it has been unclear whether there are\ncell-type- or species-specific differences in KDELR clustering. By comparing\nligand-induced KDELR clustering in different mouse and human cell lines via\nlive cell imaging, we show that macrophage cell lines from both species do not\ndevelop any clusters. Using RT-qPCR experiments and numerical analysis, we\naddress the role of KDELR expression as well as endocytosis and exocytosis\nrates on the receptor clustering at the plasma membrane and discuss how the\nefficiency of directed transport to preferred docking sites on the membrane\ninfluences the exponent of the power-law distribution of the cluster size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 19:53:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Jan 2020 14:41:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-09", "authors_parsed": [["Bauer", "Achim", ""], ["Santen", "Ludger", ""], ["Schmitt", "Manfred J.", ""], ["Shaebani", "M.
