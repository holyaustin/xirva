Experimental studies indicate that they interact with each\nother and they frequently work together in large groups. To understand the\nmechanisms of collective behavior of motor proteins we study the effect of\ninteractions in the transport of molecular motors along linear filaments. It is\ndone by analyzing a recently introduced class of totally asymmetric exclusion\nprocesses that takes into account the intermolecular interactions via\nthermodynamically consistent approach. We develop a new theoretical method that\nallows us to compute analytically all dynamic properties of the system. Our\nanalysis shows that correlations play important role in dynamics of interacting\nmolecular motors. Surprisingly, we find that the correlations for repulsive\ninteractions are weaker and more short-range than the correlations for the\nattractive interactions. In addition, it is shown that symmetry of interactions\naffect dynamic properties of molecular motors. The implications of these\nfindings for motor proteins transport are discussed.
