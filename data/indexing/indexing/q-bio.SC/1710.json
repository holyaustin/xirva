To enable this wide\nrange of transient mechanical processes and properties, networks of actin\nfilaments continuously disassemble and reassemble via active\nde/re-polymerization. However, the question remains as to how\nde/re-polymerization kinetics of individual actin filaments translate to\ntime-varying mechanics of dis/re-assembling networks. To address this question,\nto ultimately elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to exhibit a\nmyriad of transitory mechanical properties, we couple time-resolved active\nmicrorheology with microfluidics to measure the time-varying viscoelastic\nmoduli of entangled and crosslinked actin networks during chemically-triggered\nnetwork disassembly and reassembly. We also develop a corresponding\nmathematical model that relates the time-evolution of filament length to the\nresulting time-dependent storage moduli of evolving networks. During\ndisassembly, we find that the moduli exhibit two distinct exponential decays,\nwith experimental time constants of $\\sim$169 and $\\sim$47 min, which we show\narises from a phase transition from a rigid percolated network to a non-rigid\nregime occurring after $\\sim$90 min. During reassembly, measured moduli exhibit\nlinear increase with time for $\\sim$90 min, after which steady-state values are\nachieved. Our theoretical model shows that reassembly mechanics are dominated\nby elongation kinetics, and that elongation rates are much slower than has been\nrecently assumed.

One of the species of particles\n($P$) represents RNAP motors while the other ($R$) represents replication\nforks. Motivated by the biological phenomena that this model is intended to\ncapture, a maximum of only two $R$ particles are allowed to enter the lattice\nfrom two opposite ends whereas the unrestricted number of $P$ particles\nconstitute a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) in a segment\nin the middle of the lattice. Consequently, the lattice consists of three\nsegments; the encounters of the $P$ particles with the $R$ particles are\nconfined within the middle segment (segment $2$) whereas only the $R$ particles\ncan occupy the sites in the segments $1$ and $3$. The model captures three\ndistinct pathways for resolving the co-directional as well as head-collision\nbetween the $P$ and $R$ particles.
