Low ratio values lead to fast\nsorting, but results in a broad size distribution of sorted compartments\ndominated by small entities. High ratio values result in two well defined\nsorted compartments but is exponentially slow. Our results suggest an optimal\nbalance between vesicle budding and fusion for the rapid and efficient sorting\nof membrane components, and highlight the importance of stochastic effects for\nthe steady-state organisation of intra-cellular compartments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 15:36:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jan 2018 13:50:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Vagne", "Quentin", ""], ["Sens", "Pierre", ""]]}]
