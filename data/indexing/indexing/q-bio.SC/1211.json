However, no\napplications of this strategy against protozoan-induced diseases have been\nreported so far. In the present study, Crithidia fasciculata, a widely used\nmodel for therapeutic strategies against pathogenic trypanosomatids, was\ntargeted with Fe_{3}O_{4} magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in order to remotely\nprovoke cell death using TVMFs. The MNPs with average sizes of d approx. 30 nm\nwere synthesized using a precipitation of FeSO_{4}4 in basic medium. The MNPs\nwere added to Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes in exponential phase and\nincubated overnight. The amount of uploaded MNPs per cell was determined by\nmagnetic measurements. Cell viability using the MTT colorimetric assay and flow\ncytometry showed that the MNPs were incorporated by the cells with no\nnoticeable cell-toxicity effects. When a TVMF (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m) was\napplied to MNP-bearing cells, massive cell death was induced via a\nnon-apoptotic mechanism. No effects were observed by applying a TVMF on control\n(without loaded MNPs) cells. No macroscopic rise in temperature was observed in\nthe extracellular medium during the experiments. Scanning Electron Microscopy\nshowed morphological changes after TVMF experiments.

Recent experiments found that, cargo transportation by two\nmotor species has a memory, it does not change its direction as frequently as\nexpected, which means that its forward and backward step rates depends on its\nprevious motion trajectory. By assuming cargo has only the least memory, i.e.\nits step direction depends only on the direction of its last step, two cases of\ncargo motion are detailed analyzed in this study: {\\bf (I)} cargo motion under\nconstant external load; and {\\bf (II)} cargo motion in one fixed optical trap.\nDue to the existence of memory, for the first case, cargo can keep moving in\nthe same direction for a long distance. For the second case, the cargo will\noscillate in the trap.

The most likely location of cargo, where the\nprobability of finding the oscillated cargo is maximum, may be the same as or\nmay be different with the trap center, which depends on the step rates of the\ntwo motor species.

Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the\nmean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and\ndepolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely\nfrom the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when\npolarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the\nabsence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity\ninversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions,\nwe find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls\nbut SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three\ndimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supra-cellular\nlevel, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of\nnon-motile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads\ngenerically to rotational as well as translational motion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Nov 2012 10:46:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Tjhung", "E.", ""], ["Marenduzzo", "D.", ""], ["Cates", "M.

Using quantitative data obtained from a fungal\nmodel system, we previously developed ASEP-models of bidirectional motion of\nmotors along unipolar microtubules (MTs) near the cell ends of the elongated\nhyphal cells (herein referred as \"unipolar section\"). However, recent\nquantitative live cell imaging in this system has demonstrated that long-range\nmotility of motors and their endosomal cargo mainly occurs along extended\nantipolar microtubule bundles within the central part of the cell (herein\nreferred to as \"bipolar section\"). Dynein and kinesin-3 motors coordinate their\nactivity to move early endosomes (EEs) in a bidirectional fashion, with dynein\nmediating retrograde motility along the unipolar section near the cell poles,\nwhereas kinesin-3 is responsible for bidirectional motions along the antipolar\nsection. Here we extend our modelling approach to simulate bidirectional\nmotility along an antipolar microtubule bundle. In our model, cargos\n(particles) change direction on each MT with a turning rate $\\Omega$ and the\nMTs are linked to each other at the minus ends where particles can hop between\nMTs with a rate $q_1$ (obstacle-induced switching rate) or $q_2$ (end-induced\nswitching rate). By numerical simulations and mean-field approximations, we\ninvestigate the distribution of particles along the MTs for different overall\ndensities $\\Theta$. We find that even if $\\Theta$ is low, the system can\nexhibit shocks in the density profiles near plus and minus ends caused by\nqueueing of particles.
