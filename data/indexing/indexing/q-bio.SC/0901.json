The precise mechanism of this\nforeign-self-distinction, though one of the major tasks of the immune system,\ncontinues to be a fundamental puzzle. Recent progress has been made by van den\nBerg, Rand, and Burroughs (2001), who modelled the \\emph{probabilistic} nature\nof the interaction between the relevant cell types, namely, T-cells and\nantigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here, the stochasticity is due to the random\nsample of antigens present on the surface of every APC, and to the random\nreceptor type that characterises individual T-cells. It has been shown\npreviously that this model, though highly idealised, is capable of reproducing\nimportant aspects of the recognition phenomenon, and of explaining them on the\nbasis of stochastic rare events. These results were obtained with the help of a\nrefined large deviation theorem and were thus asymptotic in nature. Simulations\nhave, so far, been restricted to the straightforward simple sampling approach,\nwhich does not allow for sample sizes large enough to address more detailed\nquestions. Building on the available large deviation results, we develop an\nimportance sampling technique that allows for a convenient exploration of the\nrelevant tail events by means of simulation. With its help, we investigate the\nmechanism of statistical recognition in some depth.
