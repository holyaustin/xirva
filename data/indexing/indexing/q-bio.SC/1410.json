It is shown that the major earlier\nresults such as occurrence of normal versus anomalous transport depending on\nthe amplitude of binding potential, cargo size and the motor turnover frequency\nnot only survive in this more realistic model, but the results also look very\nsimilar for the correspondingly adjusted parameters. However, this more\nrealistic model displays a substantially larger thermodynamic efficiency due to\na bidirectional mechanochemical coupling. For realistic parameters, the maximal\nthermodynamic efficiency can be transiently about 50% as observed for kinesins,\nand even larger, surprisingly also in a novel strongly anomalous (sub)transport\nregime, where the motor enzymatic turnovers become also anomalously slow and\ncannot be characterized by a turnover rate. Here anomalously slow dynamics of\nthe cargo enforces anomalously slow cyclic kinetics of the motor protein.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Oct 2014 10:38:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Goychuk", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.4002", "submitter": "Sakuntala Chatterjee", "authors": "Mithun Kumar Mitra and Sakuntala Chatterjee", "title": "Boundary induced phase transition with stochastic entrance and exit", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "J Stat Mech P10019 (2014)", "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2014/10/P10019", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study an open-chain totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP) with\nstochastic gates present at the two boundaries.

This coordination has for long been supposed to\nrely on the existence of size thresholds determining cell cycle progression\n[1]. In budding yeast, size is controlled at the G1/S transition [11]. In\nagreement with this hypothesis, the size at birth influences the time spent in\nG1: smaller cells have a longer G1 period [3]. Nevertheless, even though cells\nborn smaller have a longer G1, the compensation is imperfect and they still bud\nat smaller cell sizes. In bacteria, several recent studies have shown that the\nincremental model of size control, in which size is controlled by addition of a\nconstant volume (in contrast to a size threshold), is able to quantitatively\nexplain the experimental data on 4 different bacterial species [6, 5, 6, 7].\nHere, we report on experimental results for the budding yeast Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae, finding, surprisingly, that cell size control in this organism is\nvery well described by the incremental model, suggesting a common strategy for\ncell size control with bacteria. Additionally, we argue that for S. cerevisiae\nthe volume increment is not added from birth to division, but rather between\ntwo budding events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 15:50:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Oct 2014 19:59:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 15:03:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-04", "authors_parsed": [["Soifer", "Ilya", ""], ["Robert", "Lydia", ""], ["Amir", "Ariel", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.4853", "submitter": "Andrej Ko\\v{s}mrlj", "authors": "Andrej Kosmrlj, Pia Cordsen, Anders Kyrsting, Daniel E.

Our analysis of the experimental\ndecay patterns allowed us to refine the structure of the degradation pathways\nat the single molecule level. Surprisingly, we found that if the previously\nhypothesized network was correct, only about 7% of the target mRNA would be\nregulated by the miRNA mechanism, which is inconsistent with the available\nknowledge. Based on systematic data analysis, we propose the alternative\nhypothesis that NOT1 interacts with miRISC before binding to the target mRNA.\nMoreover, we show that when miRISC binds alone to the target mRNA, the mRNA is\ndegraded more slowly, probably through a deadenylation-independent pathway. The\nnew biochemical pathway we propose both fits the data and paves the way for new\nexperimental work to identify new interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Oct 2014 15:49:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sin", "Celine", ""], ["Chiarugi", "Davide", ""], ["Valleriani", "Angelo", ""]]}]
