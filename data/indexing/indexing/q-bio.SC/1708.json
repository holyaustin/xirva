They are helical polymers\nwith a well-defined polarity, composed of globular monomers that bind\nnucleotides in one of three hydrolysis states (ATP, ADP-Pi, or ADP). Mean-field\nmodels of the dynamics of actin polymerization have succeeded in, among other\nthings, determining the nucleotide profile of an average filament and resolving\nthe mechanisms of accessory proteins, however these models require numerical\nsolution of a high-dimensional system of nonlinear ODE's. By truncating a set\nof recursion equations, the Brooks-Carlsson model reduces dimensionality to 11,\nbut it remains nonlinear and does not admit an analytical solution, hence,\nsignificantly hindering understanding of its resulting dynamics. In this work,\nby taking advantage of the fast timescales of the hydrolysis states of the\nfilament tips, we propose two model reduction schemes that achieve low\ndimensionality and linearity. We provide an exact solution of the resulting\nlinear equations and use it to shed light on the dynamical behaviors of the\nfull BC model, highlighting the relative ordering of the timescales of various\ncollective processes, and explaining some unusual dependence of the\nsteady-state behavior on initial conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 21:24:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Floyd", "Carlos S.", ""], ["Jarzynski", "Christopher", ""], ["Papoian", "Garegin A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.07678", "submitter": "Juraj Szavits Nossan Dr", "authors": "Juraj Szavits-Nossan, Luca Ciandrini and M.

We propose an analytic\nmethod to solve a translation model based on the inhomogeneous totally\nasymmetric simple exclusion process, which allows us to unveil simple design\nprinciples of nucleotide sequences determining protein production rates. Our\nsolution shows an excellent agreement when compared to numerical genome-wide\nsimulations of S. cerevisiae transcript sequences and predicts that the first\n10 codons, together with the value of the initiation rate, are the main\ndeterminants of protein production rate. Finally, we interpret the obtained\nanalytic results based on the evolutionary role of codons' choice for\nregulating translation rates and ribosome densities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 10:18:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Mar 2018 10:16:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Szavits-Nossan", "Juraj", ""], ["Ciandrini", "Luca", ""], ["Romano", "M.
