We explored the extent of\nmutational robustness in the budding yeast by genome wide dosage suppressor\nanalysis of 53 conditional lethal mutations in cell division cycle and RNA\nsynthesis related genes, revealing 660 suppressor interactions of which 642 are\nnovel. This collection has several distinctive features, including high\nco-occurrence of mutant-suppressor pairs within protein modules, highly\ncorrelated functions between the pairs, and higher diversity of functions among\nthe co-suppressors than previously observed. Dosage suppression of essential\ngenes encoding RNA polymerase subunits and chromosome cohesion complex suggest\na surprising degree of functional plasticity of macromolecular complexes and\nthe existence od degenerate pathways for circumventing potentially lethal\nmutations. The utility of dosage-suppressor networks is illustrated by the\ndiscovery of a novel connection between chromosome cohesion-condensation\npathways involving homologous recombination, and Huntington's disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 20:00:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Patra", "B.", ""], ["Kon", "Y.", ""], ["Yadav", "G.", ""], ["Sevold", "A.

Although it has previously been shown that channel noise can\nnontrivially affect neuronal dynamics, it is unknown whether ion-channel noise\nis strong enough to act as a noise source for hypothesised noise-enhanced\ninformation processing in real neuronal systems, i.e. 'stochastic\nfacilitation.' Here, we demonstrate that biophysical models of channel noise\ncan give rise to two kinds of recently discovered stochastic facilitation\neffects in a Hodgkin-Huxley-like model of auditory brainstem neurons. The\nfirst, known as slope-based stochastic resonance (SBSR), enables phasic neurons\nto emit action potentials that can encode the slope of inputs that vary slowly\nrelative to key time-constants in the model. The second, known as inverse\nstochastic resonance (ISR), occurs in tonically firing neurons when small\nlevels of noise inhibit tonic firing and replace it with burst-like dynamics.\nConsistent with previous work, we conclude that channel noise can provide\nsignificant variability in firing dynamics, even for large numbers of channels.\nMoreover, our results show that possible associated computational benefits may\noccur due to channel noise in neurons of the auditory brainstem. This holds\nwhether the firing dynamics in the model are phasic (SBSR can occur due to\nchannel noise) or tonic (ISR can occur due to channel noise).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 23:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 11:40:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Schmerl", "Brett A.", ""], ["McDonnell", "Mark D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.4514", "submitter": "Andrew Mugler", "authors": "Pieter Rein ten Wolde, Andrew Mugler", "title": "The importance of crowding in signaling, genetic, and metabolic networks", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is now well established that the cell is a highly crowded environment.\nYet, the effects of crowding on the dynamics of signaling pathways, gene\nregulation networks and metabolic networks are still largely unknown. Crowding\ncan alter both molecular diffusion and the equilibria of biomolecular\nreactions. In this review, we first discuss how diffusion can affect\nbiochemical networks. Diffusion of transcription factors can increase noise in\ngene expression, while diffusion of proteins between intracellular compartments\nor between cells can reduce concentration fluctuations. In push-pull networks\ndiffusion can impede information transmission, while in multi-site protein\nmodification networks diffusion can qualitatively change the macroscopic\nresponse of the system, such as the loss or emergence of bistability. Moreover,\ndiffusion can directly change the metabolic flux. We describe how crowding\naffects diffusion, and thus how all these phenomena are influenced by crowding.\nYet, a potentially more important effect of crowding on biochemical networks is\nmediated via the shift in the equilibria of bimolecular reactions, and we\nprovide computational evidence that supports this idea. Finally, we discuss how\nthe effects of crowding can be incorporated in models of biochemical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2013 19:48:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Mugler", "Andrew", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.7433", "submitter": "Ramon Grima", "authors": "Ramon Grima, Nils Walter and Santiago Schnell", "title": "Single molecule enzymology a la Michaelis-Menten", "comments": "Review article, 32 pages, 4 figures; accepted for publication in FEBS\n  Journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the past one hundred years, deterministic rate equations have been\nsuccessfully used to infer enzyme-catalysed reaction mechanisms and to estimate\nrate constants from reaction kinetics experiments conducted in vitro.
