Clustering\nof genes with similar expression profiles allows for a course-grained view of\nthe GRN and a probabilistic determination of the connectivity among the\nclusters. We present a model for the temporal evolution of a gene cluster\nnetwork which takes into account interactions of gene products with genes and,\nthrough a non-constant degradation rate, with other gene products. The number\nof model parameters is reduced by using polynomial functions to interpolate\ntemporal data points. In this manner, the task of parameter estimation is\nreduced to a system of linear algebraic equations, thus making the computation\ntime shorter by orders of magnitude. To eliminate irrelevant networks, we test\neach GRN for stability with respect to parameter variations, and impose\nrestrictions on its behavior near the steady state. We apply our model and\nmethods to DNA microarray time series' data collected on Escherichia coli\nduring glucose-lactose diauxie and infer the most probable cluster network for\ndifferent phases of the experiment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2011 10:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Albert", "Jaroslav", ""], ["Rooman", "Marianne", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0176", "submitter": "Jianhua Xing", "authors": "Fan Bai, Tohru Minamino, Zhanghan Wu, Keiichi Namba, Jianhua Xing", "title": "Coupling between switching regulation and torque generation in bacterial\n  flagellar motor", "comments": "23 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Recent experiments reveal that the switching\ndynamics of the motor depends on the motor rotation speed, and thus the motor\ntorque, non-monotonically. Here we present a unified mathematical model which\nmodels motor torque generation based on experimental torque-speed curves and\ntorque-dependent switching based on the conformational spread model. The model\nsuccessfully reproduces the observed switching rate as a function of the\nrotation speed, and provides a generic physical explanation independent of most\ndetails. A stator affects the switching dynamics through two mechanisms:\naccelerating the conformation flipping rates of individual rotor switching\nunits, which favours slower motor speed and thus increasing torque; and\naffecting more switching units within unit time, which favours faster speed.\nConsequently, the switching rate shows a maximum at intermediate speed. Our\nmodel predicts that a motor switches more often with more stators. The\nload-switching relation may serve as a mechanism for sensing the physical\nenvironment, similar to the chemotaxis system for sensing the chemical\nenvironment. It may also coordinate the switch dynamics of motors within a\ncell.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jun 2011 13:27:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 16:18:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bai", "Fan", ""], ["Minamino", "Tohru", ""], ["Wu", "Zhanghan", ""], ["Namba", "Keiichi", ""], ["Xing", "Jianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.0466", "submitter": "Suman Kumar Banik", "authors": "Arnab Bandyopadhyay and Suman K.
