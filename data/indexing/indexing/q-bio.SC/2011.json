We further predict damped and even sustained oscillations\nin the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio by accounting for recently reported\npositive and negative YAP-Rho feedback. Extending the framework to time-varying\nmechanical stimuli that simulate cyclic stretching and compression, we show\nthat the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio's time dependence follows that of the\ncyclic mechanical stimulus.

This disruption in signaling\ninterrupts normal cellular functions and may eventually develop some\npathological conditions. In this paper, computation capacity of signaling\nnetworks is introduced as a fundamental limit on signaling capability and\nperformance of such networks. The computation capacity measures the maximum\nnumber of computable inputs, that is, the maximum number of input values for\nwhich the correct functional output values can be recovered from the erroneous\nnetwork outputs, when the network contains some dysfunctional molecules. This\ncontrasts with the conventional communication capacity that measures instead\nthe maximum number of input values that can be correctly distinguished based on\nthe erroneous network outputs.\n  The computation capacity is higher than the communication capacity, if the\nnetwork response function is not a one-to-one function of the input signals. By\nexplicitly incorporating the effect of signaling errors that result in the\nnetwork dysfunction, the computation capacity provides more information about\nthe network and its malfunction. Two examples of signaling networks are studied\nhere, one regulating caspase3 and another regulating NFkB, for which\ncomputation and communication capacities are analyzed. Higher computation\ncapacities are observed for both networks. One biological implication of this\nfinding is that signaling networks may have more capacity than that specified\nby the conventional communication capacity metric. The effect of feedback is\nalso studied. In summary, this paper reports findings on a new fundamental\nfeature of the signaling capability of cell signaling networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2020 17:59:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Habibi", "Iman", ""], ["Emamian", "Effat S", ""], ["Simeone", "Osvaldo", ""], ["Abdi", "Ali", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.13462", "submitter": "Andreas Reichmuth", "authors": "Ilaria Incaviglia, Andreas Frutiger, Yves Blickenstorfer, Fridolin\n  Treindl, Giulia Ammirati, Ines L\\\"uchtefeld, Birgit Dreier, Andreas\n  Pl\\\"uckthun, Janos V\\\"or\\\"os, Andreas M Reichmuth", "title": "A promising approach for the real-time quantification of cytosolic\n  protein-protein interactions in living cells", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1021/acssensors.0c02480", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In recent years, cell-based assays have been frequently used in molecular\ninteraction analysis. Cell-based assays complement traditional biochemical and\nbiophysical methods, as they allow for molecular interaction analysis, mode of\naction studies and even drug screening processes to be performed under\nphysiologically relevant conditions. In most cellular assays, biomolecules are\nusually labeled to achieve specificity. In order to overcome some of the\ndrawbacks associated with label-based assays, we have recently introduced\ncell-based molography as a biosensor for the analysis of specific molecular\ninteractions involving native membrane receptors in living cells. Here, we\nexpand this assay to cytosolic protein-protein interactions. First, we created\na biomimetic membrane receptor by tethering one cytosolic interaction partner\nto the plasma membrane. The artificial construct is then coherently arranged\ninto a two-dimensional pattern within the cytosol of living cells. Thanks to\nthe molographic sensor, the specific interactions between the coherently\narranged protein and its endogenous interaction partners become visible in\nreal-time without the use of a fluorescent label. This method turns out to be\nan important extension of cell-based molography because it expands the range of\ninteractions that can be analyzed by molography to those in the cytosol of\nliving cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Nov 2020 20:13:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Incaviglia", "Ilaria", ""], ["Frutiger", "Andreas", ""], ["Blickenstorfer", "Yves", ""], ["Treindl", "Fridolin", ""], ["Ammirati", "Giulia", ""], ["L\u00fcchtefeld", "Ines", ""], ["Dreier", "Birgit", ""], ["Pl\u00fcckthun", "Andreas", ""], ["V\u00f6r\u00f6s", "Janos", ""], ["Reichmuth", "Andreas M", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.14592", "submitter": "Yusuke Maeda", "authors": "Lucan Yan, Tatsuya Fukuyama, Megumi Yamaoka, Yusuke T.

Our\nmicroscopy assay allows us to simultaneously record the growth of hundreds of\nspindles in the bulk cytoplasm and systematically analyze the shape of each\nstructure over the course of self-organization. We find that spindles that are\nmaturing into a bipolar shape take a route that is distinct from those ending\nup with faulty structures, such as those of a tripolar shape. Moreover, matured\nstructures are highly stable with little occasions of transformation between\ndifferent shape phenotypes. Visualizing the movement of microtubules further\nreveals a fraction of microtubules that assemble between extra poles and push\nthe poles apart, suggesting the presence of active extensile force that\nprevents pole coalescence.
