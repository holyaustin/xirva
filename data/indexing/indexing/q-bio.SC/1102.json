The phenomena behind\nelectro-mediated membrane permeabilization to plasmid DNA have been shown to be\nsignificantly more complex than those for small molecules. Small molecules\ncross the permeabilized membrane by diffusion whereas plasmid DNA first\ninteracts with the electropermeabilized part of the cell surface, forming\nlocalized aggregates. The dynamics of this process is still poorly understood\nbecause direct observations have been limited to scales of the order of\nseconds. Here, cells are electropermeabilized in the presence of plasmid DNA\nand monitored with a temporal resolution of 2 ms. This allows us to show that\nduring the first pulse application, plasmid complexes, or aggregates, start to\nform at distinct sites on the cell membrane. FRAP measurements show that the\npositions of these sites are remarkably immobile during the application of\nfurther pluses. A theoretical model is proposed to explain the appearance of\ndistinct interaction sites, the quantitative increase in DNA and also their\nimmobility leading to a tentative explanation for the success of\nelectro-mediated gene delivery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Feb 2011 08:07:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Escoffre", "Jean-Michel", ""], ["Portet", "Thomas", ""], ["Favard", "Cyril", ""], ["Teissi\u00e9", "Justin", ""], ["Dean", "David S.", ""], ["Rols", "Marie-Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.2013", "submitter": "Jan Kierfeld", "authors": "Jaroslaw Krawczyk and Jan Kierfeld", "title": "Stall force of polymerizing microtubules and filament bundles", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "EPL 93, 28006 (2011)", "doi": "10.1209/0295-5075/93/28006", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We investigate stall force and polymerization kinetics of rigid\nprotofilaments in a microtubule or interacting filaments in bundles under an\nexternal load force in the framework of a discrete growth model.

Some processes, such as the transport of\ncargoes is achieved mainly by the action of individual motors. Other, such as\ncell motility and division, require the cooperative work of many motors.\nCollective motor dynamics can be quite complex and unexpected. One beautiful\nexample is the bidirectional (\"back and forth\") motion of filaments which is\ninduced when the motors within a group exert forces in opposite directions.\nThis review tackles the puzzle emerging from a recent experimental work in\nwhich it has been shown that the characteristic reversal times of the\nbidirectional motion are practically independent of the number of motors. This\nresult is in a striking contradiction with existing theoretical models that\npredict an exponential growth of the reversal times with the size of the\nsystem. We argue that the solution to this puzzle may be the crosstalk between\nthe motors which is mediated by the elastic tensile stress that develops in the\ncytoskeleton track. The crosstalk does not directly correlate the attachment\nand detachment of the motors, which work independently of each other. However,\nit highly accelerates their detachments by making the detachment rates system\nsize dependent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Feb 2011 10:20:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Farago", "Oded", ""], ["Bernheim-Groswasser", "Anne", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5295", "submitter": "Ulrich S.
