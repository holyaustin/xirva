We first show that the subunit on- and off-rates satisfy a rigorous\nthermodynamic relationship determined by the filament-obstacle interaction\npotential. Both the on- and off-rates depend not only on the average force on\nthe obstacle, but also on the shape of the potential on the nanometer length\nscale. Basing obstacle-induced reduction of the on-rate entirely on the force\noverestimates the stall force when there are fluctuations in the force exerted\non a filament tip. We then perform simulations and analytic calculations using\nthe thermodynamic relationship. We find, consistent with expectations from\ngeneral thermodynamic relations, that the \"Brownian-Ratchet\" model is an upper\nbound to the growth velocity and that for purely repulsive potentials the\ngrowth velocity is essentially that predicted by the Brownian-Ratchet model.\nFor shallow potential wells of depth ~ 5k_BT, which might correspond to\ntransient filament-membrane attachments, the zero-force velocity is a\nsubstantial fraction of the free-filament velocity. In this case, the growth\nvelocity can depend strongly on the obstacle diffusion coefficient even when\nthe dimensionless diffusion coefficient is large. The velocity also drops more\nrapidly than predicted by the Brownian-ratchet model, in some cases by as much\nas a factor of 50 at an opposing force of 1 pN. For deep potential wells, as\nmight result from strong filament-membrane links, both the on- and off-rates\nare reduced significantly, slowing polymerization. Such potentials can sustain\npulling forces while polymerizing, but only if the attractive well has a\n\"shelf\" comparable to or greater than the monomer size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2018 21:16:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Motahari", "F.", ""], ["Carlsson", "A.
