The key role in these interactions is played by processes of\nprotein search for specific sites on DNA. Although it has been studied for many\nyears, only recently microscopic aspects of these processes became more clear.\nIn this work, we present a review on current theoretical understanding of the\nmolecular mechanisms of the protein target search. A comprehensive\ndiscrete-state stochastic method to explain the dynamics of the protein search\nphenomena is introduced and explained. Our theoretical approach utilizes a\nfirst-passage analysis and it takes into account the most relevant\nphysical-chemical processes. It is able to describe many fascinating features\nof the protein search, including unusually high effective association rates,\nhigh selectivity and specificity, and the robustness in the presence of\ncrowders and sequence heterogeneity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Aug 2018 20:48:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Shvets", "Alexey A.", ""], ["Kochugaeva", "Maria P.", ""], ["Kolomeisky", "Anatoly B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.04013", "submitter": "Jin Wang", "authors": "Qiong Liu, Jin Wang", "title": "Quantification of flux for non-equilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics\n  for driving non-Michaelis-Menton Enzyme Rates", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The driving force for active physical and biological systems is determined by\nboth the underlying landscape and the non-equilibrium curl flux. While\nlandscape can be quantified in the experiments by the histograms of the\ncollecting trajectories of the observables, the experimental flux\nquantification is still challenging. In this work, we studied the single\nmolecule enzyme dynamics and observed the deviation in kinetics from the\nconventional Michaelis-Menton reaction rate. We identified and quantified the\nnon-equilibrium flux as the origin of such non-Michaelis-Menton enzyme rate\nbehavior. This is the first time of rigorous quantification of the flux for the\ndriving force of the non-equilibrium active dynamics. We also quantified the\ncorresponding non-equilibrium thermodynamics in terms of chemical potential and\nentropy production. We identified and quantified the origin of the flux,\nchemical potential and entropy production as the heat absorbed (energy input)\nin the enzyme reaction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Aug 2018 22:56:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Qiong", ""], ["Wang", "Jin", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.09764", "submitter": "Johannes Pausch", "authors": "Johannes Pausch and Gunnar Pruessner", "title": "Is Actin Filament and Microtubule Growth Reaction- or Diffusion-Limited?", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/ab081c", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph cond-mat.soft q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Inside cells of living organisms, actin filaments and microtubules\nself-assemble and dissemble dynamically by incorporating actin or tubulin from\nthe cell plasma or releasing it into their tips' surroundings.

In this Letter, we accommodate both limits and use a\nDoi-Peliti field-theory model to estimate how diffusive transport is perturbing\nthe chemical reactions at the filament tip. Furthermore, a crossover bulk\ndensity is predicted at which the limiting process changes from chemical\nreactions to diffusive transport.
