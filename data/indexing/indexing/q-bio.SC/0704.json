Measuring the local concentration of such a\nprotein with a spatially-varying distribution allows the measurement of\nposition within the system. In order for these systems to work effectively,\nposition determination must be robust to noise. Here, we calculate fundamental\nlimits to the precision of position determination by concentration gradients\ndue to unavoidable biochemical noise perturbing the gradients. We focus on\ngradient proteins with first order reaction kinetics. Systems of this type have\nbeen experimentally characterised in both developmental and cell biology\nsettings. For a single gradient we show that, through time-averaging, great\nprecision can potentially be achieved even with very low protein copy numbers.\nAs a second example, we investigate the ability of a system with oppositely\ndirected gradients to find its centre. With this mechanism, positional\nprecision close to the centre improves more slowly with increasing averaging\ntime, and so longer averaging times or higher copy numbers are required for\nhigh precision. For both single and double gradients, we demonstrate the\nexistence of optimal length scales for the gradients, where precision is\nmaximized, as well as analyzing how precision depends on the size of the\nconcentration measuring apparatus. Our results provide fundamental constraints\non the positional precision supplied by concentration gradients in various\ncontexts, including both in developmental biology and also within a single\ncell.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2007 23:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Tostevin", "Filipe", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""], ["Howard", "Martin", ""]]}]
