However, biological systems can adapt to loads by\nstrengthening adhesions, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of\ntissue and whole organisms. Inspired by cellular focal adhesions, we suggest\nhere a generic, molecular mechanism that allows adhesion systems to harness\napplied loads for self-stabilization under non-equilibrium conditions --\nwithout any active feedback involved. The mechanism is based on conformation\nchanges of adhesion molecules that are dynamically exchanged with a reservoir.\nTangential loading drives the occupation of some stretched conformation states\nout of equilibrium, which, for thermodynamic reasons, leads to association of\nfurther molecules with the adhesion cluster. Self-stabilization robustly\nincreases adhesion lifetimes in broad parameter ranges. Unlike for catch-bonds,\nbond dissociation rates do not decrease with force. The self-stabilization\nprinciple can be realized in many ways in complex adhesion-state networks; we\nshow how it naturally occurs in cellular adhesions involving the adaptor\nproteins talin and vinculin.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Jul 2021 09:45:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Braeutigam", "Andrea", "", "1 and 2"], ["Simsek", "Ahmet Nihat", "", "1 and 2"], ["Gompper", "Gerhard", "", "1 and 2"], ["Sabass", "Benedikt", "", "1 and 2"]]}, {"id": "2107.05242", "submitter": "S{\\o}ren Andersen", "authors": "S{\\o}ren S.

Decreased tissue thickness, specifically in the stratum corneum (the\noutermost layer of the tissue), causes discomfort and inflammation, and is\nrelated to several severe diseases of the tissue.\n  In order to maintain both stratum corneum thickness and overall tissue\nthickness it is necessary for the system to balance cell proliferation and cell\nloss. Cell loss in the epidermis occurs when dead cells at the top of the\ntissue are lost to the environment through a process called desquamation. Cell\nproliferation occurs in the basal layer and causes constant upwards movement in\nthe tissue.\n  In this paper we will investigate combining a (mass action) subcellular model\nof desquamation with a three dimensional (overlapping spheres) multicellular\nmodel of the interfollicular epidermis. The model shows that hypothesised\nbiological models for the degradation of cell-cell adhesion from the literature\nare able to provide a consistent rate of cell loss in the multicellular model,\nwhich balance proliferation, hence maintaining a homeostatic thickness. We also\nuse the model to investigate the effect of having two proliferative cell types\nwith different proliferation rates in the basal layer, determining that it is\npossible to reproduce the same tissue dynamics with a single cell type\npopulation with rate equal to the harmonic mean of the two populations.

Some of the\ntrajectories display switching between persistent and anti-persistent motion\nwhile others jiggle around in one position for the whole measurement time. By\nsplitting the ensemble of endosome trajectories into slow moving sub-diffusive\nand fast moving super-diffusive endosomes, we analyzed them separately.
