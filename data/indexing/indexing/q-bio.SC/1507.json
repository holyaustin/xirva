Transcription\nFactors (TFs) search for their DNA promoter target by alternating between bulk\ndiffusion and sliding along the DNA, a mechanism known as facilitated\ndiffusion. We study a facilitated diffusion framework with switching between\nthree search modes: a bulk mode and two sliding modes triggered by\nconformational changes between two protein conformations. In one conformation\n(search mode) the TF interacts unspecifically with the DNA backbone resulting\nin fast sliding. In the other conformation (recognition mode) it interacts\nspecifically and strongly with DNA base pairs leading to slow displacement.\nFrom the bulk, a TF associates with the DNA at a random position that is\ncorrelated with the previous dissociation point, which implicitly is a function\nof the DNA structure. The target affinity depends on the conformation. We\nderive exact expressions for the mean first passage time (MFPT) to bind to the\npromoter and the conditional probability to bind before detaching when arriving\nat the promoter site. We systematically explore the parameter space and compare\nvarious search scenarios. We compare our results with experimental data for the\ndimeric Lac repressor search in E.Coli bacteria. We find that a coiled DNA\nconformation is absolutely necessary for a fast MFPT. With frequent spontaneous\nconformational changes, a fast search time is achieved even when a TF becomes\nimmobilized in the recognition state due to the specific bindings. We find a\nMFPT compatible with experimental data in presence of a specific TF-DNA\ninteraction energy that has a Gaussian distribution with a large variance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2015 10:39:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Cartailler", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", ""], ["Reingruber", "J\u00fcrgen", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.05873", "submitter": "Pierre Ronceray", "authors": "Pierre Ronceray, Chase Broedersz, and Martin Lenz", "title": "Fiber networks amplify active stress", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures.

After explaining that the IPR plays\na crucial role as a central regulator in calcium dynamics, several sources of\nrelevant experimental data are introduced. Single ion channels are best studied\nby recording single-channel currents under different ligand concentrations via\nthe patch-clamp technique. The particular relevance of modal gating, the\nspontaneous switching between different levels of channel activity that occur\neven at constant ligand concentrations, is highlighted. In order to investigate\nthe interactions of IPRs, calcium release from small clusters of channels,\nso-called calcium puffs, can be used. We then present the mathematical\nframework common to all models based on single-channel data, aggregated\ncontinuous-time Markov models, and give a short review of statistical\napproaches for parameterising these models with experimental data. The process\nof building a Markov model that integrates various sources of experimental data\nis illustrated using two recent examples, the model by Ullah et al. and the\n\"Park-Drive\" model by Siekmann et al., the only models that account for all\nsources of data currently available. Finally, it is demonstrated that the\nessential features of the Park-Drive model in different models of calcium\ndynamics are preserved after reducing it to a two-state model that only\naccounts for the switching between the inactive \"park\" and the active \"drive\"\nmode. This highlights the fact that modal gating is the most important\nmechanism of ligand regulation in the IPR. It also emphasises that data-driven\nmodels of ion channels do not necessarily have to lead to detailed models but\ncan be constructed so that relevant data is selected to represent ion channels\nat the appropriate level of complexity for a given application.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 05:13:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Siekmann", "Ivo", ""], ["Cao", "Pengxing", ""], ["Sneyd", "James", ""], ["Crampin", "Edmund J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06166", "submitter": "Appert-Rolland Cecile", "authors": "Cecile Appert-Rolland, Maximilian Ebbinghaus, Ludger Santen", "title": "Intracellular transport driven by cytoskeletal motors: General\n  mechanisms and defects", "comments": "74 pages, 43 figures", "journal-ref": "Physics Reports, 593 (2015) 1-59", "doi": "10.1016/j.physrep.2015.07.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cells are strongly out-of-equilibrium systems driven by continuous energy\nsupply. They carry out many vital functions requiring active transport of\nvarious ingredients and organelles, some being small, others being large. The\ncytoskeleton, composed of three types of filaments, determines the shape of the\ncell and plays a role in cell motion. It also serves as a road network for the\nso-called cytoskeletal motors. These molecules can attach to a cytoskeletal\nfilament, perform directed motion, possibly carrying along some cargo, and then\ndetach. It is a central issue to understand how intracellular transport driven\nby molecular motors is regulated, in particular because its breakdown is one of\nthe signatures of some neuronal diseases like the Alzheimer.\n  We give a survey of the current knowledge on microtubule based intracellular\ntransport. We first review some biological facts obtained from experiments, and\npresent some modeling attempts based on cellular automata. We start with\nbackground knowledge on the original and variants of the TASEP (Totally\nAsymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), before turning to more application\noriented models. After addressing microtubule based transport in general, with\na focus on in vitro experiments, and on cooperative effects in the\ntransportation of large cargos by multiple motors, we concentrate on axonal\ntransport, because of its relevance for neuronal diseases. It is a challenge to\nunderstand how this transport is organized, given that it takes place in a\nconfined environment and that several types of motors moving in opposite\ndirections are involved. We review several features that could contribute to\nthe efficiency of this transport, including the role of motor-motor\ninteractions and of the dynamics of the underlying microtubule network.\nFinally, we discuss some still open questions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 12:59:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Appert-Rolland", "Cecile", ""], ["Ebbinghaus", "Maximilian", ""], ["Santen", "Ludger", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.06303", "submitter": "Eugene Rosenfeld", "authors": "Eugene V.
