It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses or strains\nthat build up within the moving axoneme, but it is not known which components\nof stress or strain are involved, nor how they feed back on the dyneins. To\nanswer this question, we used isolated, reactivate axonemes of the unicellular\nalga Chlamydomonas as a model system. We derived a theory for beat regulation\nin a two-dimensional model of the axoneme. We then tested the theory by\nmeasuring the beat waveforms of wild type axonemes, which have asymmetric\nbeats, and mutant axonemes, in which the beat is nearly symmetric, using\nhigh-precision spatial and temporal imaging. We found that regulation by\nsliding forces fails to account for the measured beat, due to the short lengths\nof Chlamydomonas cilia. We found that regulation by normal forces (which tend\nto separate adjacent doublets) cannot satisfactorily account for the symmetric\nwaveforms of the mbo2 mutants.

In this\narticle, we present a general theory for the binding constants K2D and K3D of\nrather stiff proteins whose main degrees of freedom are translation and\nrotation, along membranes and around anchor points 'in 2D', or unconstrained\n'in 3D'. The theory generalizes previous results by describing how K2D depends\nboth on the average separation and thermal nanoscale roughness of the apposing\nmembranes, and on the length and anchoring flexibility of the receptors and\nligands. Our theoretical results for the ratio K2D/K3D of the binding constants\nagree with detailed results from Monte Carlo simulations without any data\nfitting, which indicates that the theory captures the essential features of the\n'dimensionality reduction' due to membrane anchoring. In our Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we consider a novel coarse-grained model of biomembrane adhesion\nin which the membranes are represented as discretized elastic surfaces, and the\nreceptors and ligands as anchored molecules that diffuse continuously along the\nmembranes and rotate at their anchor points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:18:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Guang-Kui", ""], ["Hu", "Jinglei", ""], ["Lipowsky", "Reinhard", ""], ["Weikl", "Thomas R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07657", "submitter": "Thomas R.

Central questions are how the\nbinding kinetics of these proteins is affected by the membranes and by the\nmembrane anchoring of the proteins. In this article, we (i) present detailed\ndata for the binding of membrane-anchored proteins from coarse-grained\nmolecular dynamics simulations, and (ii) provide a theory that describes how\nthe binding kinetics depends on the average separation and thermal roughness of\nthe adhering membranes, and on the anchoring, lengths, and length variations of\nthe proteins. An important element of our theory is the tilt of bound\nreceptor-ligand complexes and transition-state complexes relative to the\nmembrane normals. This tilt results from an interplay of the anchoring energy\nand rotational entropy of the complexes and facilitates the formation of\nreceptor-ligand bonds at membrane separations smaller than the preferred\nseparation for binding. In our simulations, we have considered both\nlipid-anchored and transmembrane receptor and ligand proteins. We find that the\nbinding equilibrium constant and binding on-rate constant of lipid-anchored\nproteins are considerably smaller than the binding constant and on-rate\nconstant of rigid transmembrane proteins with identical binding domains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 11:31:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hu", "Jinglei", ""], ["Xu", "Guang-Kui", ""], ["Lipowsky", "Reinhard", ""], ["Weikl", "Thomas R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.07673", "submitter": "Pablo Sartori", "authors": "Pablo Sartori, Veikko Geyer, Jonathon Howard, Frank J\\\"ulicher", "title": "Beat regulation in twisted axonemes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

These motors\ngenerate forces and torques that slide and bend the microtubule doublets within\nthe axoneme. To create regular waveforms the activities of the dyneins must be\ncoordinated. It is thought that coordination is mediated by stresses due to\nradial, transverse, or sliding deformations, that build up within the moving\naxoneme. However, which particular component of the stress regulates the motors\nto produce the observed flagellar waveforms remains an open question. To\naddress this question, we describe the axoneme as a three-dimensional bundle of\nfilaments and characterize its mechanics. We show that regulation of the motors\nby radial and transverse stresses can lead to a coordinated flagellar motion\nonly in the presence of twist. By comparison, regulation by shear stress is\npossible without twist. We calculate emergent beating patterns in twisted\naxonemes resulting from regulation by transverse stresses. The waveforms are\nsimilar to those observed in flagella of Chlamydomonas and sperm. Due to the\ntwist, the waveform has non-planar components, which result in swimming\ntrajectories such as twisted ribbons and helices that agree with observations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 12:21:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Sartori", "Pablo", ""], ["Geyer", "Veikko", ""], ["Howard", "Jonathon", ""], ["J\u00fclicher", "Frank", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.08621", "submitter": "Gao-De Li Dr", "authors": "Gao-De Li", "title": "Pfcrmp May Play a Key Role in Chloroquine Antimalarial Action and\n  Resistance Development", "comments": "5 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It was proposed earlier that Pfcrmp (Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine\nresistance marker protein) may be the chloroquine's target protein in nucleus.\nIn this communication, further evidence is presented to support the view that\nPfcrmp may play a key role in chloroquine antimalarial actions as well as\nresistance development.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 11:06:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 16:09:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Gao-De", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09076", "submitter": "Vladimir Baulin", "authors": "Alexander Muratov and Vladimir A.

Perception of gravity in root and shoot gravitropisms is usually\nattributed to gravisensitive cells, called statocytes, which exploit\nsedimentation of macroscopic and heavy organelles, amyloplasts, to sense the\ndirection of gravity. Gravity stimulus is then transduced into distal\nelongation zone, which is several mm far from statocytes, where it causes\nstretching. It is suggested that gravity stimulus is conveyed by gradients in\nauxin flux. We propose a theoretical model that may explain how concentration\ngradients and/or stretching may indirectly affect the global orientation of\ncortical microtubules, attached to the cell membrane and induce their dynamic\nreorientation perpendicular to the gradients. In turn, oriented microtubules\narrays direct the growth and orientation of cellulose microfibrils, forming\npart of the cell external skeleton and determine the shape of the cell.\nReorientation of microtubules is also observed in reaction to light in\nphototropism and mechanical bending, thus suggesting universality of the\nproposed mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:22:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Muratov", "Alexander", ""], ["Baulin", "Vladimir A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1511.09444", "submitter": "Ronald  Fox", "authors": "Ronald F.
