Direct irradiation at certain doses induce cell death,\nbut similar effects can also occur in cells no directly exposed to IR, a\nmechanism known as bystander effect. Non-IR (radiofrequency waves) can induce\nthe death of cells loaded with MNPs in a focused oncological therapy known as\nmagnetic hyperthermia. Indirect mechanisms are also able to induce the death of\nunloaded MNPs cells. Using in vitro cell models, we found that colocalization\nof the MNPs at the lysosomes and the non-increase of the temperature induces\nbystander effect under non-IR. Our results provide a landscape in which\nbystander effects are a more general mechanism, up to now only observed and\nclinically used in the field of radiotherapy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 06:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Goya", "G.

In\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, there is an ongoing debate regarding the mechanisms\nunderlying this important asymmetry. Currently proposed models suggest it is\nestablished via diffusion, but differ on whether a diffusion barrier is\nnecessary or not. However, no study so far incorporated key aspects to\nsegregation, such as dynamic morphology changes throughout anaphase or plasmids\nsize. Here, we determine the distinct effects and contributions of individual\ncellular variability, plasmid volume and moving boundaries in the asymmetric\nsegregation of plasmids. We do this by measuring cellular nuclear geometries\nand plasmid diffusion rates with confocal microscopy, subsequently\nincorporating this data into a growing domain stochastic spatial simulator. Our\nmodelling and simulations confirms that plasmid asymmetrical inheritance does\nnot require an active barrier to diffusion, and provides a full analysis on\nplasmid size effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 10:51:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Denton", "Jai", ""], ["Ghosh", "Atiyo", ""], ["Marquez-Lago", "Tatiana T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.04437", "submitter": "Tim Peterson", "authors": "Timothy R.

The Target of\nRapamycin (TOR) pathway is becoming increasingly recognized as a master\nregulator of cell size, however less is known how TOR activity might be coupled\nwith the cell cycle. Here, we establish that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes\ncytokinesis through activation of a Rho GTPase-Rho Kinase (ROCK) signaling\ncascade. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling by depletion of any of its\nnegative regulators: TSC1, TSC2, PTEN, or DEPTOR, induces polyploidy in a\nrapamycin-sensitive manner. mTORC1 hyperactivation-mediated polyploidization\noccurs by a prolonged, but ultimately failed attempt at abcission followed by\nre-fusion. Similar to the effects of ROCK2 overexpression, these mTORC1-driven\naberrant cytokinesis events are accompanied by increased Rho-GTP loading,\nextensive plasma membrane blebbing, and increased actin-myosin contractility,\nall of which can be rescued by either mTORC1 or ROCK inhibition. These results\nprovide evidence for the existence of a novel mTORC1-Rho-ROCK pathway during\ncytokinesis and suggest that mTORC1 might play a critical role in setting the\nsize at which a mammalian cell divides.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 20:47:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Peterson", "Timothy R.", ""], ["Laplante", "Mathieu", ""], ["Van Veen", "Ed", ""], ["Van Vugt", "Marcel", ""], ["Thoreen", "Carson C.", ""], ["Sabatini", "David M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08051", "submitter": "Mohammadhosein Razbin khalilabad", "authors": "Mohammadhosein Razbin, Martin Falcke, Panayotis Benetatos and Annette\n  Zippelius", "title": "Mechanical properties of branched actin filaments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "2015 Phys.

New filaments are\ngenerated by branching off existing ones, giving rise to branched network\nstructures. We investigate the force-extension relation of branched filaments,\ngrafted on an elastic structure at one end and pushing with the free ends\nagainst the leading edge cell membrane. Single filaments are modeled as\nworm-like chains, whose thermal bending fluctuations are restricted by the\nleading edge cell membrane, resulting in an effective force. Branching can\nincrease the stiffness considerably; however the effect depends on branch point\nposition and filament orientation, being most pronounced for intermediate tilt\nangles and intermediate branch point positions. We describe filament networks\nwithout cross-linkers to focus on the effect of branching. We use randomly\npositioned branch points, as generated in the process of treadmilling, and\norientation distributions as measured in lamellipodia. These networks reproduce\nboth the weak and strong force response of lamellipodia as measured in\nforce-velocity experiments. We compare properties of branched and unbranched\nnetworks. The ratio of the network average of the force per branched filament\nto the average force per unbranched filament depends on the orientation\ndistribution of the filaments. The ratio exhibits compression dependence and\nmay go up to about 4.5 in networks with a narrow orientation distribution. With\norientation distributions measured in lamellipodia, it is about two and\nessentially independent from network compression, graft elasticity and filament\npersistence length.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 13:12:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Razbin", "Mohammadhosein", ""], ["Falcke", "Martin", ""], ["Benetatos", "Panayotis", ""], ["Zippelius", "Annette", ""]]}]
