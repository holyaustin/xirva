Previous FLIM measurements (K. Busch and\ncoworkers) of complex II and III unravelled differences in the local\nenvironment of the membrane enzymes in the cristae.

The efficiency of an mRNA can be tuned\nby varying the ribosome binding sites controlling the recruitment of the\nribosomes, or the codon usage establishing the speed of protein elongation. In\nthis work we propose transcript length as a further key determinant of\ntranslation efficiency. Based on a physical model that considers the kinetics\nof ribosomes advancing on the mRNA and diffusing in its surrounding, as well as\nmRNA circularisation and ribosome drop-off, we explain how the transcript\nlength may play a central role in establishing ribosome recruitment and the\noverall translation rate of an mRNA. According to our results, the proximity of\nthe 3' end to the ribosomal recruitment site of the mRNA could induce a\nfeedback in the translation process that would favour the recycling of\nribosomes. We also demonstrate how this process may be involved in shaping the\nexperimental ribosome density-gene length dependence. Finally, we argue that\ncells could exploit this mechanism to adjust and balance the usage of its\nribosomal resources.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 11:57:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Jul 2017 09:39:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 12 Dec 2017 15:47:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Fernandes", "Lucas D.", ""], ["de Moura", "Alessandro P.

Revealed by anaphase spindle rocking, these pulling\nforces are regulated by the force generator dynamics, which are in turn\nconsequent of mitotic progression. We found a novel, additional, regulation of\nthese forces by the spindle position. It controls astral microtubule\navailability at the cortex, on which the active force generators can pull.\nImportantly, this positional control relies on the polarity dependent LET-99\ncortical band, which restricts or concentrates generators to a posterior\ncrescent. We ascribed this control to the microtubule dynamics at the cortex.\nIndeed, in mapping the cortical contacts, we found a correlation between the\ncentrosome-cortex distance and the microtubule contact density. In turn, it\nmodulates pulling force generator activity. We modelled this control,\npredicting and experimentally validating that the posterior crescent extent\ncontrolled where the anaphase oscillations started, in addition to mitotic\nprogression. Finally, we propose that spatially restricting force generator to\na posterior crescent sets the spindle's final position, reflecting polarity\nthrough the LET-99 dependent restriction of force generators to a posterior\ncrescent. This regulation superimposes that of force generator processivity.\nThis novel control confers a low dependence on microtubule and active force\ngenerator exact numbers or dynamics, provided that they exceed the threshold\nneeded for posterior displacement. Interestingly, this robustness originates in\ncell mechanics rather than biochemical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Feb 2017 11:06:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 16:02:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 24 May 2017 13:50:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 5 Apr 2018 14:02:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bouvrais", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", ""], ["Chesneau", "Laurent", ""], ["Pastezeur", "Sylvain", ""], ["Delattre", "Marie", ""], ["P\u00e9cr\u00e9aux", "Jacques", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.02076", "submitter": "Gao-De Li Dr", "authors": "Gao-De Li", "title": "Cell-Cycle-Associated Amplified Genomic-DNA Fragments (CAGFs) Might Be\n  Involved in Chloroquine Action and Resistance in Plasmodium falciparum", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  As a cheap and safe antimalarial agent, chloroquine (CQ) has been used in the\nbattle against malaria for more than half century.
