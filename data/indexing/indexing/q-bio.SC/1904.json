Due to their size, such nanodiscoids have a comparatively\nlarge boundary-to-area ratio, making them unusually well-suited to probing the\neffects of Gaussian curvature. Arguing that fluctuations in discoid size and\nshape are quenched on formation, we quantify the stability, in terms of size\nand shape, of near-solvation discoid-like flaps that are subject to thermal\nfluctuations. Using cryo-Electron Microscopy images of Styrene Maleic Acid\nstabilised discoids, we deduce that stable, saddle-like discoids (with high\nGaussian curvature) can likely be solvated from bulk lamellar ($L_\\alpha$)\nphase at moderate-to-high surface tensions ($>10^{-4}$ N/m). We then describe\nhow such tension-controlled solvation can be used for both measuring, and\nfractionating membrane components according-to, the modulus of Gaussian\nrigidity $\\bar{\\kappa}$. Opportunities for investigating the effects of\nGaussian curvature on membrane-embedded proteins, which can be co-solvated\nduring the formation process, are also discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Apr 2019 11:55:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Morris", "R.

Using\nthis data, we demonstrate that a central claim in energy matrix models of gene\nexpression - that each promoter element contributes independently and\nadditively to gene expression - contradicts experimental measurements. We\npropose that a key missing ingredient from such models is the avidity between\nthe -35 and -10 RNA polymerase binding sites and develop what we call a refined\nenergy matrix model that incorporates this effect. We show that this the\nrefined energy matrix model can characterize the full suite of gene expression\ndata and explore several applications of this framework, namely, how\nmultivalent binding at the -35 and -10 sites can buffer RNAP kinetics against\nmutations and how promoters that bind overly tightly to RNA polymerase can\ninhibit gene expression. The success of our approach suggests that avidity\nrepresents a key physical principle governing the interaction of RNA polymerase\nto its promoter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2019 08:42:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Einav", "Tal", ""], ["Phillips", "Rob", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.01991", "submitter": "Theja N.

For correct expansion of organs that primarily\ngrow by elongating, such as roots and stems, MTs must bend in the\nhigh-curvature direction along the cylindrically shaped cell membrane in order\nto form the required circumferential arrays. Computational studies, which have\nrecapitulated the self-organization of these arrays, ignored MT mechanics and\nassumed MTs follow geodesics of the cell surface. Here, we show, through\nanalysis of a derived Euler-Lagrange equation, that an elastic MT constrained\nto a cylindrical surface will deflect away from geodesics and toward low\ncurvature directions to minimize bending energy. This occurs when the curvature\nof the cell surface is relatively high for a given anchor density. In the limit\nof infinite anchor density, MTs always follow geodesics. We compare our\nanalytical predictions to measured curvatures and anchor densities and find\nthat the regime in which cells are forming these cortical arrays straddles the\nregion of parameter space in which arrays must form under the antagonistic\ninfluence of this mechanically induced deflection. Although this introduces a\npotential obstacle to forming circumferentially orientated arrays that needs to\nbe accounted for in the models, it also raises the question of whether plants\nuse this mechanical phenomenon to regulate array orientation.

Recently, it has been shown that the number of\nfunctional torque-generating stator units in the motor depends on the external\nload, and suggested that mechanosensing in the flagellar motor is driven via a\n'catch bond' mechanism in the motor's stator units. We present a method that\nallows us to measure -- on a single motor -- stator unit dynamics across a\nlarge range of external loads, including near the zero-torque limit. By\nattaching superparamagnetic beads to the flagellar hook, we can control the\nmotor's speed via a rotating magnetic field. We manipulate the motor to four\ndifferent speed levels in two different ion-motive force (IMF) conditions. This\nframework allows for a deeper exploration into the mechanism behind\nload-dependent remodelling by separating out motor properties, such as rotation\nspeed and energy availability in the form of IMF, that affect the motor torque.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2019 16:57:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2019 01:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Nirody", "Jasmine A", ""], ["Nord", "Ashley L.", ""], ["Berry", "Richard M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.11675", "submitter": "Kun-Ta Wu", "authors": "Teagan E.

However, the\nconnection between macroscopic fluid flows and microscopic motion of\nmicrotubules remains unclear. In this work, the motion of single microtubules\nwas characterized by means of 2D gliding assays and compared with the flows of\n3D active fluids. While the scales of the two systems differ by 1,000x, both\nwere driven by processive, non-processive or an equal mixture of both molecular\nmotor proteins. To search for the dynamic correlation between both systems, the\nmotor activities were tuned by varying temperature and ATP concentration, and\nthe changes in both systems were compared. Motor processivity played an\nimportant role in active fluid flows but only when the fluids were nearly\nmotionless; otherwise, flows were dominated by hydrodynamic resistance\ncontrolled by sample size. Furthermore, while the motors' thermal reaction led\nactive fluids to flow faster with increasing temperature, such temperature\ndependence could be reversed by introducing temperature-varying depletants,\nemphasizing the potential role of the depletant in designing an active fluid's\ntemperature response. The temperature response of active fluids was nearly\nimmediate (<10 sec). Such a characteristic enables active fluids to be\ncontrolled with a temperature switch. Overall, this work not only clarifies the\nrole of temperature in active fluid activity, but also sheds light on the\nunderlying principles of the relationship between the collective dynamics of\nactive fluids and the dynamics of their constituent single microtubules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Apr 2019 05:28:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bate", "Teagan E.", ""], ["Jarvis", "Edward J.", ""], ["Varney", "Megan E.", ""], ["Wu", "Kun-Ta", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12420", "submitter": "Simon Sponberg", "authors": "Julie A Cass, C.

These motors rely on energy derived from ATP,\nsupplied, in part, by diffusion from the sarcoplasm to the interior of the\nlattice of actin and myosin filaments. The radial spacing of filaments in this\nlattice may change or remain constant during contraction. If the lattice is\nisovolumetric, it must expand when the muscle shortens. If, however, the\nspacing is constant or has a different pattern of axial and radial motion, then\nthe lattice changes volume during contraction, driving fluid motion and\nassisting in the transport of molecules between the contractile lattice and the\nsurrounding intracellular space. We first create an\nadvective-diffusive-reaction flow model and show that the flow into and out of\nthe sarcomere lattice would be significant in the absence of lattice expansion.\nAdvective transport coupled to diffusion has the potential to substantially\nenhance metabolite exchange within the crowded sarcomere. Using time-resolved\nx-ray diffraction of contracting muscle, we next show that the contractile\nlattice is neither isovolumetric nor constant in spacing. Instead, lattice\nspacing is time-varying, depends on activation, and can manifest as an\neffective time-varying Poisson ratio. The resulting fluid flow in the sarcomere\nlattice of synchronous insect flight muscles is greater than expected for\nconstant lattice spacing conditions. Lattice spacing depends on a variety of\nfactors that produce radial force, including crossbridges, titin-like\nmolecules, and other structural proteins. Volume change and advective transport\nvaries with the phase of muscle stimulation but remains significant at all\nconditions. Akin to \"breathing,\" advective-diffusive transport in sarcomeres is\nsufficient to promote metabolite exchange and may play a role in the regulation\nof contraction itself.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 02:08:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 22:13:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Jun 2021 19:43:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Cass", "Julie A", ""], ["Williams", "C.
