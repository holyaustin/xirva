Aster motility and dynamics is vital for genome\nstability, cell division, polarization and differentiation. Asters move either\ntowards the cell center or away from it. Here, we focus on the centering\nmechanism in a membrane independent system of Xenopus cytoplasmic egg extracts.\nUsing live microscopy and single particle tracking, we find that asters move\ntowards chromatinized DNA structures. The velocity and directionality profiles\nsuggest a random walk with drift directed towards DNA. We have developed a\ntheoretical model that can explain this movement as a result of a gradient of\nMT length dynamics and MT gliding on immobilized dynein motors. In simulations,\nthe antagonistic action of the motor species on the radial array of MTs leads\nto a tug-of-war purely due to geometric considerations and aster motility\nresembles a directed random-walk. Additionally our model predicts that aster\nvelocities do not change greatly with varying initial distance from DNA. The\nmovement of asymmetric asters becomes increasingly super-diffusive with\nincreasing motor density, but for symmetric asters it becomes less\nsuper-diffusive. The transition of symmetric asters from superdiffusive to\ndiffusive mobility is the result of number fluctuations in bound motors in the\ntug-of-war. Overall, our model is in good agreement with experimental data in\nXenopus cytoplasmic extracts and predicts novel features of the collective\neffects of motor-MT interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 15:40:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-21", "authors_parsed": [["Athale", "Chaitanya A.", ""], ["Dinarina", "Ana", ""], ["Nedelec", "Francois", ""], ["Karsenti", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.4063", "submitter": "Michael Goldberg", "authors": "Byron C.

We show here that PP2A-B55 is the enzyme responsible for\ndephosphorylating pEndos during M phase exit. The kinetic parameters for\nPP2A-B55's action on pEndos are orders of magnitude lower than those for\nCDK-phosphorylated substrates, suggesting a simple model for PP2A-B55\nregulation that we call inhibition by unfair competition. As the name suggests,\nduring M phase PP2A-B55's attention is diverted to pEndos, which binds much\nmore avidly and is dephosphorylated more slowly than other substrates. When Gwl\nis inactivated during the M phase-to-interphase transition, the dynamic balance\nchanges: pEndos dephosphorylated by PP2A-B55 cannot be replaced, so the\nphosphatase can refocus its attention on CDK-phosphorylated substrates. This\nmechanism explains simultaneously how PP2A-B55 and Gwl together regulate\npEndos, and how pEndos controls PP2A-B55.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 17:10:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Williams", "Byron C.", ""], ["Filter", "Joshua J.", ""], ["Blake-Hodek", "Kristina A.", ""], ["Wadzinski", "Brian E.", ""], ["Fuda", "Nicholas J.", ""], ["Shalloway", "David", ""], ["Goldberg", "Michael L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6538", "submitter": "Pierre Sens", "authors": "Quentin Vagne, Matthew S.
