However, specific algorithms for automatic LCR detection and\nanalysis have not been developed in live, spontaneously beating pacemaker\ncells. Here we measured LCRs using a high-speed 2D-camera in spontaneously\ncontracting sinoatrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit and guinea pig and\ndeveloped a new algorithm capable of detecting and analyzing the LCRs spatially\nin two-dimensions, and in time. Our algorithm tracks points along the midline\nof the contracting cell. It uses these points as a coordinate system for affine\ntransform, producing a transformed image series where the cell does not\ncontract. Action potential-induced Ca transients and LCRs were thereafter\nisolated from recording noise by applying a series of spatial filters. The LCR\nbirth and death events were detected by a differential (frame-to-frame)\nsensitivity algorithm. An LCR was detected when its signal changes sufficiently\nquickly within a sufficiently large area. The LCR is considered to have died\nwhen its amplitude decays substantially, or when it merges into the rising\nwhole cell Ca transient. Our algorithm provides major LCR parameters such as\nperiod, signal mass, duration, and path area. As LCRs propagate within cells,\nthe algorithm identifies splitting and merging behaviors, indicating the\nimportance of Ca-induced-Ca-release for the fate of LCRs and for generating a\npowerful ensemble Ca signal. Thus, our new computer algorithms eliminate motion\nartifacts and detect 2D local spatiotemporal Ca release events from recording\nnoise and global signals. While the algorithms detect LCRs in sinoatrial nodal\ncells, they have the potential to be used in other applications in biophysics\nand cell physiology, for example, to detect Ca wavelets (abortive waves),\nsparks and embers in muscle cells and Ca puffs and syntillas in neurons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 May 2017 10:57:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Maltsev", "Alexander V.", ""], ["Parsons", "Sean P.", ""], ["Kim", "Mary S.", ""], ["Tsutsui", "Kenta", ""], ["Stern", "Michael D.", ""], ["Lakatta", "Edward G", ""], ["Maltsev", "Victor A.", ""], ["Monfredi", "Oliver", ""]]}, {"id": "1705.02527", "submitter": "David Holcman", "authors": "Jerome Cartailler, Zeev Schuss and David Holcman", "title": "Geometrical effects on nonlinear electrodiffusion in cell physiology", "comments": "To appear in Journal of Nonlinear Science", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s00332-017-9393-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC math.AP physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We report here new electrical laws, derived from nonlinear electro-diffusion\ntheory, about the effect of the local geometrical structure, such as curvature,\non the electrical properties of a cell.

In this work, we shed light on\nthis phenomenon, showing that passive cross-linkers, when considered in the\ncontext of two anti-parallel filaments, generate noticeable contractile forces.\nHowever, as binding free energy of cross-linkers is increased, a sharp onset of\nkinetic arrest follows, greatly diminishing effectiveness of this contractility\nmechanism, allowing the network to contract only with weakly resisting tensions\nat its boundary. We have carried out stochastic simulations elucidating this\nmechanism, followed by a mean-field treatment that predicts how contractile\nforces asymptotically scale at small and large binding energies, respectively.\nFurthermore, when considering an active contractile filament pair, based on\nnon-muscle myosin II, we found that the non-processive nature of these motors\nleads to highly inefficient force generation, due to recoil slippage of the\noverlap during periods when the motor is dissociated. However, we discovered\nthat passive cross-linkers can serve as a structural ratchet during these\nunbound motor time spans, resulting in vast force amplification.
