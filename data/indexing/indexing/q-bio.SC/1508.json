One of the\nmost important fundamental aspects of these interactions is the process of\nprotein searching and recognizing specific binding sites on DNA. A large number\nof experimental and theoretical investigations have been devoted to uncovering\nthe molecular description of these phenomena, but many aspects of the\nmechanisms of protein search for the targets on DNA remain not well understood.\nOne of the most intriguing problems is the role of multiple targets in protein\nsearch dynamics. Using a recently developed theoretical framework we analyze\nthis question in detail. Our method is based on a discrete-state stochastic\napproach that takes into account most relevant physical-chemical processes and\nleads to fully analytical description of all dynamic properties. Specifically,\nsystems with two and three targets have been explicitly investigated. It is\nfound that multiple targets in most cases accelerate the search in comparison\nwith a single target situation. However, the acceleration is not always\nproportional to the number of targets. Surprisingly, there are even situations\nwhen it takes longer to find one of the multiple targets in comparison with the\nsingle target. It depends on the spatial position of the targets, distances\nbetween them, average scanning lengths of protein molecules on DNA, and the\ntotal DNA lengths. Physical-chemical explanations of observed results are\npresented. Our predictions are compared with experimental observations as well\nas with results from a continuum theory for the protein search. Extensive Monte\nCarlo computer simulations fully support our theoretical calculations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Aug 2015 22:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Lange", "Martin", ""], ["Kochugaeva", "Maria", ""], ["Kolomeisky", "Anatoly B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.01737", "submitter": "David Schnoerr", "authors": "David Schnoerr, Guido Sanguinetti and Ramon Grima", "title": "Comparison of different moment-closure approximations for stochastic\n  chemical kinetics", "comments": "36 pages, 14 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

Several different MA methods have been proposed and\napplied in the literature, but it remains unclear how they perform with respect\nto each other. In this paper we study the normal, Poisson, log-normal and\ncentral-moment-neglect MAs by applying them to understand the stochastic\nproperties of chemical systems whose deterministic rate equations show the\nproperties of bistability, ultrasensitivity and oscillatory behaviour. Our\nresults suggest that the normal MA is favourable over the other studied MAs. In\nparticular we found that (i) the size of the region of parameter space where a\nclosure gives physically meaningful results, e.g. positive mean and variance,\nis considerably larger for the normal closure than for the other three\nclosures; (ii) the accuracy of the predictions of the four closures (relative\nto simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm) is comparable in\nthose regions of parameter space where all closures give physically meaningful\nresults; (iii) the Poisson and log-normal MAs are not uniquely defined for\nsystems involving conservation laws in molecule numbers. We also describe the\nnew software package MOCA which enables the automated numerical analysis of\nvarious MA methods in a graphical user interface and which was used to perform\nthe comparative analysis presented in this paper.

Cell polarization is defined\nthrough the spatio-temporal organization of molecules such as PI3K or small\nGTPases, and is determined by intracellular signaling networks. It results in\ndirectional forces through actin polymerization and myosin contractions. Many\nexisting mathematical models of cell polarization are formulated in terms of\nreaction-diffusion systems of interacting molecules, and are often defined in\none or two spatial dimensions. In this paper, we introduce a 3D\nreaction-diffusion model of interacting molecules in a single cell, and find\nthat cell geometry has an important role affecting the capability of a cell to\npolarize, or change polarization when an external signal changes direction. Our\nresults suggest a geometrical argument why more roundish cells can repolarize\nmore effectively than cells which are elongated along the direction of the\noriginal stimulus, and thus enable roundish cells to turn faster, as has been\nobserved in experiments. On the other hand, elongated cells preferentially\npolarize along their main axis even when a gradient stimulus appears from\nanother direction. Furthermore, our 3D model can accurately capture the effect\nof binding and unbinding of important regulators of cell polarization to and\nfrom the cell membrane. This spatial separation of membrane and cytosol, not\npossible to capture in 1D or 2D models, leads to marked differences of our\nmodel from comparable lower-dimensional models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 00:41:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 00:59:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Spill", "Fabian", ""], ["Andasari", "Vivi", ""], ["Mak", "Michael", ""], ["Kamm", "Roger D.", ""], ["Zaman", "Muhammad H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02805", "submitter": "Radek Erban", "authors": "Radek Erban", "title": "Coupling all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of ions in water with\n  Brownian dynamics", "comments": "Submitted to Proceedings of the Royal Society A", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1098/rspa.2015.0556", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ions (K$^+$, Na$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$ and\nCl$^-$) in aqueous solutions are investigated.

Such approximation proceeds by optimising an\naction functional whose associated set of Euler-Lagrange (Hamilton) equations\nprovide the most likely fluctuation path.

We analyse two\nparticular examples of systems whose mean-field limit has been shown to exhibit\nbi-stability: an enzyme-catalysed system of two mutually-inhibitory proteins\nand a gene regulatory circuit with self-activation. Our theory establishes that\nthe number of molecules of the conserved species are order parameters whose\nvariation regulates bistable behaviour in the associated systems beyond the\npredictions of the mean-field theory. This prediction is fully confirmed by\ndirect numerical simulations using the stochastic simulation algorithm.
