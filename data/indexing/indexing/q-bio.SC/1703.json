The relative positions of the sites of entry of the\ntwo species of rods with respect to the location of the bottleneck are\nmotivated by a biological phenomenon. However, the primary focus of the study\nhere is to explore the effects of the interference of the flow of the two\nspecies of rods on their spatio-temporal organization and the regulations of\nthis interference by the extended bottleneck. By a combination of mean-field\ntheory and computer simulation we calculate the flux of both species of rods\nand their density profiles as well as the composite phase diagrams of the\nsystem. If the bottleneck is sufficiently stringent some of the phases become\npractically unrealizable although not ruled out on the basis of any fundamental\nphysical principle. Moreover the extent of suppression of flow of the\ndownstream entrants by the flow of the upstream entrants can also be regulated\nby the strength of the bottleneck.

In\nthis paper we derive and analyse new mathematical models for the BR signalling\npathway and for the crosstalk between the BR and GA signalling pathways. To\nanalyse the effects of spatial heterogeneity of the signalling processes, along\nwith spatially-homogeneous ODE models we derive coupled PDE-ODE systems\nmodelling the temporal and spatial dynamics of molecules involved in the\nsignalling pathways. The values of the parameters in the model for the BR\nsignalling pathway are determined using experimental data on the gene\nexpression of BR biosynthetic enzymes. The stability of steady state solutions\nof our mathematical model, shown for a wide range of parameters, can be related\nto the BR homeostasis. Our results for the crosstalk model suggest that the\ninteraction between transcription factors BZR and DELLA exerts more influence\non the dynamics of the signalling pathways than BZR-mediated biosynthesis of\nGA, suggesting that the interaction between transcription factors may\nconstitute the principal mechanism of the crosstalk between the BR and GA\nsignalling pathways. In general, perturbations in the GA signalling pathway\nhave larger effects on the dynamics of components of the BR signalling pathway\nthan perturbations in the BR signalling pathway on the dynamics of the GA\npathway. The perturbation in the crosstalk mechanism also has a larger effect\non the dynamics of the BR pathway than of the GA pathway. Large changes in the\ndynamics of the GA signalling processes can be observed only in the case where\nthere are disturbances in both the BR signalling pathway and the crosstalk\nmechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 09:54:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Aug 2017 16:57:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Allen", "Henry R.", ""], ["Ptashnyk", "Mariya", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.07610", "submitter": "Jacques P\\'ecr\\'eaux", "authors": "Ruddi Rodriguez Garcia, Laurent Chesneau, Sylvain Pastezeur, Julien\n  Roul, Marc Tramier and Jacques P\\'ecr\\'eaux", "title": "Dynein dynamics at the microtubule plus-ends and cortex during division\n  in the C. $\\textit{elegans}$ zygote", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  During asymmetric cell division, dynein generates forces, which position the\nspindle to reflect polarity and ensure correct daughter cell fates.
