Synaptic signaling, as a natural implementation of this\nparadigm, encompasses functional components that, once understood, can\nfacilitate the development of synthetic DMC systems. To unleash this potential,\nhowever, a thorough understanding of the synaptic communication channel based\non biophysical principles is needed. Since synaptic transmission critically\ndepends also on non-neural cells, such understanding requires the consideration\nof the so-called tripartite synapse. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive\nchannel model of the tripartite synapse encompassing a three-dimensional,\nfinite-size spatial model of the synaptic cleft, molecule uptake at the\npresynaptic neuron and at glial cells, reversible binding to individual\nreceptors at the postsynaptic neuron, and spillover to the extrasynaptic space.\nBased on this model, we derive analytical time domain expressions for the\nchannel impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system and for the number of\nmolecules taken up at the presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, respectively.\nThese expressions provide insight into the impact of macroscopic physical\nchannel parameters on the decay rate of the CIR and the reuptake rate, and\nreveal fundamental limits for synaptic signal transmission induced by chemical\nreaction kinetics and the channel geometry. Adapted to realistic parameters,\nour model produces plausible results when compared to experimental and\nsimulation studies and we provide results from particle-based computer\nsimulations to further validate the analytical model.

Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the\nrole of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving\nthe active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding\nhas not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes\nthrough chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between\nthe cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the\nintracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance\nProteins (MRPs) transporters.
