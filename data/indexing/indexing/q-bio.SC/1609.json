Although\nthe cytoskeletal filaments can be very stiff and embedded in a dense and\ncross-linked network, it has been shown that, in cells, they typically exhibit\nsignificant bending on all length scales.

Our model allows to\ncouple the evolution of the deformation of the semi-flexible polymer with the\nstochastic dynamics of linkers which exert transversal forces onto the\nfilament. We observe a $q^{-2}$ dependence of the bending spectrum for some\nbiologically relevant parameters and in a certain range of wavenumbers $q$.\nHowever, generically, the spatially localized forcing and the non-thermal\ndynamics both introduce deviations from the thermal-like $q^{-2}$ spectrum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 11:43:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Weber", "Ines", ""], ["Appert-Rolland", "C\u00e9cile", ""], ["Schehr", "Gr\u00e9gory", ""], ["Santen", "Ludger", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.03829", "submitter": "Manos Mavrakis", "authors": "Manos Mavrakis (MOSAIC)", "title": "Visualizing septins in early Drosophila embryos", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Methods in Cell Biology, Elsevier, 2016, Septins, 136, pp.183", "doi": "10.1016/bs.mcb.2016.03.026", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.CB", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Functional studies in Drosophila have been key for establishing a role for\nthe septin family of proteins in animal cell division and thus extending for\nthe first time observations from the budding yeast to animal cells.
