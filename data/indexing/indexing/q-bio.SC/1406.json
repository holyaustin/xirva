While\nribosomes are believed to have a fixed stoichiometry among their core ribosomal\nproteins (RPs), some experiments suggest a more variable composition. Testing\nsuch variability requires direct and precise quantification of RPs. We used\nmass-spectrometry to directly quantify RPs across monosomes and polysomes of\nmouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and budding yeast. Our data show that the\nstoichiometry among core RPs in wild-type yeast cells and ESC depends both on\nthe growth conditions and on the number of ribosomes bound per mRNA.\nFurthermore, we find that the fitness of cells with a deleted RP-gene is\ninversely proportional to the enrichment of the corresponding RP in polysomes.\nTogether, our findings support the existence of ribosomes with distinct protein\ncomposition and physiological function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2014 14:57:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 12:17:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Slavov", "Nikolai", ""], ["Semrau", "Sefan", ""], ["Airoldi", "Edoardo", ""], ["Budnik", "Bogdan", ""], ["van Oudenaarden", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.1292", "submitter": "Jan Kierfeld", "authors": "Nina M\\\"uller and Jan Kierfeld", "title": "Effects of microtubule mechanics on hydrolysis and catastrophes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

This also affects the lateral interaction and bending\nenergies and, thus, the mechanical equilibrium state of the microtubule. As\nhydrolysis gives rise to conformational changes in dimers, mechanical forces\nalso influence the hydrolysis rates by mechanical energy changes modulating the\nhydrolysis rate. The interaction via the microtubule mechanics then gives rise\nto correlation effects in the hydrolysis dynamics, which have not been taken\ninto account before. Assuming a dominant influence of mechanical energies on\nhydrolysis rates, we investigate the most probable hydrolysis pathways both for\nvectorial and random hydrolysis. Investigating the stability with respect to\nlateral bond rupture, we identify initiation configurations for catastrophes\nalong the hydrolysis pathways and values for a lateral bond rupture force.
