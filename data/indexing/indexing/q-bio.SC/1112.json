In light of a fundamental symmetry principle, the\ntypical pattern-formation mechanisms of diffusion plus regulation cannot\nimplement the \"right-hand rule\"; at the microscopic level, the cell's\ncytoskeleton of chiral filaments seems always to be involved, usually in\ncollective states driven by polymerization forces or molecular motors. It seems\nparticularly easy for handedness to emerge in a shear or rotation in the\nbackground of an effectively two-dimensional system, such as the cell membrane\nor a layer of cells, as this requires no pre-existing axis apart from the layer\nnormal. I detail a scenario involving actin/myosin layers in snails and in C.\nelegans, and also one about the microtubule layer in plant cells. I also survey\nthe other examples that I am aware of, such as the emergence of handedness such\nas the emergence of handedness in neurons, in eukaryote cell motility, and in\nnon-flagellated bacteria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 Dec 2011 03:57:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 May 2012 01:36:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Henley", "Christopher L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.4589", "submitter": "Hong Qian", "authors": "Hong Qian and Sumit Roy", "title": "An Information Theoretical Analysis of Kinase Activated Phosphorylation\n  Dephosphorylation Cycle", "comments": "17 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience, Volume 11, Issue 3, pp. 289 -\n  295 (2012)", "doi": "10.1109/TNB.2011.2182658", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Signal transduction, the information processing mechanism in biological\ncells, is carried out by a network of biochemical reactions. The dynamics of\ndriven biochemical reactions can be studied in terms of nonequilibrium\nstatistical physics. Such systems may also be studied in terms of Shannon's\ninformation theory. We combine these two perspectives in this study of the\nbasic units (modules) of cellular signaling: the phosphorylation\ndephosphorylation cycle (PdPC) and the guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase). We\nshow that the channel capacity is zero if and only if the free energy\nexpenditure of biochemical system is zero. In fact, a positive correlation\nbetween the channel capacity and free energy expenditure is observed. In terms\nof the information theory, a linear signaling cascade consisting of multiple\nsteps of PdPC can function as a distributed \"multistage code\". With increasing\nnumber of steps in the cascade, the system trades channel capacity with the\ncode complexity. Our analysis shows that while a static code can be molecular\nstructural based; a biochemical communication channel has to have energy\nexpenditure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Dec 2011 07:29:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Hong", ""], ["Roy", "Sumit", ""]]}]
