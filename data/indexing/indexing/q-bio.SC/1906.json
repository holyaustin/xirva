Fluorescent membrane labeling\nmethods require the use of dye molecules that can be inserted in the bilayers\nat different stages of the synthesis. To our knowledge there is no generalized\nmethod for labeling preformed vesicles. Herein we develop a versatile protocol\nthat is suitable to both surfactant and lipid preformed vesicles and requires\nno separation or purification steps. Based on the lipophilic carbocyanine green\ndye PKH67, the methodology is assessed on zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine\nvesicles. To demonstrate its versatility, it is applied to dispersions of\nanionic or cationic vesicles, such as a drug administrated to premature infants\nwith respiratory distress syndrome, or a vesicle formulation used as a fabric\nsoftener for homecare applications. By means of fluorescence microscopy we then\nvisualize the interaction mechanisms of nanoparticles crossing live cell\nmembranes and of surfactant adsorbing on cotton fabric. These results highlight\nthe advantages of a membrane labeling technique that is simple and applicable\nto a large number of soft matter systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Jun 2019 22:22:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mousseau", "Fanny", ""], ["Berret", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Oikonomou", "Evdokia K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.02527", "submitter": "Harmen Wierenga", "authors": "Harmen Wierenga and Pieter Rein ten Wolde", "title": "Diffusible crosslinkers cause superexponential friction forces", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

The spindle consists of microtubules,\nwhich are not only crosslinked by motor proteins but also by passive binding\nproteins. These passive crosslinkers stabilize the highly dynamic mitotic\nspindle by generating friction forces between sliding filaments. However, it\nremains unclear how the friction coefficient depends on the number of\ncrosslinkers and the size of the overlap between the microtubules. Here, we use\ntheory and computer simulations to study the friction between two filaments\nthat are crosslinked by passive proteins, which can hop between neighboring\nbinding sites while physically excluding each other. The simulations reveal\nthat the movement of one microtubule relative to the other is limited by\nfree-energy barrier crossings, causing rare and discrete jumps of the\nmicrotubule that span the distance between adjacent crosslinker binding sites.\nWe derive an exact analytical expression for the free-energy landscape and\nidentify the reaction coordinate that governs the relative movement, which\nallows us to determine the effective barrier height for the microtubule jumps.\nBoth through simulations and reaction rate theory, we make the experimentally\ntestable prediction that the friction between the microtubules increases\nsuperexponentially with the density of crosslinkers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Jun 2019 11:39:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wierenga", "Harmen", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.02710", "submitter": "Gao-De Li Dr", "authors": "Gao-De Li", "title": "Flexible Cancer-Associated Chromatin Configuration (CACC) Might Be the\n  Fundamental Reason Why Cancer Is So Difficult to Cure", "comments": "8 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We once proposed that cell-type-associated chromatin configurations determine\ncell types and that cancer cell type is determined by cancer-associated\nchromatin configuration (CACC).

In this study, we\nused a mechanical model of the lipid bilayer to systematically investigate the\ninfluence of location, symmetry constraints, and helical forces on membrane\nneck constriction. Simulations from our model demonstrated that the energy\nbarriers associated with constriction of a membrane neck are\nlocation-dependent. Importantly, if symmetry restrictions are relaxed, then the\nenergy barrier for constriction is dramatically lowered and the membrane\nbuckles at lower values of forcing parameters. Our simulations also show that\nconstriction due to helical proteins further reduces the energy barrier for\nneck formation compared to cylindrical proteins. These studies establish that\ndespite different molecular mechanisms of neck formation in cells, the\nmechanics of constriction naturally leads to a loss of symmetry that can lower\nthe energy barrier to constriction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 15 Jun 2019 00:38:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2019 18:43:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Vasan", "Ritvik", ""], ["Rudraraju", "Shiva", ""], ["Akamatsu", "Matthew", ""], ["Garikipati", "Krishna", ""], ["Rangamani", "Padmini", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.08154", "submitter": "Debashish Chowdhury", "authors": "Annwesha Dutta, Gunter M Sch\\\"utz, Debashish Chowdhury", "title": "Stochastic thermodynamics and modes of operation of a ribosome: a\n  network theoretic perspective", "comments": "62 pages; augmented model, new results, thoroughly revised text", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In each successful chemo-mechanical cycle\nduring the (protein) elongation stage, the ribosome elongates the protein by a\nsingle subunit, called amino acid, and steps forward on the template mRNA by\nthree nucleotides called a codon. Therefore, a ribosome is also regarded as a\nmolecular motor for which the mRNA serves as the track, its step size is that\nof a codon and two molecules of GTP and one molecule of ATP hydrolyzed in that\ncycle serve as its fuel. What adds further complexity is the existence of\ncompeting pathways leading to distinct cycles, branched pathways in each cycle\nand futile consumption of fuel that leads neither to elongation of the nascent\nprotein nor forward stepping of the ribosome on its track. We investigate a\nmodel formulated in terms of the network of discrete chemo-mechanical states of\na ribosome during the elongation stage of translation.
