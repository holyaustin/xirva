Mechanisms of selectivity of such channels serve as an\ninspiration for creation of artificial nano-molecular sorting devices and\nbio-sensors. To elucidate the transport mechanisms, it is important to\nunderstand the transport on the single molecule level in the experimentally\nrelevant regime when multiple particles are crowded in the channel. In this\npaper we analyze the effects of inter-particle crowding on the non-equilibrium\ntransport times through a finite-length channel by means of analytical theory\nand computer simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jul 2009 21:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-18", "authors_parsed": [["Zilman", "Anton", ""], ["Pearson", "John", ""], ["Bel", "Golan", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4119", "submitter": "Lei-Han Tang", "authors": "Li-ping Xiong, Yu-qiang Ma, and Lei-Han Tang", "title": "Attenuation of transcriptional bursting in mRNA transport", "comments": "18 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1478-3975/7/1/016005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the stochastic nature of biochemical processes, the copy number of any\ngiven type of molecule inside a living cell often exhibits large temporal\nfluctuations. Here, we develop analytic methods to investigate how the noise\narising from a bursting input is reshaped by a transport reaction which is\neither linear or of the Michaelis-Menten type. A slow transport rate smoothes\nout fluctuations at the output end and minimizes the impact of bursting on the\ndownstream cellular activities. In the context of gene expression in eukaryotic\ncells, our results indicate that transcriptional bursting can be substantially\nattenuated by the transport of mRNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Saturation of\nthe transport mediators or nuclear pores contributes further to the noise\nreduction. We suggest that the mRNA transport should be taken into account in\nthe interpretation of relevant experimental data on transcriptional bursting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2009 16:49:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Xiong", "Li-ping", ""], ["Ma", "Yu-qiang", ""], ["Tang", "Lei-Han", ""]]}]
