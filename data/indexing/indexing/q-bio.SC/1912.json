Extreme FPTs of\ndiffusion have been studied for decades, but little is known for other types of\nstochastic processes. In this paper, we study the distribution of extreme FPTs\nof piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs). PDMPs are a broad class of\nstochastic processes that evolve deterministically between random events. Using\nclassical extreme value theory, we prove general theorems which yield the\ndistribution and moments of extreme FPTs in the limit of many searchers based\non the short time distribution of the FPT of a single searcher. We then apply\nthese theorems to some canonical PDMPs, including run and tumble searchers in\none, two, and three space dimensions.

Synaptic signaling is a natural implementation of this\nparadigm. It is responsible for relaying information from one neuron to\nanother, but also provides support for complex functionalities, such as\nlearning and memory. Many of its features are not yet understood, some are,\nhowever, known to be critical for robust, reliable neural communication. In\nparticular, some synapses feature a re-uptake mechanism at the presynaptic\nneuron, which provides a means for removing neurotransmitters from the synaptic\ncleft and for recycling them for future reuse. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive channel model for synaptic DMC encompassing a spatial model of\nthe synaptic cleft, molecule re-uptake at the presynaptic neuron, and\nreversible binding to individual receptors at the postsynaptic neuron. Based on\nthis model, we derive an analytical time domain expression for the channel\nimpulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system. Our model explicitly\nincorporates macroscopic physical channel parameters and can be used to\nevaluate the impact of re-uptake, receptor density, and channel width on the\nCIR of the synaptic DMC system. Furthermore, we provide results from\nparticlebased computer simulation, which validate the analytical model.

In spite of the efficiency\nof tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI; Imatinib), other strategies are explored to\neliminate CML leukemia stem cells, such as calcium pathways. Results: In this\nwork, we showed that Store-Operated Calcium Entry (SOCE) and thrombin induced\ncalcium influx were decreased in Bcr-Abl expressing 32d cells (32d-p210). The\n32d-p210 cells showed modified Orai1/STIM1 ratio and reduced TRPC1 expression\nthat could explain SOCE reduction. Decrease in SOCE and thrombin induced\ncalcium entry was associated to reduced Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells\n(NFAT) nucleus translocation in 32d-p210 cells. We demonstrated that SOCE\nblockers enhanced cell mobility of 32d-p210 cells and reduced the proliferation\nrate in both 32d cell lines. TKI treatment slightly reduced the\nthrombin-induced response, but imatinib restored SOCE to the wild type level.\nBcr-Abl is also known to deregulate Protein Kinase C (PKC), which was described\nto modulate calcium entries. We showed that PKC enhances SOCE and thrombin\ninduced calcium entries in control cells while this effect is lost in\nBcr-Abl-expressing cells. Conclusion: The tyrosine kinase activity seems to\nregulate calcium entries probably not directly but through a global cellular\nreorganization involving a PKC pathway. Altogether, calcium entries are\nderegulated in Bcr-Abl-expressing cells and could represent an interesting\ntherapeutic target in combination with TKI.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Dec 2019 11:12:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cabanas", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "", "IPBC"], ["Harnois", "Thomas", "", "IPBC"], ["Magaud", "Christophe", "", "STIM"], ["Cousin", "La\u00ebtitia", "", "STIM"], ["Constantin", "Bruno", "", "STIM"], ["Bourmeyster", "Nicolas", "", "IPBC"], ["D\u00e9liot", "Nadine", "", "STIM"]]}, {"id": "1912.08579", "submitter": "William Bialek", "authors": "William Bialek, Thomas Gregor, and Ga\\v{s}per Tka\\v{c}ik", "title": "Action at a distance in transcriptional regulation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is increasing evidence that protein binding to specific sites along DNA\ncan activate the reading out of genetic information without coming into direct\nphysical contact with the gene.

The two states are the 'locked' ground\nstate where the FliJ coiled coil filament experiences fluctuations in an\nasymmetric torsional potential, and a 'free' excited state in which FliJ\nundergoes rotational diffusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to treat\ntransitions between these two states, and obtain the average angular velocity\nof the FliJ filament within the FliI6 stator: ~9.0 rps. The motor was then\nstudied under external counter torque conditions in order to ascertain its\nmaximal power output: Pmax ~42 kBT/s, and the stall torque: ~3 kBT/rad. Two\nmodes of action within the flagellar export apparatus are proposed, in which\nthe motor performs useful work either by continuously 'grinding' through the\nresistive environment, or by exerting equal and opposite stall force on it. In\nboth cases, the resistance is provided by flagellin subunits entering the\nflagellar export channel prior to their unfolding.
