The core of the\nmodel is provided by a short chain of magnetosomes serving as a sensor which is\ncoupled by elastic linkers to the gating elements of ion channels forming a\nsmall cluster in the cell membrane. The magnetic sensor is fixed by one end on\ncytoskeleton elements attached to the membrane and is exposed to viscoelastic\ncytosol. Its free end can reorient stochastically and subdiffusively in\nviscoelastic cytosol responding to external magnetic field changes and open the\ngates of coupled ion channels. The sensor dynamics is generally bistable due to\nbistability of the gates which can be in two states with probabilities which\ndepend on the sensor orientation. For realistic parameters, it is shown that\nthis model channel can operate in the magnetic field of Earth for a small\nnumber (5 to 7) of single-domain magnetosomes constituting the sensor rod each\nof which has a typical size found in magnetotactic bacteria and other\norganisms, or even just one sufficiently large nanoparticle of a characteristic\nsize also found in nature. It is shown that due to viscoelasticity of medium\nthe bistable gating dynamics generally exhibits power law and stretched\nexponential distributions of the residence times of the channels in their open\nand closed states.

Most of the earlier two-state models\ncombined nucleation with incorrect-contact formation step. In our model we\nsuggest that it is considerably meaningful when we combine the nucleation with\nthe zipping since nucleation is the initial step of zipping and the nucleated\nand zipping molecules are indistinguishable.

Each spine contains a synaptic contact site that may connect\nits parent dendrite to the axons of neighboring neurons. Dendritic spines are\nmarkedly distinct in shape and size, and certain types of stimulation prompt\nspines to evolve, in fairly predictable fashion, from thin nascent morphologies\nto the mushroom-like shapes associated with mature spines. This striking\nprogression is coincident with the (re)configuration of the neuronal network\nduring early development, learning and memory formation, and has been\nconjectured to be part of the machinery that encodes these processes at the\nscale of individual neuronal connections. It is well established that the\nstructural plasticity of spines is strongly dependent upon the actin\ncytoskeleton inside the spine. A general framework that details the precise\nrole of actin in directing the transitions between the various spine shapes is\nlacking. We address this issue, and present a quantitative, model-based\nscenario for spine plasticity validated using realistic and physiologically\nrelevant parameters. Our model points to a crucial role for the actin\ncytoskeleton. In the early stages of spine formation, the interplay between the\nelastic properties of the spine membrane and the protrusive forces generated in\nthe actin cytoskeleton propels the incipient spine. In the maturation stage,\nactin remodeling in the form of the combined dynamics of branched and bundled\nactin is required to form mature, mushroom-like spines. Our model identifies\nadditional factors that plausibly aid the stabilization and maintenance of\nspine morphology. Taken together, our model provides unique insights into the\nfundamental role of actin remodeling and polymerization forces during spine\nformation and maturation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 18:51:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 13:27:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Miermans", "Karsten", ""], ["Kusters", "Remy", ""], ["Hoogenraad", "Casper", ""], ["Storm", "Cornelis", ""]]}]
