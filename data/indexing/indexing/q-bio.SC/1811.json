The mounting evidence suggests that this transport is in fact\nanomalous. However, the reasons for the anomaly is still under debate. We\nexamined experimental trajectories of organelles inside a living cell and\npropose a mathematical model that describes the previously reported transition\nfrom sub-diffusive to super-diffusive motion. In order to explain\nsuper-diffusive behaviour at long times, we introduce non-Markovian detachment\nkinetics of the cargo: the rate of detachment is inversely proportional to the\ntime since the last attachment. Recently, we observed the non-Markovian\ndetachment rate experimentally in eukaryotic cells. Here we further discuss\ndifferent scenarios of how this effective non-Markovian detachment rate could\narise. The non-Markovian model is successful in simultaneously describing the\ntime-averaged variance (the time-averaged mean squared displacement corrected\nfor directed motion), the mean first passage time of trajectories and the\nmultiple peaks observed in the distributions of cargo velocities. We argue that\nnon-Markovian kinetics could be biologically beneficial compared to the\nMarkovian kinetics commonly used for modelling, by increasing the average\ndistance the cargoes travel when a microtubule is blocked by other filaments.\nIn turn, sub-diffusion allows cargoes to reach neighbouring filaments with\nhigher probability, which promotes active motion along the microtubules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Nov 2018 11:40:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Korabel", "Nickolay", ""], ["Waigh", "Thomas A.", ""], ["Fedotov", "Sergei", ""], ["Allan", "Viki J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.05649", "submitter": "Ramon Grima", "authors": "Emma M.

Each of these\nnetworks are composed of organized actin microfilaments which are decorated\nwith specific sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs). The molecular mechanisms\nguiding ABPs to specific actin networks are still poorly understood, but\ncooperativity, the mechanism by which the binding of an ABP is positively\ninfluenced by proximal bound ABPs, plays a crucial role in generating locally\ndense stretches of ABPs. Cooperative binding is characterized by its amplitude,\nbut also by the range at which its effects are propagated along an actin\nfilament through long-range allosteric interactions. The range of these\nallosteric effects is still debated, but is likely to be significant at the\nlengthscale of actin filaments in cells. Here, we investigated how\ncooperativity influences the clustering of ABPs, using a stochastic\ncomputational model of binding of ABPs to actin filaments. The model reproduces\nthe formation of ABP clusters observed experimentally at the single filament\nscale, and provides a theoretical estimation of the range of cooperativity for\nproteins such as ADF/cofilin. We found that both the amplitude and the spatial\nrange of cooperativity dramatically impact the properties of clustering.\nHowever, the parameters of cooperativity modulate differently the rate of\nassembly, size and dynamics of the ABP clusters, suggesting that cooperativity\nis an efficient mechanism to regulate precisely the recruitment of ABPs in\ncells.
