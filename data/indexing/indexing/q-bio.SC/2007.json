This system is analyzed in a limit where\nthe detached motors have faster dynamics than the cargo, which in turn has\nfaster dynamics than the attached motors. The attachment and detachment rates\nare also taken to be slow relative to the spatial dynamics. Through an\napplication of iterated stochastic averaging to this system, and the use of\nrenewal-reward theory to stitch together the progress within each switching\nphase, we obtain explicit analytical expressions for the effective drift,\ndiffusivity, and processivity of the motor-cargo system. Our approach accounts\nin particular for jumps in motor-cargo position that occur during attachment\nand detachment events, as the cargo tracking variable makes a rapid adjustment\ndue to the averaged fast scales. The asymptotic formulas are in generally good\nagreement with direct stochastic simulations of the detailed model based on\nexperimental parameters for various pairings of kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 under\nassisting, hindering, or no load.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2020 19:24:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:47:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:15:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Klobusicky", "Joseph J.", ""], ["Fricks", "John", ""], ["Kramer", "Peter R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.02206", "submitter": "Shreyas Bhaban", "authors": "Shreyas Bhaban, James Melbourne, Saurav Talukdar and Murti V.

When disentangling the overall tilt angle and the structure of the tail\nimposed by trans/gauche configurations of torsion angles in the tail,\nrespectively, a more detailed picture of the impact of sterols can be\nformulated, revealing, e.g., an approximate temperature-concentration\nsuperposition ranging from the liquid to the gel phase. Furthermore, a new\nquantitative measure to identify the presence of collective sterol effects is\ndiscussed. Moreover, when comparing both types of sterols, addition of\ncholesterol has a noticeably stronger impact on phospholipid properties than of\nergosterol. The observed differences can be attributed to higher planarity of\nthe cholesterol ring system.
