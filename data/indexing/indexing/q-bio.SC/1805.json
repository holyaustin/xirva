The early steps of membrane fusion and viral capsid entry are\nmediated by adsorption to the cell surface, and receptor and coreceptor\nbinding. HIV-1 specifically targets CD4+ helper T-cells of the human immune\nsystem and binds to the receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 before fusion is\ninitiated. Previous experiments have been performed using a cell line\n(293-Affinofile) in which the expression of CD4 and CCR5 concentration were\nindependently controlled. After exposure to HIV-1 of various strains, the\nresulting infectivity was measured through the fraction of infected cells. To\ndesign and evaluate the effectiveness of drug therapies that target the\ninhibition of the entry processes, an accurate functional relationship between\nthe CD4/CCR5 concentrations and infectivity is desired in order to more\nquantitatively analyze experimental data. We propose three kinetic models\ndescribing the possible mechanistic processes involved in HIV entry and fit\ntheir predictions to infectivity measurements, contrasting and comparing\ndifferent outcomes. Our approach allows interpretation of the clustering of\ninfectivity of different strains of HIV-1 in the space of mechanistic kinetic\nparameters. Our model fitting also allows inference of nontrivial\nstoichiometries of receptor and coreceptor binding and provides a framework\nthrough which to quantitatively investigate the effectiveness of fusion\ninhibitors and neutralizing antibodies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2018 20:56:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Mistry", "Bhaven", ""], ["D'Orsogna", "Maria R.", ""], ["Webb", "Nicholas E.", ""], ["Lee", "Benhur", ""], ["Chou", "Tom", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.04624", "submitter": "Martin Lenz", "authors": "Pierre Ronceray and Chase P.

The model requires that the creation rate for each species be\nan increasing function of the ratio of total to unbound RNA. Similar mechanisms\nhave already been found to exist experimentally for ncRNA regulation. With the\noverall concentration of RNA regulated, equilibrium constants can be chosen to\nstore many different patterns, or many different input-output relations.

Some of these schemes that are based on the\nreaction-diffusion master equation (RDME), can simulate for extended spatial\nand temporal scales but cannot directly account for the microscopic effects in\nthe cell such as volume exclusion and diffusion-influenced reactions.\nNonetheless, schemes based on the high-resolution microscopic lattice method\n(MLM) can directly simulate these effects by representing each finite-sized\nmolecule explicitly as a random walker on fine lattice voxels. The theory and\nconsistency of MLM in simulating diffusion-influenced reactions have not been\nclarified in detail. Here, we examine MLM in solving diffusion-influenced\nreactions in 3D space by employing the Spatiocyte simulation scheme. Applying\nthe random walk theory, we construct the general theoretical framework\nunderlying the method and obtain analytical expressions for the total rebinding\nprobability and the effective reaction rate. By matching Collins-Kimball and\nlattice-based rate constants, we obtained the exact expressions to determine\nthe reaction acceptance probability and voxel size. We found that the size of\nvoxel should be about 2% larger than the molecule. MLM is validated by\nnumerical simulations, showing good agreement with the off-lattice\nparticle-based method, eGFRD. MLM run time is more than an order of magnitude\nfaster than eGFRD when diffusing macromolecules with typical concentrations in\nthe cell. MLM also showed good agreements with eGFRD and mean-field models in\ncase studies of two basic motifs of intracellular signaling, the protein\nproduction-degradation process and the dual phosphorylation cycle. Moreover,\nwhen a reaction compartment is populated with volume-excluding obstacles, MLM\ncaptures the non-classical reaction kinetics caused by anomalous diffusion of\nreacting molecules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 May 2018 03:35:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 1 Sep 2018 03:53:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chew", "Wei-Xiang", ""], ["Kaizu", "Kazunari", ""], ["Watabe", "Masaki", ""], ["Muniandy", "Sithi V.", ""], ["Takahashi", "Koichi", ""], ["Arjunan", "Satya N.
