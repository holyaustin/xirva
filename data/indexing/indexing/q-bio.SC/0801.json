Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) technique\nhas been used over the past three decades to measure the mobility of\nmacromolecules and protein transport and interaction with immobile structures\ninside the cell nucleus. A theoretical model is presented that aims to describe\nprotein transport inside the nucleus, a process which is influenced by the\npresence of a boundary (i.e. membrane). A set of reaction-diffusion equations\nis employed to model both the diffusion of proteins and their interaction with\nimmobile binding sites. The proposed model has been designed to be applied to\nbiological samples with a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (CLSM) equipped\nwith the feature to bleach regions characterised by a scanning beam that has a\nradially Gaussian distributed profile. The proposed model leads to FRAP curves\nthat depend on the on- and off-rates. Semi-analytical expressions are used to\ndefine the boundaries of on- (off-) rate parameter space in simplified cases\nwhen molecules move within a bounded domain. The theoretical model can be used\nin conjunction to experimental data acquired by CLSM to investigate the\nbiophysical properties of proteins in living cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 4 Jan 2008 15:33:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tsibidis", "George D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.1392", "submitter": "Masatoshi Nishikawa", "authors": "Masatoshi Nishikawa, Hiroaki Takagi, Atsuko H.
