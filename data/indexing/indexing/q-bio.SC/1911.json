Despite\nthe critical importance of synaptosomes, the mechanisms of their formation\nremain not well understood. Because of the multi-site nature of participating\nproteins, it is widely believed that their search for specific sites on DNA\ninvolves the formation and breaking of DNA loops and sliding in the looped\nconfigurations. In reality, DNA in live cells is densely covered by other\nbiological molecules that might interfere with the formation of synaptosomes.\nIn this work, we developed a theoretical approach to evaluate the role of\nobstacles in the target search of multi-site proteins when the formation of DNA\nloops and the sliding in looped configurations are possible. Our theoretical\nmethod is based on analysis of a discrete-state stochastic model that uses a\nmaster equations approach and extensive computer simulations. It is found that\nthe obstacle slows down the search dynamics in the system when DNA loops are\nlong-lived, but the effect is minimal for short-lived DNA loops. In addition,\nthe relative positions of the target and the obstacle strongly influence the\ntarget search kinetics. Furthermore, the presence of the obstacle might\nincrease the noise in the system. These observations are discussed using\nphysical-chemical arguments. Our theoretical approach clarifies the molecular\nmechanisms of formation of protein-DNA complexes with multiple interactions\nsites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Nov 2019 19:46:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Felipe", "Cayke", ""], ["Shin", "Jaeoh", ""], ["Loginova", "Yulia", ""], ["Kolomeisky", "Anatoly B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.03640", "submitter": "Debasish Chaudhuri", "authors": "Amit Kumar, Pinaki Swain, Bela M.

This is true for vesicles in intracellular\ntransport, micro-organisms like bacteria, or animals moving within and\nresponding to their environment. For example, in cells the movement of\nvesicles, organelles and other cargo are affected by their binding to and\nunbinding from cytoskeletal filaments such as microtubules through molecular\nmotor proteins. A typical goal of theoretical or numerical analysis of models\nof such systems is to investigate the effective transport properties and their\ndependence on model parameters. While the effective velocity of particles\nundergoing switching diffusion is often easily characterized in terms of the\nlong-time fraction of time that particles spend in each state, the calculation\nof the effective diffusivity is more complicated because it cannot be expressed\nsimply in terms of a statistical average of the particle transport state at one\nmoment of time. However, it is common that these systems are regenerative, in\nthe sense that they can be decomposed into independent cycles marked by returns\nto a base state. Using decompositions of this kind, we calculate effective\ntransport properties by computing the moments of the dynamics within each cycle\nand then applying renewal-reward theory. This method provides a useful\nalternative large-time analysis to direct homogenization for linear\nadvection-reaction-diffusion partial differential equation models. Moreover, it\napplies to a general class of semi-Markov processes and certain stochastic\ndifferential equations that arise in models of intracellular transport.\nApplications of the proposed framework are illustrated for case studies such as\nmRNA transport in developing oocytes and processive cargo movement by teams of\nmotor proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Nov 2019 16:28:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-19", "authors_parsed": [["Ciocanel", "Maria-Veronica", ""], ["Fricks", "John", ""], ["Kramer", "Peter R.", ""], ["McKinley", "Scott A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.09352", "submitter": "Thomas R.
