In Drosophila oocytes,\nmicrotubules have been observed to undergo undulating motion, curving to form\ntravelling waves during cytoplasmic streaming. Here we show that this wave-like\nmotion can be understood physically as due to the hydrodynamic drag of\nstreaming impellers attached to kinesin motors moving toward the plus-ends of\nmicrotubules whose minus ends are anchored to the cell cortex. The tangential\nforces applied to such microtubules by kinesin give rise to bending and leads\nto chiral symmetry breaking causing the microtubules to propagate long\ntravelling waves. The waves are reminiscent of those seen in flagellar motion\nbut of a much longer time scale and by a different physical mechanism. We show\nhow kinesin movement can produce a bulk flow of cytoplasm surrounding a\nmicrotubule with the range of flow greatly enhanced by the effect of\nhydrodynamic coupling between impellers. That is, a relatively small number of\nmotors can move a large amount of fluid. The chaotic nature of the fluid motion\nof cytoplasm caused by kinesin movement along constantly changing microtubule\ntrajectories is important as it greatly enhances the efficiency of mixing.\nExisting data on in vitro microtubule gliding assays also show this chiral\ninstability in two dimensions and an analysis of this gives quantitative\nestimates for the forces exerted by motors and the drag coefficient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jan 2011 22:03:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2012 02:38:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Deutsch", "J.

In this work, we\npresent a model for quorum sensing induced luminescence phenotypes focusing on\nthe interactions of multiple sRNAs with target mRNA. Within our model, we find\nthat one key parameter -- the fold-change in protein concentration necessary\nfor luminescence activation -- can control whether the sRNAs appear to act\nadditively or redundantly. For specific parameter choices, we find that\ndifferences in this key parameter can also explain hitherto unconnected\nluminescence phenotypes differences for various pathway mutants in \\textit{V.\nharveyi} and \\textit{V. cholerae}.
