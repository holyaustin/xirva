However, the mechanisms stabilizing such small rafts are not clear,\nand even their existence is sometimes questioned. Here we report the\nobservation of raft-like structures in a coarse-grained molecular model for\nmulticomponent lipid bilayers. On small scales, our membranes demix into a\nliquid ordered (lo) and a liquid disordered (ld) phase. On large scales, phase\nseparation is suppressed and gives way to a microemulsion-type state that\ncontains nanometer size lo domains in a ld environment. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mechanism that generates rafts of finite size by a coupling between\nmonolayer curvature and local composition. We show that mismatch between the\nspontaneous curvatures of monolayers in the lo and ld phase induces elastic\ninteractions, which reduce the line tension between the lo and ld phase and can\nstabilize raft domains with a characteristic size of the order of a few\nnanometers. Our findings suggest that rafts in multicomponent bilayers might be\nclosely related to the modulated ripple phase in one-component bilayers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 23:18:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Meinhardt", "Sebastian", ""], ["Vink", "Richard L.

Quenching these\nvesicles from their fluid phase (T>Tm) through the phase transition in the gel\nstate (T<Tm) drives the inner vesicles to be expelled from the larger mother\nvesicle via the accompanying decrease in vesicle area by ~25% which forces a\npore to open in the mother vesicle. We demonstrate that the proceeding time\nevolution of the resulting efflux follows the relaxation of the membrane area\nand describe the entire relaxation process using an Onsager-like nonequilibrium\nthermodynamics ansatz. As a consequence of the volume efflux internal vesicles\nare expelled from the mother vesicle. Although complete sealing of the pore may\noccur during the expulsion, the global relaxation dynamics is conserved.\nFinally, comparison of these results to morphological relaxation phenomena\nfound in earlier studies reveals a universal relaxation behaviour in GUVs. When\nquenched from the fluid to gel phase the typical time scale of relaxation shows\nlittle variation and ranges between 4-5 seconds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 14:53:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Leirer", "C.

We show that\nlocalized mechanical perturbations, initiated by driving giant unilamellar\nvesicles (GUVs) through their lipid phase transition, leads to the immediate\nformation of rapidly growing, multiply localized, non-equilibrium buds, when\nthe transition takes place at short timescales (<{\\tau}). We show that these\nbuds arise from small fluid-like perturbations and grow as spherical caps in\nthe third dimension, since in plane spreading is obstructed by the continuous\nrigid gel-like matrix. Accounting for both three and two dimensional viscosity,\nwe demonstrate that dissipation decreases the size scale of the system and\ntherefore favours the formation of multiple buds as long as the perturbation\ntakes place above a certain critical rate. This rate depends on membrane and\nmedia viscosity and is qualitatively and quantitatively correctly predicted by\nour theoretical description.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 14:56:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-27", "authors_parsed": [["Franke", "Thomas", "", "Corresponding"], ["Leirer", "Christian T.", "", "Corresponding"], ["Wixforth", "Achim", "", "Corresponding"], ["Dan", "Nily", "", "Corresponding"], ["Schneider", "Matthias F.", "", "Corresponding"]]}, {"id": "1303.6793", "submitter": "Nicolae Radu Zabet", "authors": "Nicolae Radu Zabet and Boris Adryan", "title": "The effects of transcription factor competition on gene regulation", "comments": "This is an updated version of the manuscript taking into account\n  comments from reviewers", "journal-ref": "Frontiers in Genetics 4:197 (2013)", "doi": "10.3389/fgene.2013.00197", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transcription factor (TF) molecules translocate by facilitated diffusion (a\ncombination of 3D diffusion around and 1D random walk on the DNA). Despite the\nattention this mechanism received in the last 40 years, only a few studies\ninvestigated the influence of the cellular environment on the facilitated\ndiffusion mechanism and, in particular, the influence of `other' DNA binding\nproteins competing with the TF molecules for DNA space. Molecular crowding on\nthe DNA is likely to influence the association rate of TFs to their target site\nand the steady state occupancy of those sites, but it is still not clear how it\ninfluences the search in a genome-wide context, when the model includes\nbiologically relevant parameters (such as: TF abundance, TF affinity for DNA\nand TF dynamics on the DNA). We performed stochastic simulations of TFs\nperforming the facilitated diffusion mechanism, and considered various\nabundances of cognate and non-cognate TFs. We show that, for both obstacles\nthat move on the DNA and obstacles that are fixed on the DNA, changes in search\ntime are not statistically significant in case of biologically relevant\ncrowding levels on the DNA. In the case of non-cognate proteins that slide on\nthe DNA, molecular crowding on the DNA always leads to statistically\nsignificant lower levels of occupancy, which may confer a general mechanism to\ncontrol gene activity levels globally. When the `other' molecules are immobile\non the DNA, we found a completely different behaviour, namely: the occupancy of\nthe target site is always increased by higher molecular crowding on the DNA.\nFinally, we show that crowding on the DNA may increase transcriptional noise\nthrough increased variability of the occupancy time of the target sites.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 11:25:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Aug 2013 12:48:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Zabet", "Nicolae Radu", ""], ["Adryan", "Boris", ""]]}]
