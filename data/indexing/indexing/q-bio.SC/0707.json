Regular arrays are extremely resilient and can reversibly\naccommodate a large amount of supercoiling without much change in length. This\nbehavior is quantitatively described by a molecular model of the chromatin 3-D\narchitecture. In this model, we assume the existence of a dynamic equilibrium\nbetween three conformations of the nucleosome, which are determined by the\ncrossing status of the entry/exit DNAs (positive, null or negative). Torsional\nstrain, in displacing that equilibrium, extensively reorganizes the fiber\narchitecture. The model explains a number of long-standing topological\nquestions regarding DNA in chromatin, and may provide the ground to better\nunderstand the dynamic binding of most chromatin-associated proteins.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Jul 2007 15:56:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bancaud", "Aurelien", ""], ["Silva", "Natalia Conde e", ""], ["Barbi", "Maria", ""], ["Wagner", "Gaudeline", ""], ["Allemand", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Mozziconacci", "Julien", ""], ["Lavelle", "Christophe", ""], ["Croquette", "Vincent", ""], ["Victor", "Jean-Marc", ""], ["Prunell", "Ariel", ""], ["Viovy", "Jean-Louis", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.2551", "submitter": "Ulrich S.

Activation of myosin II molecular\nmotors through the Rho-pathway is described by a system of reaction-diffusion\nequations, which are coupled into a viscoelastic model for a contractile actin\nbundle.
