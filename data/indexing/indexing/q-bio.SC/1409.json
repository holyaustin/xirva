In an effort to dissect the fundamental\neffects of crowding and an increasingly complex cellular environment on the\ntransport of individual motor proteins, we have performed in vitro\nreconstitution experiments with single kinesin-1 motors walking on microtubules\nin the presence of crowding agents and transient microtubule-associated\nproteins that more closely emulate the cellular environment. Macromolecular\ncrowding due to inert polymers caused enhanced run lengths of motors, but\ndisplayed an increased tendency for non-specific motor association and\ndiffusion, most likely due to depletion interactions. We found that transiently\nbound associated proteins slowed forward motion, but did not drastically affect\nthe association times, in opposition to previously reported obstacle properties\nof stably associated microtubule-associated proteins, such as the neuronal\nprotein tau. Such studies of the transport properties of molecular motors in\nincreasingly complex reconstituted environments are important to illuminate the\nfundamental biophysical principles underlying the essential process of\nintracellular cargo transport.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2014 14:32:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Conway", "Leslie", ""], ["Ross", "Jennifer L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.3481", "submitter": "Sandip Datta", "authors": "Sandip Datta and Brian Seed", "title": "Influence of Multiplicative Stochastic Variation on Translational\n  Elongation Rates", "comments": "14 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent experiments have shown that stochastic effects exerted at the level of\ntranslation contribute a substantial portion of the variation in abundance of\nproteins expressed at moderate to high levels.

The plus-end\nof all the MTs in the bundle are permanently attached to a movable `wall' by a\ndevice whose detailed structure is not treated explicitly in our model. The\nonly requirement is that the device allows polymerization and depolymerization\nof each MT at the plus-end. In spite of the absence of external force and\ndirect lateral interactions between the MTs, the group of polymerizing MTs\nattached to the wall create a load force against the group of depolymerizing\nMTs and vice-versa; the load against a group is shared equally by the members\nof that group. Such indirect interactions among the MTs gives rise to the rich\nvariety of possible states of collective dynamics that we have identified by\ncomputer simulations of the model in different parameter regimes.

Our simplified model\nincludes (i) taus modeled as entropic springs between microtubules, (ii)\nremoval of taus from the bundles due to phosphorylation, and (iii) a possible\ndepletion force between microtubules due to these dissociated phosphorylated\ntaus. We equilibrate upon tau removal using steepest descent relaxation. In the\nabsence of the depletion force, the transverse rigidity to radial compression\nof the bundle falls to zero at about 60% tau occupancy, in agreement with\nstandard percolation theory results. However, with the attractive depletion\nforce, spring removal leads to a first order collapse of the bundles over a\nwide range of tau occupancies for physiologically realizable conditions. While\nour simplest calculations assume a constant concentration of microtubule\nintercalants to mediate the depletion force, including a dependence that is\nlinear in the detached taus yields the same collapse. Applying percolation\ntheory to removal of taus at microtubule tips, which are likely to be the\nprotective sites against dynamic instability, we argue that the microtubule\ninstability can only obtain at low tau occupancy, from 0.06-0.30 depending upon\nthe tau coordination at the microtubule tips. Hence, the collapse we discover\nis likely to be more robust over a wide range of tau occupancies than the\ndynamic instability.
