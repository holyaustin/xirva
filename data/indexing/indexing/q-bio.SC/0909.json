Here, we report the\nreal-time dynamics of the L1 stalk, a structural element of the large ribosomal\nsubunit that is implicated in directing tRNA movements during translation.\nWithin pre-translocation ribosomal complexes, the L1 stalk exists in a dynamic\nequilibrium between open and closed conformations. Binding of elongation factor\nG (EF-G) shifts this equilibrium towards the closed conformation through one of\nat least two distinct kinetic mechanisms, where the identity of the P-site tRNA\ndictates the kinetic route that is taken. Within post-translocation complexes,\nL1 stalk dynamics are dependent on the presence and identity of the E-site\ntRNA. Collectively, our data demonstrate that EF-G and the L1 stalk\nallosterically collaborate to direct tRNA translocation from the P to the E\nsites, and suggest a model for the release of E-site tRNA.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2009 16:14:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Fei", "Jingyi", ""], ["Bronson", "Jonathan E.", ""], ["Hofman", "Jake M.", ""], ["Srinivas", "Rathi L.", ""], ["Wiggins", "Chris H.", ""], ["Gonzalez,", "Ruben L.", "Jr"]]}, {"id": "0909.1918", "submitter": "Edoardo Milotti", "authors": "Roberto Chignola, Alessio Del Fabbro, Edoardo Milotti", "title": "Dynamics of intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations in the presence of\n  multisite Ca$^{2+}$-binding proteins", "comments": "4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2010.03.047", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the dynamics of intracellular calcium oscillations in the presence\nof proteins that bind calcium on multiple sites and that are generally believed\nto act as passive calcium buffers in cells.

Results are obtained using techniques from Karlin (1982)\nthat overcome the weak selection constraints needed for tractability in prior\nstudies of multilocus event models. A multivariate form of the reduction\nprinciple is found: reduction results at individual loci combine topologically\nto produce a surface of mutation rate alterations that are neutral for a new\nmodifier allele. New mutation rates survive if and only if they fall below this\nsurface - a generalization of the hyperplane found by Zhivotovsky et al. (1994)\nfor a multilocus recombination modifier. Increases in mutation rates at some\nloci may evolve if compensated for by decreases at other loci. The strength of\nselection on the modifier scales in proportion to the number of germline cell\ndivisions, and increases with the number of loci affected. Loci that do not\nmake a difference to marginal fitnesses at equilibrium are not subject to the\nreduction principle, and under fine tuning of mutation rates would be expected\nto have higher mutation rates than loci in mutation-selection balance. Other\nresults include the nonexistence of 'viability analogous, Hardy-Weinberg'\nmodifier polymorphisms under multiplicative mutation, and the sufficiency of\naverage transmission rates to encapsulate the effect of modifier polymorphisms\non the transmission of loci under selection. A conjecture is offered regarding\nsituations, like recombination in the presence of mutation, that exhibit\ndepartures from the reduction principle. Constraints for tractability are:\ntight linkage of all loci, initial fixation at the modifier locus, and mutation\ndistributions comprising transition probabilities of reversible Markov chains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Sep 2009 00:33:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2010 22:26:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 19 Aug 2010 01:14:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Altenberg", "Lee", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2521", "submitter": "Juergen Reingruber", "authors": "Juergen Reingruber David Holcman", "title": "The Gated Narrow Escape Time for molecular signaling", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The mean time for a diffusing ligand to activate a target protein located on\nthe surface of a microdomain can regulate cellular signaling.
