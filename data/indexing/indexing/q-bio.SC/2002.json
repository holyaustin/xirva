They are\nparticularly important for biological reactions, where the reaction rates are\noften determined by the diffusive transport of the molecules on two-dimensional\nsurfaces, such as the cell membrane. The peculiarities of diffusion on\ntwo-dimensional surfaces may lead to nontrivial reaction kinetics, such as\nconcentration dependent rate of association between two molecules. However,\ntraditionally, the kinetics of biomolecular association reactions has been\nmodeled using the law of mass action, which assumes that the rate of reaction\nis a concentration independent constant. In this paper, using multiscale\nmolecular simulation, we investigate the concentration dependence of\ndiffusion-limited association reactions on 2D surfaces. In particular, we\nquantify the influence of short-ranged pair interactions on the concentration\ndependence of the reaction rates and codify it in an empirical law. Using this\nlaw in a chemical kinetic model, we find that the the steady state behaviors of\nsimple chemical systems are drastically modified by the presence of\nconcentration dependent rates. In particular, we find that it leads to\nsuppression of intrinsic noise in dimerization reaction and destabilizes robust\noscillation in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems. In fact, we see a\ntransition from robust to fine-tuned behavior in the latter. In addition, we\nshow that concentration dependent reaction rates arise naturally in stochastic\npredator-prey systems due to intrinsic noise. We comment on the consequences of\nthese results and discuss their implications in the modeling of complex\nchemical and biological systems. In particular, we comment on the range of\nvalidity of the law of mass action, which is a staple in all theoretical\nmodeling of these systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Feb 2020 20:17:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2020 19:51:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Sarkar", "Sumantra", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.01986", "submitter": "Danielle Oliveira Costa Santos Dr.", "authors": "A.

The\nproteins needed to form and maintain flagella are synthesized in the cell body\nand transported to the distal tips. What `rulers' or `timers' a specific type\nof cells use to strike a balance between the outward and inward transport of\nmaterials so as to maintain a particular length of its flagella in the steady\nstate is one of the open questions in cellular self-organization. Even more\ncurious is how the two flagella of biflagellates, like Chlamydomonas\nReinhardtii, communicate through their base to coordinate their lengths. In\nthis paper we develop a stochastic model for flagellar length control based on\na time-of-flight (ToF) mechanism. This ToF mechanism decides whether or not\nstructural proteins are to be loaded onto an intraflagellar transport (IFT)\ntrain just before it begins its motorized journey from the base to the tip of\nthe flagellum. Because of the ongoing turnover, the structural proteins\nreleased from the flagellar tip are transported back to the cell body also by\nIFT trains. We represent the traffic of IFT trains as a totally asymmetric\nsimple exclusion process (TASEP). The ToF mechanism for each flagellum,\ntogether with the TASEP-based description of the IFT trains, combined with a\nscenario of sharing of a common pool of flagellar structural proteins in\nbiflagellates, can account for all key features of experimentally known\nphenomena. These include ciliogenesis, resorption, deflagellation as well as\nregeneration after selective amputation of one of the two flagella. We also\nshow that the experimental observations of Ishikawa and Marshall are consistent\nwith the ToF mechanism of length control if the effects of the mutual exclusion\nof the IFT trains captured by the TASEP are taken into account. Moreover, we\nmake new predictions on the flagellar length fluctuations and the role of the\ncommon pool.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Feb 2020 12:20:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2020 15:53:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Patra", "Swayamshree", ""], ["J\u00fclicher", "Frank", ""], ["Chowdhury", "Debashish", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.06717", "submitter": "Edvin Memet", "authors": "Edvin Memet, Feodor Hilitski, Zvonimir Dogic, and L.

Once a NK or T cell has identified a\ntarget cell, they form a tight contact zone, the immunological synapse (IS).\nOne then observes repolarization of the cell involving the rotation of the\nmicrotubule (MT) cytoskeleton and a movement of the microtubule organizing\ncenter (MTOC) to a position that is just underneath the plasma membrane at the\nIS. Concomitantly a massive relocation of organelles attached to MTs is\nobserved, including the Golgi apparatus, lytic granules and mitochondria. Since\nthe mechanism of this relocation is still elusive we devise a theoretical model\nfor the molecular motor driven motion of the MT cytoskeleton confined between\nmembrane and nucleus. We analyze scenarios currently discussed in the\nliterature, the cortical sliding and the capture-shrinkage mechanisms, and\ncompare quantitative predictions about the spatio-temporal evolution of MTOC\nposition and MT cytoskeleton morphology with experiments. The model predicts\nthe experimentally observed biphasic nature of the process due to an interplay\nbetween MT cytoskeleton geometry and motor forces and confirms the dominance of\nthe capture-shrinkage over the cortical sliding mechanism when MTOC and IS are\ninitially diametrically opposed. We also find that the two mechanisms act\nsynergistically, reducing the resources necessary for repositioning. The\nlocalization of dyneins in the pSMAC facilitates their interaction with the\nMTs. Our model also opens a way to infer details of the dynein distribution\nfrom the experimentally observed features of the MT cytoskeleton dynamics.
