In particular for bidirectionally\ntransported cargos it is an open question whether the characteristics of their\nmotion can result from pure stochastic fluctuations or whether some\ncoordination of the motors is needed. The results of a mean-field model of\ncargo-motors dynamics, which was proposed by M\\\"uller et al.[1] suggest the\nexistence of high motility states which would result from a stochastic\ntug-of-war. Here we analyze a non-mean field extension of their model, that\ntakes explicitly the position of each motor into account. We find that high\nmotility states then disappear. We consider also a mutual motor-motor\nactivation, as an explicit mechanism of motor coordination. We show that the\nresults of the mean-field model are recovered only in case of a strong\nmotor-motor activation in the limit of a high number of motors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Jan 2015 11:27:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Klein", "Sarah", ""], ["Appert-Rolland", "Cecile", ""], ["Santen", "Ludger", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.01465", "submitter": "Vincent Niviere", "authors": "Laurent Filisetti, Julien Valton (LCBM - UMR 5249), Marc Fontecave\n  (LCBM - UMR 5249), Vincent Nivi\\`ere (LCBM - UMR 5249)", "title": "The flavin reductase ActVB from Streptomyces coelicolor:\n  characterization of the electron transferase activity of the flavoprotein\n  form", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "FEBS Letters, Elsevier, 2005, 579, pp.2817-20", "doi": "10.1016/j.febslet.2005.04.019", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The flavin reductase ActVB is involved in the last step of actinorhodin\nbiosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor.

The Hopfield-like metabolic dynamics are stable and can be maintained\nas a long-term biochemical memory.

In the BFM, torque is generated at the interface between\ntransmembrane proteins (stators) and a rotor. It is well-established that the\npassage of ions down a transmembrane gradient through the stator complex\nprovides the energy needed for torque generation. However, the physics involved\nin this energy conversion remain poorly understood. Here we propose a\nmechanically specific model for torque generation in the BFM. In particular, we\nidentify two fundamental forces involved in torque generation: electrostatic\nand steric. We propose that electrostatic forces serve to position the stator,\nwhile steric forces comprise the actual 'power stroke'. Specifically, we\npredict that ion-induced conformational changes about a proline 'hinge' residue\nin an $\\alpha$-helix of the stator are directly responsible for generating the\npower stroke. Our model predictions fit well with recent experiments on a\nsingle-stator motor. Furthermore, we propose several experiments to elucidate\nthe torque-speed relationship in motors where the number of stators may not be\nconstant. The proposed model provides a mechanical explanation for several\nfundamental features of the flagellar motor, including: torque-speed and\nspeed-ion motive force relationships, backstepping, variation in step sizes,\nand the puzzle of swarming experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 04:07:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Mandadapu", "Kranthi K.", ""], ["Nirody", "Jasmine A.", ""], ["Berry", "Richard M.", ""], ["Oster", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02941", "submitter": "Ralf Metzler", "authors": "Aljaz Godec and Ralf Metzler", "title": "Signal focusing through active transport", "comments": "5 pages. 3 figures, includes supplementary material (2 pages)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In biological cells and novel diagnostic devices biochemical receptors need\nto be sensitive to extremely small concentration changes of signaling\nmolecules.
