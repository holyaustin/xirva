Often they accumulate at the cell poles or in the cell center. At\nthe same time, the copy number of proteins in a single cell is relatively small\nmaking the patterns noisy. To explore limits to protein patterns due to\nmolecular noise, we studied a generic mechanism for spontaneous polar protein\nassemblies in rod-shaped bacteria, which is based on cooperative binding of\nproteins to the cytoplasmic membrane. For mono-polar assemblies, we find that\nthe switching time between the two poles increases exponentially with the cell\nlength and with the protein number.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 7 May 2014 14:16:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Wettmann", "L.", ""], ["Bonny", "M.", ""], ["Kruse", "K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.2596", "submitter": "Mohammad Soltani", "authors": "Mohammad Soltani, Pavol Bokes, Zachary Fox, Abhyudai Singh", "title": "Nonspecific transcription factor binding reduces variability in\n  transcription factor and target protein expression", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures, Physical Biology", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transcription factors (TFs) interact with a multitude of binding sites on DNA\nand partner proteins inside cells. We investigate how nonspecific\nbinding/unbinding to such decoy binding sites affects the magnitude and\ntime-scale of random fluctuations in TF copy numbers arising from stochastic\ngene expression. A stochastic model of TF gene expression, together with decoy\nsite interactions is formulated. Distributions for the total (bound and\nunbound) and free (unbound) TF levels are derived by analytically solving the\nchemical master equation under physiologically relevant assumptions. Our\nresults show that increasing the number of decoy binding sides considerably\nreduces stochasticity in free TF copy numbers. The TF autocorrelation function\nreveals that decoy sites can either enhance or shorten the time-scale of TF\nfluctuations depending on model parameters. To understand how noise in TF\nabundances propagates downstream, a TF target gene is included in the model.\nIntriguingly, we find that noise in the expression of the target gene decreases\nwith increasing decoy sites for linear TF-target protein dose-responses, even\nin regimes where decoy sites enhance TF autocorrelation times. Moreover,\ncounterintuitive noise transmissions arise for nonlinear dose-responses. In\nsummary, our study highlights the critical role of molecular sequestration by\ndecoy binding sites in regulating the stochastic dynamics of TFs and target\nproteins at the single-cell level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 11 May 2014 22:48:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 19:07:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Soltani", "Mohammad", ""], ["Bokes", "Pavol", ""], ["Fox", "Zachary", ""], ["Singh", "Abhyudai", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.3958", "submitter": "Mohammad Soltani", "authors": "Mohammad Soltani, Cesar Vargas, Niraj Kumar, Rahul Kulkarni, Abhyudai\n  Singh", "title": "Moment Closure Approximations in a Genetic Negative Feedback Circuit", "comments": "6 pages, 2 figures, conference on decision and control", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Auto-regulation, a process wherein a protein negatively regulates its own\nproduction, is a common motif in gene expression networks.

Moment equations are closed\nby expressing higher-order moments as nonlinear functions of lower-order\nmoments, a technique commonly referred to as moment closure.

We show that the microtubule\nlattice itself coexists in discrete polymorphic states. Curved states can be\ninduced via a mechanical hysteresis involving torques and forces typical of few\nmolecular motors acting in unison.

Molecular motors of the\nkinesin-8 protein family depolymerise microtubules in a length-dependent\nmanner, and experimental and theoretical evidence suggest a role for kinesin-8\nin the dynamic regulation of microtubules. However, so far the detailed\nmolecular mechanisms how these molecular motors interact with the growing\nmicrotubule tip remain elusive. Here we investigate two interaction scenarios\nfor kinesin-8 and the microtubule tip. We give a comprehensive analysis of\nregimes where length-regulation is possible and characterise how the stationary\nlength depends on the biochemical rates and the bulk concentrations of the\nvarious proteins. For a neutral scenario, where microtubules grow irrespective\nof whether the microtubule tip is occupied by a molecular motor, length\nregulation is possible only for a narrow range of biochemical rates and limited\nto small polymerisation rates. In contrast, for an inhibition scenario, where\nthe presence of a motor at the microtubule tip inhibits microtubule growth, the\nregime of length regulation is extremely broad and includes high growth rates.\nThese results also apply to situations where polymerising enzymes, like\nXMAP215, and kinesin-8 mutually exclude each other from the microtubule tip. We\nalso investigate the stochastic dynamics of the two scenarios. While for the\nneutral scenario length is tightly controlled, length dynamics is intermittent\nfor the inhibition scenario and exhibits extended periods of microtubule growth\nand shrinkage, reminiscent of microtubule dynamic instability. On a broader\nperspective, the set of models established in this work quite generally\nsuggests that mutual exclusion of molecules at the ends of cytoskeletal\nfilaments is an important factor for filament dynamics and regulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 May 2014 18:24:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Reese", "Louis", ""], ["Melbinger", "Anna", ""], ["Frey", "Erwin", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7241", "submitter": "Andre Cardoso Barato", "authors": "Andre C.

We analyze three models of increasing complexity inspired by the E.\ncoli sensory network, where the external process is an external ligand\nconcentration jumping between two values. We start with a simple model for\nwhich ATP must be consumed so that a protein inside the cell can learn about\nthe external concentration. With a second model for a single receptor we show\nthat the rate at which the receptor learns about the external environment can\nbe nonzero even without any dissipation inside the cell since chemical work\ndone by the external process compensates for this learning rate. The third\nmodel is more complete, also containing adaptation. For this model we show\ninter alia that a bacterium in an environment that changes at a very slow\ntime-scale is quite inefficient, dissipating much more than it learns. Using\nthe concept of a coarse-grained learning rate, we show for the model with\nadaptation that while the activity learns about the external signal the option\nof changing the methylation level increases the concentration range for which\nthe learning rate is substantial.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2014 13:56:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 18:11:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Barato", "Andre C.", ""], ["Hartich", "David", ""], ["Seifert", "Udo", ""]]}]
