We\nevolved gene regulatory networks so that the expression of target genes\n(partial system) is insensitive to environmental changes. Then, we found the\nexpression levels of the remaining genes autonomously increase as a plastic\nresponse. Negative proportionality was observed between the average changes in\ntarget and remnant genes, reflecting reciprocity between the macroscopic\nrobustness of homeostatic genes and plasticity of regulator genes. This\nreciprocity follows the lever principle, which was satisfied throughout the\nevolutionary course, imposing an evolutionary constraint.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2020 04:44:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2020 01:36:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hatakeyama", "Tetsuhiro S.", ""], ["Kaneko", "Kunihiko", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.09844", "submitter": "Kyle Crocker", "authors": "Kyle Crocker, James London, Andr\\'es Medina, Richard Fishel, and Ralf\n  Bundschuh", "title": "Potential evolutionary advantage of a dissociative search mechanism in\n  DNA mismatch repair", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

Here, we study the probability that these complexes locate a given\ntarget site via a semi-analytic, Monte Carlo calculation that tracks the\nassociation and dissociation of the complexes. We compare such probabilities to\nthose obtained using a non-dissociative diffusive scan, and determine that for\nexperimentally observed diffusion constants, search distances, and search\ndurations $\\textit{in vitro}$, there is neither a significant advantage nor\ndisadvantage associated with the dissociative mechanism in terms of probability\nof successful search, and that both search mechanisms are highly efficient for\na majority of hemimethylated site distances. Furthermore, we examine the space\nof physically realistic diffusion constants, hemimethylated site distances, and\nassociation lifetimes and determine the regions in which dissociative searching\nis more or less efficient than non-dissociative searching. We conclude that the\ndissociative search mechanism is advantageous in the majority of the physically\nrealistic parameter space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Dec 2020 18:58:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Crocker", "Kyle", ""], ["London", "James", ""], ["Medina", "Andr\u00e9s", ""], ["Fishel", "Richard", ""], ["Bundschuh", "Ralf", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.10338", "submitter": "Vinodkumar Saranathan", "authors": "Vinodkumar Saranathan (1) and C\\'edric Finet (1) ((1) Division of\n  Science, Yale-NUS College, Singapore)", "title": "Cellular and Developmental Basis of Avian Structural Coloration", "comments": "10 pages, 2 figures, LaTeX; typos corrected; submitted to Current\n  Opinion in Genetics and Development", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.gde.2021.02.004", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph q-bio.SC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Vivid structural colors in birds are a conspicuous and vital part of their\nphenotype.
