In a previous work, we developed a model for a single actin or\nmicrotubule filament where hydrolysis occurred according to the vectorial\nmechanism: the filament could grow only from one end, and was in contact with a\nreservoir of monomers. Here we extend this approach in several ways, by\nincluding the dynamics of both ends and by comparing two possible mechanisms of\nATP hydrolysis. Our emphasis is mainly on two possible limiting models for the\nmechanism of hydrolysis within a single filament, namely the vectorial or the\nrandom model. We propose a set of experiments to test the nature of the precise\nmechanism of hydrolysis within actin filaments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 5 Aug 2009 12:39:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Jan 2010 07:04:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ranjith", "Padinhateeri", ""], ["Mallick", "Kirone", ""], ["Joanny", "Jean-Francois", ""], ["Lacoste", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.1179", "submitter": "Anatoly Smirnov", "authors": "Anatoly Yu.

In the chain of events leading to Ca2+ influx for SR reloading\nduring asynchronous Ca2+ waves in vascular smooth muscle (VSM), the physical\nand functional link between non-selective cation channels (NSCC) and Na+/Ca2+\nexchangers (NCX) needs to be elucidated in view of two recent findings: the\nidentification of the transient receptor potential canonical channel 6 (TRPC6)\nas a crucial NSCC in VSM cells and the observation of localized cytosolic [Na+]\ntransients following purinergic stimulation of these cells. Having previously\nhelped clarify the Ca2+ signalling step between NCX and SERCA behind SR Ca2+\nrefilling, this quantitative approach now allows us to model the upstream\nlinkage of NSCC and NCX. We have implemented a random walk (RW) Monte Carlo\n(MC) model with simulations mimicking a Na+ diffusion process originating at\nthe NSCC within PM-SR junctions. The model calculates the average [Na+] in the\nnanospace and also produces [Na+] profiles as a function of distance from the\nNa+ source.
