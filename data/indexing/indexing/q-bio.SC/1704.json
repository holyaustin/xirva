Human amylin oligomerizes easily and can deposit in the pancreas,\nbrain, and heart, where they have been associated with calcium dysregulation.\nIn the heart, accumulating evidence suggests that human amylin oligomers form\nmodestly cation-selective, voltage-dependent ion channels that embed in the\ncell sarcolemma (SL). The oligomers increase membrane conductance in a\ndose-dependent manner, which is correlated with elevated cytosolic calcium\n(Ca2+). Our core hypothesis therefore is that non-selective inward Ca2+\nconduction afforded by human amylin oligomers increase cytosolic and\nsarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load, which thereby magnifies intracellular\nCa2+ transients. Questions remain however regarding the mechanism of\namylin-induced Ca2+ dysregulation, including whether enhanced SL Ca2+ influx is\nsufficient to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ load, and if so, how might amplified Ca2+\ntransients perturb Ca2+-dependent cardiac pathways. To investigate these\nquestions, we modified a computational model of cardiomyocytes Ca2+ signaling\nto reflect experimentally-measured changes in SL membrane permeation and\ndecreased Sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) function\nstemming from acute and transgenic human amylin peptide exposure. With this\nmodel, we confirmed the hypothesis that increasing SL permeation alone was\nsufficient to enhance Ca2+ transient amplitudes. Our model indicated that\namplified cytosolic transients are driven by increased Ca2+ loading of the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum and may contribute to the Ca2+-dependent activation of\ncalmodulin. These findings suggest that increased membrane permeation induced\nby deposition of amylin oligomers contributes to Ca2+ dysregulation in\npre-diabetes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 15:22:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Stewart", "Bradley D.", ""], ["Scott", "Caitlin E.", ""], ["McCoy", "Thomas P.", ""], ["Yin", "Guo", ""], ["Despa", "Florin", ""], ["Despa", "Sanda", ""], ["Kekenes-Huskey", "Peter M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.03863", "submitter": "Jordan Horowitz", "authors": "Jordan M.

Characterizing the fluctuations that give rise to\nsuch rare events motivates the analysis of large deviations in stochastic\nmodels of gene expression. Recent developments in non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics have led to a framework for analyzing Markovian processes conditioned\non rare events and for representing such processes by conditioning-free driven\nMarkovian processes. We use this framework, in combination with approaches\nbased on queueing theory, to analyze a general class of stochastic models of\ngene expression. Modeling gene expression as a Batch Markovian Arrival Process\n(BMAP), we derive exact analytical results quantifying large deviations of\ntime-integrated random variables such as promoter activity fluctuations. We\nfind that the conditioning-free driven process can also be represented by a\nBMAP that has the same form as the original process, but with renormalized\nparameters. The results obtained can be used to quantify the likelihood of\nlarge deviations, to characterize system fluctuations conditional on rare\nevents and to identify combinations of model parameters that can give rise to\ndynamical phase transitions in system dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 17:54:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Horowitz", "Jordan M.", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Rahul V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.05942", "submitter": "Adam Gosztolai", "authors": "Adam Gosztolai, J\\\"org Schumacher, Volker Behrends, Jacob G Bundy,\n  Franziska Heydenreich, Mark H Bennett, Martin Buck, Mauricio Barahona", "title": "GlnK facilitates the dynamic regulation of bacterial nitrogen\n  assimilation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.bpj.2017.04.012", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ammonium assimilation in E. coli is regulated by two paralogous proteins\n(GlnB and GlnK), which orchestrate interactions with regulators of gene\nexpression, transport proteins and metabolic pathways.
