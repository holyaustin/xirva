For instance, the physics of protein\nfolding limits the lengths of cellular polypeptide chains. Consequently, many\ncellular functions are carried out not by long, isolated proteins, but rather\nby multi-protein complexes. Protein complexes themselves do not escape physical\nconstraints, one of the most important being the difficulty to assemble\nreliably in the presence of cellular noise. In order to lay the foundation for\na theory of reliable protein complex assembly, we study here an equilibrium\nthermodynamic model of self-assembly that exhibits four distinct assembly\nbehaviors: diluted protein solution, liquid mixture, \"chimeric assembly\" and\n\"multifarious assembly\". In the latter regime, different protein complexes can\ncoexist without forming erroneous chimeric structures. We show that two\nconditions have to be fulfilled to attain this regime: (i) the composition of\nthe complexes needs to be sufficiently heterogeneous, and (ii) the use of the\nset of components by the complexes has to be sparse. Our analysis of publicly\navailable databases of protein complexes indicates that cellular protein\nsystems might have indeed evolved so to satisfy both of these conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 18:31:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Sartori", "Pablo", ""], ["Leibler", "Stanislas", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.03891", "submitter": "Thierry Mora", "authors": "Gr\\'egoire Altan-Bonnet, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M.

In some cases, the host can respond\nby producing an inhibitor of that enzyme, which can be considered as a\ncounter-counter defence. An example is provided by cephalosporins,\nbeta-lactamases and clavulanic acid (an inhibitor of beta-lactamases). Here, we\ntackle the question under which conditions it pays, during evolution, to\nestablish a counter-counter defence rather than to intensify or widen the\ndefence mechanisms. We establish a mathematical model describing this\nphenomenon, based on enzyme kinetics for competitive inhibition. We use an\nobjective function based on Haber's rule, which says that the toxic effect is\nproportional to the time integral of toxin concentration. The optimal\nallocation of defence and counter-counter defence can be calculated in an\nanalytical way despite the nonlinearity in the underlying differential\nequation. The calculation provides a threshold value for the dissociation\nconstant of the inhibitor. Only if the inhibition constant is below that\nthreshold, that is, in the case of strong binding of the inhibitor, it pays to\nhave a counter-counter defence. This theoretical prediction accounts for the\nobservation that not for all defence mechanisms, a counter-counter defence\nexists. Our results should be of interest for computing optimal mixtures of\nbeta-lactam antibiotics and beta-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, as\nwell as for plant-herbivore and other molecular-ecological interactions and to\nfight antibiotic resistance in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Jul 2019 16:35:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Schuster", "Stefan", ""], ["Ewald", "Jan", ""], ["Dandekar", "Thomas", ""], ["D\u00fchring", "Sybille", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.04977", "submitter": "Andreana Rosnik", "authors": "Andreana M.

Our model of intracellular\ntransport solves for the time evolution of a probability distribution of cargo\nthat is transported by passive diffusion in the bulk cytoplasm and driven by\nmotors on explicitly rendered, polar cytoskeletal filaments with random\norientations. We show that depending on the lengths and polarizations of\nfilaments in the network, dynamic sequestering regions can form in different\nregions of the cell. Furthermore, we find that, for certain parameters, the\nresidence time of cargo is non-monotonic with increasing filament length,\nindicating an optimal regime for dynamic sequestration that is potentially\ntunable via filament length.

In these scenarios, the more relevant\ntimescale is the FPT of the first Brownian searcher to reach a target from a\nlarge group of independent and identical Brownian searchers. Though the\nsearchers are identically distributed, one searcher will reach the target\nbefore the others and will thus have the fastest FPT.

In this paper, we use rigorous\nprobabilistic methods to study this fastest FPT. We determine the asymptotic\nbehavior of all the moments of this fastest FPT in the limit of many searchers\nin a general class of two- and three-dimensional domains.

While decades of experimental work have uncovered four fundamental\nprocesses that regulate organelle biogenesis, namely, de novo synthesis,\nfission, fusion and decay, a comprehensive understanding of how these processes\ntogether control organelle abundance remains elusive. Recent fluorescence\nmicroscopy experiments allow for the counting of organelles at the single-cell\nlevel. These measurements provide information about the cell-to-cell\nvariability in organelle abundance in addition to the mean level. Motivated by\nsuch measurements, we build upon a recent study and analyze a general\nstochastic model of organelle biogenesis. We compute the exact analytical\nexpressions for the probability distribution of organelle numbers, their mean,\nand variance across a population of single cells. It is shown that different\nmechanisms of organelle biogenesis lead to distinct signatures in the\ndistribution of organelle numbers which allows us to discriminate between these\nvarious mechanisms. By comparing our theory against published data for\nperoxisome abundance measurements in yeast, we show that a widely believed\nmodel of peroxisome biogenesis that involves de novo synthesis, fission, and\ndecay is inadequate in explaining the data. Also, our theory predicts\nbimodality in certain limits of the model.
