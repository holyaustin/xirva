The multiscale structure of the observed process is\nrepresented frequency-by-frequency and the concept of the multiscale ratio is\nintroduced to quantify the bias in the realized integrated volatility due to\nthe observation error. The multiscale ratio is estimated from a single sample\npath, and a frequency-by-frequency bias correction procedure is proposed, which\nsimultaneously reduces variance. We extend the method to include correlated\nobservation errors and provide the implied time domain form of the estimation\nprocedure. The new method is implemented to estimate the integrated volatility\nfor the Heston and other models, and the improved performance of our method\nover existing methods is illustrated by simulation studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 09:06:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 19 Apr 2009 11:51:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Olhede", "Sofia", ""], ["Sykulski", "Adam", ""], ["Pavliotis", "Grigorios", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.0966", "submitter": "Michael Hahsler", "authors": "Michael Hahsler and Kurt Hornik", "title": "New probabilistic interest measures for association rules", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Intelligent Data Analysis, 11(5):437-455, 2007", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DB stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mining association rules is an important technique for discovering meaningful\npatterns in transaction databases. Many different measures of interestingness\nhave been proposed for association rules. However, these measures fail to take\nthe probabilistic properties of the mined data into account. In this paper, we\nstart with presenting a simple probabilistic framework for transaction data\nwhich can be used to simulate transaction data when no associations are\npresent. We use such data and a real-world database from a grocery outlet to\nexplore the behavior of confidence and lift, two popular interest measures used\nfor rule mining. The results show that confidence is systematically influenced\nby the frequency of the items in the left hand side of rules and that lift\nperforms poorly to filter random noise in transaction data. Based on the\nprobabilistic framework we develop two new interest measures, hyper-lift and\nhyper-confidence, which can be used to filter or order mined association rules.\nThe new measures show significantly better performance than lift for\napplications where spurious rules are problematic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Mar 2008 20:17:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hahsler", "Michael", ""], ["Hornik", "Kurt", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.1628", "submitter": "Janne Sinkkonen", "authors": "Janne Sinkkonen, Janne Aukia and Samuel Kaski", "title": "Component models for large networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Being among the easiest ways to find meaningful structure from discrete data,\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and related component models have been\napplied widely.

We\nintroduce an alternative, interaction component model for communities (ICMc),\nwhere the whole network is a bag of links, stemming from different components.\nThe former finds both disassortative and assortative structure, while the\nalternative assumes assortativity and finds community-like structures like the\nearlier methods motivated by physics.
