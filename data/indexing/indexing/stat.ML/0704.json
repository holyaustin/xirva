In particular, we look at the error rates and power of some multi-stage\nregression methods. In the first stage we fit a set of candidate models. In the\nsecond stage we select one model by cross-validation. In the third stage we use\nhypothesis testing to eliminate some variables. We refer to the first two\nstages as \"screening\" and the last stage as \"cleaning.\" We consider three\nscreening methods: the lasso, marginal regression, and forward stepwise\nregression. Our method gives consistent variable selection under certain\nconditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Apr 2007 17:52:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2009 14:17:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wasserman", "Larry", ""], ["Roeder", "Kathryn", ""]]}]
