Chow and Liu established that ML-estimation\nreduces to the construction of a maximum-weight spanning tree using the\nempirical mutual information quantities as the edge weights. Using the theory\nof large-deviations, we analyze the exponent associated with the error\nprobability of the event that the ML-estimate of the Markov tree structure\ndiffers from the true tree structure, given a set of independently drawn\nsamples. By exploiting the fact that the output of ML-estimation is a tree, we\nestablish that the error exponent is equal to the exponential rate of decay of\na single dominant crossover event. We prove that in this dominant crossover\nevent, a non-neighbor node pair replaces a true edge of the distribution that\nis along the path of edges in the true tree graph connecting the nodes in the\nnon-neighbor pair. Using ideas from Euclidean information theory, we then\nanalyze the scenario of ML-estimation in the very noisy learning regime and\nshow that the error exponent can be approximated as a ratio, which is\ninterpreted as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for learning tree distributions.\nWe show via numerical experiments that in this regime, our SNR approximation is\naccurate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 May 2009 01:40:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Oct 2010 03:40:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 21 Nov 2010 16:27:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Vincent Y.

The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we\nare not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in\nthe meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach\nto speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden\nMarkov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006)\n1566--1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio\ndata---creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them---we describe\nan augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate.\nWe also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission\ndistributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to\nrealistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a\ntruncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full\nstate sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST\ndata set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields\nstate-of-the-art speaker diarization results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 18:06:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2009 13:26:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 11 Aug 2010 22:50:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 16 Aug 2011 09:16:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fox", "Emily B.", ""], ["Sudderth", "Erik B.", ""], ["Jordan", "Michael I.", ""], ["Willsky", "Alan S.", ""]]}]
