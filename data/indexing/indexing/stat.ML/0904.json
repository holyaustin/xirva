It is efficient when the number of unknown\nvariables is much larger than the number of observations because of the dual\nformulation. Moreover, the primal variable is explicitly updated and the\nsparsity in the solution is exploited. Numerical comparison with the\nstate-of-the-art algorithms shows that the proposed algorithm is favorable when\nthe design matrix is poorly conditioned or dense and very large.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 3 Apr 2009 14:32:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tomioka", "Ryota", ""], ["Sugiyama", "Masashi", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.0776", "submitter": "Vivien Robinet", "authors": "Vivien Robinet (Leibniz - IMAG, TIMC), Gilles Bisson (Leibniz - IMAG,\n  TIMC), Mirta B.

The key idea\nis to identify which variables are exogenous based on non-Gaussianity instead\nof estimating the entire structure of the model. Exogenous variables work as\ntriggers that activate a causal chain in the model, and their identification\nleads to more efficient experimental designs and better understanding of the\ncausal mechanism.
