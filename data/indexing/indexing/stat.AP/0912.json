To address the question\nof whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience\nhypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified\nversion of supervenience (called epsilon-supervenience) that is amenable to\nexperimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this\napproach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the\nprobabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided\ndetermination of epsilon-supervenience. The physical property of the brain\nemployed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the\nbrain-graph or connectome). epsilon-supervenience allows us to determine\nwhether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to\nwithin any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the\nrelationship between the two. This may provide motivation for\ncross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Dec 2009 06:01:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Feb 2011 21:29:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 6 Aug 2011 00:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Vogelstein", "Joshua T.", ""], ["Vogelstein", "R.
