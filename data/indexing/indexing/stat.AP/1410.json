One setting in which this is\nparticularly true is cluster-randomized trial designs. However, Monte Carlo\napproaches are useful in many additional settings as well.

The proposed model takes\ninto account as quantile predictors both the lagged values of the estimated\nvolatility and some key macroeconomic and financial variables, which provide\nimportant information about the overall market trend and risk. In this way, and\nwithout distributional assumptions on the realized range innovations, it is\npossible to assess the entire conditional distribution of the estimated\nvolatility. This issue is a critical one for financial decision-makers in terms\nof pricing, asset allocation, and risk management. The quantile regression\napproach allows how the links among the involved variables change across the\nquantiles levels to be analyzed. In addition, a rolling analysis is performed\nin order to determine how the relationships that characterize the proposed\nmodel evolve over time. The analysis is applied to sixteen stocks issued by\ncompanies that operate in differing economic sectors of the U.S. market, and\nthe forecast accuracy is validated by means of suitable tests. The results show\nevidence of the selected variables' relevant impacts and, particularly during\nperiods of market stress, highlights heterogeneous effects across quantiles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 15:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bonaccolto", "Giovanni", ""], ["Caporin", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.7056", "submitter": "Rebecca Steorts", "authors": "Rebecca C.

We develop a data-driven method for solving\nthe classification problem, where syndrome types are identified and quantified\nbased on patterns detected in unlabeled symptom survey data.\n  Method: Latent class analysis (LCA) has been applied in WM research to solve\na similar problem, i.e., to identify subtypes of a patient population in the\nabsence of a gold standard. A widely known weakness of LCA is that it makes an\nunrealistically strong independence assumption. We relax the assumption by\nfirst detecting symptom co-occurrence patterns from survey data and use those\npatterns instead of the symptoms as features for LCA. Results: The result of\nthe investigation is a six-step method: Data collection, symptom co-occurrence\npattern discovery, pattern interpretation, syndrome identification, syndrome\ntype identification, and syndrome type classification. A software package\ncalled Lantern is developed to support the application of the method. The\nmethod is illustrated using a data set on Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment\n(VMCI).\n  Conclusions: A data-driven method for TCM syndrome identification and\nclassification is presented. The method can be used to answer the following\nquestions about a Western medicine disease: What TCM syndrome types are there\namong the patients with the disease?
