To answer this question, DNA analysts typically use\nrelative frequencies, random-match probabilities or likelihood ratios. They\ncompute these quantities for the major racial or ethnic groups in the United\nStates, supplying prosecutors with such mind-boggling figures as ``one in nine\nhundred and fifty sextillion African Americans, one in one hundred and thirty\nseptillion Caucasians, and one in nine hundred and thirty sextillion\nHispanics.\" In People v. Prince, a California Court of Appeals rejected this\npractice on the theory that only the perpetrator's race is relevant to the\ncrime; hence, it is impermissible to introduce statistics about other races.\nThis paper critiques this reasoning. Relying on the concept of likelihood, it\npresents a logical justification for referring to a range of races and\nidentifies some problems with the one-race-only rule. The paper also notes some\nways to express the probative value of a DNA match quantitatively without\nreferring to variations in DNA profile frequencies among races or ethnic\ngroups.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2008 09:01:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Kaye", "David H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3032", "submitter": "Philip B.

To define and quantify `chance success' is\nknotty. Some null hypotheses ascribe chance to the Earth: Seismicity is modeled\nas random. The null distribution of the number of successful predictions -- or\nany other test statistic -- is taken to be its distribution when the fixed set\nof predictions is applied to random seismicity. Such tests tacitly assume that\nthe predictions do not depend on the observed seismicity. Conditioning on the\npredictions in this way sets a low hurdle for statistical significance.\nConsider this scheme: When an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 or greater occurs\nanywhere in the world, predict that an earthquake at least as large will occur\nwithin 21 days and within an epicentral distance of 50 km. We apply this rule\nto the Harvard centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) catalog for 2000--2004 to generate\na set of predictions. The null hypothesis is that earthquake times are\nexchangeable conditional on their magnitudes and locations and on the\npredictions--a common ``nonparametric'' assumption in the literature. We\ngenerate random seismicity by permuting the times of events in the CMT catalog.\nWe consider an event successfully predicted only if (i) it is predicted and\n(ii) there is no larger event within 50 km in the previous 21 days. The\n$P$-value for the observed success rate is $<0.001$: The method successfully\npredicts about 5% of earthquakes, far better than `chance,' because the\npredictor exploits the clustering of earthquakes -- occasional foreshocks --\nwhich the null hypothesis lacks. Rather than condition on the predictions and\nuse a stochastic model for seismicity, it is preferable to treat the observed\nseismicity as fixed, and to compare the success rate of the predictions to the\nsuccess rate of simple-minded predictions like those just described. If the\nproffered predictions do no better than a simple scheme, they have little\nvalue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 May 2008 09:25:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Luen", "Brad", ""], ["Stark", "Philip B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3043", "submitter": "Persi Diaconis", "authors": "Persi Diaconis, Julia Salzman", "title": "Projection pursuit for discrete data", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/193940307000000482 the IMS\n  Collections (http://www.imstat.org/publications/imscollections.htm) by the\n  Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "IMS Collections 2008, Vol. 2, 265-288", "doi": "10.1214/193940307000000482", "report-no": "IMS-COLL2-IMSCOLL215", "categories": "math.ST stat.AP stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops projection pursuit for discrete data using the discrete\nRadon transform.
