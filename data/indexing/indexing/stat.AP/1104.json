Water\nsupply systems are studied as spatially organized networks for which the\npractical applications of abstract evaluation methods are critically evaluated.\nEmpirical data from benchmark networks are used to study the interplay between\nnetwork structure and operational efficiency, reliability and robustness.\nStructural measurements are undertaken to quantify properties such as\nredundancy and optimal-connectivity, herein proposed as constraints in network\ndesign optimization problems. The role of the supply-demand structure towards\nsystem efficiency is studied and an assessment of the vulnerability to failures\nbased on the disconnection of nodes from the source(s) is undertaken. The\nabsence of conventional degree-based hubs (observed through uncorrelated\nnon-heterogeneous sparse topologies) prompts an alternative approach to\nstudying structural vulnerability based on the identification of network\ncut-sets and optimal connectivity invariants.

A widely studied \\emph{perturbation-based PPDM}\napproach introduces random perturbation to individual values to preserve\nprivacy before data is published. Previous solutions of this approach are\nlimited in their tacit assumption of single-level trust on data miners.\n  In this work, we relax this assumption and expand the scope of\nperturbation-based PPDM to Multi-Level Trust (MLT-PPDM). In our setting, the\nmore trusted a data miner is, the less perturbed copy of the data it can\naccess. Under this setting, a malicious data miner may have access to\ndifferently perturbed copies of the same data through various means, and may\ncombine these diverse copies to jointly infer additional information about the\noriginal data that the data owner does not intend to release. Preventing such\n\\emph{diversity attacks} is the key challenge of providing MLT-PPDM services.\nWe address this challenge by properly correlating perturbation across copies at\ndifferent trust levels. We prove that our solution is robust against diversity\nattacks with respect to our privacy goal. That is, for data miners who have\naccess to an arbitrary collection of the perturbed copies, our solution prevent\nthem from jointly reconstructing the original data more accurately than the\nbest effort using any individual copy in the collection. Our solution allows a\ndata owner to generate perturbed copies of its data for arbitrary trust levels\non-demand.

Reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) allows the\nanalyst to minimize some cost function while ensuring some minimal performances\ncast as admissible failure probabilities for a set of performance functions. In\norder to address real-world engineering problems in which the performance is\nassessed through computational models (e.g., finite element models in\nstructural mechanics) metamodeling techniques have been developed in the past\ndecade. This paper introduces adaptive Kriging surrogate models to solve the\nRBDO problem. The latter is cast in an augmented space that \"sums up\" the range\nof the design space and the aleatory uncertainty in the design parameters and\nthe environmental conditions. The surrogate model is used (i) for evaluating\nrobust estimates of the failure probabilities (and for enhancing the\ncomputational experimental design by adaptive sampling) in order to achieve the\nrequested accuracy and (ii) for applying a gradient-based optimization\nalgorithm to get optimal values of the design parameters. The approach is\napplied to the optimal design of ring-stiffened cylindrical shells used in\nsubmarine engineering under uncertain geometric imperfections. For this\napplication the performance of the structure is related to buckling which is\naddressed here by means of a finite element solution based on the asymptotic\nnumerical method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Apr 2011 13:33:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 14:19:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dubourg", "V.", ""], ["Bourinet", "J. -M.", ""], ["Sudret", "B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.3503", "submitter": "Arnab Chakraborty", "authors": "Arnab Chakraborty", "title": "RESID: A Practical Stochastic Model for Software Reliability", "comments": "13 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.SE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A new approach called RESID is proposed in this paper for estimating\nreliability of a software allowing for imperfect debugging.

This model leads to \\emph{linear} state and measurement equations,\nwhich bypass data association and can afford state estimation via\nsparsity-aware Kalman filtering (KF). Leveraging the grid-induced sparsity of\nthe novel model, two types of sparsity-cognizant TSSG-KF trackers are\ndeveloped: one effects sparsity through $\\ell_1$-norm regularization, and the\nother invokes sparsity as an extra measurement. Iterative extended KF and\nGauss-Newton algorithms are developed for reduced-complexity tracking, along\nwith accurate error covariance updates for assessing performance of the\nresultant sparsity-aware state estimators. Based on TSSG state estimates, more\ninformative target position and track estimates can be obtained in a follow-up\nstep, ensuring that track association and position estimation errors do not\npropagate back into TSSG state estimates. The novel TSSG trackers do not\nrequire knowing the number of targets or their signal strengths, and exhibit\nconsiderably lower complexity than the benchmark hidden Markov model filter,\nespecially for a large number of targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate\nthat sparsity-cognizant trackers enjoy improved root mean-square error\nperformance at reduced complexity when compared to their sparsity-agnostic\ncounterparts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 03:39:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Farahmand", "Shahrokh", ""], ["Giannakis", "Georgios B.", ""], ["Leus", "Geert", ""], ["Tian", "Zhi", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5429", "submitter": "Caroline Berard", "authors": "Caroline B\\'erard, Marie-Laure Martin-Magniette, V\\'eronique Brunaud,\n  S\\'ebastien Aubourg and St\\'ephane Robin", "title": "Unsupervised Classification for Tiling Arrays: ChIP-chip and\n  Transcriptome", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME q-bio.GN q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Tiling arrays make possible a large scale exploration of the genome thanks to\nprobes which cover the whole genome with very high density until 2 000 000\nprobes. Biological questions usually addressed are either the expression\ndifference between two conditions or the detection of transcribed regions. In\nthis work we propose to consider simultaneously both questions as an\nunsupervised classification problem by modeling the joint distribution of the\ntwo conditions. In contrast to previous methods, we account for all available\ninformation on the probes as well as biological knowledge like annotation and\nspatial dependence between probes. Since probes are not biologically relevant\nunits we propose a classification rule for non-connected regions covered by\nseveral probes. Applications to transcriptomic and ChIP-chip data of\nArabidopsis thaliana obtained with a NimbleGen tiling array highlight the\nimportance of a precise modeling and the region classification.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 15:42:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00e9rard", "Caroline", ""], ["Martin-Magniette", "Marie-Laure", ""], ["Brunaud", "V\u00e9ronique", ""], ["Aubourg", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Robin", "St\u00e9phane", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5674", "submitter": "Stanley Lazic", "authors": "Stanley E.

This is partly due to the difficulty of manipulating\nlevels of neurogenesis without inducing off-target effects, which might also\ninfluence behaviour. In addition, the analytical methods typically used do not\ndirectly test whether neurogenesis mediates the effect of an intervention on\nbehaviour. Previous studies may have incorrectly attributed changes in\nbehavioural performance to neurogenesis because the role of known (or unknown)\nneurogenesis-independent mechanisms were not formally taken into consideration\nduring the analysis. Causal models can tease apart complex causal relationships\nand were used to demonstrate that the effect of exercise on pattern separation\nis via neurogenesis-independent mechanisms. Many studies in the neurogenesis\nliterature would benefit from the use of statistical methods that can separate\nneurogenesis-dependent from neurogenesis-independent effects on behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Apr 2011 16:32:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 7 Sep 2011 20:35:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Lazic", "Stanley E.", ""]]}]
