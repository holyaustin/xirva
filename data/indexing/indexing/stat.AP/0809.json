Value-at-Risk is a\nstandard tool to measure and control the market risk of an asset or a\nportfolio, and it is also required for regulatory purposes. Its popularity is\npartly due to the fact that it is an easily understood measure of risk. The use\nof Product Partition Models allows us to remain in a Normal setting even in\npresence of outlying points, and to obtain a closed-form expression for\nValue-at-Risk computation. We present and compare two different scenarios: a\nproduct partition structure on the vector of means and a product partition\nstructure on the vector of variances. We apply our methodology to an Italian\nstock market data set from Mib30. The numerical results clearly show that\nProduct Partition Models can be successfully exploited in order to quantify\nmarket risk exposure. The obtained Value-at-Risk estimates are in full\nagreement with Maximum Likelihood approaches, but our methodology provides\nricher information about the clustering structure of the data and the presence\nof outlying points.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Sep 2008 13:45:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 13:08:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-15", "authors_parsed": [["Bormetti", "Giacomo", ""], ["De Giuli", "Maria Elena", ""], ["Delpini", "Danilo", ""], ["Tarantola", "Claudia", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.0387", "submitter": "Simon Barthelm\\'e", "authors": "Simon Barthelm\\'e and Pascal Mamassian", "title": "A flexible Bayesian method for adaptive measurement in psychophysics", "comments": "28 pages, 15 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  In psychophysical experiments time and the limited goodwill of participants\nis usually a major constraint.

For these complex problems, many of the required calculations\ncannot be done analytically, and so Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms have\nbeen used.

The assumption of independence of time to commit each type of crimes is\nrelaxed so that the association of the time to recidivism between any two types\nof crimes can be evaluated. We found that the correlation of time to recidivism\nbetween sex crimes and violent crimes are more correlated than other pairs.\nProbability of experiencing a charged arrest of other crimes is greater than a\ncharged arrest of violent crimes followed by a charged arrest of sex crimes for\nan individual after release.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Sep 2008 13:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-01", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "Jenq-Daw", ""], ["Lee", "Cheng K.", ""]]}]
