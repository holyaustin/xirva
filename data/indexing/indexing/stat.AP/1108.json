Our work addresses analysis of stellar reflex\nmotion data, where a planet is detected by observing the \"wobble\" of its host\nstar as it responds to the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Newtonian\nmechanics specifies an analytical model for the resulting time series, but it\nis strongly nonlinear, yielding complex, multimodal likelihood functions; it is\neven more complex when multiple planets are present. The parameter spaces range\nin size from few-dimensional to dozens of dimensions, depending on the number\nof planets in the system, and the type of motion measured (line-of-sight\nvelocity, or position on the sky). Since orbits are periodic, Bayesian\ngeneralizations of periodogram methods facilitate the analysis. This relies on\nthe model being linearly separable, enabling partial analytical\nmarginalization, reducing the dimension of the parameter space. Subsequent\nanalysis uses adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and adaptive importance\nsampling to perform the integrals required for both inference (planet detection\nand orbit measurement), and information-maximizing sequential design (for\nadaptive scheduling of observations).

Much of these data are quantitative image data, which are\ncharacterized by intensities that represent some measurement of interest in the\nscanned images. The data typically consist of multiple images on the same\ndomain and the goal of the research is to combine the quantitative information\nacross images to make inference about populations or interventions. In this\npaper we present a unified analysis framework for the analysis of quantitative\nimage data using a Bayesian functional mixed model approach. This framework is\nflexible enough to handle complex, irregular images with many local features,\nand can model the simultaneous effects of multiple factors on the image\nintensities and account for the correlation between images induced by the\ndesign. We introduce a general isomorphic modeling approach to fitting the\nfunctional mixed model, of which the wavelet-based functional mixed model is\none special case. With suitable modeling choices, this approach leads to\nefficient calculations and can result in flexible modeling and adaptive\nsmoothing of the salient features in the data. The proposed method has the\nfollowing advantages: it can be run automatically, it produces inferential\nplots indicating which regions of the image are associated with each factor, it\nsimultaneously considers the practical and statistical significance of\nfindings, and it controls the false discovery rate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Aug 2011 07:40:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Morris", "Jeffrey S.", ""], ["Baladandayuthapani", "Veerabhadran", ""], ["Herrick", "Richard C.", ""], ["Sanna", "Pietro", ""], ["Gutstein", "Howard", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4739", "submitter": "Robert B.
