The traditional approach to study a distribution relies on\nlocating its mean point and finding the dispersion about that point. On a\ngeneral manifold however, even if two distributions are sufficiently\nconcentrated and have unique means, a comparison of their covariances is not\npossible due to the difference in local parametrizations. To circumvent the\nproblem we associate a covariance field with each distribution and compare them\nat common points by applying a similarity invariant function on their\nrepresenting matrices. In this way we are able to define distances between\ndistributions. We also propose new approach for interpolating discrete\ndistributions and derive some criteria that assure consistent results.

Hand tallies of the votes in a random sample of\nprecincts can be used to test the hypothesis that a full manual recount would\nfind a different outcome. This paper develops a conservative sequential test\nbased on the vote-counting errors found in a hand tally of a simple or\nstratified random sample of precincts. The procedure includes a natural\nescalation: If the hypothesis that the apparent outcome is incorrect is not\nrejected at stage $s$, more precincts are audited. Eventually, either the\nhypothesis is rejected--and the apparent outcome is confirmed--or all precincts\nhave been audited and the true outcome is known. The test uses a priori bounds\non the overstatement of the margin that could result from error in each\nprecinct. Such bounds can be derived from the reported counts in each precinct\nand upper bounds on the number of votes cast in each precinct. The test allows\nerrors in different precincts to be treated differently to reflect voting\ntechnology or precinct sizes. It is not optimal, but it is conservative: the\nchance of erroneously confirming the outcome of a contest if a full manual\nrecount would show a different outcome is no larger than the nominal\nsignificance level. The approach also gives a conservative $P$-value for the\nhypothesis that a full manual recount would find a different outcome, given the\nerrors found in a fixed size sample. This is illustrated with two contests from\nNovember, 2006: the U.S. Senate race in Minnesota and a school board race for\nthe Sausalito Marin City School District in California, a small contest in\nwhich voters could vote for up to three candidates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jul 2008 06:54:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Stark", "Philip B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4011", "submitter": "Fionn Murtagh", "authors": "Fionn Murtagh", "title": "Discussion of: Treelets--An adaptive multi-Scale basis for sparse\n  unordered data", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOAS137A the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, No. 2, 472-473", "doi": "10.1214/08-AOAS137A", "report-no": "IMS-AOAS-AOAS137A", "categories": "stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Discussion of \"Treelets--An adaptive multi-Scale basis for sparse unordered\ndata\" [arXiv:0707.0481]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jul 2008 07:15:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Murtagh", "Fionn", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.4016", "submitter": "Peter J.

However, the analysis of qMRI has been\nlimited to ad-hoc heuristic methods. Our research provides a powerful\nstatistical framework for image analysis and sheds light on future localized\nadaptive treatment regimes tailored to the individual's response. We assume in\nan imperfect world we only observe a blurred and noisy version of the\nunderlying pathological/physiological changes via qMRI, due to measurement\nerrors or unpredictable influences. We use a hidden Markov random field to\nmodel the spatial dependence in the data and develop a maximum likelihood\napproach via the Expectation--Maximization algorithm with stochastic variation.\nAn important improvement over previous work is the assessment of variability in\nparameter estimation, which is the valid basis for statistical inference. More\nimportantly, we focus on the expected changes rather than image segmentation.\nOur research has shown that the approach is powerful in both simulation studies\nand on a real dataset, while quite robust in the presence of some model\nassumption violations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 14:09:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xiaoxi", ""], ["Johnson", "Timothy D.", ""], ["Little", "Roderick J.

I\ndiscuss how this result did not appear in a previous analysis of the PBDB. The\nexistence of the 63 My periodicity, despite very different treatment of\nsystematic error in both PBDB and Sepkoski databases strongly argues for\nconsideration of its reality in the fossil record. Cross-spectral analysis of\nthe two datasets finds that a 62 My periodicity coincides in phase by 1.6 My,\nequivalent to better than the errors in either measurement. Consequently, the\ntwo data sets not only contain the same strong periodicity, but its peaks and\nvalleys closely correspond in time. Two other spectral peaks appear in the PBDB\nanalysis, but appear to be artifacts associated with detrending and with the\nincreased interval length. Sampling-standardization procedures implemented by\nthe PBDB collaboration suggest that the signal is not an artifact of sampling\nbias. Further work should focus on finding the cause of the 62 My periodicity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jul 2008 20:01:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2008 14:23:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 26 Sep 2008 19:56:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 25 Nov 2008 13:36:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sat, 13 Dec 2008 23:51:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Wed, 24 Dec 2008 14:59:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Melott", "Adrian L.", "", "University of Kansas"]]}, {"id": "0807.4969", "submitter": "Brendon Brewer", "authors": "Brendon J.

At the present time it is safe to say that\nwe do not have much of an idea as to whether life is common or exceedingly rare\nin the universe, and this will probably not be solved for certain unless\ndefinitive evidence of extraterrestrial life is found in the future. Our\npresence on Earth is just as consistent with the hypothesis that life is\nextremely rare as it is with the hypothesis that it is common, since if there\nwas only one planet with intelligent life, we would find ourselves on it.\nHowever, we have more information than this, such as the the surprisingly short\nlength of time it took for life to arise on Earth. Previous authors have\nanalysed this information, concluding that it is evidence that the probability\nof abiogenesis is moderate ($>$ 13% with 95% probability) and cannot be\nextremely small. In this paper I use simple probabilistic model to show that\nthis conclusion was based more on an unintentional assumption than on the data.\nWhile the early formation of life on Earth provides some evidence in the\ndirection of life being common, it is far from conclusive, and in particular\ndoes not rule out the possibility that abiogenesis has only occurred once in\nthe history of the universe.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2008 01:37:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Brewer", "Brendon J.", ""]]}]
