A typical goal is\nthe comparison of gene expression between two conditions (e.g., diseased vs.\nnondiseased) to detect genes which show differential expression. Classical\nhypothesis testing procedures have been applied to this problem and more recent\nwork has employed sophisticated models that allow for the sharing of\ninformation across genes. However, many recent gene expression studies have an\nexperimental design with several conditions that requires an even more involved\nhypothesis testing approach. In this paper, we use a hierarchical Bayesian\nmodel to address the situation where there are many hypotheses that must be\nsimultaneously tested for each gene. In addition to having many hypotheses\nwithin each gene, our analysis also addresses the more typical multiple\ncomparison issue of testing many genes simultaneously. We illustrate our\napproach with an application to a study of genes involved in obstructive sleep\napnea in humans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Mar 2009 20:28:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2009 14:04:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-08", "authors_parsed": [["Jensen", "Shane T.", ""], ["Erkan", "Ibrahim", ""], ["Arnardottir", "Erna S.", ""], ["Small", "Dylan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.0507", "submitter": "Peter Boden", "authors": "Peter Boden, Phil Rees", "title": "Using administrative data to improve the estimation of immigration to\n  local areas in England", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  International migration is now a significant driver of population change\nacross Europe but the methods available to estimate its true impact upon\nsub-national areas remain inconsistent, constrained by inadequate systems of\nmeasurement and data capture.

Most fMRI analyses via GLM\nproceed in a massively univariate fashion where the same design matrix is used\nfor analyzing data from each voxel.

By enabling the capture of multiple profiles of interest using a\nsingle contrast (as opposed to an F-test) in a way that optimizes for both bias\nand variance enables the passing of first level parameter estimates and their\nvariances to the higher level for group analysis which is not possible using\nF-tests.
