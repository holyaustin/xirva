This Whittle likelihood is a large sample approximation to the\ndistribution of the periodogram over a chosen grid of frequencies, and\nconstitutes an approximation to the time-domain likelihood of the data, via the\nlinear transformation of an inverse discrete Fourier transform combined with a\ndemodulation.

Numerical ocean models are essential for creating\nstorm surge forecasts for coastal areas. These models are driven primarily by\nthe surface wind forcings. Currently, the gridded wind fields used by ocean\nmodels are specified by deterministic formulas that are based on the central\npressure and location of the storm center. While these equations incorporate\nimportant physical knowledge about the structure of hurricane surface wind\nfields, they cannot always capture the asymmetric and dynamic nature of a\nhurricane.

The number of variables hopefully can be reduced, by using either\nprojection techniques or selection methods; the latter allow for the\ninterpretation of the selected variables. Since the optimal approach of testing\nall possible subsets of variables with the prediction model is intractable, an\nincremental selection approach using a nonparametric statistics is a good\noption, as it avoids the computationally intensive use of the model itself. It\nhas two drawbacks however: the number of groups of variables to test is still\nhuge, and colinearities can make the results unstable. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper presents a method to select groups of spectral\nvariables. It consists in a forward-backward procedure applied to the\ncoefficients of a B-Spline representation of the spectra. The criterion used in\nthe forward-backward procedure is the mutual information, allowing to find\nnonlinear dependencies between variables, on the contrary of the generally used\ncorrelation. The spline representation is used to get interpretability of the\nresults, as groups of consecutive spectral variables will be selected. The\nexperiments conducted on NIR spectra from fescue grass and diesel fuels show\nthat the method provides clearly identified groups of selected variables,\nmaking interpretation easy, while keeping a low computational load.

When multiple\nco-evolving data streams are observed, an important task is to determine how\nthese streams depend on each other, accounting for dynamic dependence patterns\nwithout imposing any restrictive probabilistic law governing this dependence.\nIn this paper we argue that flexible least squares (FLS), a penalized version\nof ordinary least squares that accommodates for time-varying regression\ncoefficients, can be deployed successfully in this context. Our motivating\napplication is statistical arbitrage, an investment strategy that exploits\npatterns detected in financial data streams. We demonstrate that FLS is\nalgebraically equivalent to the well-known Kalman filter equations, and take\nadvantage of this equivalence to gain a better understanding of FLS and suggest\na more efficient algorithm. Promising experimental results obtained from a\nFLS-based algorithmic trading system for the S&P 500 Futures Index are\nreported.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2007 15:25:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Montana", "Giovanni", ""], ["Triantafyllopoulos", "Kostas", ""], ["Tsagaris", "Theodoros", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.4166", "submitter": "Massimo Bilancia", "authors": "Massimo Bilancia, Girolamo Stea", "title": "Timescale effect estimation in time-series studies of air pollution and\n  health: A Singular Spectrum Analysis approach", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/07-EJS123 the Electronic\n  Journal of Statistics (http://www.i-journals.org/ejs/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Electronic Journal of Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, 432-453", "doi": "10.1214/07-EJS123", "report-no": "IMS-EJS-EJS_2007_123", "categories": "stat.AP", "license": null, "abstract": "  A wealth of epidemiological data suggests an association between\nmortality/morbidity from pulmonary and cardiovascular adverse events and air\npollution, but uncertainty remains as to the extent implied by those\nassociations although the abundance of the data.
