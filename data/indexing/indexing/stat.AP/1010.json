In\nthis article we present some elementary statistical considerations which\nclearly show that in case of complex traits the approach based on multiple\nregression or generalized linear models is preferable to multiple testing. We\nintroduce a model selection approach to GWAS based on modifications of Bayesian\nInformation Criterion (BIC) and develop some simple search strategies to deal\nwith the huge number of potential models. Comprehensive simulations based on\nreal SNP data confirm that model selection has larger power than multiple\ntesting to detect causal SNPs in complex models. On the other hand multiple\ntesting has substantial problems with proper ranking of causal SNPs and tends\nto detect a certain number of false positive SNPs, which are not linked to any\nof the causal mutations. We show that this behavior is typical in GWAS for\ncomplex traits and can be explained by an aggregated influence of many small\nrandom sample correlations between genotypes of a SNP under investigation and\nother causal SNPs. We believe that our findings at least partially explain\nproblems with low power and nonreplicability of results in many real data GWAS.\nFinally, we discuss the advantages of our model selection approach in the\ncontext of real data analysis, where we consider publicly available gene\nexpression data as traits for individuals from the HapMap project.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Oct 2010 11:20:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Frommlet", "Florian", ""], ["Ruhaltinger", "Felix", ""], ["Twarog", "Piotr", ""], ["Bogdan", "Malgorzata", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.0297", "submitter": "G\\'{a}bor J.

CCF employs a multiplicative latent\nfactor model to characterize the dyadic utility function. But unlike CF, CCF\nmodels the user behavior of choices by encoding a local competition effect. In\nthis way, CCF allows us to leverage dyadic data that was previously lumped\ntogether with missing data in existing CF models.

Most inference for\nsocial network models assumes that the presence or absence of all possible\nlinks is observed, that the information is completely reliable, and that there\nare no measurement (e.g., recording) errors.

However,\nunderstanding these issues is limited by a fundamental issue of spatial\nscaling: most evidence of past trends comes from rain gauge data, whereas\ntrends into the future are produced by climate models, which rely on gridded\naggregates. To study this further, we fit the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)\ndistribution to the right tail of the distribution of both rain gauge and\ngridded events. The results of this modeling exercise confirm that return\nvalues computed from rain gauge data are typically higher than those computed\nfrom gridded data; however, the size of the difference is somewhat surprising,\nwith the rain gauge data exhibiting return values sometimes two or three times\nthat of the gridded data. The main contribution of this paper is the\ndevelopment of a family of regression relationships between the two sets of\nreturn values that also take spatial variations into account.

Our goal is to screen for firms whose ROA trajectories suggest\nthat they have systematically outperformed their peer groups over time. Such a\nproject faces at least three statistical difficulties: adjustment for relevant\ncovariates, massive multiplicity, and longitudinal dependence. We conclude\nthat, once these difficulties are taken into account, demonstrably superior\nperformance appears to be quite rare. We compare our findings with other recent\nmanagement studies on the same subject, and with the popular literature on\ncorporate success. Our methodological contribution is to propose a new class of\npriors for use in large-scale simultaneous testing. These priors are based on\nthe hypergeometric inverted-beta family, and have two main attractive features:\nheavy tails and computational tractability. The family is a four-parameter\ngeneralization of the normal/inverted-beta prior, and is the natural conjugate\nprior for shrinkage coefficients in a hierarchical normal model. Our results\nemphasize the usefulness of these heavy-tailed priors in large multiple-testing\nproblems, as they have a mild rate of tail decay in the marginal likelihood\n$m(y)$---a property long recognized to be important in testing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Oct 2010 19:10:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 25 Sep 2011 02:53:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 06:24:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Polson", "Nicholas G.", ""], ["Scott", "James G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1010.6202", "submitter": "Ansgar Steland", "authors": "Ansgar Steland", "title": "Sequential Data-Adaptive Bandwidth Selection by Cross-Validation for\n  Nonparametric Prediction", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": "Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation, Volume\n  41, 2012 - Issue 7, 1195-1219,", "doi": "10.1080/03610918.2012.625853", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.PR stat.AP stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of bandwidth selection by cross-validation from a\nsequential point of view in a nonparametric regression model.

The errors may be {\\alpha}-mixing or L2-near epoch\ndependent, which guarantees that the uniform convergence of the cross\nvalidation sum and the consistency of the cross-validated bandwidth hold true\nfor a large class of time series.
