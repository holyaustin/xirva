We extend standard CVAR\nmodels to incorporate estimation of model parameters in the presence of price\nseries level shifts which are not accurately modeled in the standard Gaussian\nerror correction model (ECM) framework. This involves developing a novel matrix\nvariate Bayesian CVAR mixture model comprised of Gaussian errors intra-day and\nAlpha-stable errors inter-day in the ECM framework. To achieve this we derive a\nnovel conjugate posterior model for the Scaled Mixtures of Normals (SMiN CVAR)\nrepresentation of Alpha-stable inter-day innovations. These results are\ngeneralized to asymmetric models for the innovation noise at inter-day\nboundaries allowing for skewed Alpha-stable models.\n  Our proposed model and sampling methodology is general, incorporating the\ncurrent literature on Gaussian models as a special subclass and also allowing\nfor price series level shifts either at random estimated time points or known a\npriori time points. We focus analysis on regularly observed non-Gaussian level\nshifts that can have significant effect on estimation performance in\nstatistical models failing to account for such level shifts, such as at the\nclose and open of markets. We compare the estimation accuracy of our model and\nestimation approach to standard frequentist and Bayesian procedures for CVAR\nmodels when non-Gaussian price series level shifts are present in the\nindividual series, such as inter-day boundaries. We fit a bi-variate\nAlpha-stable model to the inter-day jumps and model the effect of such jumps on\nestimation of matrix-variate CVAR model parameters using the likelihood based\nJohansen procedure and a Bayesian estimation. We illustrate our model and the\ncorresponding estimation procedures we develop on both synthetic and actual\ndata.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Aug 2010 06:29:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Peters", "Gareth W.", ""], ["Kannan", "Balakrishnan B.", ""], ["Lasscock", "Ben", ""], ["Mellen", "Chris", ""], ["Godsill", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.0415", "submitter": "Grace Wahba", "authors": "Xiwen Ma, Bin Dai, Ronald Klein, Barbara E.K.

We account for\nthe rigid body dynamics of spin and precession and calculate the probability\ndistribution of heads, tails, and sides for a thick coin as a function of its\ndimensions and the distribution of its initial conditions. Our theory yields a\nsimple expression for the aspect ratio of homogeneous coins with a prescribed\nfrequency of heads/tails compared to sides, which we validate by tossing\nexperiments using coins of different aspect ratios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Aug 2010 18:19:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Jun 2011 21:17:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 19 Sep 2011 05:14:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Yong", "Ee Hou", ""], ["Mahadevan", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.5070", "submitter": "Gael Varoquaux", "authors": "Ga\\\"el Varoquaux (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, LNAO), Flore Baronnet\n  (LCogn), Andreas Kleinschmidt (LCogn), Pierre Fillard (INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France, LNAO), Bertrand Thirion (INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, LNAO)", "title": "Detection of brain functional-connectivity difference in post-stroke\n  patients using group-level covariance modeling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Medical Image Computing and Computer Added Intervention (2010)", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-642-15705-9_25", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Functional brain connectivity, as revealed through distant correlations in\nthe signals measured by functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), is a\npromising source of biomarkers of brain pathologies. However, establishing and\nusing diagnostic markers requires probabilistic inter-subject comparisons.\nPrincipled comparison of functional-connectivity structures is still a\nchallenging issue. We give a new matrix-variate probabilistic model suitable\nfor inter-subject comparison of functional connectivity matrices on the\nmanifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. We show that this model\nleads to a new algorithm for principled comparison of connectivity coefficients\nbetween pairs of regions. We apply this model to comparing separately\npost-stroke patients to a group of healthy controls. We find\nneurologically-relevant connection differences and show that our model is more\nsensitive that the standard procedure. To the best of our knowledge, these\nresults are the first report of functional connectivity differences between a\nsingle-patient and a group and thus establish an important step toward using\nfunctional connectivity as a diagnostic tool.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Aug 2010 12:35:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Varoquaux", "Ga\u00ebl", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, LNAO"], ["Baronnet", "Flore", "", "LCogn"], ["Kleinschmidt", "Andreas", "", "LCogn"], ["Fillard", "Pierre", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de\n  France, LNAO"], ["Thirion", "Bertrand", "", "INRIA Saclay - Ile de France, LNAO"]]}]
