Rapid sequencing by\nnew technologies enables low-cost resequencing of target regions, although it\nis still prohibitive to test more than a few individuals. In order to improve\ncost trade-offs, it has recently been suggested to apply pooling designs which\nenable the detection of carriers of rare alleles in groups of individuals.\nHowever, this was shown to hold only for a relatively low number of individuals\nin a pool, and requires the design of pooling schemes for particular cases.\n  We propose a novel pooling design, based on a compressed sensing approach,\nwhich is both general, simple and efficient. We model the experimental\nprocedure and show via computer simulations that it enables the recovery of\nrare allele carriers out of larger groups than were possible before, especially\nin situations where high coverage is obtained for each individual.\n  Our approach can also be combined with barcoding techniques to enhance\nperformance and provide a feasible solution based on current resequencing\ncosts. For example, when targeting a small enough genomic region (~100\nbase-pairs) and using only ~10 sequencing lanes and ~10 distinct barcodes, one\ncan recover the identity of 4 rare allele carriers out of a population of over\n4000 individuals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2009 13:25:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shental", "Noam", ""], ["Amir", "Amnon", ""], ["Zuk", "Or", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.0639", "submitter": "Ana Arribas-Gil", "authors": "Ana Arribas-Gil", "title": "Parameter Estimation in multiple-hidden i.i.d. models from biological\n  multiple alignment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Statistical Applications in Genetics and Molecular Biology: 9(1),\n  Article 10, 2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this work we deal with parameter estimation in a latent variable model,\nnamely the multiple-hidden i.i.d. model, which is derived from multiple\nalignment algorithms.
