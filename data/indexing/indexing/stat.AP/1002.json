Most\nof the unmixing algorithms proposed in the literature do not take into account\nthe possible spatial correlations between the pixels. In this work, a Bayesian\nmodel is introduced to exploit these correlations. The image to be unmixed is\nassumed to be partitioned into regions (or classes) where the statistical\nproperties of the abundance coefficients are homogeneous. A Markov random field\nis then proposed to model the spatial dependency of the pixels within any\nclass. Conditionally upon a given class, each pixel is modeled by using the\nclassical linear mixing model with additive white Gaussian noise. This strategy\nis investigated the well known linear mixing model. For this model, the\nposterior distributions of the unknown parameters and hyperparameters allow\nones to infer the parameters of interest. These parameters include the\nabundances for each pixel, the means and variances of the abundances for each\nclass, as well as a classification map indicating the classes of all pixels in\nthe image. To overcome the complexity of the posterior distribution of\ninterest, we consider Markov chain Monte Carlo methods that generate samples\ndistributed according to the posterior of interest. The generated samples are\nthen used for parameter and hyperparameter estimation. The accuracy of the\nproposed algorithms is illustrated on synthetic and real data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2010 19:17:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Aug 2010 09:39:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Jan 2011 10:54:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 06:59:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Eches", "Olivier", ""], ["Dobigeon", "Nicolas", ""], ["Tourneret", "Jean-Yves", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.1111", "submitter": "Luc Demortier", "authors": "Luc Demortier, Supriya Jain, Harrison B.
