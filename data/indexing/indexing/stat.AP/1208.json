Few algorithms\nattempt to merge both static and dynamic structure to improve estimation for\ntime-varying sparse signals (e.g., video). In this work we present a\nre-weighted l_1 dynamic filtering scheme for causal signal estimation that\nutilizes both sparsity assumptions and dynamic structure.

We find that the number of irregular snores --- easily accessible, and\nquantified by what we call the snore time interval index (STII) --- is in good\nagreement with the well-known apnea-hypopnea index, which expresses the\nseverity of obstructive sleep apnea and is extracted only from polysomnography.\nIn addition, the Hurst analysis of the snore sound itself, which calculates the\nfluctuations in the signal as a function of time interval, is used to build a\nclassifier that is able to distinguish between patients with no or mild apnea\nand patients with moderate or severe apnea.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 18:24:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Alencar", "Adriano M.", ""], ["da Silva", "Diego Greatti Vaz", ""], ["Oliveira", "Carolina Beatriz", ""], ["Vieira", "Andre P.", ""], ["Moriya", "Henrique T.", ""], ["Lorenzi-Filho", "Geraldo", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.2253", "submitter": "Ann B.

A common thread to most genetic\ninvestigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified\nfrom family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large\npanels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be\nnoisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for\ndenoising genetically - inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the\nunderlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals.\nThe approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multiscale\ndecomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise\nrelationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to\nbetter estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We\nillustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate\nthe \"heritability\" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally\nheritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable\nto additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related\nindividuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed\nrelationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based\nsamples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic\nrelationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much\nbroader potential application in statistics. Most notably, for\nerror-in-variables random effects models and settings that require\nregularization of matrices with block or hierarchical structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 10 Aug 2012 19:19:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Dec 2013 06:25:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Crossett", "Andrew", ""], ["Lee", "Ann B.", ""], ["Klei", "Lambertus", ""], ["Devlin", "Bernie", ""], ["Roeder", "Kathryn", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.2301", "submitter": "Winston Lin", "authors": "Winston Lin", "title": "Agnostic notes on regression adjustments to experimental data:\n  Reexamining Freedman's critique", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/12-AOAS583 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2013, Vol. 7, No. 1, 295-318", "doi": "10.1214/12-AOAS583", "report-no": "IMS-AOAS-AOAS583", "categories": "stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Freedman [Adv. in Appl.

My\nfindings have recently been questioned through repeat analysis to the United\nKingdom university system. Ferlazzo & Sdoia found that several disciplines in\nthis system also display a scarcity of last names, and that a similar scarcity\nis found when analyzing the first (given) names of Italian professors. Here I\nshow that the scarcity of first names in Italian disciplines is completely\nexplained by uneven male/female representation, while the scarcity of last\nnames in United Kingdom academia is due to discipline-specific immigration.\nHowever, these factors cannot explain the scarcity of last names in Italian\ndisciplines. Geographic and demographic considerations -- proposed as a\npossible explanation of my findings -- appear to have no significant effect:\nafter correcting for these factors, the scarcity of last names remains highly\nsignificant in several disciplines, and there is a marked trend from north to\nsouth, with a higher likelihood of nepotism in the south and in Sicily.\nMoreover, I show that in several Italian disciplines positions tend to be\ninherited as with last names (i.e., from father to son, but not from mother to\ndaughter). Taken together, these results strenghten the case for nepotism,\nhighlighting that statistical tests cannot be applied to a dataset without\ncarefully considering the characteristics of the data and critically\ninterpreting the results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 20:57:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-30", "authors_parsed": [["Allesina", "Stefano", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5809", "submitter": "Greg Finak", "authors": "Greg Finak, Andrew McDavid, Pratip Chattopadhyay, Maria Dominguez,\n  Steve De Rosa, Mario Roederer and Raphael Gottardo", "title": "Mixture Models for Single Cell Assays with Applications to Vaccine\n  Studies", "comments": "18 pages, 5 figures plus supplementary material", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In immunological studies, the characterization of small, functionally\ndistinct cell subsets from blood and tissue is crucial to decipher system level\nbiological changes. An increasing number of studies rely on assays that provide\nsingle-cell measurements of multiple genes and proteins from bulk cell samples.\nA common problem in the analysis of such data is to identify biomarkers (or\ncombinations of thereof) that are differentially expressed between two\nbiological conditions (e.g., before/after vaccination), where expression is\ndefined as the proportion of cells expressing the biomarker or combination in\nthe cell subset of interest.\n  Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical framework based on a beta-binomial\nmixture model for testing for differential biomarker expression using\nsingle-cell assays. Our model allows inference to be subject specific, as is\ntypically required when accessing vaccine responses, while borrowing strength\nacross subjects through common prior distributions. We propose two approaches\nfor parameter estimation: an empirical-Bayes approach using an\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm and a fully Bayesian one based on a Markov\nchain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare our method against frequentist\napproaches for single-cell assays including Fisher's exact test, a likelihood\nratio test, and basic log-fold changes. Using several experimental assays\nmeasuring proteins or genes at the single-cell level and simulated data, we\nshow that our method has higher sensitivity and specificity than alternative\nmethods. Additional simulations show that our framework is also robust to model\nmisspecification. Finally, we also demonstrate how our approach can be extended\nto testing multivariate differential expression across multiple biomarker\ncombinations using a Dirichlet-multinomial model and illustrate this\nmultivariate approach using single-cell gene expression data and simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 23:30:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 16:30:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-31", "authors_parsed": [["Finak", "Greg", ""], ["McDavid", "Andrew", ""], ["Chattopadhyay", "Pratip", ""], ["Dominguez", "Maria", ""], ["De Rosa", "Steve", ""], ["Roederer", "Mario", ""], ["Gottardo", "Raphael", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6403", "submitter": "Maxime Lenormand", "authors": "Maxime Lenormand (UR LISC), Guillaume Deffuant (UR LISC)", "title": "Generating a synthetic population of individuals in households:\n  Sample-free vs sample-based methods", "comments": "10 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 16, 12\n  (2013)", "doi": "10.18564/jasss.2319", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We compare a sample-free method proposed by Gargiulo et al.
