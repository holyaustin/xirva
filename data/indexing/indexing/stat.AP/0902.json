Typically, the ordering of markers is based on a\nstabilized variant of the t-score, such as the moderated t or the SAM\nstatistic. However, these procedures ignore gene-gene correlations, which may\nhave a profound impact on the gene orderings and on the power of the subsequent\ntests.\n  We propose a simple procedure that adjusts gene-wise t-statistics to take\naccount of correlations among genes. The resulting correlation-adjusted\nt-scores (\"cat\" scores) are derived from a predictive perspective, i.e. as a\nscore for variable selection to discriminate group membership in two-class\nlinear discriminant analysis. In the absence of correlation the cat score\nreduces to the standard t-score. Moreover, using the cat score it is\nstraightforward to evaluate groups of features (i.e. gene sets). For\ncomputation of the cat score from small sample data we propose a shrinkage\nprocedure. In a comparative study comprising six different synthetic and\nempirical correlation structures we show that the cat score improves estimation\nof gene orderings and leads to higher power for fixed true discovery rate, and\nvice versa. Finally, we also illustrate the cat score by analyzing metabolomic\ndata.\n  The shrinkage cat score is implemented in the R package \"st\" available from\nURL http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/st/\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Feb 2009 17:18:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 May 2009 21:27:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:49:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Zuber", "Verena", ""], ["Strimmer", "Korbinian", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.0990", "submitter": "Elvan Ceyhan", "authors": "Elvan Ceyhan", "title": "Directional Clustering Tests Based on Nearest Neighbor Contingency\n  Tables", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "KU-EC-09-1", "categories": "stat.ME stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Spatial interaction between two or more classes or species has important\nimplications in various fields and causes multivariate patterns such as\nsegregation or association.

It centered on a concern, perhaps\nwidely spread, that measurement error adjustment methods can induce positive\nbias in results of epidemiological studies when there is no true association. I\ntrace the possible history of this supposition and test it in a simulation\nstudy of both continuous and binary health outcomes under a classical\nmultiplicative measurement error model. A Bayesian measurement adjustment\nmethod is used. The main conclusion is that adjustment for the presumed\nmeasurement error does not 'induce' positive associations, especially if the\nfocus of the interpretation of the result is taken away from the point\nestimate. This is in line with properties of earlier measurement error\nadjustment methods introduced to epidemiologists in the 1990s. An heuristic\nargument is provided to support the generalizability of this observation in the\nBayesian framework. I find that when there is no true association, positive\nbias can only be induced by indefensible manipulation of the priors, such that\nthey dominate the data. The misconception about bias induced by measurement\nerror adjustment should be more clearly explained during the training of\nepidemiologists to ensure the appropriate (and wider) use of measurement error\ncorrection procedures. The simple message that can be derived from this paper\nis: 'Do not focus on point estimates, but mind the gap between boundaries that\nreflect variability in the estimate'. And of course: 'Treat measurement error\nas a tractable problem that deserves much more attention than just a\nqualitative (throw-away) discussion'.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 Feb 2009 22:49:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-10", "authors_parsed": [["Burstyn", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.1360", "submitter": "Shane Jensen", "authors": "Shane T.

We show that this linguistic question can be formulated as a\nproblem of model selection in the class of variable length Markov chains. To\ncarry on this approach, we compare texts from European and Brazilian\nPortuguese. These texts are previously encoded according to some basic rhythmic\nfeatures of the sentences which can be automatically retrieved. This is an\nentirely new approach from the linguistic point of view. Our statistical\ncontribution is the introduction of the smallest maximizer criterion which is a\nconstant free procedure for model selection. As a by-product, this provides a\nsolution for the problem of optimal choice of the penalty constant when using\nthe BIC to select a variable length Markov chain. Besides proving the\nconsistency of the smallest maximizer criterion when the sample size diverges,\nwe also make a simulation study comparing our approach with both the standard\nBIC selection and the Peres-Shields order estimation. Applied to the linguistic\nsample constituted for our case study, the smallest maximizer criterion assigns\ndifferent context-tree models to the two dialects of Portuguese.
