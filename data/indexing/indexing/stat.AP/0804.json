Several statistical\nissues related to this model are studied. We first make a quick but extensive\nreview of their main properties and show that most of these properties can be\nanalytically studied. We then develop an approximation theory of these\nprocesses in the limit of small intermittency $\\lambda^2\\ll 1$, i.e., when the\ndegree of multifractality is small. This allows us to prove that the\nprobability distributions associated with these processes possess some very\nsimple aggregation properties accross time scales. Such a control of the\nprocess properties at different time scales, allows us to address the problem\nof parameter estimation. We show that one has to distinguish two different\nasymptotic regimes: the first one, referred to as the ''low frequency regime'',\ncorresponds to taking a sample whose overall size increases whereas the second\none, referred to as the ''high frequency regime'', corresponds to sampling the\nprocess at an increasing sampling rate. We show that, the first regime leads to\nconvergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the situation is\nmuch more intricate : only the intermittency coefficient $\\lambda^2$ can be\nestimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical\nsituations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency\nversus high frequency) and consequently decide whether the estimations of the\nother parameters are reliable or not. We finally illustrate how both our\nresults on parameter estimation and on aggregation properties, allow one to\nsuccessfully use these models for modelization and prediction of financial time\nseries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Apr 2008 14:10:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Bacry", "E.", ""], ["Kozhemyak", "A.", ""], ["Muzy", "J. -F.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0650", "submitter": "Nathalie Villa", "authors": "Anne Ruiz (IMT, Gremaq), Nathalie Villa (IMT)", "title": "Storms prediction : Logistic regression vs random forest for unbalanced\n  data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Case Studies in Business, Industry and Government Statistics 1, 2\n  (2007) 91-101", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of this study is to compare two supervised classification methods on\na crucial meteorological problem.

We describe a measurement procedure and campaign to\nmeasure a large number of multi-hop networks in an ensemble of environments.\nThe measurements show statistically significant correlations among shadowing\nexperienced on different links in the network, with correlation coefficients up\nto 0.33. We propose a statistical model for the shadowing correlation between\nlink pairs which shows strong agreement with the measurements, and we compare\nthe new model with an existing shadowing correlation model of Gudmundson\n(1991). Finally, we analyze multi-hop paths in three and four node networks\nusing both correlated and independent shadowing models and show that\nindependent shadowing models can underestimate the probability of route failure\nby a factor of two or greater.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Apr 2008 01:52:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 18 Apr 2008 00:57:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-18", "authors_parsed": [["Agrawal", "Piyush", "", "Sensing and Processing Across\n  Networks Lab"], ["Patwari", "Neal", "", "Sensing and Processing Across\n  Networks Lab"]]}, {"id": "0804.3033", "submitter": "Xinjia Chen", "authors": "Xinjia Chen", "title": "A Simple Sample Size Formula for Estimating Means of Poisson Random\n  Variables", "comments": "6 pages, nofigure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.PR stat.AP stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we derive an explicit sample size formula based a mixed\ncriterion of absolute and relative errors for estimating means of Poisson\nrandom variables.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Apr 2008 14:57:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-04-21", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Xinjia", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3166", "submitter": "Cecile Ane", "authors": "C\\'ecile An\\'e", "title": "Analysis of comparative data with hierarchical autocorrelation", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/08-AOAS173 the Annals of\n  Applied Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aoas/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Applied Statistics 2008, Vol. 2, No. 3, 1078-1102", "doi": "10.1214/08-AOAS173", "report-no": "IMS-AOAS-AOAS173", "categories": "stat.AP math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The asymptotic behavior of estimates and information criteria in linear\nmodels are studied in the context of hierarchically correlated sampling units.\nThe work is motivated by biological data collected on species where\nautocorrelation is based on the species' genealogical tree. Hierarchical\nautocorrelation is also found in many other kinds of data, such as from\nmicroarray experiments or human languages. Similar correlation also arises in\nANOVA models with nested effects. I show that the best linear unbiased\nestimators are almost surely convergent but may not be consistent for some\nparameters such as the intercept and lineage effects, in the context of\nBrownian motion evolution on the genealogical tree. For the purpose of model\nselection I show that the usual BIC does not provide an appropriate\napproximation to the posterior probability of a model. To correct for this, an\neffective sample size is introduced for parameters that are inconsistently\nestimated. For biological studies, this work implies that tree-aware sampling\ndesign is desirable; adding more sampling units may not help ancestral\nreconstruction and only strong lineage effects may be detected with high power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 19 Apr 2008 21:01:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Nov 2008 07:27:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["An\u00e9", "C\u00e9cile", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.3779", "submitter": "Xinjia Chen", "authors": "Xinjia Chen", "title": "On Estimation of Finite Population Proportion", "comments": "11 pages, no figure, added multistage fixed-width confidence interval\n  method", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.PR stat.AP stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the classical problem of estimating the proportion of\na finite population.
