These results allow\nus to construct simultaneous confidence sets for function-valued effects of the\ncounterfactual changes, including the effects on the entire distribution and\nquantile functions of the outcome as well as on related functionals. These\nconfidence sets can be used to test functional hypotheses such as no-effect,\npositive effect, or stochastic dominance.
