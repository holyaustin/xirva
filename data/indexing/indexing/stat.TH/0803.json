The $k$-FWER, a generalized version of the usual familywise error\nrate (FWER), is such an error rate that has recently been introduced in the\nliterature and procedures controlling it have been proposed. A further\ngeneralization of a result on the $k$-FWER is provided in this article. In\naddition, an alternative and less conservative notion of error rate, the\n$k$-FDR, is introduced in the same spirit as the $k$-FWER by generalizing the\nusual false discovery rate (FDR). A $k$-FWER procedure is constructed given any\nset of increasing constants by utilizing the $k$th order joint null\ndistributions of the $p$-values without assuming any specific form of\ndependence among all the $p$-values. Procedures controlling the $k$-FDR are\nalso developed by using the $k$th order joint null distributions of the\n$p$-values, first assuming that the sets of null and nonnull $p$-values are\nmutually independent or they are jointly positively dependent in the sense of\nbeing multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP$_2$) and then discarding\nthat assumption about the overall dependence among the $p$-values.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Mar 2008 07:49:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Sarkar", "Sanat K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.2963", "submitter": "Yuhong Yang", "authors": "Yuhong Yang", "title": "Consistency of cross validation for comparing regression procedures", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/009053607000000514 the\n  Annals of Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of\n  Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Statistics 2007, Vol. 35, No. 6, 2450-2473", "doi": "10.1214/009053607000000514", "report-no": "IMS-AOS-AOS0284", "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Theoretical developments on cross validation (CV) have mainly focused on\nselecting one among a list of finite-dimensional models (e.g., subset or order\nselection in linear regression) or selecting a smoothing parameter (e.g.,\nbandwidth for kernel smoothing).

In this paper, we propose two\nnovel types of regularization in the context of the multicategory SVM (MSVM)\nfor simultaneous classification and variable selection. The MSVM generally\nrequires estimation of multiple discriminating functions and applies the argmax\nrule for prediction. For each individual variable, we propose to characterize\nits importance by the supnorm of its coefficient vector associated with\ndifferent functions, and then minimize the MSVM hinge loss function subject to\na penalty on the sum of supnorms. To further improve the supnorm penalty, we\npropose the adaptive regularization, which allows different weights imposed on\ndifferent variables according to their relative importance. Both types of\nregularization automate variable selection in the process of building\nclassifiers, and lead to sparse multi-classifiers with enhanced\ninterpretability and improved accuracy, especially for high dimensional low\nsample size data. One big advantage of the supnorm penalty is its easy\nimplementation via standard linear programming.

This paper studies PCA in this\nhigh-dimensional regime, but under the additional assumption that the maximal\neigenvector is sparse, say, with at most $k$ nonzero components. We consider a\nspiked covariance model in which a base matrix is perturbed by adding a\n$k$-sparse maximal eigenvector, and we analyze two computationally tractable\nmethods for recovering the support set of this maximal eigenvector, as follows:\n(a) a simple diagonal thresholding method, which transitions from success to\nfailure as a function of the rescaled sample size\n$\\theta_{\\mathrm{dia}}(n,p,k)=n/[k^2\\log(p-k)]$; and (b) a more sophisticated\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation, which succeeds once the rescaled\nsample size $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)=n/[k\\log(p-k)]$ is larger than a\ncritical threshold. In addition, we prove that no method, including the best\nmethod which has exponential-time complexity, can succeed in recovering the\nsupport if the order parameter $\\theta_{\\mathrm{sdp}}(n,p,k)$ is below a\nthreshold.
