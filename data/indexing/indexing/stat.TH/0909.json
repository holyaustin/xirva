We seek group actions that preserve\nthe structural parameter and yield a maximal invariant in the parameter space\nwith fixed dimension. M-estimation from the likelihood of the maximal invariant\nstatistic yields the maximum invariant likelihood estimator (MILE). Consistency\nof MILE for cases in which the likelihood of the maximal invariant is the\nproduct of marginal likelihoods is straightforward. We illustrate this result\nwith a stationary autoregressive model with fixed effects and an agent-specific\nmonotonic transformation model. Asymptotic properties of MILE, when the\nlikelihood of the maximal invariant does not factorize, remain an open\nquestion. We are able to provide consistent, asymptotically normal and\nefficient results of MILE when invariance yields Wishart distributions.

In this paper a modification\nof Hoeffding's test is considered based on a relaxation of the K-L divergence\ntest statistic, referred to as the mismatched divergence. The resulting\nmismatched test is shown to be a generalized likelihood-ratio test (GLRT) for\nthe case where the alternate distribution lies in a parametric family of the\ndistributions characterized by a finite dimensional parameter, i.e., it is a\nsolution to the corresponding composite hypothesis testing problem. For certain\nchoices of the alternate distribution, it is shown that both the Hoeffding test\nand the mismatched test have the same asymptotic performance in terms of error\nexponents. A consequence of this result is that the GLRT is optimal in\ndifferentiating a particular distribution from others in an exponential family.\nIt is also shown that the mismatched test has a significant advantage over the\nHoeffding test in terms of finite sample size performance. This advantage is\ndue to the difference in the asymptotic variances of the two test statistics\nunder the null hypothesis. In particular, the variance of the K-L divergence\ngrows linearly with the alphabet size, making the test impractical for\napplications involving large alphabet distributions. The variance of the\nmismatched divergence on the other hand grows linearly with the dimension of\nthe parameter space, and can hence be controlled through a prudent choice of\nthe function class defining the mismatched divergence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Sep 2009 18:35:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:49:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 9 Sep 2010 06:56:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Unnikrishnan", "Jayakrishnan", ""], ["Huang", "Dayu", ""], ["Meyn", "Sean", ""], ["Surana", "Amit", ""], ["Veeravalli", "Venugopal", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2353", "submitter": "Ery Arias-Castro", "authors": "Ery Arias-Castro", "title": "Clustering Based on Pairwise Distances When the Data is of Mixed\n  Dimensions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the context of clustering, we consider a generative model in a Euclidean\nambient space with clusters of different shapes, dimensions, sizes and\ndensities.

The\ninfluence of the tree structure and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution\non the learning rate as the number of samples increases is discussed.\nSpecifically, the error exponent corresponding to the event that the estimated\ntree structure differs from the actual unknown tree structure of the\ndistribution is analyzed. Finding the error exponent reduces to a least-squares\nproblem in the very noisy learning regime. In this regime, it is shown that the\nextremal tree structure that minimizes the error exponent is the star for any\nfixed set of correlation coefficients on the edges of the tree. If the\nmagnitudes of all the correlation coefficients are less than 0.63, it is also\nshown that the tree structure that maximizes the error exponent is the Markov\nchain. In other words, the star and the chain graphs represent the hardest and\nthe easiest structures to learn in the class of tree-structured Gaussian\ngraphical models. This result can also be intuitively explained by correlation\ndecay: pairs of nodes which are far apart, in terms of graph distance, are\nunlikely to be mistaken as edges by the maximum-likelihood estimator in the\nasymptotic regime.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2009 20:49:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Jan 2010 02:26:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Vincent Y.
