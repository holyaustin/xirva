As a quadrature, the harmonic mean\napproximation suffers from enormous truncation error as consequence . In\naddition, I demonstrate that the integral expression for the harmonic-mean\napproximation converges slowly at best for high-dimensional problems with\nuninformative prior distributions.

Simulation experiments are used to assess\nthe power of the tests, which is generally higher than recently proposed tests\nusing the estimated quadratic variation (i.e., realised volatility). In\nparticular, the crossing tree shows significantly more power with shorter\ndatasets. We then show results from applying the methodology to high frequency\ncurrency exchange rate data. We show that in 2003, for the AUD-USD, GBP-USD,\nJPY-USD and EUR-USD rates, at small timescales (less than 15 minutes or so) the\ncontinuous martingale hypothesis is rejected, but not so at larger timescales.\nFor 2003 EUR-GBP data, the hypothesis is rejected at small timescales and some\nmoderate timescales, but not all.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2009 07:22:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 23:27:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Jones", "Owen D.", "", "University of Melbourne"], ["Rolls", "David A.", "", "University of Melbourne"]]}, {"id": "0911.5357", "submitter": "Mathieu Ribatet", "authors": "Mathieu Ribatet, Daniel Cooley and Anthony C.

Applications of these\nmodels arise in the study of physical, as well as biological systems, where\ndirected edges between nodes represent the influence of components of the\nsystem on each other. The general problem of estimating DAGs from observed data\nis computationally NP-hard, Moreover two directed graphs may be observationally\nequivalent. When the nodes exhibit a natural ordering, the problem of\nestimating directed graphs reduces to the problem of estimating the structure\nof the network. In this paper, we propose a penalized likelihood approach that\ndirectly estimates the adjacency matrix of DAGs. Both lasso and adaptive lasso\npenalties are considered and an efficient algorithm is proposed for estimation\nof high dimensional DAGs. We study variable selection consistency of the two\npenalties when the number of variables grows to infinity with the sample size.\nWe show that although lasso can only consistently estimate the true network\nunder stringent assumptions, adaptive lasso achieves this task under mild\nregularity conditions. The performance of the proposed methods is compared to\nalternative methods in simulated, as well as real, data examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Nov 2009 23:47:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shojaie", "Ali", ""], ["Michailidis", "George", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5482", "submitter": "Ya'acov Ritov", "authors": "Natalia Bochkina and Ya'acov Ritov", "title": "Sparse Empirical Bayes Analysis (SEBA)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ML math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a joint processing of $n$ independent sparse regression problems.\nEach is based on a sample $(y_{i1},x_{i1})...,(y_{im},x_{im})$ of $m$ \\iid\nobservations from $y_{i1}=x_{i1}\\t\\beta_i+\\eps_{i1}$, $y_{i1}\\in \\R$, $x_{i\n1}\\in\\R^p$, $i=1,...,n$, and $\\eps_{i1}\\dist N(0,\\sig^2)$, say. $p$ is large\nenough so that the empirical risk minimizer is not consistent.
