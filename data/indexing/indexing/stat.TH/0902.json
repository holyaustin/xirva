We\npropose a smoothing splines estimator for the functional slope parameter based\non a slight modification of the usual penalty. Theoretical analysis\nconcentrates on the error in an out-of-sample prediction of the response for a\nnew random function $X_{n+1}$. It is shown that rates of convergence of the\nprediction error depend on the smoothness of the slope function and on the\nstructure of the predictors. We then prove that these rates are optimal in the\nsense that they are minimax over large classes of possible slope functions and\ndistributions of the predictive curves. For the case of models with\nerrors-in-variables the smoothing spline estimator is modified by using a\ndenoising correction of the covariance matrix of discretized curves. The\nmethodology is then applied to a real case study where the aim is to predict\nthe maximum of the concentration of ozone by using the curve of this\nconcentration measured the preceding day.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Feb 2009 14:47:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Crambes", "Christophe", ""], ["Kneip", "Alois", ""], ["Sarda", "Pascal", ""]]}, {"id": "0902.4380", "submitter": "Nicole Kraemer", "authors": "Gilles Blanchard, Nicole Kraemer", "title": "Kernel Partial Least Squares is Universally Consistent", "comments": "18 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": "JMLR Workshop and Conference Proceedings 9 (AISTATS 2010) 57-64,\n  2010", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We prove the statistical consistency of kernel Partial Least Squares\nRegression applied to a bounded regression learning problem on a reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space.
