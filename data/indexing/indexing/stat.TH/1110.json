M is typically\nlarge and X will usually have M rows associated with each of the M decisions to\nmake, but for each row the data may be low dimensional. A Bayesian\ndecision-theoretic approach for this problem is implemented with the overall\nloss function being a cost-weighted linear combination of Type I and Type II\nloss functions. The class of loss functions considered allows for the use of\nthe false discovery rate (FDR), false nondiscovery rate (FNR), and missed\ndiscovery rate (MDR) in assessing the decision. Through this Bayesian paradigm,\nthe Bayes multiple decision function (BMDF) is derived and an efficient\nalgorithm to obtain the optimal Bayes action is described. In contrast to many\nworks in the literature where the rows of the matrix X are assumed to be\nstochastically independent, we allow in this paper a dependent data structure\nwith the associations obtained through a class of frailty-induced Archimedean\ncopulas. In particular, non-Gaussian dependent data structure, which is the\nnorm rather than the exception when dealing with failure-time data, can be\nentertained. The numerical implementation of the determination of the Bayes\noptimal action is facilitated through sequential Monte Carlo techniques. The\nmain theory developed could also be extended to the problem of multiple\nhypotheses testing, multiple classification and prediction, and\nhigh-dimensional variable selection. The proposed procedure is illustrated for\nthe simple versus simple and for the composite hypotheses setting via\nsimulation studies. The procedure is also applied to a subset of a real\nmicroarray data set from a colon cancer study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 22:38:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Wensong", ""], ["Pe\u00f1a", "Edsel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.0108", "submitter": "Iain M.

In this paper, we try to provide some\ninsights to these problems through a theoretic study on a ME structure where\n$m$ experts are mixed, with each expert being related to a polynomial\nregression model of order $k$. We study the convergence rate of the maximum\nlikelihood estimator (MLE), in terms of how fast the Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence of the estimated density converges to the true density, when the\nsample size $n$ increases. The convergence rate is found to be dependent on\nboth $m$ and $k$, and certain choices of $m$ and $k$ are found to produce\noptimal convergence rates. Therefore, these results shed light on the two\naforementioned important problems: on how to choose $m$, and on how $m$ and $k$\nshould be compromised, for achieving good convergence rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 14:43:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2011 11:39:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mendes", "Eduardo F.", ""], ["Jiang", "Wenxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2295", "submitter": "Antonio Irpino PhD", "authors": "Antonio Irpino and Rosanna Verde", "title": "Basic statistics for probabilistic symbolic variables: a novel\n  metric-based approach", "comments": "19 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11634-014-0176-4", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In data mining, it is usually to describe a set of individuals using some\nsummaries (means, standard deviations, histograms, confidence intervals) that\ngeneralize individual descriptions into a typology description.

The stochastic block model is a common tool\nfor model-based community detection, and asymptotic tools for checking\nconsistency of community detection under the block model have been recently\ndeveloped. However, the block model is limited by its assumption that all nodes\nwithin a community are stochastically equivalent, and provides a poor fit to\nnetworks with hubs or highly varying node degrees within communities, which are\ncommon in practice. The degree-corrected stochastic block model was proposed to\naddress this shortcoming and allows variation in node degrees within a\ncommunity while preserving the overall block community structure. In this paper\nwe establish general theory for checking consistency of community detection\nunder the degree-corrected stochastic block model and compare several community\ndetection criteria under both the standard and the degree-corrected models. We\nshow which criteria are consistent under which models and constraints, as well\nas compare their relative performance in practice. We find that methods based\non the degree-corrected block model, which includes the standard block model as\na special case, are consistent under a wider class of models and that\nmodularity-type methods require parameter constraints for consistency, whereas\nlikelihood-based methods do not. On the other hand, in practice, the degree\ncorrection involves estimating many more parameters, and empirically we find it\nis only worth doing if the node degrees within communities are indeed highly\nvariable.
