We consider a generalization of\n$f$-divergences to multiple distributions, and we provide a constructive\nequivalence between divergences, statistical information (in the sense of\nDeGroot), and losses for multiclass classification. A major application of our\nresults is in multi-class classification problems in which we must both infer a\ndiscriminant function $\\gamma$---for making predictions on a label $Y$ from\ndatum $X$---and a data representation (or, in the setting of a hypothesis\ntesting problem, an experimental design), represented as a quantizer\n$\\mathsf{q}$ from a family of possible quantizers $\\mathsf{Q}$. In this\nsetting, we characterize the equivalence between loss functions, meaning that\noptimizing either of two losses yields an optimal discriminant and quantizer\n$\\mathsf{q}$, complementing and extending earlier results of Nguyen et. al. to\nthe multiclass case.

Consistency is proven under an asymptotic structure\n$\\frac{p}{n}\\to c$ where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the parameter\ndimension of the response variables. In particular, our proposed class of\nestimators dominates the maximum likelihood estimator under the squared risk\neven when the model does not include the true model. Experimental results show\nthat the risks of our model selection criteria are smaller than the ones based\non the maximum likelihood estimator and that our proposed criteria specify the\ntrue model under some conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 05:19:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 11:31:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Mori", "Yuichi", ""], ["Suzuki", "Taiji", ""]]}]
