We develop a framework for constructing nonlinear\nmechanistic models and carrying out inference. Our framework permits the\nconsideration of implicit dynamic models, meaning statistical models for\nstochastic dynamical systems which are specified by a simulation algorithm to\ngenerate sample paths. Inference procedures that operate on implicit models are\nsaid to have the plug-and-play property. Our work builds on recently developed\nplug-and-play inference methodology for partially observed Markov models. We\nintroduce a class of implicitly specified Markov chains with stochastic\ntransition rates, and we demonstrate its applicability to open problems in\nstatistical inference for biological systems. As one example, these models are\nshown to give a fresh perspective on measles transmission dynamics.
