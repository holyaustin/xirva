This result can be used to prove the result of\nSparre Andersen (1954) that the number of vertices of the smallest concave\nmajorant of the empirical distribution function of a sample of size n from the\nuniform distribution on [0,1] is asymptotically normal, with an asymptotic\nexpectation and variance which are both of order log n. A similar (Markovian)\ninverse jump process was introduced in Groeneboom (1989), in an analysis of the\nleast concave majorant of two-sided Brownian motion with a parabolic drift.\nThis process is quite different from the process for one-sided Brownian motion\nwithout drift: the number of vertices in a (corresponding slopes) interval has\nan expectation proportional to the length of the interval and the variance of\nthe number of vertices in such an interval is about half the size of the\nexpectation, if the length of the interval tends to infinity. We prove an\nasymptotic normality result for the number of vertices in an increasing\ninterval, which translates into a corresponding result for the least concave\nmajorant of an empirical distribution function of a sample of size n, generated\nby a strictly concave distribution function. In this case the number of\nvertices is of order cube root n, and the variance is again about half the size\nof the asymptotic expectation. As a side result we obtain some interesting\nrelations between the first moments of the number of vertices, the square of\nthe location of the maximum of Brownian motion minus a parabola, the value of\nthe maximum itself, the squared slope of the least concave majorant at zero,\nand the value of the least concave majorant at zero.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 21:57:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Oct 2011 13:11:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 14:25:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 15:15:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-26", "authors_parsed": [["Groeneboom", "Piet", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.0029", "submitter": "Vladimir Osipov Dr.", "authors": "B.

There may be multiple pertinent aspects\nof performance (e.g. detection, track estimation, identification/classification\nand cost) and multiple users (e.g. within picture compilation, threat\nassessment, resource allocation and intercept control tasks), each with\ndifferent requirements. Further, the estimates of performances and the user\nrequirements are likely to be uncertain. In such circumstances, how can we\nreliably assess and compare the effectiveness of candidate systems? This paper\npresents a general yet simple mathematical framework that achieves all of this.\nFirst, the general requirements of a satisfactory framework are outlined. Then,\nstarting from a definition of a measure of effectiveness (MOE) based on set\ntheory, the formulae for assessing performance in various applications are\nobtained. These include combined MOEs, multiple and possibly conflicting user\nrequirements, multiple sources and types of performance data and different\ndescriptions of uncertainty. Issues raised by implementation of the scheme\nwithin a simulator are discussed. Finally, it is shown how this approach to\nperformance assessment is used to treat some challenging examples from sonar\nsystem assessment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Nov 2010 11:44:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Reed", "C.

The first step consists on performing 1D highly resolved\nmatter density reconstructions along the line-of-sight towards z~2-3 quasars\nbased on an arbitrary non-Gaussian univariate model for matter statistics. The\nsecond step consists on Gibbs-sampling based on conditional PDFs. The matter\ndensity field is sampled in real space with Hamiltonian-sampling using the\nPoisson/Gamma-lognormal model, while redshift distortions are corrected with\nlinear Lagrangian perturbation theory. The power-spectrum of the lognormal\ntransformed variable which is Gaussian distributed (and thus close to the\nlinear regime) can consistently be sampled with the inverse Gamma distribution\nfunction. We test our method through numerical N-body simulations with a\ncomputational volume large enough (> 1 h^{-3} Gpc^3) to show that the linear\npower-spectra are nicely recovered over scales larger than >~20 h^{-1} Mpc,\ni.e. the relevant range where features imprinted by the baryon-acoustics\noscillations (BAOs) appear.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 14:09:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Aug 2011 14:32:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 12:11:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Kitaura", "Francisco-Shu", ""], ["Gallerani", "Simona", ""], ["Ferrara", "Andrea", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.6256", "submitter": "Karim Lounici", "authors": "Vladimir Koltchinskii, Alexandre B.

We propose a new nuclear norm penalized estimator of $A_0$\nand establish a general sharp oracle inequality for this estimator for\narbitrary values of $n,m_1,m_2$ under the condition of isometry in expectation.\nThen this method is applied to the matrix completion problem. In this case, the\nestimator admits a simple explicit form and we prove that it satisfies oracle\ninequalities with faster rates of convergence than in the previous works. They\nare valid, in particular, in the high-dimensional setting $m_1m_2\\gg n$. We\nshow that the obtained rates are optimal up to logarithmic factors in a minimax\nsense and also derive, for any fixed matrix $A_0$, a non-minimax lower bound on\nthe rate of convergence of our estimator, which coincides with the upper bound\nup to a constant factor. Finally, we show that our procedure provides an exact\nrecovery of the rank of $A_0$ with probability close to 1.
