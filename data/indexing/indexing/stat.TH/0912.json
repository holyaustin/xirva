The use of the local\napproximation method, which includes the local polynomial smoothing as a\nparticular case, leads to a finite family of estimators corresponding to\ndifferent degrees of smoothing. Data-driven choice of localization degree in\nthis case can be understood as the problem of selection from this family.

An important issue with this type of\nprocedures - the choice of certain tuning parameters - was addressed in\nSpokoiny and Vial (2009). The authors called their approach to the parameter\ncalibration \"propagation\". In the present paper the propagation approach is\ndeveloped and justified for the heteroscedastic case in presence of the noise\nmisspecification.

By Galambos's theorem, existence of directional derivatives in the\nupper endpoint of the copula is necessary and sufficient for convergence of the\nmultivariate extremes provided the marginal maxima converge. The copula of the\nmax-stable limit distribution does not depend on the margins. So margins seem\nto play a subsidiary role in multivariate extremes. The theory and examples\npresented in this paper cast a different light on the significance of margins.\nFor light-tailed meta distributions, the asymptotic behaviour is very sensitive\nto perturbations of the underlying heavy-tailed original distribution, it may\nchange drastically even when the asymptotic behaviour of the heavy-tailed\ndensity is not affected.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2009 17:09:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 23 Nov 2012 11:42:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Balkema", "Guus", ""], ["Embrechts", "Paul", ""], ["Nolde", "Natalia", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.5338", "submitter": "Angelika Rohde", "authors": "Angelika Rohde, Alexandre B.

We are\nparticularly interested in the high-dimensional setting where the number $mT$\nof unknown entries can be much larger than the sample size $N$. Motivated by\nseveral applications, we consider estimation of matrix $A$ under the assumption\nthat it has small rank. This can be viewed as dimension reduction or sparsity\nassumption. In order to shrink toward a low-rank representation, we investigate\npenalized least squares estimators with a Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm penalty term,\n$p\\leq1$. We study these estimators under two possible assumptions---a modified\nversion of the restricted isometry condition and a uniform bound on the ratio\n\"empirical norm induced by the sampling operator/Frobenius norm.\" The main\nresults are stated as nonasymptotic upper bounds on the prediction risk and on\nthe Schatten-$q$ risk of the estimators, where $q\\in[p,2]$. The rates that we\nobtain for the prediction risk are of the form $rm/N$ (for $m=T$), up to\nlogarithmic factors, where $r$ is the rank of $A$. The particular examples of\nmulti-task learning and matrix completion are worked out in detail. The proofs\nare based on tools from the theory of empirical processes.

In this\npaper, we extend this theorem to the case of multiresponse experiments, and we\nshow that when the number of experiments is finite, $c-,A-,T-$ and $D-$optimal\ndesign of multiresponse experiments can be computed by Second-Order Cone\nProgramming (SOCP). Moreover, our SOCP approach can deal with design problems\nin which the variable is subject to several linear constraints.\n  We give two proofs of this generalization of Elfving's theorem. One is based\non Lagrangian dualization techniques and relies on the fact that the\nsemidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of the multiresponse $c-$optimal\ndesign always has a solution which is a matrix of rank $1$. Therefore, the\ncomplexity of this problem fades.\n  We also investigate a \\emph{model robust} generalization of $c-$optimality,\nfor which an Elfving-type theorem was established by Dette (1993). We show with\nthe same Lagrangian approach that these model robust designs can be computed\nefficiently by minimizing a geometric mean under some norm constraints.\nMoreover, we show that the optimality conditions of this geometric programming\nproblem yield an extension of Dette's theorem to the case of multiresponse\nexperiments.\n  When the number of unknown parameters is small, or when the number of linear\nfunctions of the parameters to be estimated is small, we show by numerical\nexamples that our approach can be between 10 and 1000 times faster than the\nclassic, state-of-the-art algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 15:38:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Jul 2010 01:25:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 25 Nov 2010 14:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sagnol", "Guillaume", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.5489", "submitter": "Alexandre Belloni", "authors": "Alexandre Belloni, Robert L.
