Together, these\nissues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for\nnetworks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by\nconsidering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into\ncommunities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest\nof the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,\nunder which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of\nthe blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution\nwithin each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models\nadd a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree. The choice\nbetween ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make\nvery different inferences about communities. We present the first principled\nand tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected\nblock models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of\nlog-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial\ndepartures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop\nlinear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block\nmodel and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation.

However, quantile regression is not equipped with a parametric\nlikelihood, and therefore, Bayesian inference for quantile regression demands\ncareful investigation. This paper considers the Bayesian empirical likelihood\napproach to quantile regression. Taking the empirical likelihood into a\nBayesian framework, we show that the resultant posterior from any fixed prior\nis asymptotically normal; its mean shrinks toward the true parameter values,\nand its variance approaches that of the maximum empirical likelihood estimator.\nA more interesting case can be made for the Bayesian empirical likelihood when\ninformative priors are used to explore commonality across quantiles. Regression\nquantiles that are computed separately at each percentile level tend to be\nhighly variable in the data sparse areas (e.g., high or low percentile levels).\nThrough empirical likelihood, the proposed method enables us to explore various\nforms of commonality across quantiles for efficiency gains. By using an MCMC\nalgorithm in the computation, we avoid the daunting task of directly maximizing\nempirical likelihood. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is\ninvestigated empirically, where substantial efficiency gains are demonstrated\nwith informative priors on common features across several percentile levels. A\ntheoretical framework of shrinking priors is used in the paper to better\nunderstand the power of the proposed method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 13:02:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yunwen", ""], ["He", "Xuming", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5462", "submitter": "Erik Aas", "authors": "Erik Aas", "title": "Limit points of the iterative scaling procedure", "comments": "7 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The iterative scaling procedure (ISP) is an algorithm which computes a\nsequence of matrices, starting from some given matrix.
