On the other\nhand, such a belief model may be intended to represent that the subject\nbelieves or knows that the phenomenon under study exhibits symmetry. We defend\nthe view that these are fundamentally different things, even though the\ndifference cannot be captured by Bayesian belief models. In fact, the failure\nto distinguish between both situations leads to Laplace's so-called Principle\nof Insufficient Reason, which has been criticised extensively in the\nliterature.\n  We show that there are belief models (imprecise probability models, coherent\nlower previsions) that generalise and include the Bayesian belief models, but\nwhere this fundamental difference can be captured. This leads to two notions of\nsymmetry for such belief models: weak invariance (representing symmetry of\nbeliefs) and strong invariance (modelling beliefs of symmetry). We discuss\nvarious mathematical as well as more philosophical aspects of these notions. We\nalso discuss a few examples to show the relevance of our findings both to\nprobabilistic modelling and to statistical inference, and to the notion of\nexchangeability in particular.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Jan 2008 16:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["de Cooman", "Gert", ""], ["Miranda", "Enrique", ""]]}, {"id": "0801.2070", "submitter": "Baba Thiam", "authors": "Abdelkader Mokkadem (LM-Versailles), Mariane Pelletier\n  (LM-Versailles), Baba Thiam (LM-Versailles)", "title": "Joint behaviour of semirecursive kernel estimators of the location and\n  of the size of the mode of a probability density function", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Let $\\theta$ and $\\mu$ denote the location and the size of the mode of a\nprobability density.

While it is indeed possible to\napproximate posterior probabilities based solely on MCMC outputs from single\nmodels, as demonstrated by Gelfand and Dey (1994) and Bartolucci et al. (2006),\nwe show that the proposals of Scott (2002) and Congdon (2006) are biased and\nadvance several arguments towards this thesis, the primary one being the\nconfusion between model-based posteriors and joint pseudo-posteriors. From a\npractical point of view, the bias in Scott's (2002) approximation appears to be\nmuch more severe than the one in Congdon's (2006), the later being often of the\nsame magnitude as the posterior probability it approximates, although we also\nexhibit an example where the divergence from the true posterior probability is\nextreme.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2008 07:26:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 12:13:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 18 Mar 2008 21:23:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 21 Apr 2008 14:32:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 5 Jun 2008 07:04:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-11", "authors_parsed": [["Robert", "Christian", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Marin", "Jean-Michel", "", "INRIA Futurs"]]}, {"id": "0801.3887", "submitter": "Christian Robert", "authors": "Nicolas Chopin (CREST), Christian Robert (CREST, Ceremade)", "title": "Properties of Nested Sampling", "comments": "Revision submitted to Biometrika", "journal-ref": "Biometrika 97(3):741-755, 2010", "doi": "10.1093/biomet/asq021", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.CO math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nested sampling is a simulation method for approximating marginal likelihoods\nproposed by Skilling (2006).
