We show that,\nin the limit in which a model complexity constraint is relaxed, filtering finds\nthe exact causal architecture of a stochastic dynamical system, known as the\ncausal-state partition. From this, one can estimate the amount of historical\ninformation the process stores. More generally, causal filtering finds a graded\nmodel-complexity hierarchy of approximations to the causal architecture. Abrupt\nchanges in the hierarchy, as a function of approximation, capture distinct\nscales of structural organization.\n  For nonideal cases with finite data, we show how the correct number of\nunderlying causal states can be found by optimal causal estimation. A\npreviously derived model complexity control term allows us to correct for the\neffect of statistical fluctuations in probability estimates and thereby avoid\nover-fitting.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 11 Aug 2007 19:13:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Aug 2010 23:46:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Still", "Susanne", ""], ["Crutchfield", "James P.", ""], ["Ellison", "Christopher J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.1593", "submitter": "Adom Giffin", "authors": "Adom Giffin and Ariel Caticha", "title": "Updating Probabilities with Data and Moments", "comments": "Presented at the 27th International Workshop on Bayesian Inference\n  and Maximum Entropy Methods in Science and Engineering, Saratoga Springs, NY,\n  July 8-13, 2007. 10 pages, 1 figure V2 has a small typo in the end of the\n  appendix that was fixed. aj=mj+1 is now aj=m(k-j)+1", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.2821302", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an cs.IT math.IT math.ST physics.comp-ph physics.pop-ph stat.AP stat.CO stat.ME stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  We use the method of Maximum (relative) Entropy to process information in the\nform of observed data and moment constraints.

A popular method for analyzing such\nfunctional data is ``smoothing first, then estimation.'' That is, statistical\ninference such as estimation and hypothesis testing about functional data is\nconducted based on the substitution of the underlying individual functions by\ntheir reconstructions obtained by one smoothing technique or another. However,\nlittle is known about this substitution effect on functional data analysis. In\nthis paper this problem is investigated when the local polynomial kernel (LPK)\nsmoothing technique is used for individual function reconstructions. We find\nthat under some mild conditions, the substitution effect can be ignored\nasymptotically. Based on this, we construct LPK reconstruction-based estimators\nfor the mean, covariance and noise variance functions of a functional data set\nand derive their asymptotics. We also propose a GCV rule for selecting good\nbandwidths for the LPK reconstructions. When the mean function also depends on\nsome time-independent covariates, we consider a functional linear model where\nthe mean function is linearly related to the covariates but the covariate\neffects are functions of time. The LPK reconstruction-based estimators for the\ncovariate effects and the covariance function are also constructed and their\nasymptotics are derived. Moreover, we propose a $L^2$-norm-based global test\nstatistic for a general hypothesis testing problem about the covariate effects\nand derive its asymptotic random expression. The effect of the bandwidths\nselected by the proposed GCV rule on the accuracy of the LPK reconstructions\nand the mean function estimator is investigated via a simulation study.
