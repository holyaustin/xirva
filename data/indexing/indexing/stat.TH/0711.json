Stat. 34 (2006) 1581--1619], Kou,\nZhou & Wong have presented a new stochastic simulation method called the\nequi-energy (EE) sampler. This technique is designed to simulate from a\nprobability measure $\\pi$, perhaps only known up to a normalizing constant. The\nauthors demonstrate that the sampler performs well in quite challenging\nproblems but their convergence results (Theorem 2) appear incomplete. This was\npointed out, in the discussion of the paper, by Atchad\\'e & Liu (2006) who\nproposed an alternative convergence proof. However, this alternative proof,\nwhilst theoretically correct, does not correspond to the algorithm that is\nimplemented. In this note we provide a new proof of convergence of the\nequi-energy sampler based on the Poisson equation and on the theory developed\nin Andrieu et al. (2007) for \\emph{Non-Linear} Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).\nThe objective of this note is to provide a proof of correctness of the EE\nsampler when there is only one feeding chain; the general case requires a much\nmore technical approach than is suitable for a short note.

The analytic signal is first\nlocally represented as a modulated oscillation, demodulated by its own\ninstantaneous frequency, and then Taylor-expanded at each point in time. The\nterms in this expansion, called the instantaneous modulation functions, are\ntime-varying functions which quantify, at increasingly higher orders, the local\ndepartures of the signal from a uniform sinusoidal oscillation. Closed-form\nexpressions for these functions are found in terms of Bell polynomials and\nderivatives of the signal's instantaneous frequency and bandwidth. The analytic\nwavelet transform is shown to depend upon the interaction between the signal's\ninstantaneous modulation functions and frequency-domain derivatives of the\nwavelet, inducing a hierarchy of departures of the transform away from a\nperfect representation of the signal. The form of these deviation terms\nsuggests a set of conditions for matching the wavelet properties to suit the\nvariability of the signal, in which case our expressions simplify considerably.\nOne may then quantify the time-varying bias associated with signal estimation\nvia wavelet ridge analysis, and choose wavelets to minimize this bias.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Nov 2007 12:32:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2009 13:17:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 15 Oct 2011 16:33:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Lilly", "Jonathan M.", ""], ["Olhede", "Sofia C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3924", "submitter": "Florence Merlevede", "authors": "J\\'er\\^ome Dedecker (LSTA), Florence Merlev\\`ede (PMA), Magda\n  Peligrad, Sergey Utev", "title": "Moderate deviations for stationary sequences of bounded random variables", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper we derive the moderate deviation principle for stationary\nsequences of bounded random variables under martingale-type conditions.\nApplications to functions of $\\phi$-mixing sequences, contracting Markov\nchains, expanding maps of the interval, and symmetric random walks on the\ncircle are given.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 Nov 2007 20:34:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-27", "authors_parsed": [["Dedecker", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me", "", "LSTA"], ["Merlev\u00e8de", "Florence", "", "PMA"], ["Peligrad", "Magda", ""], ["Utev", "Sergey", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3931", "submitter": "Akimichi Takemura", "authors": "Satoshi Kuriki and Akimichi Takemura", "title": "The tube method for the moment index in projection pursuit", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, Vol.138, No.9,\n  2749-2762. 2008.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jspi.2008.03.010", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  The projection pursuit index defined by a sum of squares of the third and the\nfourth sample cumulants is known as the moment index proposed by Jones and\nSibson.
