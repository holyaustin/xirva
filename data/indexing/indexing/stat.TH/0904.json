This result is proved under mild\nassumptions and we do not impose any condition on the support of the signal to\nbe estimated. Our procedure is based on data-driven thresholds. As usual, they\ndepend on a threshold parameter $\\gamma$ whose optimal value is hard to\nestimate from the data. Our main concern is to provide some theoretical and\nnumerical results to handle this issue. In particular, we establish the\nexistence of a minimal threshold parameter from the theoretical point of view:\ntaking $\\gamma<1$ deteriorates oracle performances of our procedure. In the\nsame spirit, we establish the existence of a maximal threshold parameter and\nour theoretical results point out the optimal range $\\gamma\\in[1,12]$. Then, we\nlead a numerical study that shows that choosing $\\gamma$ larger than 1 but\nclose to 1 is a fairly good choice. Finally, we compare our procedure with\nclassical ones revealing the harmful role of the support of functions when\nestimated by classical procedures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2009 14:17:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Reynaud-Bouret", "Patricia", ""], ["Rivoirard", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1226", "submitter": "Yaming Yu", "authors": "Yaming Yu", "title": "On an Asymptotic Series of Ramanujan", "comments": "To appear, Ramanujan J", "journal-ref": "Ramanujan J. 20 (2009) 179--188", "doi": "10.1007/s11139-009-9169-x", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.CA stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An asymptotic series in Ramanujan's second notebook (Entry 10, Chapter 3) is\nconcerned with the behavior of the expected value of $\\phi(X)$ for large\n$\\lambda$ where $X$ is a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda$ and $\\phi$\nis a function satisfying certain growth conditions.

We consider quantile regression penalized by the $\\ell_1$-norm of\ncoefficients ($\\ell_1$-QR). First, we show that $\\ell_1$-QR is consistent at\nthe rate $\\sqrt{s/n} \\sqrt{\\log p}$. The overall number of regressors $p$\naffects the rate only through the $\\log p$ factor, thus allowing nearly\nexponential growth in the number of zero-impact regressors. The rate result\nholds under relatively weak conditions, requiring that $s/n$ converges to zero\nat a super-logarithmic speed and that regularization parameter satisfies\ncertain theoretical constraints. Second, we propose a pivotal, data-driven\nchoice of the regularization parameter and show that it satisfies these\ntheoretical constraints. Third, we show that $\\ell_1$-QR correctly selects the\ntrue minimal model as a valid submodel, when the non-zero coefficients of the\ntrue model are well separated from zero. We also show that the number of\nnon-zero coefficients in $\\ell_1$-QR is of same stochastic order as $s$.\nFourth, we analyze the rate of convergence of a two-step estimator that applies\nordinary quantile regression to the selected model.

Each agent\nv receives a signal X_v(0)~N(s, 1) where s is an unknown quantity. A natural\niterative way of estimating s is to perform the following procedure. At\niteration t + 1 let X_v(t + 1) be the average of X_v(t) and of X_w(t) among all\nthe neighbors w of v.\n  In this paper we consider a variant of simple iterative averaging, which\nmodels \"greedy\" behavior of the agents. At iteration t, each agent v declares\nthe value of its estimator X_v(t) to all of its neighbors. Then, it updates\nX_v(t + 1) by taking the maximum likelihood (or minimum variance) estimator of\ns, given X_v(t) and X_w(t) for all neighbors w of v, and the structure of the\ngraph.\n  We give an explicit efficient procedure for calculating X_v(t), study the\nconvergence of the process as t goes to infinity and show that if the limit\nexists then it is the same for all v and w. For graphs that are symmetric under\nactions of transitive groups, we show that the process is efficient. Finally,\nwe show that the greedy process is in some cases more efficient than simple\naveraging, while in other cases the converse is true, so that, in this model,\n\"greed\" of the individual agents may or may not have an adverse affect on the\noutcome.\n  The model discussed here may be viewed as the Maximum-Likelihood version of\nmodels studied in Bayesian Economics. The ML variant is more accessible and\nallows in particular to show the significance of symmetry in the efficiency of\nestimators using networks of agents.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2009 17:57:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2009 06:28:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Tamuz", "Omer", ""]]}]
