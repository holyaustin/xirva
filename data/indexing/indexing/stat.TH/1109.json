These RSPs are typically using the channel\nside information (CSI). Specifically, the relay terminal (RT) is chosen among\nall available RTs by a central entity (CE) which receives all RTs' CSI via\nfeedback channels. However, in the millimeter wave radio frequencies, the rate\nof the CSI variation is much higher than that of the CSI variation in 6 GHz\nfrequencies under the same mobility conditions, which evidently results in a\nserious problem causing that the CSI at the CE is inaccurate for the RSP since\nthe feedback channels have a backhaul / transmission delay.

In this context, we propose in\nthis paper a partial-RSP in dual-hop amplify-and-forward relaying system, which\nutilize only the SSI of the RTs instead of their CSI. Then for the performance\nanalysis, we obtain an exact average unified performance (AUP) of the proposed\nSSI-based partial-RSP for a variety shadowed fading environments. In\nparticular, we offer a generic AUP expression whose special cases include the\naverage bit error probability (ABEP) analysis for binary modulation schemes,\nthe ergodic capacity analysis and the moments-generating function (MGF)-based\ncharacterization. The correctness of our newly theoretical results is validated\nwith some selected numerical examples in an extended generalized-K fading\nenvironment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 12:51:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 10 Jul 2012 01:35:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yilmaz", "Ferkan", ""], ["Alouini", "Mohamed-Slim", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.6611", "submitter": "J\\'er\\'emie Mo\\\"ise Marcel", "authors": "Mo\\\"ise J\\'er\\'emie", "title": "Processus empiriques des rapports de $m$-espacements uniformes disjoints\n  (Non-overlapping uniform $m$-spacings-ratio empirical processes)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider an empirical process based upon ratio of selected pair of the\nnon-overlapping $m$-spacings generated by independent samples of arbitrary\nsizes.

What about a convenient deterrence function?\nHow to calibrate the model when detailed data is not available? We answer\nproposing an extended job search geographical base for commuters living in the\nmunicipalities, we compare two different deterrence functions and we show that\nthe parameter is a constant for network linking French municipalities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 09:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Jan 2012 12:40:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 8 May 2015 07:48:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Lenormand", "Maxime", "", "UR LISC"], ["Huet", "Sylvie", "", "UR LISC"], ["Gargiulo", "Floriana", "", "UR LISC"]]}, {"id": "1109.6760", "submitter": "Maxime Lenormand", "authors": "Maxime Lenormand (UR LISC), Sylvie Huet (UR LISC), Guillaume Deffuant\n  (UR LISC)", "title": "Deriving the number of jobs in proximity services from the number of\n  inhabitants in French rural municipalities", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 7, e40001 (2012)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0040001", "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use a minimum requirement approach to derive the number of jobs in\nproximity services per inhabitant in French rural municipalities.

This problem, called hub\nscreening, is important in many applications ranging from network security to\ncomputational biology to finance to social networks. In the area of network\nsecurity, a node that becomes a hub of high correlation with neighboring nodes\nmight signal anomalous activity such as a coordinated flooding attack. In the\narea of computational biology the set of hubs of a gene expression correlation\ngraph can serve as potential targets for drug treatment to block a pathway or\nmodulate host response. In the area of finance a hub might indicate a\nvulnerable financial instrument or sector whose collapse might have major\nrepercussions on the market. In the area of social networks a hub of observed\ninteractions between criminal suspects could be an influential ringleader. The\ntechniques and theory presented in this paper permit scalable and reliable\nscreening for such hubs. This paper extends our previous work on correlation\nscreening [arXiv:1102.1204] to the more challenging problem of partial\ncorrelation screening for variables with a high degree of connectivity. In\nparticular we consider 1) extension to the more difficult problem of screening\nfor partial correlations exceeding a specified magnitude; 2) extension to\nscreening variables whose vertex degree in the associated partial correlation\ngraph, often called the concentration graph, exceeds a specified degree.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 15:07:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Oct 2011 02:40:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hero", "Alfred", ""], ["Rajaratnam", "Bala", ""]]}]
