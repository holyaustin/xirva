It is well known that Lasso can estimate the nonparametric\nregression function at nearly the oracle rate, and is thus hard to improve\nupon. We show that the OLS post-Lasso estimator performs at least as well as\nLasso in terms of the rate of convergence, and has the advantage of a smaller\nbias. Remarkably, this performance occurs even if the Lasso-based model\nselection \"fails\" in the sense of missing some components of the \"true\"\nregression model. By the \"true\" model, we mean the best s-dimensional\napproximation to the nonparametric regression function chosen by the oracle.\nFurthermore, OLS post-Lasso estimator can perform strictly better than Lasso,\nin the sense of a strictly faster rate of convergence, if the Lasso-based model\nselection correctly includes all components of the \"true\" model as a subset and\nalso achieves sufficient sparsity. In the extreme case, when Lasso perfectly\nselects the \"true\" model, the OLS post-Lasso estimator becomes the oracle\nestimator. An important ingredient in our analysis is a new sparsity bound on\nthe dimension of the model selected by Lasso, which guarantees that this\ndimension is at most of the same order as the dimension of the \"true\" model.\nOur rate results are nonasymptotic and hold in both parametric and\nnonparametric models. Moreover, our analysis is not limited to the Lasso\nestimator acting as a selector in the first step, but also applies to any other\nestimator, for example, various forms of thresholded Lasso, with good rates and\ngood sparsity properties. Our analysis covers both traditional thresholding and\na new practical, data-driven thresholding scheme that induces additional\nsparsity subject to maintaining a certain goodness of fit. The latter scheme\nhas theoretical guarantees similar to those of Lasso or OLS post-Lasso, but it\ndominates those procedures as well as traditional thresholding in a wide\nvariety of experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 22:10:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Mar 2010 14:43:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 11 Jun 2011 22:56:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 25 Aug 2011 02:30:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 12:16:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-21", "authors_parsed": [["Belloni", "Alexandre", ""], ["Chernozhukov", "Victor", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.0200", "submitter": "Jon A.
