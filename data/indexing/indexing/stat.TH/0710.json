A motivating factor is the existence of many different methods of\nestimation, leading to possibly competing estimators. We consider here three\ndifferent types of aggregation: model selection (MS) aggregation, convex (C)\naggregation and linear (L) aggregation. The objective of (MS) is to select the\noptimal single estimator from the list; that of (C) is to select the optimal\nconvex combination of the given estimators; and that of (L) is to select the\noptimal linear combination of the given estimators. We are interested in\nevaluating the rates of convergence of the excess risks of the estimators\nobtained by these procedures. Our approach is motivated by recently published\nminimax results [Nemirovski, A. (2000). Topics in non-parametric statistics.\nLectures on Probability Theory and Statistics (Saint-Flour, 1998). Lecture\nNotes in Math. 1738 85--277. Springer, Berlin; Tsybakov, A. B. (2003). Optimal\nrates of aggregation. Learning Theory and Kernel Machines. Lecture Notes in\nArtificial Intelligence 2777 303--313. Springer, Heidelberg]. There exist\ncompeting aggregation procedures achieving optimal convergence rates for each\nof the (MS), (C) and (L) cases separately. Since these procedures are not\ndirectly comparable with each other, we suggest an alternative solution. We\nprove that all three optimal rates, as well as those for the newly introduced\n(S) aggregation (subset selection), are nearly achieved via a single\n``universal'' aggregation procedure. The procedure consists of mixing the\ninitial estimators with weights obtained by penalized least squares. Two\ndifferent penalties are considered: one of them is of the BIC type, the second\none is a data-dependent $\\ell_1$-type penalty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Oct 2007 08:48:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-29", "authors_parsed": [["Bunea", "Florentina", ""], ["Tsybakov", "Alexandre B.", ""], ["Wegkamp", "Marten H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.3666", "submitter": "Odile Pons", "authors": "Odile Pons", "title": "Regression for partially observed variables and nonparametric quantiles\n  of conditional probabilities", "comments": "Submitted to the Statistics Surveys (http://www.i-journals.org/ss/)\n  by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "IMS-SS-SS_2007_31", "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  Efficient estimation under bias sampling, censoring or truncation is a\ndifficult question which has been partially answered and the usual estimators\nare not always consistent.
