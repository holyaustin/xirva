Standard statistical theory shows that the normalized MLE is\nasymptotically normally distributed with covariance matrix being the inverse of\nthe Fisher information matrix (FIM) at the unknown parameter. Two commonly used\nestimates for the covariance of the MLE are the inverse of the observed FIM\n(the same as the inverse Hessian of the negative log-likelihood) and the\ninverse of the expected FIM (the same as the inverse FIM). Both of the observed\nand expected FIM are evaluated at the MLE from the sample data. In this\ndissertation, we demonstrate that, under reasonable conditions similar to\nstandard MLE conditions, the inverse expected FIM outperforms the inverse\nobserved FIM under a mean squared error criterion. Specifically, in an\nasymptotic sense, the inverse expected FIM (evaluated at the MLE) has no\ngreater mean squared error with respect to the true covariance matrix than the\ninverse observed FIM (evaluated at the MLE) at the element level.
