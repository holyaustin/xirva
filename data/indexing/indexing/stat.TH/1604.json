By probabilistically bounding the\ndistortion of the covariance matrix, we can apply Weyl's theorem to bound the\ndistortion of the precision matrix, yielding a conservative, but sound test\nthreshold for a much wider class of distributions than considered in previous\nworks. The resulting test enables one to answer with statistical significance\nwhether an edge is present in the graph, and convergence results are known for\na wide range of distributions. The computational complexities is linear in the\nsample size enabling the application of the test to large data samples for\nwhich computation time becomes a limiting factor. We experimentally validate\nthe correctness and scalability of the test on multivariate distributions for\nwhich the distributional assumptions of competing tests result in\nunderestimates of the false positive ratio.

A deterministic drift attracts each neuron's membrane\npotential to an equilibrium potential $m.$ When a neuron jumps, its membrane\npotential is reset to $0,$ while the other neurons receive an additional amount\nof potential $\\frac{1}{N}.$ We are interested in the estimation of the jump (or\nspiking) rate of a single neuron based on an observation of the membrane\npotentials of the $N$ neurons up to time $t.$ We study a Nadaraya-Watson type\nkernel estimator for the jump rate and establish its rate of convergence in\n$L^2 .$ This rate of convergence is shown to be optimal for a given H\\\"older\nclass of jump rate functions. We also obtain a central limit theorem for the\nerror of estimation. The main probabilistic tools are the uniform ergodicity of\nthe process and a fine study of the invariant measure of a single neuron.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 15:11:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 13:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Hodara", "Pierre", ""], ["Krell", "Nathalie", ""], ["L\u00f6cherbach", "Eva", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.07449", "submitter": "Ery Arias-Castro", "authors": "Ery Arias-Castro and Yuchao Liu", "title": "Distribution-free Detection of a Submatrix", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of detecting the presence of a submatrix with\nlarger-than-usual values in a large data matrix.
