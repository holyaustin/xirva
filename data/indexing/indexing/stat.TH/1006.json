In this\nregard, it generalizes the notion of incoherence in the existing literature on\nmodel selection and introduces two fundamental measures of coherence---termed\nas the worst-case coherence and the average coherence---among the columns of a\ndesign matrix. It utilizes these two measures of coherence to provide an\nin-depth analysis of a simple, model-order agnostic one-step thresholding (OST)\nalgorithm for model selection and proves that OST is feasible for exact as well\nas partial model selection as long as the design matrix obeys an easily\nverifiable property. One of the key insights offered by the ensuing analysis in\nthis regard is that OST can successfully carry out model selection even when\nmethods based on convex optimization such as the lasso fail due to the rank\ndeficiency of the submatrices of the design matrix. In addition, the paper\nestablishes that if the design matrix has reasonably small worst-case and\naverage coherence then OST performs near-optimally when either (i) the energy\nof any nonzero entry of the signal is close to the average signal energy per\nnonzero entry or (ii) the signal-to-noise ratio in the measurement system is\nnot too high. Finally, two other key contributions of the paper are that (i) it\nprovides bounds on the average coherence of Gaussian matrices and Gabor frames,\nand (ii) it extends the results on model selection using OST to low-complexity,\nmodel-order agnostic recovery of sparse signals with arbitrary nonzero entries.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Jun 2010 19:22:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 12:16:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 2 Jul 2010 19:08:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Bajwa", "Waheed U.", ""], ["Calderbank", "Robert", ""], ["Jafarpour", "Sina", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.0812", "submitter": "Christian Recher Dipl.
