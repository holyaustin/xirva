Sen has contributed extensively to many areas of Statistics\nincluding order statistics, nonparametrics, robust inference, sequential\nmethods, asymptotics, biostatistics, clinical trials, bioenvironmental studies\nand bioinformatics. His long list of over 600 publications and 22 books and\nvolumes along with numerous citations during the past 5 decades bear testimony\nto his work. All three of us have had the good fortune of being associated with\nhim in different capacities. He has given professional and personal advice on\nmany occasions to all of us, and we feel that our lives have certainly been\nenriched by our association with him. He has been over the years a friend,\nphilosopher and a guide to us, and still continues to be one! While parametric\nstatistical inference remains ever so popular, semi-parametric, Bayesian and\nnonparametric inferential methods have attracted great attention from numerous\napplied scientists because of their weaker assumptions, which make them\nnaturally robust and so more appropriate in real-life applications. This\nclearly signals for ``beyond parametrics'' approaches which include\nnonparametrics, semi-parametrics, Bayes methods and many others. Motivated by\nthis feature, and his drive in the ``beyond parametrics'' area, we thought that\nit will be only appropriate for a volume in honor of Pranab Kumar Sen to focus\non this aspect of statistical inference and its applications. With this in\nmind, we have put together this volume in order to (i) review some of the\nrecent developments in this direction, (ii) focus on some new methodologies and\nhighlight their applications, and (iii) suggest some interesting open problems\nand possible new directions for further research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jun 2008 14:32:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["Balakrishnan", "N.", ""], ["Pe\u00f1a", "Edsel A.", ""], ["Silvapulle", "Mervyn J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.4426", "submitter": "Yashwant Singh", "authors": "Yashwant Singh", "title": "On the generalization of Gurland distribution", "comments": "Submitted to the Electronic Journal of Statistics\n  (http://www.i-journals.org/ejs/) by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics\n  (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": "IMS-EJS-EJS_2008_257", "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the present paper a generalization of Gurland distribution [3] is obtained\nas a beta mixture of the generalized Poisson distribution (GPD) of Consul and\nJain [2].

In recognition of\nJayanta's enormous impact, this volume is an effort to honor him by drawing\ntogether contributions to the main areas in which he has worked and continues\nto work. The papers naturally fall into five categories. First, sequential\nestimation was Jayanta's starting point. Thus, beginning with that topic, there\nare two papers, one classical by Hall and Ding leading to a variant on\np-values, and one Bayesian by Berger and Sun extending reference priors to\nstopping time problems. Second, there are five papers in the general area of\nprior specification. Much of Jayanta's earlier work involved group families as\ndoes Sweeting's paper here for instance. There are also two papers dwelling on\nthe link between fuzzy sets and priors, by Meeden and by Delampady and Angers.\nEqually daring is the work by Mukerjee with data dependent priors and the\npleasing confluence of several prior selection criteria found by Ghosh, Santra\nand Kim.
