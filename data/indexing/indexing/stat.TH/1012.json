However in many practical situations of interest, models are\nconstrained structurally so that they only have a few degrees of freedom\nrelative to their ambient dimension. This paper provides a general framework to\nconvert notions of simplicity into convex penalty functions, resulting in\nconvex optimization solutions to linear, underdetermined inverse problems. The\nclass of simple models considered are those formed as the sum of a few atoms\nfrom some (possibly infinite) elementary atomic set; examples include\nwell-studied cases such as sparse vectors and low-rank matrices, as well as\nseveral others including sums of a few permutations matrices, low-rank tensors,\northogonal matrices, and atomic measures. The convex programming formulation is\nbased on minimizing the norm induced by the convex hull of the atomic set; this\nnorm is referred to as the atomic norm. The facial structure of the atomic norm\nball carries a number of favorable properties that are useful for recovering\nsimple models, and an analysis of the underlying convex geometry provides sharp\nestimates of the number of generic measurements required for exact and robust\nrecovery of models from partial information. These estimates are based on\ncomputing the Gaussian widths of tangent cones to the atomic norm ball. When\nthe atomic set has algebraic structure the resulting optimization problems can\nbe solved or approximated via semidefinite programming. The quality of these\napproximations affects the number of measurements required for recovery.

The density is assumed to be smooth, have bounded support, and\nbe uniformly bounded from below on this set. Unlike previous $k$-NN estimators\nof non-linear density functionals, the proposed estimator uses data-splitting\nand boundary correction to achieve lower mean square error. Specifically, we\nassume that $T$ i.i.d. samples ${X}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ from the density are\nsplit into two pieces of cardinality $M$ and $N$ respectively, with $M$ samples\nused for computing a k-nearest-neighbor density estimate and the remaining $N$\nsamples used for empirical estimation of the integral of the density\nfunctional. By studying the statistical properties of k-NN balls, explicit\nrates for the bias and variance of the BPI estimator are derived in terms of\nthe sample size, the dimension of the samples and the underlying probability\ndistribution. Based on these results, it is possible to specify optimal choice\nof tuning parameters $M/T$, $k$ for maximizing the rate of decrease of the mean\nsquare error (MSE). The resultant optimized BPI estimator converges faster and\nachieves lower mean squared error than previous $k$-NN entropy estimators.

First, the sure\nindependence screening property can hold only under the existence of a second\norder moment of predictor variables, rather than exponential tails or\nalikeness, even when the number of predictor variables grows as fast as\nexponentially of the sample size. Second, it can be used to deal with\nsemiparametric models such as transformation regression models and single-index\nmodels under monotonic constraint to the link function without involving\nnonparametric estimation even when there are nonparametric functions in the\nmodels. Third, the procedure can be largely used against outliers and influence\npoints in the observations. Last, the use of indicator functions in rank\ncorrelation screening greatly simplifies the theoretical derivation due to the\nboundedness of the resulting statistics, compared with previous studies on\nvariable screening.
