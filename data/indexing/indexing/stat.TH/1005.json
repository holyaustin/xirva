We show that in the high dimensional case when the dimension $p$ and\nthe observation frequency $n$ grow in the same rate, the limiting spectral\ndistribution (LSD) of RCV depends on the covolatility process not only through\nthe targeting ICV, but also on how the covolatility process varies in time. We\nestablish a Mar\\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for weighted sample covariance\nmatrices, based on which we obtain a Mar\\v{c}enko--Pastur type theorem for RCV\nfor a class $\\mathcal{C}$ of diffusion processes. The results explicitly\ndemonstrate how the time variability of the covolatility process affects the\nLSD of RCV. We further propose an alternative estimator, the time-variation\nadjusted realized covariance (TVARCV) matrix. We show that for processes in\nclass $\\mathcal {C}$, the TVARCV possesses the desirable property that its LSD\ndepends solely on that of the targeting ICV through the Mar\\v{c}enko--Pastur\nequation, and hence, in particular, the TVARCV can be used to recover the\nempirical spectral distribution of the ICV by using existing algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2010 15:29:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 19 Feb 2011 16:55:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 10 Oct 2011 13:21:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 13 Mar 2012 08:38:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Zheng", "Xinghua", ""], ["Li", "Yingying", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1971", "submitter": "Ryan J.
