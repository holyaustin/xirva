They are becoming increasingly popular\nin many scientific fields including biostatistics, medicine, economics and\nfinancial econometrics. Estimating and testing the model index coefficients\n$\\bolds{\\beta}$ is one of the most important objectives in the statistical\nanalysis. However, the commonly used assumption on the index coefficients,\n$\\|\\bolds{\\beta}\\|=1$, represents a nonregular problem: the true index is on\nthe boundary of the unit ball. In this paper we introduce the EFM approach, a\nmethod of estimating functions, to study the single-index model. The procedure\nis to first relax the equality constraint to one with (d-1) components of\n$\\bolds{\\beta}$ lying in an open unit ball, and then to construct the\nassociated (d-1) estimating functions by projecting the score function to the\nlinear space spanned by the residuals with the unknown link being estimated by\nkernel estimating functions. The root-n consistency and asymptotic normality\nfor the estimator obtained from solving the resulting estimating equations are\nachieved, and a Wilks type theorem for testing the index is demonstrated. A\nnoticeable result we obtain is that our estimator for $\\bolds{\\beta}$ has\nsmaller or equal limiting variance than the estimator of Carroll et al. [J.\nAmer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 447-489]. A fixed-point iterative scheme for\ncomputing this estimator is proposed.

We analyze two general types of model, corresponding to whether the\nreference process is in continuous or discrete time. For the former, we\nconsider discrete generation particle models defined by arbitrarily fine time\nmesh approximations of the Feynman-Kac models with continuous time path\nintegrals. For the latter, we assume that the discrete process is observed at\ninteger times and we design new approximation models with geometric interacting\njumps in terms of a sequence of intermediate time steps between the integers.\nIn both situations, we provide non asymptotic bias and variance theorems w.r.t.\nthe time step and the size of the system, yielding what appear to be the first\nresults of this type for this class of Feynman-Kac particle integration models.\nWe also discuss uniform convergence estimates w.r.t. the time horizon. Our\napproach is based on an original semigroup analysis with first order\ndecompositions of the fluctuation errors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Nov 2012 09:16:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Del Moral", "Pierre", "", "INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest and University of\n  Bordeaux"], ["Jacob", "Pierre E.", "", "National University of Singapore"], ["Lee", "Anthony", "", "University of Warwick"], ["Murray", "Lawrence", "", "CSIRO Mathematics, Informatics and\n  Statistics"], ["Peters", "Gareth W.", "", "University College London"]]}, {"id": "1211.7221", "submitter": "Oliver Pfaffel", "authors": "Oliver Pfaffel", "title": "On the spectral norm of large heavy-tailed random matrices with strongly\n  dependent rows and columns", "comments": "11 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a new random matrix ensemble $X$ which is constructed by an\napplication of a two dimensional linear filter to a matrix of iid random\nvariables with infinite fourth moments.
