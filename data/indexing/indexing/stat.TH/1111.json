In this\npaper, we use a dual representation for PLQ penalties to build a statistical\nmodeling framework and a computational theory for Kalman smoothing.\n  We develop a statistical framework by establishing conditions required to\ninterpret PLQ penalties as negative logs of true probability densities. Then,\nwe present a computational framework, based on interior-point methods, that\nsolves the Kalman smoothing problem with PLQ penalties and maintains the linear\ncomplexity in the size of the time series, just as in the L2 case. The\nframework presented extends the computational efficiency of the Mayne-Fraser\nand Rauch-Tung-Striebel algorithms to a much broader non-smooth setting, and\nincludes many known robust and sparse smoothers as special cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Nov 2011 13:06:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-14", "authors_parsed": [["Aravkin", "Aleksandr Y.", ""], ["Burke", "James V.", ""], ["Pillonetto", "Gianluigi", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.2778", "submitter": "Axel B\\\"ucher", "authors": "Axel B\\\"ucher and Stanislav Volgushev", "title": "Empirical and sequential empirical copula processes under serial\n  dependence", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The empirical copula process plays a central role for statistical inference\non copulas.

At any given\ntime $t$, a SMC method produces a set of samples over the state space of the\nsystem of interest (often termed \"particles\") that is used to build a discrete\nand random approximation of the posterior probability distribution of the state\nvariables, conditional on a sequence of available observations. One potential\napplication of the methodology is the estimation of the densities associated to\nthe sequence of a posteriori distributions. While practitioners have rather\nfreely applied such density approximations in the past, the issue has received\nless attention from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of constructing kernel-based estimates of the posterior probability\ndensity function and its derivatives, and obtain asymptotic convergence results\nfor the estimation errors. In particular, we find convergence rates for the\napproximation errors that hold uniformly on the state space and guarantee that\nthe error vanishes almost surely as the number of particles in the filter\ngrows. Based on this uniform convergence result, we first show how to build\ncontinuous measures that converge almost surely (with known rate) toward the\nposterior measure and then address a few applications.

The paper shows how this property can be generalized to the\nregression coefficient of non-linear transformations of Gaussian-mixtures. Due\nto its generality, and the wide use of Gaussians and Gaussian-mixtures to\nstatistically model several phenomena, this theoretical framework can find\napplications in multiple disciplines, such as communication, estimation, and\ninformation theory, when part of the nonlinear transformation input is the\nquantity of interest and the other part is the noise. In particular, the paper\nshows how the said properties can be exploited to simplify closed-form\ncomputation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the estimation mean-squared\nerror (MSE), and bounds on the mutual information in additive non-Gaussian\n(possibly non-linear) channels, also establishing relationships among them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Nov 2011 11:26:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2012 18:44:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 10 May 2013 15:32:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Banelli", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.5989", "submitter": "Djamal Louani DL", "authors": "Djamal Louani and Sidi Mohamed Ould Maouloud", "title": "Large Deviation Results for the Nonparametric Regression Function\n  Estimator on Functional Data", "comments": "23 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.ME stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is devoted to the study of large deviation behaviors in the\nsetting of the estimation of the regression function on functional data.
