We study the behavior of the multivariate group\nLasso, in which block regularization based on the $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norm is used\nfor support union recovery, or recovery of the set of $s$ rows for which $B^*$\nis nonzero. Under high-dimensional scaling, we show that the multivariate group\nLasso exhibits a threshold for the recovery of the exact row pattern with high\nprobability over the random design and noise that is specified by the sample\ncomplexity parameter $\\theta(n,p,s):=n/[2\\psi(B^*)\\log(p-s)]$. Here $n$ is the\nsample size, and $\\psi(B^*)$ is a sparsity-overlap function measuring a\ncombination of the sparsities and overlaps of the $K$-regression coefficient\nvectors that constitute the model. We prove that the multivariate group Lasso\nsucceeds for problem sequences $(n,p,s)$ such that $\\theta(n,p,s)$ exceeds a\ncritical level $\\theta_u$, and fails for sequences such that $\\theta(n,p,s)$\nlies below a critical level $\\theta_{\\ell}$. For the special case of the\nstandard Gaussian ensemble, we show that $\\theta_{\\ell}=\\theta_u$ so that the\ncharacterization is sharp. The sparsity-overlap function $\\psi(B^*)$ reveals\nthat, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$\nregularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to\nan ordinary Lasso approach and can yield substantial improvements in sample\ncomplexity (up to a factor of $K$) when the coefficient vectors are suitably\northogonal. For more general designs, it is possible for the ordinary Lasso to\noutperform the multivariate group Lasso.

In this paper, the regression coefficients\noutside an ideal model are assumed to be small, but not necessarily zero. Under\na sparse Riesz condition on the correlation of design variables, we prove that\nthe LASSO selects a model of the correct order of dimensionality, controls the\nbias of the selected model at a level determined by the contributions of small\nregression coefficients and threshold bias, and selects all coefficients of\ngreater order than the bias of the selected model.

The idea involves a procedure to isolate a\nsubgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a\nmember).

Once the fence is constructed, the\noptimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a\ncriterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of\nthe fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many\npredictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant.\nWe give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a\ndesirable property for a good model selection procedure.

Information Theory provides us with a basic\nfunctional, the relative entropy (or Kullback-Leibler divergence), an\nasymmetrical measure of dissimilarity between the empirical and the theoretical\ndistributions. The formal properties of the relative entropy turn out to be\nable to capture every aspect of Inferential Statistics, as illustrated here,\nfor simplicity, on dices (= i.i.d. process with finitely many outcomes):\nrefutability (strict or probabilistic): the asymmetry data / models; small\ndeviations: rejecting a single hypothesis; competition between hypotheses and\nmodel selection; maximum likelihood: model inference and its limits; maximum\nentropy: reconstructing partially observed data; EM-algorithm; flow data and\ngravity modelling; determining the order of a Markov chain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 15:33:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 3 Apr 2010 14:16:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bavaud", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""]]}]
