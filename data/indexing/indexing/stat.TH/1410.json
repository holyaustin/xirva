The\npresent paper studies upper and lower bounds for the FDR under various\ndependence structures of p-values, namely independence, reverse martingale\ndependence and positive regression dependence on the subset (PRDS) of true null\nhypotheses. The inequalities are based on exact finite sample formulas which\nare also of interest for independent uniformly distributed p-values under the\nnull. As applications the asymptotic worst case FDR of step up and step down\ntests coming from an non-decreasing rejection curve is established. In\naddition, new step up tests are established and necessary conditions for the\nFDR control are discussed. The reverse martingale models yield sharper FDR\nresults than the PRDS models. Already in certain multivariate normal dependence\nmodels the familywise error rate of the Benjamini Hochberg step up test can be\ndifferent from the desired level alpha. The second part of the paper is devoted\nto adaptive step up tests under dependence. The well-known Storey estimator is\nmodified so that the corresponding step up test has finite sample control for\nvarious block wise dependent p-values. These results may be applied to\ndependent genome data. Within each chromosome the p-values may be reverse\nmartingale dependent while the chromosomes are independent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 08:56:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 17:05:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Heesen", "Philipp", ""], ["Janssen", "Arnold", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8570", "submitter": "Guang Cheng", "authors": "Tianqi Zhao, Guang Cheng, Han Liu", "title": "A Partially Linear Framework for Massive Heterogeneous Data", "comments": "40 pages main text + 40 pages suppl, To appear in Annals of\n  Statistics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a partially linear framework for modelling massive heterogeneous\ndata.
