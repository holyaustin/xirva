In combinatorial\ngeometry these transitions appear as abrupt changes in the properties of face\ncounts of convex polytopes when the dimensions are varied. The thresholds in\nthese very different problems appear in the same critical locations after\nappropriate calibration of variables.\n  These thresholds are important in each subject area: for linear modelling,\nthey place hard limits on the degree to which the now-ubiquitous\nhigh-throughput data analysis can be successful; for robustness, they place\nhard limits on the degree to which standard robust fitting methods can tolerate\noutliers before breaking down; for compressed sensing, they define the sharp\nboundary of the undersampling/sparsity tradeoff in undersampling theorems.\n  Existing derivations of phase transitions in combinatorial geometry assume\nthe underlying matrices have independent and identically distributed (iid)\nGaussian elements.

A major reason for this preference is the\nwell-known problem of inconsistency of estimators based on regular sampling,\nwhen the underlying power spectral density is not bandlimited. It is argued in\nthis paper that, in consideration of a large sample property like consistency,\nit is natural to allow the sampling rate to go to infinity as the sample size\ngoes to infinity. Through appropriate asymptotic calculations under this\nscenario, it is shown that the smoothed periodogram based on regularly spaced\ndata is a consistent estimator of the spectral density, even when the latter is\nnot band-limited. It transpires that, under similar assumptions, the estimators\nbased on uniformly sampled and Poisson-sampled data have about the same rate of\nconvergence. Apart from providing this reassuring message, the paper also gives\na guideline for practitioners regarding appropriate choice of the sampling\nrate. Theoretical calculations for large samples and Monte-Carlo simulations\nfor small samples indicate that the smoothed periodogram based on uniformly\nsampled data have less variance and more bias than its counterpart based on\nPoisson sampled data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Jun 2009 07:05:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 May 2010 11:44:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Srivastava", "Radhendushka", ""], ["Sengupta", "Debasis", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.5101", "submitter": "Masoud M.

In this paper, we investigate a more general condition\nfor avoiding effect reversal: A-collapsibility. The conditions of Cox and\nWermuth imply A-collapsibility, without assuming homogeneity. In fact, we show\nthat, when W is a binary variable, collapsibility is equivalent to\nA-collapsibility plus homogeneity, and A-collapsibility is equivalent to the\nconditions of Cox and Wermuth. Recently, Cox (2007) extended Cochran's result\non regression coefficients of conditional and marginal models, to quantile\nregression coefficients. The conditions of Cox and Wermuth are sufficient for\nA-collapsibility of quantile regression coefficients. If the conditional\ndistribution of W, given Y = y and X = x, belong to one-dimensional natural\nexponential family, they are also necessary.
