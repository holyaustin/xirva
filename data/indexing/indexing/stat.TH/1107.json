There we showed some standard statistical properties of the sample\nextremogram. A major difficulty was the construction of credible confidence\nbands for the extremogram. In this paper, we employ the stationary bootstrap to\novercome this problem. Moreover, we introduce the cross extremogram as a\nmeasure of extremal serial dependence between two or more time series. We also\nstudy the extremogram for return times between extremal events. The use of the\nstationary bootstrap for the extremogram and the resulting interpretations are\nillustrated in several univariate and multivariate financial time series\nexamples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 20:54:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Davis", "Richard A.", ""], ["Mikosch", "Thomas", ""], ["Cribben", "Ivor", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5859", "submitter": "Justin Wishart", "authors": "Justin Rory Wishart", "title": "Minimax lower bound for kink location estimators in a nonparametric\n  regression model with long-range dependence", "comments": "To appear in Statistics & Probability Letters", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, a lower bound is determined in the minimax sense for change\npoint estimators of the first derivative of a regression function in the\nfractional white noise model.
