Such estimator arises as the solution\nof a convex penalized likelihood optimization problem based on the group-lasso\npenalty. We illustrate how it is possible to construct an estimator of the\nunderlying log-linear model using the blocks of nonzero coefficients recovered\nby the group-lasso procedure. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the\ngroup-lasso estimator as a model selection method in a double-asymptotic\nframework, in which both the sample size and the model complexity grow\nsimultaneously. We provide conditions guaranteeing that the group-lasso\nestimator is model selection consistent, in the sense that, with overwhelming\nprobability as the sample size increases, it correctly identifies all the sets\nof nonzero interactions among the variables. Provided the sequences of true\nunderlying models is sparse enough, recovery is possible even if the number of\ncells grows larger than the sample size. Finally, we derive some central limit\ntype of results for the log-linear group-lasso estimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Sep 2007 20:25:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 05:19:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Nardi", "Yuval", ""], ["Rinaldo", "Alessandro", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.3535", "submitter": "Alessandro Rinaldo", "authors": "S.E.

Furthermore, the rates\nof the replication are often controlled by exogenous parameters causing periods\nof expansion and contraction, e.g., baby booms and busts, economic booms and\nrecessions, etc. In addition, the sizes of these objects often have reflective\nlower boundaries, e.g., cities do not fall bellow a certain size, low income\nindividuals are subsidized by the government, companies are protected by\nbankruptcy laws, etc.\n  Hence, it is natural to propose reflected modulated branching processes as\ngeneric models for many of the preceding observations.
