However, the standard PCA suffers from the fact that the principal\ncomponents (PCs) are usually linear combinations of all the original variables,\nand it is thus often difficult to interpret the PCs. To alleviate this\ndrawback, various sparse PCA approaches were proposed in literature [15, 6, 17,\n28, 8, 25, 18, 7, 16]. Despite success in achieving sparsity, some important\nproperties enjoyed by the standard PCA are lost in these methods such as\nuncorrelation of PCs and orthogonality of loading vectors. Also, the total\nexplained variance that they attempt to maximize can be too optimistic. In this\npaper we propose a new formulation for sparse PCA, aiming at finding sparse and\nnearly uncorrelated PCs with orthogonal loading vectors while explaining as\nmuch of the total variance as possible. We also develop a novel augmented\nLagrangian method for solving a class of nonsmooth constrained optimization\nproblems, which is well suited for our formulation of sparse PCA. We show that\nit converges to a feasible point, and moreover under some regularity\nassumptions, it converges to a stationary point. Additionally, we propose two\nnonmonotone gradient methods for solving the augmented Lagrangian subproblems,\nand establish their global and local convergence. Finally, we compare our\nsparse PCA approach with several existing methods on synthetic, random, and\nreal data, respectively.

This embedding represents any probability\nmeasure as a mean element in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A\npseudometric on the space of probability measures can be defined as the\ndistance between distribution embeddings: we denote this as $\\gamma_k$, indexed\nby the kernel function $k$ that defines the inner product in the RKHS.\n  We present three theoretical properties of $\\gamma_k$.

While previously published conditions may apply only\nin restricted circumstances (e.g. on compact domains), and are difficult to\ncheck, our conditions are straightforward and intuitive: bounded continuous\nstrictly positive definite kernels are characteristic. Alternatively, if a\nbounded continuous kernel is translation-invariant on $\\bb{R}^d$, then it is\ncharacteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the\nentire $\\bb{R}^d$.

Furthermore, a novel hierarchical prior model for\nobtaining edge-preserving conditional mean estimates is introduced. The\nconvergence of the method with respect to finer discretization is studied and\nthe posterior distribution is shown to converge weakly. Finally, theoretical\nfindings are illustrated by a numerical example with simulated data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2009 12:42:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2009 13:38:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Helin", "Tapio", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.5397", "submitter": "Divyanshu Vats", "authors": "Divyanshu Vats, Jose M.

Under\nappropriate conditions, the recursions for the random field are linear\nstochastic differential/difference equations driven by white noise, for which\nwe derive recursive estimation algorithms, that extend standard algorithms,\nlike the Kalman-Bucy filter and the Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother, to noncausal\nMarkov random fields.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Jul 2009 19:10:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2010 02:17:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 12 Aug 2010 17:20:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 20 Dec 2010 00:33:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Vats", "Divyanshu", ""], ["Moura", "Jose M.
