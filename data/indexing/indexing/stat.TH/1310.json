More often than\nnot, modern scientific findings rely on statistical analysis of\nhigh-dimensional data. At a minimum, reproducibility manifests itself in\nstability of statistical results relative to \"reasonable\" perturbations to data\nand to the model used. Jacknife, bootstrap, and cross-validation are based on\nperturbations to data, while robust statistics methods deal with perturbations\nto models. In this article, a case is made for the importance of stability in\nstatistics. Firstly, we motivate the necessity of stability for interpretable\nand reliable encoding models from brain fMRI signals. Secondly, we find strong\nevidence in the literature to demonstrate the central role of stability in\nstatistical inference, such as sensitivity analysis and effect detection.\nThirdly, a smoothing parameter selector based on estimation stability (ES),\nES-CV, is proposed for Lasso, in order to bring stability to bear on\ncross-validation (CV). ES-CV is then utilized in the encoding models to reduce\nthe number of predictors by 60% with almost no loss (1.3%) of prediction\nperformance across over 2,000 voxels. Last, a novel \"stability\" argument is\nseen to drive new results that shed light on the intriguing interactions\nbetween sample to sample variability and heavier tail error distribution (e.g.,\ndouble-exponential) in high-dimensional regression models with $p$ predictors\nand $n$ independent samples. In particular, when\n$p/n\\rightarrow\\kappa\\in(0.3,1)$ and the error distribution is\ndouble-exponential, the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is a better estimator than\nthe Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) estimator.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2013 05:54:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yu", "Bin", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.0333", "submitter": "Nikolai Leonenko", "authors": "Danijel Grahovac, Mofei Jia, Nikolai N.

Despite its ubiquity,\nprovision of accurate and tractable approximations to its distribution under\nthe alternative has been a longstanding open problem. Assuming Gaussian\nobservations and a rank one alternative, or concentrated non-centrality, we\nderive simple yet accurate approximations for the most common low-dimensional\nsettings. These include signal detection in noise, multiple response\nregression, multivariate analysis of variance and canonical correlation\nanalysis. A small noise perturbation approach, perhaps underused in statistics,\nleads to simple combinations of standard univariate distributions, such as\ncentral and non-central $\\chi^2$ and $F$. Our results allow approximate power\nand sample size calculations for Roy's test for rank one effects, which is\nprecisely where it is most powerful.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Oct 2013 12:23:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 15 Jun 2014 05:59:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 3 Jul 2015 18:44:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Johnstone", "Iain M.", ""], ["Nadler", "Boaz", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.6713", "submitter": "Asaf Cohen", "authors": "Asaf Cohen", "title": "Parameter Estimation: The Proper Way to Use Bayesian Posterior Processes\n  with Brownian Noise", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Mathematics of Operations Research, 40 (2), 361-389, 2015", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST math.OC math.PR stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper studies a problem of Bayesian parameter estimation for a sequence\nof scaled counting processes whose weak limit is a Brownian motion with an\nunknown drift.

Under the\nassumption that the true parameter vector is sparse we propose a panel-Lasso\nestimator and establish finite sample upper bounds on its estimation error\nunder two different sets of conditions on the covariates as well as the error\nterms. In particular, we allow for heteroscedastic and non-gaussian error terms\nwhich are weakly dependent over time. Upper bounds on the estimation error of\nthe unobserved heterogeneity are also provided under the assumption of\nsparsity. Next, we show that our upper bounds are essentially optimal in the\nsense that they can only be improved by multiplicative constants.

On the other hand, various popular\ndensity estimators such as kernel and wavelet density estimators are optimal in\nthe strong topology in the sense of achieving the minimax rate over all\nestimators for a Sobolev ball of densities. Recently, it has been shown in a\nseries of papers by Gin\\'{e} and Nickl that these density estimators on\n$\\mathbb{R}$ that are optimal in strong topology are also optimal in\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathcal{F}}$ for certain choices of $\\mathcal{F}$ such that\n$\\|\\cdot\\|_{\\mathcal{F}}$ metrizes the weak topology, where\n$\\|\\mathbb{P}\\|_{\\mathcal{F}}:=\\sup\\{\\int f\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{P}:\nf\\in\\mathcal{F}\\}$.
