In this view a theory is scientific if\nit can be used to build a data compression program, and it is valuable if it\ncan compress a standard benchmark database to a small size, taking into account\nthe length of the compressor itself. This methodology therefore includes an\nOccam principle as well as a solution to the problem of demarcation. Because of\nthe fundamental difficulty of lossless compression, this type of research must\nbe empirical in nature: compression can only be achieved by discovering and\ncharacterizing empirical regularities in the data. Because of this, the\nphilosophy provides a way to reformulate fields such as computer vision and\ncomputational linguistics as empirical sciences: the former by attempting to\ncompress databases of natural images, the latter by attempting to compress\nlarge text databases. The book argues that the rigor and objectivity of the\ncompression principle should set the stage for systematic progress in these\nfields. The argument is especially strong in the context of computer vision,\nwhich is plagued by chronic problems of evaluation.\n  The book also considers the field of machine learning. Here the traditional\napproach requires that the models proposed to solve learning problems be\nextremely simple, in order to avoid overfitting. However, the world may contain\nintrinsically complex phenomena, which would require complex models to\nunderstand. The compression philosophy can justify complex models because of\nthe large quantity of data being modeled (if the target database is 100 Gb, it\nis easy to justify a 10 Mb model). The complex models and abstractions learned\non the basis of the raw data (images, language, etc) can then be reused to\nsolve any specific learning problem, such as face recognition or machine\ntranslation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 18:46:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Burfoot", "Daniel", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.5617", "submitter": "Diego Colombo", "authors": "Diego Colombo, Marloes H.
