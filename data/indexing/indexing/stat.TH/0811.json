In this\npaper we model the medium-term log-return dynamics in a market with both\nfundamental and technical traders. This is based on a Poisson trade arrival\nmodel with variable size orders. With simplifications we are led to a hybrid\nSDE mixing both arithmetic and geometric Brownian motions, whose solution is\ngiven by a class of integrals of exponentials of one Brownian motion against\nanother, in forms considered by Yor and collaborators. The reduction of the\nhybrid SDE to a single Brownian motion leads to an SDE of the form considered\nby Nagahara, which is a type of \"Pearson diffusion\", or equivalently a\nhyperbolic OU SDE. Various dynamics and equilibria are possible depending on\nthe balance of trades. Under mean-reverting circumstances we arrive naturally\nat an equilibrium fat-tailed return distribution with a Student or Pearson Type\nIV form. Under less restrictive assumptions richer dynamics are possible,\nincluding bimodal structures. The phenomenon of variance explosion is\nidentified that gives rise to much larger price movements that might have a\npriori been expected, so that \"$25\\sigma$\" events are significantly more\nprobable. We exhibit simple example solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation\nthat shows how such variance explosion can hide beneath a standard Gaussian\nfacade.

The essential questions\nanswered are the following. Let x be any fixed point on the unit sphere in\n$R^p$, where $p\\ge 3$. What are the distributions of $U_2=x'\\Gamma^2 x$ and\n$U_3=x'\\Gamma^3 x$? It is clear by orthogonal invariance that these\ndistribution do not depend on x, so that we can, without loss of generality,\ntake x to be $x_0=(1,0,...,0)'\\in R^p$. Call this the \"north pole\". Then\n$x_0'\\Gamma^ k x_0$ is the first component of the vector $\\Gamma^k x_0$. We\nderive stochastic representations for the exact distributions of $U_2$ and\n$U_3$ in terms of random variables with known distributions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Nov 2008 20:50:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Eaton", "Morris L.", ""], ["Muirhead", "Robb J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.2741", "submitter": "Anne Philippe", "authors": "Youri Davydov (LPP), Alexender Nagaev, Anne Philippe (LMJL)", "title": "On peeling procedure applied to a Poisson point process", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In the focus of our attention is the asymptotic properties of the sequence of\nconvex hulls which arise as a result of a peeling procedure applied to the\nconvex hull generated by a Poisson point process.
