We consider the problem of approximating a function belonging\nto an arbitrary real-valued RKHS on R^d based on approximate observations of\nthe function. The observations are approximate in the sense that the actual\nobservations (i.e., the true function values) are known only to belong to a\nconvex set of admissible observations. We seek a minimax optimal approximation\nfor the function that minimizes the supremum of the RKHS norm on the error\nbetween the true function and the chosen approximation subject only to the\nconditions that the true function belongs to a uniformly bounded uncertainty\nset of functions that satisfy the constraints on the observations and that the\napproximation is a member of the RKHS. We refer to such a solution as a minimax\nrobust reconstruction. We characterize the solution to the minimax robust\nreconstruction problem and show that it is equivalent to solving a\nstraightforward convex optimization problem. We demonstrate that a minimax\nrobust reconstruction will generally be more stable than an approximation based\non interpolation through a nominal set of observations and that, subject to\nsome mild regularity conditions on the convex set of admissible observations,\nthe minimax robust reconstruction is unconditionally stable. We motivate our\nresults by characterizing the minimax robust reconstruction for several\nspecific convex observational models and discuss relationships with other\napproaches to function approximation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2007 21:49:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 3 Jan 2013 20:38:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 5 Jan 2013 20:06:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-08", "authors_parsed": [["Barton", "Richard J.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0257", "submitter": "Emmanuel Gobet", "authors": "Arnaud Gloter (LAMA), Emmanuel Gobet (LJK)", "title": "LAMN property for hidden processes: the case of integrated diffusions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare (B) Probability and\n  Statistics 44, 1 (2008) 104-128", "doi": "10.1214/07-AIHP111", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper we prove the Local Asymptotic Mixed Normality (LAMN) property\nfor the statistical model given by the observation of local means of a\ndiffusion process $X$.
