The single-index is\nidentified by the best approximation to the multivariate prediction function of\nthe response variable, regardless of whether the prediction function is a\ngenuine single-index function. A polynomial spline estimator is proposed for\nthe single-index prediction coefficients, and is shown to be root-n consistent\nand asymptotically normal. An iterative optimization routine is used which is\nsufficiently fast for the user to analyze large data of high dimension within\nseconds.
