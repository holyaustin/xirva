In such cases, one can resort to so-called choice functions. They\nprovide a means to determine which options in a particular set are optimal, and\nallow incomparability among any number of options. Applying choice functions in\nsequential decision problems can be highly non-trivial, as the usual properties\nof maximising expected utility may no longer be satisfied. In this paper, we\nstudy one of these properties: we revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of\nsubgame perfectness in the context of decision trees, leading us to the concept\nof subtree perfectness, which basically says that the optimal solution of a\ndecision tree should not depend on any larger tree it may be embedded in. In\nother words, subtree perfectness excludes counterfactual reasoning, and\ntherefore may be desirable from some philosophical points of view. Subtree\nperfectness is also desirable from a practical point of view, because it admits\nefficient algorithms for solving decision trees, such as backward induction.\nThe main contribution of this paper is a very simple non-technical criterion\nfor determining whether any given choice function will satisfy subtree\nperfectness or not. We demonstrate the theorem and illustrate subtree\nperfectness, or the lack thereof, through numerous examples, for a wide variety\nof choice functions, where incomparability amongst strategies can be caused by\nimprecision in either probabilities or utilities. We find that almost no choice\nfunction, except for maximising expected utility, satisfies it in general. We\nalso find that choice functions other than maximising expected utility can\nsatisfy it, provided that we restrict either the structure of the tree, or the\nstructure of the choice function.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 12:58:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-10", "authors_parsed": [["Huntley", "Nathan", ""], ["Troffaes", "Matthias C.
