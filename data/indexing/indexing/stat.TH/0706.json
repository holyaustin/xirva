In\nthe context of panel time series where one observes data from several\nindividuals, it is often too strong to assume the joint linearity of processes.\nInstead the methods developed in this paper enable us to quantify the\ndependence through 2-mixing which allows for nonlinearity. We propose an\nestimator of the panel mean function and obtain its rate of convergence. We\nshow that under certain conditions the rate of convergence can be improved by\nallowing the number of individuals in the panel to increase with time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2007 18:48:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Johannes", "Jan", ""], ["Rao", "Suhasini Subba", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.3968", "submitter": "Lutz Duembgen", "authors": "Lutz Duembgen, G\\\"unther Walther", "title": "Multiscale inference about a density", "comments": "Version 2 is an extended version (Technical report 56, IMSV, Univ.\n  Bern) which is referred to in version 3.

Such\nproblems have appeared in the literature of a diverse set of fields including\nsystem identification and control, Euclidean embedding, and collaborative\nfiltering. Although specific instances can often be solved with specialized\nalgorithms, the general affine rank minimization problem is NP-hard. In this\npaper, we show that if a certain restricted isometry property holds for the\nlinear transformation defining the constraints, the minimum rank solution can\nbe recovered by solving a convex optimization problem, namely the minimization\nof the nuclear norm over the given affine space. We present several random\nensembles of equations where the restricted isometry property holds with\noverwhelming probability. The techniques used in our analysis have strong\nparallels in the compressed sensing framework. We discuss how affine rank\nminimization generalizes this pre-existing concept and outline a dictionary\nrelating concepts from cardinality minimization to those of rank minimization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jun 2007 04:54:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Recht", "Benjamin", ""], ["Fazel", "Maryam", ""], ["Parrilo", "Pablo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.4169", "submitter": "Domenico Marinucci", "authors": "P.
