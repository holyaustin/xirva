Our Gauss-Markov theorem demonstrates that\nOLS is a \"best linear unbiased estimator\", extending the classical result. We\nconstruct a stochastic version of the OLS estimator, which is a continuous\ndisintegration exactly for the class of \"uncorrelated implies independent\"\n(UII) measures. As a consequence, Gaussian measures always exhibit continuous\ndisintegrations through continuous linear maps, extending a theorem of the\nfirst author. Applying this framework to some problems in machine learning, we\nprove a useful representation theorem for covariance tensors, and show that OLS\ndefines a good kriging predictor for vector-valued arrays on general index\nspaces.

When considering non-smooth regularizers,\nsuch as the popular l1-norm corresponding to soft-thresholding mapping, the\nSURE is a discontinuous function of the parameters preventing the use of\ngradient descent optimization techniques. Instead, we focus on an approximation\nof the SURE based on finite differences as proposed in (Ramani et al., 2008).\nUnder mild assumptions on the estimation mapping, we show that this\napproximation is a weakly differentiable function of the parameters and its\nweak gradient, coined the Stein Unbiased GrAdient estimator of the Risk\n(SUGAR), provides an asymptotically (with respect to the data dimension)\nunbiased estimate of the gradient of the risk. Moreover, in the particular case\nof soft-thresholding, it is proved to be also a consistent estimator. This\ngradient estimate can then be used as a basis to perform a quasi-Newton\noptimization.

Random forests are an\nensemble learning method for classification and regression that constructs a\nnumber of randomized decision trees during the training phase and predicts by\naveraging the results. Since its publication in the seminal paper of Breiman\n(2001), the procedure has become a major data analysis tool, that performs well\nin practice in comparison with many standard methods. What has greatly\ncontributed to the popularity of forests is the fact that they can be applied\nto a wide range of prediction problems and have few parameters to tune. Aside\nfrom being simple to use, the method is generally recognized for its accuracy\nand its ability to deal with small sample sizes, high-dimensional feature\nspaces and complex data structures. The random forest methodology has been\nsuccessfully involved in many practical problems, including air quality\nprediction (winning code of the EMC data science global hackathon in 2012, see\nhttp://www.kaggle.com/c/dsg-hackathon), chemoinformatics [Svetnik et al.\n(2003)], ecology [Prasad, Iverson and Liaw (2006), Cutler et al.

Many\ndifferent ideas have been proposed to solve this problem. However, there is not\na simple way to do inference even for its simple cases. This paper studies the\nspecial bilinear model $$Y_t=\\mu+\\phi Y_{t-2}+ bY_{t-2}\\varepsilon_{t-1}+\n\\varepsilon_t,$$ where $\\{\\varepsilon_t\\}$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random\nvariables with mean zero. We first give a sufficient condition for the\nexistence of a unique stationary solution for the model and then propose a\nGARCH-type maximum likelihood estimator for estimating the unknown parameters.\nIt is shown that the GMLE is consistent and asymptotically normal under only\nfinite fourth moment of errors. Also a simple consistent estimator for the\nasymptotic covariance is provided. A simulation study confirms the good finite\nsample performance. Our estimation approach is novel and nonstandard and it may\nprovide a new insight for future research in this direction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 May 2014 04:18:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Ling", "Shiqing", ""], ["Peng", "Liang", ""], ["Zhu", "Fukang", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.3082", "submitter": "Rahul Mukerjee", "authors": "Rahul Mukerjee and S.

The new hierarchical approaches are then compared\nusing a dataset examining the effect of telomere defects on yeast.
