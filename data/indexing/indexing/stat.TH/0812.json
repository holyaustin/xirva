The ideal threshold optimizes the\nclassification error. In \\cite{PNAS} we showed that HCT was numerically close\nto the ideal threshold. We formalize an asymptotic framework for studying the\nRW model, considering a sequence of problems with increasingly many features\nand relatively fewer observations. We show that along this sequence, the\nlimiting performance of ideal HCT is essentially just as good as the limiting\nperformance of ideal thresholding. Our results describe two-dimensional {\\it\nphase space}, a two-dimensional diagram with coordinates quantifying \"rare\" and\n\"weak\" in the RW model. Phase space can be partitioned into two regions -- one\nwhere ideal threshold classification is successful, and one where the features\nare so weak and so rare that it must fail. Surprisingly, the regions where\nideal HCT succeeds and fails make the exact same partition of the phase\ndiagram. Other threshold methods, such as FDR threshold selection, are\nsuccessful in a substantially smaller region of the phase space than either HCT\nor Ideal thresholding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 11 Dec 2008 22:02:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Donoho", "David", ""], ["Jin", "Jiashun", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.2548", "submitter": "Andreas N.

In this work, a more general\nscenario is considered where the change propagates across the sensors, and its\npropagation can be modeled as a Markov process. A centralized, Bayesian version\nof this problem, with a fusion center that has perfect information about the\nobservations and a priori knowledge of the statistics of the change process, is\nconsidered. The problem of minimizing the average detection delay subject to\nfalse alarm constraints is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision\nprocess (POMDP). Insights into the structure of the optimal stopping rule are\npresented. In the limiting case of rare disruptions, we show that the structure\nof the optimal test reduces to thresholding the a posteriori probability of the\nhypothesis that no change has happened. We establish the asymptotic optimality\n(in the vanishing false alarm probability regime) of this threshold test under\na certain condition on the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between the post-\nand the pre-change densities. In the special case of near-instantaneous change\npropagation across the sensors, this condition reduces to the mild condition\nthat the K-L divergence be positive.

Within the exponential family parameter irredundancy, local\nidentifiability, gradient weak local identifiability and weak local\nidentifiability are shown to be equivalent. We consider applications to a\nrecently developed class of cancer models of Little and Wright (Math\nBiosciences 183 (2003) 111-134) and Little et al. (J Theoret Biol 254 (2008)\n229-238) that generalize a large number of other recently used quasi-biological\ncancer models, in particular those of Armitage and Doll (Br J Cancer 8 (1954)\n1-12) and the two-mutation model (Moolgavkar and Venzon Math Biosciences 47\n(1979) 55-77).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2008 19:04:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 12 Aug 2009 11:23:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 11:20:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 28 Feb 2010 17:29:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Little", "Mark P.", ""], ["Heidenreich", "Wolfgang F.", ""], ["Li", "Guangquan", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4881", "submitter": "Daniel B.

People have long before\nnoticed the weakness of the convex $l_1$-constraint (or the soft-thresholding)\nin wavelets and have designed many different forms of nonconvex penalties to\nincrease model sparsity and accuracy. But for a nonorthogonal regression\nmatrix, there is great difficulty in both investigating the performance in\ntheory and solving the problem in computation. TISP provides a simple and\nefficient way to tackle this so that we successfully borrow the rich results in\nthe orthogonal design to solve the nonconvex penalized regression for a general\ndesign matrix. Our starting point is, however, thresholding rules rather than\npenalty functions. Indeed, there is a universal connection between them. But a\ndrawback of the latter is its non-unique form, and our approach greatly\nfacilitates the computation and the analysis. In fact, we are able to build the\nconvergence theorem and explore theoretical properties of the selection and\nestimation via TISP nonasymptotically. More importantly, a novel Hybrid-TISP is\nproposed based on hard-thresholding and ridge-thresholding. It provides a\nfusion between the $l_0$-penalty and the $l_2$-penalty, and adaptively achieves\nthe right balance between shrinkage and selection in statistical modeling. In\npractice, Hybrid-TISP shows superior performance in test-error and is\nparsimonious.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2008 12:34:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 29 Nov 2009 06:12:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-29", "authors_parsed": [["She", "Yiyuan", ""]]}]
