Natural criterion functions are often unavailable for general\nfunctional measurement error models due to the lack of information on the\ndistribution of the unobservable covariates.

In addition, the construction\nof such estimating equations routinely requires solving integral equations,\nhence the computation is often much more intensive compared with ordinary\nregression models. Because of these difficulties, traditional best subset\nvariable selection procedures are not applicable, and in the measurement error\nmodel context, variable selection remains an unsolved issue.

Using a new law of iterated logarithm for\nmartingales, we prove the convergence of the adaptive quantile estimators for\ngeneral distributions with nonunique quantiles thereby extending the work of\nFeldman and Tucker [Ann. Math. Statist. 37 (1996) 451--457]. We illustrate the\nalgorithm with an example from credit portfolio risk analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 09:34:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Egloff", "Daniel", ""], ["Leippold", "Markus", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.4959", "submitter": "Jens Ledet Jensen", "authors": "Jens Ledet Jensen", "title": "On some problems in the article \"Efficient Likelihood Estimation in\n  State Space Models\" by Cheng-Der Fuh", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-AOS748A the Annals of\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org/aos/) by the Institute of Mathematical\n  Statistics (http://www.imstat.org)", "journal-ref": "Annals of Statistics 2010, Vol. 38, No. 2, 1279-1281", "doi": "10.1214/09-AOS748A", "report-no": "IMS-AOS-AOS748A", "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  On some problems in the article \"Efficient Likelihood Estimation in State\nSpace Models\" by Cheng-Der Fuh [Ann.
