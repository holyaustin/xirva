In order to overcome some\nlimitations of its areas of application, coming from stationarity of its\nincrements as well as constancy over time of its self-similarity exponent,\nStoev and Taqqu introduced in \\cite{stoev2004stochastic} an extension of LFSM,\ncalled Linear Multifractional Stable Motion (LMSM), in which the Hurst\nparameter becomes a function $H(\\cdot)$ depending on the time variable $t$.\nSimilarly to LFSM, the tail heaviness of the marginal distributions of LMSM is\ndetermined by $\\al$; also, under some conditions, its self-similarity is\ngoverned by $H(\\cdot)$ and its path roughness is closely related to\n$H(\\cdot)-1/\\al$. Namely, it was shown in \\cite{stoev2004stochastic} that\n$H(t_0)$ is the self-similarity exponent of LMSM at a time $t_0\\neq 0$;\nmoreover, very recently, it was established in \\cite{hamonier2012lmsm}, that\nthe quantities $\\min_{t\\in I} H(t)-1/\\al$, and $H(t_0)-1/\\al$, are respectively\nthe uniform H\\\"older exponent of LMSM on a compact interval $I$, and its local\nH\\\"older exponent at $t_0$.\n  The main goal of our article, is to construct, using wavelet coefficients of\nLMSM, strongly consistent (i.e. almost surely convergent) statistical\nestimators of $\\min_{t\\in I} H(t)$, $H(t_0)$, and $\\al$; our estimation\nresults, are obtained when $\\al\\in (1,2)$, and, $H(\\cdot)$ is a H\\\"older\nfunction smooth enough, with values in a compact subinterval\n$[\\underline{H},\\bar{H}]$ of $(1/\\al,1)$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2013 15:26:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Ayache", "Antoine", ""], ["Hamonier", "Julien", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.3073", "submitter": "Chintan Mehta", "authors": "Marc Hallin, Chintan Mehta", "title": "R-Estimation for Asymmetric Independent Component Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.ME math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Independent Component Analysis (ICA) recently has attracted attention in the\nstatistical literature as an alternative to elliptical models.

We focus here on estimating the model's\nmixing matrix. Traditional methods (FOBI, Kernel-ICA, FastICA) originating from\nthe engineering literature have consistency that requires moment conditions\nwithout achieving any type of asymptotic efficiency.

The semiparametric approach by Chen and Bickel (2006)\nachieves semiparametric efficiency but requires estimating the k unobserved\nindependent component densities. As a reaction, an efficient\n(signed-)rank-based approach has been proposed by Ilmonen and Paindaveine\n(2011) for the case of symmetric component densities that fail to be root-n\nconsistent as soon as one of the component densities is asymmetric. In this\npaper, using ranks rather than signed ranks, we extend their approach to the\nasymmetric case and propose a one-step R-estimator for ICA mixing matrices.
