In modern\nhigh-dimensional applications, a common approach to finding sparse positive\ndefinite matrices is to threshold their small off-diagonal elements.

Thresholding has the attractive property that the resulting matrices\nare sparse, and are thus easier to interpret and work with. In many\napplications, it is often required, and thus implicitly assumed, that\nthresholded matrices retain positive definiteness.

When the decomposition of a random process\nis performed -- which occurs in particular when an additive noise is corrupting\nthe signal to be analyzed -- it is useful to characterize the statistical\nproperties of the dual-tree wavelet coefficients of this process. As dual-tree\ndecompositions constitute overcomplete frame expansions, correlation structures\nare introduced among the coefficients, even when a white noise is analyzed. In\nthis paper, we show that it is possible to provide an accurate description of\nthe covariance properties of the dual-tree coefficients of a wide-sense\nstationary process. The expressions of the (cross-)covariance sequences of the\ncoefficients are derived in the one and two-dimensional cases. Asymptotic\nresults are also provided, allowing to predict the behaviour of the\nsecond-order moments for large lag values or at coarse resolution. In addition,\nthe cross-correlations between the primal and dual wavelets, which play a\nprimary role in our theoretical analysis, are calculated for a number of\nclassical wavelet families.
