When applying the\nMI approach to BSS problems, one usually determines the analytical expressions\nof the derivatives of the MI with respect to the parameters of the considered\nseparating model. In the literature, these calculations were mainly reported\nfor linear mixtures up to now. They are more complex for nonlinear mixtures,\ndue to dependencies between the considered quantities. Moreover, the notations\ncommonly employed by the BSS community in such calculations may become\nmisleading when using them for nonlinear mixtures, due to the above-mentioned\ndependencies. We claim that the calculations reported in [4] contain an error,\nbecause they did not take into account all these dependencies. In this\ndocument, we therefore explain this phenomenon, by showing the effect of\nindirect dependencies on the application of the MI approach to the mixing and\nseparating models considered in [4].
