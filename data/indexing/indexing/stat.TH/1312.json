The issue of modelling or estimating the probability of the\nsimultaneous occurrence of such extremal pressures is now crucial from the risk\nassessment point of view. In this paper, heavy-tail modelling, widely used as a\nconservative approach to risk assessment and corresponding to a worst-case risk\nanalysis, is applied to the study of sloshing. Multivariate heavy-tailed\ndistributions are considered, with Sloshing pressures investigated by means of\nsmall-scale replica tanks instrumented with d >1 sensors. When attempting to\nfit such nonparametric statistical models, one naturally faces computational\nissues inherent in the phenomenon of dimensionality. The primary purpose of\nthis article is to overcome this barrier by introducing a novel methodology.\nFor d-dimensional heavy-tailed distributions, the structure of extremal\ndependence is entirely characterised by the angular measure, a positive measure\non the intersection of a sphere with the positive orthant in Rd. As d\nincreases, the mutual extremal dependence between variables becomes difficult\nto assess. Based on a spectral clustering approach, we show here how a low\ndimensional approximation to the angular measure may be found. The\nnonparametric method proposed for model sloshing has been successfully applied\nto pressure data. The parsimonious representation thus obtained proves to be\nvery convenient for the simulation of multivariate heavy-tailed distributions,\nallowing for the implementation of Monte-Carlo simulation schemes in estimating\nthe probability of failure. Besides confirming its performance on artificial\ndata, the methodology has been implemented on a real data set specifically\ncollected for risk assessment of sloshing in the LNG shipping industry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 21:10:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Dematteo", "Antoine", "", "TSI"], ["CLEMENCON", "St\u00e9phan", "", "TSI"], ["Vayatis", "Nicolas", "", "CMLA"], ["Mougeot", "Mathilde", "", "LPMA"]]}, {"id": "1312.0142", "submitter": "Chao Gao", "authors": "Chao Gao, Harrison H.

It is well known that the standard\ncadre of computationally tractable sparse regression algorithms---such as the\nLasso, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), and their extensions---perform poorly\nwhen the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. To address this\nshortcoming, we develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that\niteratively swaps variables until convergence. SWAP is surprisingly effective\nin handling measurement matrices with high correlations. In fact, we prove that\nSWAP outputs the true support, the locations of the non-zero entries in the\nsparse vector, under a relatively mild condition on the measurement matrix.\nFurthermore, we show that SWAP can be used to boost the performance of any\nsparse regression algorithm. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of SWAP\nby comparing it with several state-of-the-art sparse regression algorithms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 21:27:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 22 Feb 2014 19:38:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Vats", "Divyanshu", ""], ["Baraniuk", "Richard G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.1830", "submitter": "Youssef  Mroueh", "authors": "Youssef Mroueh, Lorenzo Rosasco", "title": "Quantization and Greed are Good: One bit Phase Retrieval, Robustness and\n  Greedy Refinements", "comments": "fixed typos; added a plot", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we study the problem of robust phase recovery.

The problem of selecting the optimal numbers of clusters and\nsegments is solved by means of the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Specifically, we\nconsider critical values based upon (i) the union bound combined with a\nmoderate deviation inequality for self-normalized sums, (ii) the multiplier and\nempirical bootstraps, and (iii) two-step and three-step variants of (i) and\n(ii) by incorporating the selection of uninformative inequalities that are far\nfrom being binding and a novel selection of weakly informative inequalities\nthat are potentially binding but do not provide first order information. We\nprove validity of these methods, showing that under mild conditions, they lead\nto tests with the error in size decreasing polynomially in $n$ while allowing\nfor $p$ being much larger than $n$, indeed $p$ can be of order $\\exp (n^{c})$\nfor some $c > 0$. Importantly, all these results hold without any restriction\non the correlation structure between $p$ Studentized statistics, and also hold\nuniformly with respect to suitably large classes of underlying distributions.\nMoreover, in the online supplement, we show validity of a test based on the\nblock multiplier bootstrap in the case of dependent data under some general\nmixing conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 02:46:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jun 2014 15:53:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 22:09:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 05:33:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Sun, 30 Sep 2018 17:22:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 18 Oct 2018 18:06:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Chernozhukov", "Victor", ""], ["Chetverikov", "Denis", ""], ["Kato", "Kengo", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7709", "submitter": "Yannis Yatracos", "authors": "Yannis G.

For the\nestimation of an $n$-dimensional mean vector $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ in the\nGaussian sequence model, is it possible to find an adaptive optimal threshold\nestimator in a full range of sparsity levels where nonadaptive optimality can\nbe achieved by threshold estimators? We provide an explicit affirmative answer\nas follows. Under the squared loss, adaptive minimaxity in strong and weak\n$\\ell_p$ balls with $0\\le p<2$ is achieved by a class of smooth threshold\nestimators with the threshold level of the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR rule or its a\ncertain approximation, provided that the minimax risk is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$ for some $\\delta_n\\to 0$. For $p=0$, this\nmeans adaptive minimaxity in $\\ell_0$ balls when $1\\le\n\\|\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\|_0\\ll n$. The class of smooth threshold estimators\nincludes the soft and firm threshold estimators but not the hard threshold\nestimator. The adaptive minimaxity in such a wide range is a delicate problem\nsince the same is not true for the FDR hard threshold estimator at certain\nthreshold and nominal FDR levels. The above adaptive minimaxity of the FDR\nsmooth-threshold estimator is established by proving a stronger notion of\nadaptive ratio optimality for the soft threshold estimator in the sense that\nthe risk for the FDR threshold level is uniformly within an infinitesimal\nfraction of the risk for the optimal threshold level for each unknown vector,\nwhen the minimum risk of nonadaptive soft threshold estimator is between\n$n^{-\\delta_n}$ and $\\delta_n n$. It is an interesting consequence of this\nadaptive ratio optimality that the FDR smooth-threshold estimator outperforms\nthe sample mean in the common mean model $\\theta_i=\\mu$ when $|\\mu|<n^{-1/2}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 20:00:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Wenhua", ""], ["Zhang", "Cun-Hui", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7857", "submitter": "Peter Orbanz", "authors": "Peter Orbanz and Daniel M.
