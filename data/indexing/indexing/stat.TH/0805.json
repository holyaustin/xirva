When the OL is\nmultimodal, but the state transition pdf (STP) is narrow enough, the optimal\nimportance density is usually unimodal. Under this assumption, many techniques\nhave been proposed. But when the STP is broad, this assumption does not hold.\nWe study how existing techniques can be generalized to situations where the\noptimal importance density is multimodal, but is unimodal conditioned on a part\nof the state vector. Sufficient conditions to test for the unimodality of this\nconditional posterior are derived. The number of particles, N, to accurately\ntrack using a PF increases with state space dimension, thus making any regular\nPF impractical for large dimensional tracking problems. We propose a solution\nthat partially addresses this problem. An important class of large dimensional\nproblems with multimodal OL is tracking spatially varying physical quantities\nsuch as temperature or pressure in a large area using a network of sensors\nwhich may be nonlinear and/or may have non-negligible failure probabilities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 May 2008 05:41:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Vaswani", "Namrata", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.0074", "submitter": "Jean-Marc Bardet", "authors": "Jean-Marc Bardet (CES, SAMOS), Pierre Bertrand (LMA-Clermont)", "title": "A nonparametric estimator of the spectral density of a continuous-time\n  Gaussian process observed at random times", "comments": "Scandinavian Journal of Statistics To appear (2010) 1-41", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In numerous applications data are observed at random times and an estimated\ngraph of the spectral density may be relevant for characterizing and explaining\nphenomena.
