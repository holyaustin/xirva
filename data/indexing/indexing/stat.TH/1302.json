In matrix recovery, one takes $n <\nMN$ linear measurements $y_1,..., y_n$ of $X_0$, where $y_i = \\Tr(a_i^T X_0)$\nand each $a_i$ is a $M$ by $N$ matrix. For measurement matrices with Gaussian\ni.i.d entries, it known that if $X_0$ is of low rank, it is recoverable from\njust a few measurements. A popular approach for matrix recovery is Nuclear Norm\nMinimization (NNM). Empirical work reveals a \\emph{phase transition} curve,\nstated in terms of the undersampling fraction $\\delta(n,M,N) = n/(MN)$, rank\nfraction $\\rho=r/N$ and aspect ratio $\\beta=M/N$. Specifically, a curve\n$\\delta^* = \\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$ exists such that, if $\\delta >\n\\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$, NNM typically succeeds, while if $\\delta <\n\\delta^*(\\rho;\\beta)$, it typically fails. An apparently quite different\nproblem is matrix denoising in Gaussian noise, where an unknown $M$ by $N$\nmatrix $X_0$ is to be estimated based on direct noisy measurements $Y = X_0 +\nZ$, where the matrix $Z$ has iid Gaussian entries. It has been empirically\nobserved that, if $X_0$ has low rank, it may be recovered quite accurately from\nthe noisy measurement $Y$.
