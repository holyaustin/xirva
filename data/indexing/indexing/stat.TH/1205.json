The\npresence of the convex constraint complicates various issues in asymptotic\nanalysis, particularly uniform convergence analysis. To overcome this\ndifficulty, we establish the uniform Lipschitz property of optimal spline\ncoefficients in the $\\ell_\\infty$-norm by exploiting piecewise linear and\npolyhedral theory. Based upon this property, it is shown that this estimator\nattains optimal rates of convergence on the entire interval of interest over\nthe H\\\"older class under both the risks. In addition, adaptive estimates are\nconstructed under both the sup-norm risk and the pointwise risk when the\nexponent of the H\\\"older class is between one and two. These estimates achieve\na maximal risk within a constant factor of the minimax risk over the H\\\"older\nclass.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 20:09:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xiao", ""], ["Shen", "Jinglai", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0241", "submitter": "Ilya Shpitser", "authors": "Ilya Shpitser", "title": "Counterfactual Graphical Models for Longitudinal Mediation Analysis with\n  Unobserved Confounding", "comments": "To appear in the 2012 Rumelhart prize special issue of Cognitive\n  Science honoring Judea Pearl", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Questions concerning mediated causal effects are of great interest in\npsychology, cognitive science, medicine, social science, public health, and\nmany other disciplines. For instance, about 60% of recent papers published in\nleading journals in social psychology contain at least one mediation test\n(Rucker, Preacher, Tormala, & Petty, 2011). Standard parametric approaches to\nmediation analysis employ regression models, and either the \"difference method\"\n(Judd & Kenny, 1981), more common in epidemiology, or the \"product method\"\n(Baron & Kenny, 1986), more common in the social sciences. In this paper we\nfirst discuss a known, but perhaps often unappreciated fact: that these\nparametric approaches are a special case of a general counterfactual framework\nfor reasoning about causality first described by Neyman (1923), and Rubin\n(1974), and linked to causal graphical models by J. Robins (1986), and Pearl\n(2000). We then show a number of advantages of this framework. First, it makes\nthe strong assumptions underlying mediation analysis explicit. Second, it\navoids a number of problems present in the product and difference methods, such\nas biased estimates of effects in certain cases.

Toward\nthis end, in the spirit of the SURE theory, a key step is to compute the (weak)\nderivative and divergence of a solution with respect to the observations. As\nsuch a solution is not available in closed form, but rather through a proximal\nsplitting algorithm, we propose to recursively compute the divergence from the\nsequence of iterates. A second challenge that we unlocked is the computation of\nthe (weak) derivative of the proximity operator of a spectral function. To show\nthe potential applicability of our approach, we exemplify it on a matrix\ncompletion problem to objectively and automatically select the regularization\nparameter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 May 2012 18:55:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Oct 2012 10:44:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2012 20:28:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Deledalle", "Charles-Alban", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Vaiter", "Samuel", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Peyr\u00e9", "Gabriel", "", "CEREMADE"], ["Fadili", "Jalal", "", "GREYC"], ["Dossal", "Charles", "", "IMB"]]}, {"id": "1205.1595", "submitter": "Andreas Maurer", "authors": "Andreas Maurer", "title": "Thermodynamics and concentration", "comments": "Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/10-BEJ341 the Bernoulli\n  (http://isi.cbs.nl/bernoulli/) by the International Statistical\n  Institute/Bernoulli Society (http://isi.cbs.nl/BS/bshome.htm)", "journal-ref": "Bernoulli 2012, Vol. 18, No. 2, 434-454", "doi": "10.3150/10-BEJ341", "report-no": "IMS-BEJ-BEJ341", "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We show that the thermal subadditivity of entropy provides a common basis to\nderive a strong form of the bounded difference inequality and related results\nas well as more recent inequalities applicable to convex Lipschitz functions,\nrandom symmetric matrices, shortest travelling salesmen paths and weakly\nself-bounding functions.

There\nare many aspects of dynamical networks that require statistical considerations.\nIn this paper we focus on determining network structure. Estimating dynamic\nnetworks is a difficult task since the number of components involved in the\nsystem is very large. As a result, the number of parameters to be estimated is\nbigger than the number of observations. However, a characteristic of many\nnetworks is that they are sparse. For example, the molecular structure of genes\nmake interactions with other components a highly-structured and therefore\nsparse process.\n  Penalized Gaussian graphical models have been used to estimate sparse\nnetworks. However, the literature has focussed on static networks, which lack\nspecific temporal constraints. We propose a structured Gaussian dynamical\ngraphical model, where structures can consist of specific time dynamics, known\npresence or absence of links and block equality constraints on the parameters.\nThus, the number of parameters to be estimated is reduced and accuracy of the\nestimates, including the identification of the network, can be tuned up. Here,\nwe show that the constrained optimization problem can be solved by taking\nadvantage of an efficient solver, logdetPPA, developed in convex optimization.\nMoreover, model selection methods for checking the sensitivity of the inferred\nnetworks are described.

The covariate takes\nvalues in $L^2[0,1]$, the Hilbert space of the square-integrable real-valued\nfunctions on the unit interval. The error term could be directly observed as a\nresponse or \\emph{estimated} from a functional parametric model, like for\ninstance the functional linear regression. Our test is based on the remark that\nchecking the no-effect of the functional covariate is equivalent to checking\nthe nullity of the conditional expectation of the error term given a\nsufficiently rich set of projections of the covariate. Such projections could\nbe on elements of norm 1 from finite-dimension subspaces of $L^2[0,1]$. Next,\nthe idea is to search a finite-dimension element of norm 1 that is, in some\nsense, the least favorable for the null hypothesis. Finally, it remains to\nperform a nonparametric check of the nullity of the conditional expectation of\nthe error term given the scalar product between the covariate and the selected\nleast favorable direction. For such finite-dimension search and nonparametric\ncheck we use a kernel-based approach. As a result, our test statistic is a\nquadratic form based on univariate kernel smoothing and the asymptotic critical\nvalues are given by the standard normal law. The test is able to detect\nnonparametric alternatives, including the polynomial ones. The error term could\npresent heteroscedasticity of unknown form. We do no require the law of the\ncovariate $X$ to be known. The test could be implemented quite easily and\nperforms well in simulations and real data applications.

Nevertheless, simulations can sometimes be time-consuming. In this\ncase, an approximation of the code input/output relation is made using a\nmetamodel. Actually, a computer code can often be run at different levels of\ncomplexity and a hierarchy of levels of code can hence be obtained. For\nexample, it can be a finite element model with a more or less fine mesh. The\naim of our research is to study the use of several levels of a code to predict\nthe output of a costly computer code. The presented multi-stage metamodel is a\nparticular case of co-kriging which is a well-known geostatistical method. We\nfirst describe the construction of the co-kriging model and we focus then on a\nsequential experimental design strategy. Indeed, one of the strengths of\nco-kriging is that it provides through the predictive co-kriging variance an\nestimation of the model error at each point of the input space parameter.\nTherefore, to improve the surrogate model we can sequentially add points in the\ntraining set at locations where the predictive variances are the largest ones.\nNonetheless, in a multi-fidelity framework, we also have to choose which level\nof code we have to run. We present here different strategies to choose this\nlevel.
