An aircraft\nequipped with an amount~$x$ of ammunition is intercepted by enemy airplanes\narriving according to a homogenous Poisson process over a fixed time\nduration~$t$. Upon encountering an enemy, the aircraft has the choice of\nspending any amount~$0\\le y\\le x$ of its ammunition, resulting in the\naircraft's survival with probability equal to some known increasing function of\n$y$. Two different goals have been considered in the literature concerning the\noptimal amount~$K(x,t)$ of ammunition spent: (i)~Maximizing the probability of\nsurviving for time~$t$, which is the so-called Bomber Problem, and (ii)\nmaximizing the number of enemy airplanes shot down during time~$t$, which we\ncall the Fighter Problem. Several authors have attempted to settle the\nfollowing conjectures about the monotonicity of $K(x,t)$: [A] $K(x,t)$ is\ndecreasing in $t$, [B] $K(x,t)$ is increasing in $x$, and [C] the\namount~$x-K(x,t)$ held back is increasing in $x$. [A] and [C] have been shown\nfor the Bomber Problem with discrete ammunition, while [B] is still an open\nquestion. In this paper we consider both time and ammunition continuous, and\nfor the Bomber Problem prove [A] and [C], while for the Fighter we prove [A]\nand [C] for one special case and [B] and [C] for another.

There exist many other interesting\nvariations of this technique, as reviewed in [Calhoun et al. 2009 Neuroimage\n45: S163-172]. We present methods for the more general problem of discovering\nfunctional connectivity occurring at all possible time lags.

Our approach is based on a Fisher Lecture given by R.D. Cook where it\nis shown that SIR axes can be interpreted as solutions of an inverse regression\nproblem. In this paper, a Gaussian prior distribution is introduced on the\nunknown parameters of the inverse regression problem in order to regularize\ntheir estimation.
