Focusing on models in which there is some structure of independence\nof some of the observed variables conditioned on hidden ones, we demonstrate a\ngeneral approach for establishing identifiability utilizing algebraic\narguments. A theorem of J. Kruskal for a simple latent-class model with finite\nstate space lies at the core of our results, though we apply it to a diverse\nset of models. These include mixtures of both finite and nonparametric product\ndistributions, hidden Markov models and random graph mixture models, and lead\nto a number of new results and improvements to old ones. In the parametric\nsetting, this approach indicates that for such models, the classical definition\nof identifiability is typically too strong. Instead generic identifiability\nholds, which implies that the set of nonidentifiable parameters has measure\nzero, so that parameter inference is still meaningful. In particular, this\nsheds light on the properties of finite mixtures of Bernoulli products, which\nhave been used for decades despite being known to have nonidentifiable\nparameters. In the nonparametric setting, we again obtain identifiability only\nwhen certain restrictions are placed on the distributions that are mixed, but\nwe explicitly describe the conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Sep 2008 18:11:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 12:02:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Allman", "Elizabeth S.", ""], ["Matias", "Catherine", ""], ["Rhodes", "John A.", ""]]}]
