It examines the philosophical foundations of the statistical\narguments used to evaluate hypotheses in evolutionary biology, based on simple\nexamples and likelihood ratios. The difficulty with reading the book from a\nstatistician's perspective is the reluctance of the author to engage into model\nbuilding and even less into parameter estimation. The first chapter nonetheless\nconstitutes a splendid coverage of the most common statistical approaches to\ntesting and model comparison, even though the advocation of the Akaike\ninformation criterion against Bayesian alternatives is rather forceful. The\nbook also covers an examination of the \"intelligent design\" arguments against\nthe Darwinian evolution theory, predictably if unnecessarily resorting to\nPopperian arguments to correctly argue that the creationist perspective fails\nto predict anything. The following chapters cover the more relevant issues of\nassessing selection versus drift and of testing for the presence of a common\nancestor. While remaining a philosophy treatise, Evidence and Evolution is\nwritten in a way that is accessible to laymen, if rather unusual from a\nstatistician viewpoint, and the insight about testing issues gained from\nEvidence and Evolution makes it a worthwhile read.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Apr 2010 16:13:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Robert", "Christian P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5151", "submitter": "Alexandre d'Aspremont", "authors": "Alexandre d'Aspremont, Noureddine El Karoui", "title": "Weak Recovery Conditions from Graph Partitioning Bounds and Order\n  Statistics", "comments": "Final version", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.OC math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a weaker formulation of the nullspace property which guarantees\nrecovery of sparse signals from linear measurements by l_1 minimization.

In\nultrahigh dimensional linear regressions where the dimensionality is much\nlarger than sample size, traditional variance estimation techniques are not\napplicable. Recent advances on variable selection in ultrahigh dimensional\nlinear regressions make this problem accessible. One of the major problems in\nultrahigh dimensional regression is the high spurious correlation between the\nunobserved realized noise and some of the predictors. As a result, the realized\nnoises are actually predicted when extra irrelevant variables are selected,\nleading to serious underestimate of the noise level. In this paper, we propose\na two-stage refitted procedure via a data splitting technique, called refitted\ncross-validation (RCV), to attenuate the influence of irrelevant variables with\nhigh spurious correlations. Our asymptotic results show that the resulting\nprocedure performs as well as the oracle estimator, which knows in advance the\nmean regression function. The simulation studies lend further support to our\ntheoretical claims. The naive two-stage estimator which fits the selected\nvariables in the first stage and the plug-in one stage estimators using LASSO\nand SCAD are also studied and compared. Their performances can be improved by\nthe proposed RCV method.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Apr 2010 03:43:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Dec 2010 20:07:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Fan", "Jianqing", ""], ["Guo", "Shaojun", ""], ["Hao", "Ning", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.5199", "submitter": "Ouerdia Arkoun", "authors": "Ouerdia Arkoun (LMRS)", "title": "Sequential adaptive estimators in nonparametric autoregressive models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We constuct a sequential adaptive procedure for estimating the autoregressive\nfunction at a given point in nonparametric autoregression models with Gaussian\nnoise.

Using recent deviation bounds\non the KL divergence, we prove that KL-UCRL provides the same guarantees as\nUCRL2 in terms of regret. However, numerical experiments on classical\nbenchmarks show a significantly improved behavior, particularly when the MDP\nhas reduced connectivity.
