In a completely\ndifferent setting, this paper is devoted to analyze some statistical\napplications of the Poincar\\'{e} cone property (when defined in a slightly\nstronger version). First, we show that this condition can be seen as a sort of\ngeneralized convexity: while it is considerably less restrictive than\nconvexity, it still retains some ``convex flavour.'' In particular, when\nimposed to a probability support $S$, this property allows the estimation of\n$S$ from a random sample of points, using the ``hull principle'' much in the\nsame way as a convex support is estimated using the convex hull of the sample\npoints. The statistical properties of such hull estimator (consistency,\nconvergence rates, boundary estimation) are considered in detail. Second, it is\nshown that the class of sets fulfilling the Poincar\\'{e} property is a\n$P$-Glivenko-Cantelli class for any absolutely continuous distribution $P$ on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$.

In the one-dimensional case,\ncomputing the probability for a given mean and variance simply requires the\nevaluation of the corresponding Gaussian density. In the $n$-dimensional\nsetting, however, it requires the inversion of an $n \\times n$ covariance\nmatrix, $C$, as well as the evaluation of its determinant, $\\det(C)$. In many\ncases, such as regression using Gaussian processes, the covariance matrix is of\nthe form $C = \\sigma^2 I + K$, where $K$ is computed using a specified\ncovariance kernel which depends on the data and additional parameters\n(hyperparameters). The matrix $C$ is typically dense, causing standard direct\nmethods for inversion and determinant evaluation to require $\\mathcal O(n^3)$\nwork. This cost is prohibitive for large-scale modeling.
