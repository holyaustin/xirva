In this paper, we establish heavy\ntraffic limit theorems to provide suitable approximations for the system under\nfirst-in first-out (FIFO) and work conserving service discipline, which state\nthat, when the lengths of both ON- and OFF-periods are lightly tailed, the\nsequences of the scaled queue length and workload processes converge weakly to\nshort-range dependent reflecting Gaussian processes, and when the lengths of\nON- and/or OFF periods are heavily tailed with infinite variance, the sequences\nconverge weakly to either reflecting fractional Brownian motions (FBMs) or\ncertain type of long-range dependent reflecting Gaussian processes depending on\nthe choice of scaling as the number of superposed sources tends to infinity.\nMoreover, the sequences exhibit a state space collapse-like property when the\nnumber of sources is large enough, which is a kind of extension of the\nwell-known Little's law for M/M/1 queueing system. Theory to justify the\napproximations is based on appropriate heavy traffic conditions which\nessentially mean that the service rate closely approaches the arrival rate when\nthe number of input sources tends to infinity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2011 19:33:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dai", "Wanyang", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.1404", "submitter": "Noureddine El Karoui", "authors": "Noureddine El Karoui and Holger Koesters", "title": "Geometric sensitivity of random matrix results: consequences for\n  shrinkage estimators of covariance and related statistical methods", "comments": "68 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Shrinkage estimators of covariance are an important tool in modern applied\nand theoretical statistics.

Two surprising consequences to be explored in further\nwork are that (in)distinguishability factors are automatically predicted from\nthe problem formulation and that a quantity related to the thermodynamic\nentropy production is found by considering information loss in non-equilibrium\nprocesses. Using the problem of ion channel thermodynamics as an example, we\nillustrate the idea of building up complexity by successively adding\ninformation to create progressively more complex descriptions of a physical\nsystem. Our result is that such statistical mechanical descriptions can be used\nto create transparent, computable, experimentally-relevant models that may be\ninformed by more detailed atomistic simulations.

We prove\nthat the weighted and unweighted TCLs are optimized by the ensembles of\nunit-specific posterior quantiles and posterior medians, respectively. In\naddition, we relate these classification loss functions on parameter ensembles\nto the concepts of posterior sensitivity and specificity. Finally, we find some\nrelationships between the unweighted TCL and the absolute value loss, which\nexplain why both functions are minimized by posterior medians.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 15:54:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 14:15:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Ginestet", "Cedric E.", ""], ["Best", "Nicky G.", ""], ["Richardson", "Sylvia", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6351", "submitter": "Arash Ali Amini", "authors": "Arash A.

This\npaper develops generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) algorithms for\nminimum mean-squared error estimation of a random vector from quantized linear\nmeasurements, notably allowing the linear expansion to be overcomplete or\nundercomplete and the scalar quantization to be regular or non-regular. GAMP is\na recently-developed class of algorithms that uses Gaussian approximations in\nbelief propagation and allows arbitrary separable input and output channels.\nScalar quantization of measurements is incorporated into the output channel\nformalism, leading to the first tractable and effective method for\nhigh-dimensional estimation problems involving non-regular scalar quantization.\nNon-regular quantization is empirically demonstrated to greatly improve\nrate-distortion performance in some problems with oversampling or with\nundersampling combined with a sparsity-inducing prior. Under the assumption of\na Gaussian measurement matrix with i.i.d. entries, the asymptotic error\nperformance of GAMP can be accurately predicted and tracked through the state\nevolution formalism. We additionally use state evolution to design MSE-optimal\nscalar quantizers for GAMP signal reconstruction and empirically demonstrate\nthe superior error performance of the resulting quantizers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 19:31:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Nov 2011 05:01:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Kamilov", "Ulugbek", ""], ["Goyal", "Vivek K.", ""], ["Rangan", "Sundeep", ""]]}]
