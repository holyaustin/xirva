The framework\nembraces many of the central themes developed by Steve Grossberg in his\nextensive body of work in the past 50 years. By embracing head on the\nleitmotifs of dynamics, decentralized computation, emergence, selection and\ncompetition, and autonomy, it is proposed that a science of the mind-brain can\nbe developed that is built upon a solid foundation of understanding behavior\nwhile employing computational and mathematical tools in an integral manner. A\nkey implication of the framework is that standard ways of thinking about\ncausation are inadequate when unravelling the workings of a complex system such\nas the brain. Instead, it is proposed that researchers should focus on\ndetermining the dynamic multivariate structure of brain data. Accordingly,\ncentral problems become to characterize the dimensionality of neural\ntrajectories, and the geometry of the underlying neural space. At a time when\nthe development of neurotechniques has reached a fever pitch, neuroscience\nneeds to redirect its focus and invest comparable energy in the conceptual and\ntheoretical dimensions of its research endeavor. Otherwise we run the risk of\nbeing able to measure 'every atom' in the brain in a theoretical vacuum.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2019 14:03:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pessoa", "Luiz", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.00951", "submitter": "Jan-Hendrik Schleimer", "authors": "Jan-Hendrik Schleimer, Janina Hesse, Susana Andrea Contreras, Susanne\n  Schreiber", "title": "Firing statistics in the bistable regime of neurons with homoclinic\n  spike generation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

In two of the three spike onset bifurcation sequences\nthat are known to give rise to all-or-none type action potentials, however, the\nresting-state fixpoint and limit cycle spiking can coexist in an intermediate\nregime, resulting in bistable dynamics. Here, noise can induce switches between\nthe attractors, i.e., between rest and spiking, and thus increase the\nvariability of the spike train compared to neurons with only one stable\nattractor. Qualitative features of the resulting spike statistics depend on the\nspike onset bifurcations. This study focuses on the creation of the spiking\nlimit cycle via the saddle-homoclinic orbit (HOM) bifurcation and derives\ninterspike interval (ISI) densities for a conductance-based neuron model in the\nbistable regime. The ISI densities of bistable homoclinic neurons are found to\nbe unimodal yet distinct from the inverse Gaussian distribution associated with\nthe saddle-node-on-invariant-cycle (SNIC) bifurcation. It is demonstrated that\nfor the HOM bifurcation the transition between rest and spiking is mainly\ndetermined along the downstroke of the action potential -- a dynamical feature\nthat is not captured by the commonly used reset neuron models. The deduced\nspike statistics can help to identify HOM dynamics in experimental data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Feb 2019 18:42:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2020 18:09:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Schleimer", "Jan-Hendrik", ""], ["Hesse", "Janina", ""], ["Contreras", "Susana Andrea", ""], ["Schreiber", "Susanne", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.01210", "submitter": "Liliana Camarillo Rodriguez", "authors": "L.

So,\nthe conclusion is that biological quantum networks can only approximately solve\nsmall instances of NP-hard problems.\n  On the other hand, artificial intelligence and machine learning implemented\nin complex dynamical systems based on genuine quantum networks can certainly be\nexpected to show enhanced performance and quantum advantage compared with\nclassical networks. Nevertheless, even quantum networks can only be expected to\nefficiently solve NP-hard problems approximately. In the end it is a question\nof precision - Nature is approximate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2019 14:12:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 16 Mar 2019 15:09:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 May 2019 19:07:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Wendin", "G\u00f6ran", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.03309", "submitter": "Jason Kim", "authors": "Jason Z.

To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,\nvisual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate\nprediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft\nvisual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven\nfeatures (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also\nassume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.\nHowever, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for\nmaximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding\nframework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer\nlearning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a\nnonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear\nmapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve\nprediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can\nsignificantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,\nV1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.\nComparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding\nmodels, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher\nprediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively\nanterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new\nframework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings\nfrom visual features to brain activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 23 Feb 2019 14:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Chi", ""], ["Qiao", "Kai", ""], ["Wang", "Linyuan", ""], ["Tong", "Li", ""], ["Hu", "Guoen", ""], ["Zhang", "Ruyuan", ""], ["Yan", "Bin", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09189", "submitter": "Markus Kern", "authors": "Markus Kern, Johanna Ruescher, Andreas Schulze-Bonhage, Tonio Ball", "title": "Cortical Mirror-System Activation During Real-Life Game Playing: An\n  Intracranial Electroencephalography (EEG) Study", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figure, CCN 2018 conference paper", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.32470/CCN.2018.1096-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Analogous to the mirror neuron system repeatedly described in monkeys as a\npossible substrate for imitation learning and/or action understanding, a\nneuronal execution/observation matching system (OEMS) is assumed in humans, but\nlittle is known to what extent this system is activated in non-experimental,\nreal-life conditions.

Here, we show that there is a hidden peril in thresholding\ncontinuous times series --either from empirical or synthetic data-- for the\ndetection of avalanches. In particular, we consider two possible alternative\ndefinitions of avalanche size used e.g. in the empirical determination of\navalanche exponents in the analysis of neural-activity data. By performing\nanalytical and computational studies of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (taken as\na guiding example) we show that if (i) relatively large threshold values are\nemployed to determine the beginning and ending of avalanches and if (ii) --as\nsometimes done in the literature-- avalanche sizes are defined as the total\narea (above zero) of the avalanche, then true asymptotic scaling behavior is\nnot seen, instead the observations are dominated by transient effects. These\ncan induce misinterpretations of the resulting scaling regimes as well as to a\nwrong assignation of universality classes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2019 11:29:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 12:53:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 10 Sep 2019 08:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Villegas", "Pablo", ""], ["di Santo", "Serena", ""], ["Burioni", "Raffaella", ""], ["Mu\u00f1oz", "Miguel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10597", "submitter": "Peter Zeidman", "authors": "Peter Zeidman, Amirhossein Jafarian, Nad\\`ege Corbin, Mohamed L.\n  Seghier, Adeel Razi, Cathy J.

MFDE is robust to the presence of baseline wanders,\nor trends, in the data. We evaluate MFDE, compared with popular multiscale\nsample entropy (MSE), and the recently introduced multiscale dispersion entropy\n(MDE), on selected synthetic data and five neurological diseases' datasets: 1)\nfocal and non-focal electroencephalograms (EEGs); 2) walking stride interval\nsignals for young, elderly, and Parkinson's subjects; 3) stride interval\nfluctuations for Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; 4)\nEEGs for controls and Alzheimer's disease patients; and 5) eye movement data\nfor Parkinson's disease and ataxia. MFDE dealt with the problem of undefined\nMSE values and, compared with MDE, led to more stable entropy values over the\nscale factors for pink noise. Overall, MFDE was the fastest and most consistent\nmethod for the discrimination of different states of neurological data,\nespecially where the mean value of a time series considerably changes along the\nsignal (e.g., eye movement data).
