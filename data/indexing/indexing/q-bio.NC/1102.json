The equilibria reflect the correlation structure of the\ninputs, a global object extracted through local recurrent interactions only.\nSecond, we use numerical methods to illustrate how learning extracts the hidden\ngeometrical structure of the inputs. Indeed, multidimensional scaling methods\nmake it possible to project the final connectivity matrix on to a distance\nmatrix in a high-dimensional space, with the neurons labelled by spatial\nposition within this space. The resulting network structure turns out to be\nroughly convolutional. The residual of the projection defines the\nnon-convolutional part of the connectivity which is minimized in the process.\nFinally, we show how restricting the dimension of the space where the neurons\nlive gives rise to patterns similar to cortical maps. We motivate this using an\nenergy efficiency argument based on wire length minimization. Finally, we show\nhow this approach leads to the emergence of ocular dominance or orientation\ncolumns in primary visual cortex.

The mechanisms involved\nin this extreme sensitivity of cortical networks are currently not well\nunderstood. Here, we show in a minimal model of cortical circuit dynamics that\nexponential state separation after single spike and even single synapse\nperturbations coexists with dynamical stability to infinitesimal state\nperturbations. We propose a unifying picture of exponentially separating flux\ntubes enclosing unique stable trajectories composing the networks' state\nspaces.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Feb 2011 16:00:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Monteforte", "Michael", ""], ["Wolf", "Fred", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.5528", "submitter": "Henry L\\\"utcke", "authors": "Henry L\\\"utcke and Fritjof Helmchen", "title": "Two-photon imaging and analysis of neural network dynamics", "comments": "36 pages, 4 figures, accepted for publication in Reports on Progress\n  in Physics", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/0034-4885/74/8/086602", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The glow of a starry night sky, the smell of a freshly brewed cup of coffee\nor the sound of ocean waves breaking on the beach are representations of the\nphysical world that have been created by the dynamic interactions of thousands\nof neurons in our brains. How the brain mediates perceptions, creates thoughts,\nstores memories and initiates actions remains one of the most profound puzzles\nin biology, if not all of science. A key to a mechanistic understanding of how\nthe nervous system works is the ability to analyze the dynamics of neuronal\nnetworks in the living organism in the context of sensory stimulation and\nbehaviour. Dynamic brain properties have been fairly well characterized on the\nmicroscopic level of individual neurons and on the macroscopic level of whole\nbrain areas largely with the help of various electrophysiological techniques.\nHowever, our understanding of the mesoscopic level comprising local populations\nof hundreds to thousands of neurons (so called 'microcircuits') remains\ncomparably poor. In large parts, this has been due to the technical\ndifficulties involved in recording from large networks of neurons with\nsingle-cell spatial resolution and near- millisecond temporal resolution in the\nbrain of living animals. In recent years, two-photon microscopy has emerged as\na technique which meets many of these requirements and thus has become the\nmethod of choice for the interrogation of local neural circuits. Here, we\nreview the state-of-research in the field of two-photon imaging of neuronal\npopulations, covering the topics of microscope technology, suitable fluorescent\nindicator dyes, staining techniques, and in particular analysis techniques for\nextracting relevant information from the fluorescence data. We expect that\nfunctional analysis of neural networks using two-photon imaging will help to\ndecipher fundamental operational principles of neural microcircuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Feb 2011 17:48:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 21:42:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["L\u00fctcke", "Henry", ""], ["Helmchen", "Fritjof", ""]]}]
