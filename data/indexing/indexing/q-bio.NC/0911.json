We look at\nthe Kuramoto model with white noise forces: in mathematical terms it is a set\nof N oscillators, each driven by an independent Brownian motion with a constant\ndrift, that is each oscillator has its own frequency, which, in general,\nchanges from one oscillator to another (these frequencies are usually taken to\nbe random and they may be viewed as a quenched disorder). The interactions\nbetween oscillators are of long range type (mean field). We review some results\non the Kuramoto model from a statistical mechanics standpoint: we give in\nparticular necessary and sufficient conditions for reversibility and we point\nout a formal analogy, in the N to infinity limit, with local mean field models\nwith conservative dynamics (an analogy that is exploited to identify in\nparticular a Lyapunov functional in the reversible set-up). We then focus on\nthe reversible Kuramoto model with sinusoidal interactions in the N to infinity\nlimit and analyze the stability of the non-trivial stationary profiles arising\nwhen the interaction parameter K is larger than its critical value K_c. We\nprovide an analysis of the linear operator describing the time evolution in a\nneighborhood of the synchronized profile: we exhibit a Hilbert space in which\nthis operator has a self-adjoint extension and we establish, as our main\nresult, a spectral gap inequality for every K>K_c.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 8 Nov 2009 09:00:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Bertini", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Giacomin", "Giambattista", ""], ["Pakdaman", "Khashayar", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.1616", "submitter": "Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "authors": "Adele Peel and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "title": "Delay before synchronization and its role in latency of sensory\n  awareness", "comments": "5 pages and 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Here we show that for coupled-map systems, the length of the transient prior\nto synchronization is both dependant on the coupling strength and dynamics of\nconnections: systems with fixed connections and with no self-coupling display\nquasi-instantaneous synchronization.

Modifications of these parameters by auxiliary beta\nsubunits are at the origin of differences in N-type channel regulation by G\nproteins. The simulation data illustrate that channel reluctance can occur as\nthe result of an experimental bias linked to the variable extent of G protein\ndissociation when peak currents are measured at various membrane potentials.

Unfortunately,\nstrong absorption in aqueous solutions and low spatial resolution return\ndifficult free-space investigations. A new approach based on integrated THz\ncircuits was used.

The nerve cord was put inside a BioMEMS realized in\npolydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sealed on a glass wafer. Glass is a good material\nfor supporting high-frequency integrated waveguides such as coplanar waveguides\n(CPWs). Measurements were performed with vectorial network analyser (VNA).\n  Results: The transmission parameter in the frequency range of 0.14-0.22 THz\nwas measured through CPWs located just below the microchannel containing the\ninjured leech nerve cord. The lesion caused a decreased transmission\ncoefficient due to the NOS activity. L-NAME was injected inside the\nmicrochannel and it was verified that it inhibits this activity.\n  Conclusions: It was demonstrated that THz spectroscopy can detect a\nbiochemical event, such as NOS activity around an injured leech's nerve cord,\nin real time.
