The minimum of the firing rate as a function\nof the stimulus amplitude $I_0$ in the high-frequency regime is due to the\nmultimodal transition. Below this singular point only odd multiples of the\ndriving period remain and the system is highly sensitive to noise. The\ncoefficient of variation has a maximum and the firing rate has a minimum as a\nfunction of the noise intensity which is an indication of the stochastic\ncoherence antiresonance. The model calculations reproduce the frequency of\noccurrence of the most common modes in the vicinity of the transition. A linear\nrelation of output frequency vs. $I_0$ for above the transition is also\nconfirmed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 5 Jun 2010 21:23:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Borkowski", "L.

There are several\nparadigms of CI [like artificial neural networks, evolutionary computations,\nswarm intelligence, artificial immune systems, fuzzy systems and many others],\neach of these has its origins in biological systems [biological neural systems,\nnatural Darwinian evolution, social behavior, immune system, interactions of\norganisms with their environment]. Most of those paradigms evolved into\nseparate machine learning (ML) techniques, where probabilistic methods are used\ncomplementary with CI techniques in order to effectively combine elements of\nlearning, adaptation, evolution and Fuzzy logic to create heuristic algorithms\nthat are, in some sense, intelligent. The current trend is to develop consensus\ntechniques, since no single machine learning algorithms is superior to others\nin all possible situations. In order to overcome this problem several\nmeta-approaches were proposed in ML focusing on the integration of results from\ndifferent methods into single prediction. We discuss here the Landau theory for\nthe nonlinear equation that can describe the adaptive integration of\ninformation acquired from an ensemble of independent learning agents. The\ninfluence of each individual agent on other learners is described similarly to\nthe social impact theory. The final decision outcome for the consensus system\nis calculated using majority rule in the stationary limit, yet the minority\nsolutions can survive inside the majority population as the complex\nintermittent clusters of opposite opinion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jun 2010 15:11:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Plewczynski", "Dariusz", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.3271", "submitter": "Paul Vitanyi", "authors": "Anne S.

We develop a technique, Inductive Game Theory, to extract\ndirectly from time-series data the decision-making strategies used by\nindividuals and groups. This technique uses Monte Carlo simulation to test\nalternative causal models of conflict dynamics. We find individuals base their\ndecision to fight on memory of social factors, not on short timescale\necological resource competition. Furthermore, the social assessments on which\nthese decisions are based are triadic (self in relation to another pair of\nindividuals), not pairwise. We show that this triadic decision making causes\nlong conflict cascades and that there is a high population cost of the large\nfights associated with these cascades. These results suggest that individual\nagency has been over-emphasized in the social evolution of complex aggregates,\nand that pair-wise formalisms are inadequate.
