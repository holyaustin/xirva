As this effects\nrelies on very small potential changes, better modeling methods are necessary\nto quantify the weak electrical fields in the microscopic scale in a more\nrealistic way.

This imperfect\nsynchronization, observed in the beta frequency band, is believed to be related\nto the hypokinetic motor symptoms of the disorder. Our study explores potential\nmechanisms behind this intermittent synchrony. We study the response of a\nbursting pallidal neuron to different patterns of synaptic input from\nsubthalamic nucleus (STN) neuron. We show how external globus pallidus (GPe)\nneuron is sensitive to the phase of the input from the STN cell and can exhibit\nintermittent phase-locking with the input in the beta band. The temporal\nproperties of this intermittent phase-locking show similarities to the\nintermittent synchronization observed in experiments. We also study the\nsynchronization of GPe cells to synaptic input from the STN cell with\ndependence on the dopamine-modulated parameters. Dopamine also affects the\ncellular properties of neurons. We show how the changes in firing patterns of\nSTN neuron due to the lack of dopamine may lead to transition from a lower to a\nhigher coherent state, roughly matching the synchrony levels observed in basal\nganglia in normal and parkinsonian states. The intermittent nature of the\nneural beta band synchrony in Parkinson's disease is achieved in the model due\nto the interplay of the timing of STN input to pallidum and pallidal neuronal\ndynamics, resulting in sensitivity of pallidal output to the phase of the\narriving STN input. Thus the mechanism considered here (the change in firing\npattern of subthalamic neurons through the dopamine-induced change of membrane\nproperties) may be one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the\ngeneration of the intermittent synchronization observed in Parkinson's disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Nov 2012 21:19:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Choongseok", ""], ["Rubchinsky", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.2342", "submitter": "Ehtibar Dzhafarov", "authors": "Ehtibar N.

The activation\nof specific sensory-motor processes, which may partially replace impaired\nneural pathways, is likely the cause of the observed benefits. Nonlinear\nindexes, such as scaling exponents and Lyapunov exponents, have been proposed\nto characterize RAC effects. The maximal Lyapunov exponent estimates the degree\nof resilience of gait control to small perturbations, i.e. the local dynamic\nstability (LDS). The objective of the present study was to assess to what\nextent RAC influences gait LDS, and to compare this effect with that on scaling\nexponents. Twenty healthy subjects performed 6x5min walking trials on an\ninstrumented treadmill at three different speeds. Freely chosen walking\ncadences were measured during the first three trials and then imposed\naccordingly in the last three trials with a metronome. The 2D trajectory of the\ncenter of pressure on the treadmill was recorded. From the antero-posterior and\nthe medio-lateral signals, both long-term and short-term LDS were computed.\nLong-term LDS was strongly enhanced (relative change +47%), with significant\nchange in every direction and speed. The average change in short-term LDS was\nsmaller (+3%), with a more marked effect at low speed (+5%). RAC substantially\nmodified the fluctuation dynamics of the center of the pressure trajectory. We\nalso observed that both LDS and fractal dynamics (scaling exponents) responded\nsimilarly to RAC. Thus, both scaling exponents and LDS are responsive to\nsensory-motor synchronizing processes that RAC activates, and may constitute\nrelevant indexes for evaluating gait variability in cued walking. Finally, the\nmore locally stable gait pattern could be an indication of a lower fall risk,\nwhich may be an advantage to patients of RAC therapies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 15 Nov 2012 14:31:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2013 10:10:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 08:35:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-09", "authors_parsed": [["Terrier", "Philippe", ""], ["Deriaz", "Olivier", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.4487", "submitter": "Yuriy Pershin", "authors": "M.

In the model, neurons form a sparsely connected network\nand their spontaneous activity is driven by random spikes representing synaptic\nnoise. Using simulations and analytical calculations, we found that if the STSD\nis absent, the neural network shows either asynchronous behavior or regular\nnetwork oscillations depending on the noise level. In networks with STSD,\nchanging parameters of synaptic plasticity and the noise level, we observed\ntransitions to complex patters of collective activity: mixed-mode and spindle\noscillations, bursts of collective activity, and chaotic behaviour.\nInterestingly, these patterns are stable in a certain range of the parameters\nand separated by critical boundaries. Thus, the parameters of synaptic\nplasticity can play a role of control parameters or switchers between different\nnetwork states. However, changes of the parameters caused by a disease may lead\nto dramatic impairment of ongoing neural activity. We analyze the chaotic\nneural activity by use of the 0-1 test for chaos (Gottwald, G. & Melbourne, I.,\n2004) and show that it has a collective nature.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Nov 2012 17:52:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "K. -E.", ""], ["Goltsev", "A.

To understand how large ensembles\nof neurons process sensory information, it is necessary to develop suitable\nstatistical models to describe the response variability of the recorded spike\ntrains.

The identification of a\ndeformation parameter allows us to provide a statistical characterisation of\nthe amount of high-order correlations in the case of a very large neural\nensemble, significantly reducing the number of parameters, avoiding the\nsampling problem, and inferring the underlying dynamical properties of the\nnetwork within pools of multiunit neural activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Nov 2012 16:26:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Montani", "Fernando", ""], ["Phoka", "Elena", ""], ["Portesi", "Mariela", ""], ["Schultz", "Simon R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.6615", "submitter": "Werner Ehm", "authors": "Werner Ehm and Jiri Wackermann", "title": "Modeling geometric-optical illusions: A variational approach", "comments": "Minor corrections, final version", "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematical Psychology 56 (2012), 404-416", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC math.CA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Visual distortions of perceived lengths, angles, or forms, are generally\nknown as \"geometric-optical illusions\" (GOI).
