The power spectral density (PSD)\nof the Vm displays a power-law structure at high frequencies (>50 Hz) with a\nslope of about -2.5. This type of frequency scaling cannot be accounted for by\ntraditional models, as either single-compartment models or models based on\nreconstructed cell morphologies display a frequency scaling with a slope close\nto -4. This slope is due to the fact that the membrane resistance is\n\"short-circuited\" by the capacitance for high frequencies, a situation which\nmay not be realistic. Here, we integrate non-ideal capacitors in cable\nequations to reflect the fact that the capacitance cannot be charged\ninstantaneously. We show that the resulting \"non-ideal\" cable model can be\nsolved analytically using Fourier transforms. Numerical simulations using a\nball-and-stick model yield membrane potential activity with similar frequency\nscaling as in the experiments. We also discuss the consequences of using\nnon-ideal capacitors on other cellular properties such as the transmission of\nhigh frequencies, which is boosted in non-ideal cables, or voltage attenuation\nin dendrites.
