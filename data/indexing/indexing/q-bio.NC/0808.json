The syndrome is featured by a bilateral, symmetric and\nmultisensory involvement, and by a functional depression with dynamic effects\ndependent on the neural mass lost and related to physiological laws of nervous\nexcitability. Inverted or tilted vision as well as tactile and auditive\ninversion, under minimum stimulus, appears as a stage of incomplete\nintegration, being almost corrected under higher stimulus or facilitation by\nmultisensory integration. The syndrome reveals aspects of the brain dynamics\nthat suggest a functional continuity and unity of the cortex. A functional\ngradients scheme was proposed in which the specificity of the cortex is\ndistributed with a continuous variation. This syndrome is interpreted as a\nscale reduction in the nervous excitability of the system, the different\nsensory qualities being affected allometricaly according to scaling laws. A\ncontinuity from lower to higher sensory functions was proposed. The sensory\ngrowth by an increase of the stimulus or by multisensory facilitation is found\nto follow approximately power laws, that would reflect basic laws of biological\nneural networks.

The novelty of our approach is that we use a compound null\nhypothesis that includes not only models of independent neurons but also models\nwhere neurons have weak dependencies. The strength of interaction among the\nneurons is represented in terms of certain pair-wise conditional probabilities.\nWe specify our null hypothesis by putting an upper bound on all such\nconditional probabilities. We construct a probabilistic model that captures the\ncounting process and use this to calculate the mean and variance of the count\nfor any pattern.
