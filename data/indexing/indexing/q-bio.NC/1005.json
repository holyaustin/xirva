Here we present experimental evidence\nto reconcile the notions of synchrony at the level of neuronal spiking and at\nthe mesoscopic scale. We demonstrate that only in time intervals of excess\nspike synchrony, coincident spikes are better entrained to the LFP than\npredicted by the locking of the individual spikes. This effect is enhanced in\nperiods of large LFP amplitudes. A quantitative model explains the LFP dynamics\nby the orchestrated spiking activity in neuronal groups that contribute the\nobserved surplus synchrony. From the correlation analysis, we infer that\nneurons participate in different constellations but contribute only a fraction\nof their spikes to temporally precise spike configurations, suggesting a dual\ncoding scheme of rate and synchrony. This finding provides direct evidence for\nthe hypothesized relation that precise spike synchrony constitutes a major\ntemporally and spatially organized component of the LFP. Revealing that\ntransient spike synchronization correlates not only with behavior, but with a\nmesoscopic brain signal corroborates its relevance in cortical processing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 May 2010 18:10:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Denker", "Michael", ""], ["Roux", "S\u00e9bastien", ""], ["Lind\u00e9n", "Henrik", ""], ["Diesmann", "Markus", ""], ["Riehle", "Alexa", ""], ["Gr\u00fcn", "Sonja", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0517", "submitter": "Michael J.

The presence of noise limits the precision of neural responses and\nimpacts the quality of neural signal transduction. We assess the signal\ntransduction quality in relation to the level of noise, and show it to be\nmaximized by a non-zero level of noise, analogous to the stochastic resonance\neffect. The quality enhancement occurs for a finite range of stimuli to a\nsingle neuron; we show how to construct networks of neurons that extend the\nrange. The range increases more rapidly with network size when we make use of\nheterogeneous populations of neurons with a variety of thresholds, rather than\nhomogeneous populations of neurons all with the same threshold. The limited\nprecision of neural responses thus can have a direct effect on the optimal\nnetwork structure, with diverse functional properties of the constituent\nneurons supporting an economical information processing strategy that reduces\nthe metabolic costs of handling a broad class of stimuli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2010 13:27:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Barber", "Michael J.", ""], ["Ristig", "Manfred L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.1830", "submitter": "Ajanta Kundu", "authors": "Ajanta Kundu and Sandip Sarkar", "title": "Can Centre Surround Model Explain the Enhancement of Visual Perception\n  through Stochastic Resonance?", "comments": "4 pages,5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.comp-ph q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We demonstrate the ability of centre surround model for simulating the\nenhancement of contrast sensitivity through stochastic resonance observed in\npsychophysical experiments.
