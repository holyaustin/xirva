Here we demonstrate a device made of\nconjugated molecules and metal nanoparticles (NPs) which behaves as a spiking\nsynapse suitable for integration in neural network architectures. We\ndemonstrate that this device exhibits the main behavior of a biological\nsynapse. These results open the way to rate coding utilization of the NOMFET in\nperceptron and Hopfield networks. We can also envision the NOMFET as a building\nblock of neuroelectronics for interfacing neurons or neuronal logic devices\nmade from patterned neuronal cultures with solid-state devices and circuits.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2009 09:56:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Alibart", "F.", ""], ["Pleutin", "S.", ""], ["Guerin", "D.", ""], ["Gamrat", "C.", ""], ["Vuillaume", "D.", ""]]}, {"id": "0904.1505", "submitter": "Stefano Cardanobile", "authors": "Stefano Cardanobile, Stefan Rotter", "title": "Multiplicatively interacting point processes and applications to neural\n  modeling", "comments": "22 pages, 7 figures.
