Networks can be used to model brain functional\nactivities constituting a way to characterize and quantify this structured form\nof organization. Reports state that different physiological states or even\ndiseases that affect the central nervous system may be associated to\nalterations on those networks, that might reflect in graphs of different\narchitectures. However, the relation of their structure to different states or\nconditions of the organism is not well comprehended. Thus, experiments that\ninvolve the estimation of functional neural networks of subjects exposed to\ndifferent controlled conditions are of great relevance. Within this context,\nthis research has sought to model large scale functional brain networks during\nan anesthetic induction process. The experiment was based on intra-cranial\nrecordings of neural activities of an old world macaque of the species Macaca\nfuscata. Neural activity was recorded during a Ketamine-Medetomidine anesthetic\ninduction process. Networks were serially estimated in time intervals of five\nseconds. Changes were observed in various networks properties within about one\nand a half minutes after the administration of the anesthetics. These changes\nreveal the occurrence of a transition on the networks architecture. During\ngeneral anesthesia a reduction in the functional connectivity and network\nintegration capabilities were verified in both local and global levels. It was\nalso observed that the brain shifted to a highly specific and dynamic state.\nThe results bring empirical evidence and report the relation of the induced\nstate of anesthesia to properties of functional networks, thus, they contribute\nfor the elucidation of some new aspects of neural correlates of consciousness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 19:12:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 13:44:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Padovani", "Eduardo C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.00069", "submitter": "Thomas Gorochowski", "authors": "Thomas E.

The authors concede that creative variation is partly\ndirected; however, the greater the extent to which variants are generated\nnon-randomly, the greater the extent to which the distribution of variants can\nreflect not selection but the initial generation bias. Since each thought in a\ncreative process can alter the selective criteria against which the next is\nevaluated, there is no demarcation into generations as assumed in a Darwinian\nmodel.

Subsequently, first evaluations in\nboth sphere and realistic head models are presented, and the results are\ncompared to previously introduced CG-FEM approaches. Additional visualizations\nare shown to illustrate the current preserving property of the Mixed-FEM.\n  Based on these results, it is concluded that the newly presented Mixed-FEM\ncan at least complement and in some scenarios even outperform the established\nCG-FEM approaches, which motivates a further evaluation of the Mixed-FEM for\napplications in bioelectromagnetism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 22:14:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 22:24:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Vorwerk", "Johannes", ""], ["Engwer", "Christian", ""], ["Pursiainen", "Sampsa", ""], ["Wolters", "Carsten H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.05992", "submitter": "Vince Grolmusz", "authors": "Bal\\'azs Szalkai and Vince Grolmusz", "title": "Human Sexual Dimorphism of the Relative Cerebral Area Volumes in the\n  Data of the Human Connectome Project", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The average human brain volume of the males is larger than that of the\nfemales.

Humans are notoriously good at it, even if some variations\nare presumably more difficult to handle than others (e.g. 3D rotations). Humans\nare thought to solve the problem through hierarchical processing along the\nventral stream, which progressively extracts more and more invariant visual\nfeatures. This feed-forward architecture has inspired a new generation of\nbio-inspired computer vision systems called deep convolutional neural networks\n(DCNN), which are currently the best algorithms for object recognition in\nnatural images. Here, for the first time, we systematically compared human\nfeed-forward vision and DCNNs at view-invariant object recognition using the\nsame images and controlling for both the kinds of transformation as well as\ntheir magnitude. We used four object categories and images were rendered from\n3D computer models. In total, 89 human subjects participated in 10 experiments\nin which they had to discriminate between two or four categories after rapid\npresentation with backward masking. We also tested two recent DCNNs on the same\ntasks. We found that humans and DCNNs largely agreed on the relative\ndifficulties of each kind of variation: rotation in depth is by far the hardest\ntransformation to handle, followed by scale, then rotation in plane, and\nfinally position. This suggests that humans recognize objects mainly through 2D\ntemplate matching, rather than by constructing 3D object models, and that DCNNs\nare not too unreasonable models of human feed-forward vision. Also, our results\nshow that the variation levels in rotation in depth and scale strongly modulate\nboth humans' and DCNNs' recognition performances.

Although it is\ncommonly believed that they are, Gauthier et al.(2014) recently showed that\nthese abilities become more correlated as experience with nonface categories\nincreases.

Using the Cambridge Face Memory Test and the Vanderbilt\nExpertise Test, they showed that the shared variance between Cambridge Face\nMemory Test and Vanderbilt Expertise Test performance increases monotonically\nas experience increases.

We explain this conundrum using our\nneurocomputational model of face and object processing (The Model, TM). Our\nresults show that, as in the behavioral data, the correlation between\nsubordinate level face and object recognition accuracy increases as experience\ngrows. We suggest that different domains do not compete for resources because\nthe relevant features are shared between faces and objects. The essential power\nof experience is to generate a \"spreading transform\" for faces that generalizes\nto objects that must be individuated. Interestingly, when the task of the\nnetwork is basic level categorization, no increase in the correlation between\ndomains is observed. Hence, our model predicts that it is the type of\nexperience that matters and that the source of the correlation is in the\nfusiform face area, rather than in cortical areas that subserve basic level\ncategorization.
