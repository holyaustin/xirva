Memory has long been\na focus of investigation and interest in both the sciences and the humanities.\nThe way memory enriches and distorts lived experience has been widely explored\nin literature and the arts. Our fascination with the subject is increasingly\nevident in popular culture, with the widespread proliferation of novels and\nmovies in which events play out in a nonlinear fashion that reflects how\nmemories of them are woven together in the minds of the characters involved.\nScientific approaches to memory have focused on the study of amnesiacs,\nneuroimaging studies, and cognitive studies of the formation, retrieval, and\nforgetting of memories. Until now, however, humanistic and scientific\ninvestigations of memory have been carried out independently. This book\nprovides an exemplary illustration of how disciplinary boundaries can be\ntranscended, showing how approaches to memory from the humanities and the\nsciences can revitalize one another. With 19 chapters written by academics from\na range of disciplines including neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry,\ncognitive science, cultural studies, philosophy, bioethics, history of science,\nart, theatre, film, and literature, it is undoubtedly one of the most\ninterdisciplinary books on library shelves.

To ascertain the existence of power-law distributions of\ninter-spike intervals (ISI) occurring during the progression of status\nepilepticus (SE), so that the emergence of critical states could be reasonably\nhypothesized as being part of the intrinsic nature of the SE. Methods. Status\nepilepticus was induced by pilocarpine administration in post-natal 21-day rats\n(n=8). For each animal, 24 hours of EEG from the onset of the SE were analyzed\naccording to the analytical procedure suggested by Clauset et al.

The analytical\nprocedure was implemented by the freely available R software package\n\"poweRlaw\". Time of calculations was considerably shorten by the exploitation\nof High-Throughput Computing technology, a.k.a. Grid Computing technology.\nResults. The progression of the SE is characterized by the emergence of\npower-law correlations of ISI whose likelihood of occurrence increases the more\nthe time from the onset of the SE elapses. Log-normal distribution of ISI is\nhowever widely represented. Additionally, undetermined distributions of ISI are\nrepresented as well, although confined within a restricted temporal window.

A mental\narchitecture is a hypothetical network of processes aimed at performing a task,\nof which we only observe the overall time it takes under variable parameters of\nthe task. It is usually assumed that the network contains several processes\nselectively influenced by different experimental factors, and then the question\nis asked as to how these processes are arranged within the network, e.g.,\nwhether they are concurrent or sequential. One way of doing this is to consider\nthe distribution functions for the overall processing time and compute certain\nlinear combinations thereof (interaction contrasts). The theory of selective\ninfluences in psychology can be viewed as a special application of the\ninterdisciplinary theory of (non)contextuality having its origins and main\napplications in quantum theory. In particular, lack of contextuality is\nequivalent to the existence of a \"hidden\" random entity of which all the random\nvariables in play are functions. Consequently, for any given value of this\ncommon random entity, the processing times and their compositions (minima,\nmaxima, or sums) become deterministic quantities. These quantities, in turn,\ncan be treated as random variables with (shifted) Heaviside distribution\nfunctions, for which one can easily compute various linear combinations across\ndifferent treatments, including interaction contrasts. This mathematical fact\nleads to a simple method, more general than the previously used ones, to\ninvestigate and characterize the interaction contrast for different types of\nseries-parallel architectures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Jan 2015 16:23:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 12:45:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 17 May 2015 17:54:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 02:53:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Ru", ""], ["Dzhafarov", "Ehtibar N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.02450", "submitter": "Gali Sela", "authors": "Gali Sela, Antonella Lauri, X.

We develop a signal detection model in\nwhich individuals must learn how to calibrate their anxiety responses: they\nneed to learn which cues indicate danger in the environment.

Because\nof this tradeoff, a subset of the population can become trapped in a state of\nself-perpetuating over-sensitivity to threatening stimuli, even when\nindividuals learn optimally. This phenomenon arises because when individuals\nbecome too cautious, they stop sampling the environment and fail to correct\ntheir misperceptions, whereas when individuals become too careless they\ncontinue to sample the environment and soon discover their mistakes. Thus,\nover-sensitivity to threats becomes common whereas under-sensitivity becomes\nrare.

In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization\nmethod for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better\nspecify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the\nproposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside\nhuman brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with\nimposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain\nactivity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a\nrealistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head\nand includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the\ncerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity\nvalues. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly\nimproves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed\nmethod was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6\nsimultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint,\nthe accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%.\nConclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method\nis potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human\nbrain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 16:11:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Saha", "Sajib", ""], ["de Hoog", "Frank", ""], ["Nesterets", "Ya.
