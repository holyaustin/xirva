To this end\nTononi et al. [Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 91, 5033 (1994)] proposed a measure of\nneural complexity that purports to capture this property based on mutual\ninformation between complementary subsets of a system. Neural complexity, so\ndefined, is one of a family of information theoretic metrics developed to\nmeasure the balance between the segregation and integration of a system's\ndynamics. One key question arising for such measures involves understanding how\nthey are influenced by network topology. Sporns et al. [Cereb. Cortex 10, 127\n(2000)] employed numerical models in order to determine the dependence of\nneural complexity on the topological features of a network. However, a complete\npicture has yet to be established. While De Lucia et al. [Phys. Rev. E 71,\n016114 (2005)] made the first attempts at an analytical account of this\nrelationship, their work utilized a formulation of neural complexity that, we\nargue, did not reflect the intuitions of the original work. In this paper we\nstart by describing weighted connection matrices formed by applying a random\ncontinuous weight distribution to binary adjacency matrices. This allows us to\nderive an approximation for neural complexity in terms of the moments of the\nweight distribution and elementary graph motifs. In particular we explicitly\nestablish a dependency of neural complexity on cyclic graph motifs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 10:54:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 12:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-30", "authors_parsed": [["Barnett", "L.", ""], ["Buckley", "C.

It is shown that for\nboth types of coupling, the delay always plays a subtle role in either\npromoting or impairing synchronization. In particular, depending on the\ninherent oscillation period of individual neurons, regions of irregular and\nregular propagating excitatory fronts appear intermittently as the delay\nincreases. These delay-induced synchronization transitions are manifested as\nwell-expressed minima in the measure for spatiotemporal synchrony. For\nattractive coupling, the minima appear at every integer multiple of the average\noscillation period, while for the repulsive coupling, they appear at every odd\nmultiple of the half of the average oscillation period. The obtained results\nare robust to the variations of the dynamics of individual neurons, the system\nsize, and the neuronal firing type. Hence, they can be used to characterize\nattractively or repulsively coupled scale-free neuronal networks with delays.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 20:02:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qingyun", ""], ["Chen", "Guanrong", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""]]}]
