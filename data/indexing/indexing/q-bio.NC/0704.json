Advances in the analysis of complex\nnetworks provide useful new approaches to understanding structural and\nfunctional properties of brain networks. Structural properties of networks\nrecently described allow their characterization as small-world, random\n(exponential) and scale-free. They complement the set of other properties that\nhave been explored in the context of brain connectivity, such as topology,\nhodology, clustering, and hierarchical organization. Here we apply new network\nanalysis methods to cortical inter-areal connectivity networks for the cat and\nmacaque brains. We compare these corticocortical fibre networks to benchmark\nrewired, small-world, scale-free and random networks, using two analysis\nstrategies, in which we measure the effects of the removal of nodes and\nconnections on the structural properties of the cortical networks. The brain\nnetworks' structural decay is in most respects similar to that of scale-free\nnetworks. The results implicate highly connected hub-nodes and bottleneck\nconnections as structural basis for some of the conditional robustness of brain\nsystems. This informs the understanding of the development of brain networks'\nconnectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2007 13:38:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Kaiser", "Marcus", ""], ["Martin", "Robert", ""], ["Andras", "Peter", ""], ["Young", "Malcolm P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.0648", "submitter": "Kaushik Majumdar", "authors": "Kaushik Majumdar", "title": "Behavioral response to strong aversive stimuli: A neurodynamical model", "comments": "Submitted to journal", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": null, "abstract": "  In this paper a theoretical model of functioning of a neural circuit during a\nbehavioral response has been proposed.

Those\ncoefficients form a vector in a multidimensional vector space. Behavioral\ndynamics of a neuronal network in response to strong aversive stimuli has been\nstudied in a vector space in which a suitable pseudometric has been defined.\nThe neurodynamical model of network behavior has been formulated in terms of\nexisting memory, synaptic plasticity and feelings. The model has an analogy in\nclassical electrostatics, by which the notion of force and potential energy has\nbeen introduced. Since the model takes input from each neuron in a network and\nproduces a behavior as the output, it would be extremely difficult or may even\nbe impossible to implement.

Yet, despite almost a quarter\ncentury of intense work, attractor networks are not fully understood. In\nparticular, there are still two unanswered questions. First, how is it that\nattractor networks exhibit irregular firing, as is observed experimentally\nduring working memory tasks?

From this description it follows that irregular firing can exist only\nif the number of neurons involved in a memory is large. The same mean field\nanalysis also shows that the number of memories that can be stored in a network\nscales with the number of excitatory connections, a result that has been\nsuggested for simple models but never shown for realistic ones.
