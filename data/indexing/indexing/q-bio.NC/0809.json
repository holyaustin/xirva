It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle\nexternal visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy\nand complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to\ninvestigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a\ndifferent set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there\nis quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material\nsubstrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective\nwavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated\nthat owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in\nneurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for\ncognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle\nway which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and\ndespite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain\nto be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum\nstates of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for\ncollapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility\nfor the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if\nwe accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them\ncan provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Aug 2008 20:32:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2008 18:00:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 4 Jul 2010 23:51:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 13 Dec 2010 15:25:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Salari", "V.", ""], ["Rahnama", "M.", ""], ["Tuszynski", "J.

However,\nit is not clear whether such activity states are specific to simple IF models,\nor if they also exist in networks where neurons are endowed with complex\nintrinsic properties similar to electrophysiological measurements. Here, we\ninvestigate the occurrence of AI states in networks of nonlinear IF neurons,\nsuch as the adaptive exponential IF (Brette-Gerstner-Izhikevich) model. This\nmodel can display intrinsic properties such as low-threshold spike (LTS),\nregular spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS). We successively investigate the\noscillatory and AI dynamics of thalamic, cortical and thalamocortical networks\nusing such models. AI states can be found in each case, sometimes with\nsurprisingly small network size of the order of a few tens of neurons. We show\nthat the presence of LTS neurons in cortex or in thalamus, explains the robust\nemergence of AI states for relatively small network sizes. Finally, we\ninvestigate the role of spike-frequency adaptation (SFA). In cortical networks\nwith strong SFA in RS cells, the AI state is transient, but when SFA is\nreduced, AI states can be self-sustained for long times. In thalamocortical\nnetworks, AI states are found when the cortex is itself in an AI state, but\nwith strong SFA, the thalamocortical network displays Up and Down state\ntransitions, similar to intracellular recordings during slow-wave sleep or\nanesthesia. Self-sustained Up and Down states could also be generated by\ntwo-layer cortical networks with LTS cells. These models suggest that intrinsic\nproperties such as LTS are crucial for AI states in thalamocortical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Sep 2008 15:55:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Dec 2008 14:22:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 08:34:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Sun, 10 May 2009 13:34:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Destexhe", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.1127", "submitter": "Naoki Masuda Dr.", "authors": "Yuko K.

In a step toward solving this problem\nwe demonstrate by theoretical analysis and simulation how networks of richly\ninter-connected neurons, such as those observed in the superficial layers of\nthe neocortex, can embed reliable robust finite state machines. We show how a\nmulti-stable neuronal network containing a number of states can be created very\nsimply, by coupling two recurrent networks whose synaptic weights have been\nconfigured for soft winner-take-all (sWTA) performance. These two sWTAs have\nsimple, homogenous locally recurrent connectivity except for a small fraction\nof recurrent cross-connections between them, which are used to embed the\nrequired states. This coupling between the maps allows the network to continue\nto express the current state even after the input that elicted that state is\nwithdrawn. In addition, a small number of 'transition neurons' implement the\nnecessary input-driven transitions between the embedded states. We provide\nsimple rules to systematically design and construct neuronal state machines of\nthis kind. The significance of our finding is that it offers a method whereby\nthe cortex could construct networks supporting a broad range of sophisticated\nprocessing by applying only small specializations to the same generic neuronal\ncircuit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2008 22:52:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Rutishauser", "Ueli", ""], ["Douglas", "Rodney J.", ""]]}]
