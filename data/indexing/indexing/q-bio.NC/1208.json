One\nhypothesis states that such representations depend upon multimodal binding\nprocesses within a single region. Convergent evidence suggests that such a\nregion may exist within the temporal lobe(see Patterson 2007). To test these\nhypotheses we utilized two established paradigms, behavioral priming and\nphysiological suppression, to examine response to the repetition of concepts\nacross perceptual modalities.\n  Typically, examinations of the relationship between behavioral priming and\nsuppression have queried the extent to which suppression effects in different\nbrain regions correlate with single measures of behavioral priming. In\ncontrast, we were interested in the extent to which suppression effects within\na single brain region would correlate with multiple measures of behavioral\npriming. While many sensory regions show suppression effects to specific\nperceptual repetitions, we hypothesized that a region engaged in conceptual\nrepresentation would show suppression effects to conceptual repetitions, even\nwhen the stimuli were perceptually distinct.\n  Using BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) data, we determined that\nsuppression effects in perirhinal cortex, a temporal lobe region, significantly\ncorrelate with behavioral priming in a multimodal manner. This result provides\nevidence that perirhinal cortex is engaged in conceptual representation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Aug 2012 22:00:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Awipi", "Tarimotimi", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.5350", "submitter": "Man Yi Yim", "authors": "Man Yi Yim, Ad Aertsen, Stefan Rotter", "title": "Impact of intrinsic biophysical diversity on the activity of spiking\n  neurons", "comments": "4 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

This\nis well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as\nluminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential\nvelocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis\nthat motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our\nimplementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic\nrepresentation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to\nthe aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that\nthis solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate\nthe formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features\nindependent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are\nexplained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global\nscale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped\ncells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as\nnecessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that\nmotion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model,\nis sufficient to solve the aperture problem.
