Here we present an approach for finding the\noptimal mappings between input signals and network states that allow the\nnetwork to convey the maximal information about input signals drawn from a\ngiven distribution. This mapping also produces a set of linear equations for\ncalculating the optimal Ising model coupling constants, as well as geometric\nproperties that indicate the applicability of the pairwise Ising model. We show\nthat the optimal pairwise interactions are on average zero for Gaussian and\nuniformly distributed inputs, whereas they are non-zero for inputs\napproximating those in natural environments. These non-zero network\ninteractions are predicted to increase in strength as the noise in the response\nfunctions of each network node increases. This approach also suggests ways for\nhow interactions with unmeasured parts of the network can be inferred from the\nparameters of response functions for the measured network nodes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 Sep 2009 16:12:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Fitzgerald", "Jeffrey D.", ""], ["Sharpee", "Tatyana O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.1563", "submitter": "Eugenio Urdapilleta", "authors": "Eugenio Urdapilleta and Ines Samengo", "title": "The firing statistics of Poisson neuron models driven by slow stimuli", "comments": "15 pages, 9 figures, accepted in Biological Cybernetics (Springer)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The coding properties of cells with different types of receptive fields have\nbeen studied for decades.

For the Hopfield network, we found that, in the retrieval phase favored\nwhen the network wants to memory one of stored patterns, all the reconstruction\nalgorithms fail to extract interactions within a desired accuracy, and the same\nfailure occurs in the spin glass phase where spurious minima show up, while in\nthe paramagnetic phase, albeit unfavored during the retrieval dynamics, the\nalgorithms work well to reconstruct the network itself. This implies that, as a\ninverse problem, the paramagnetic phase is conversely useful for reconstructing\nthe network while the retrieval phase loses all the information about\ninteractions in the network except for the case where only one pattern is\nstored. The performances of algorithms are studied with respect to the system\nsize, memory load and temperature, sample-to-sample fluctuations are also\nconsidered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2009 08:15:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 02:34:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Huang", "Haiping", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.2886", "submitter": "Behnam Farid", "authors": "Behnam Farid, and Alexei M.

Rev. B 78, 153103 (2008), arXiv:arXiv:0803.4468]\nconcluded that the Luttinger theorem (LT) does not apply for the Mott-Hubbard\n(MH) insulating phase of this model (i.e. for V >> t) in the thermodynamic\nlimit; KP even suggested, incorrectly, that failure of the LT were apparent for\na half-filled finite system consisting of N=26 lattice sites. By employing a\nsimple model for the self-energy Sigma of a MH state, we show that the\nfinite-size-scaling approach of the type utilised by KP is not reliable for the\nsystem sizes considered by KP. On the basis of the equivalence of the model\nunder consideration (at half-filling and for t'/t << 1) and the XXZ spin-chain\nHamiltonian for SU(2) spins, we further show that for V > V_c(t,t') the system\nunder consideration has a charge-density-wave (CDW) ground state (GS) in the\nthermodynamic limit, corresponding to a doubling of the unit cell in comparison\nwith that specific to the underlying lattice. Although this GS is also\ninsulating, its spectral gap is due to the broken translational symmetry of the\nGS; it is not a correlation-induced MH gap. The LT is therefore a priori valid\nfor this GS. This fact establishes that the conclusion by KP is indeed\nerroneous. Finally, we present a heuristic argument due to Volovik that sheds\nlight on the mechanism underlying the robustness of the LT. In an appendix, we\npresent the details of the calculation of the single-particle Green function of\nthe broken-symmetry GS of the model under consideration by means of\nbosonization and in terms of the form factors of a class of soliton-generating\nfields pertaining to the quantum sine-Gordon Hamiltonian.
