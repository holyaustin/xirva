The framework is constructed\nusing the new concept of a 'formal narrative' which is a sequence of cognitive\nstates inferred from sense data. First we propose that human cognition uses a\nhierarchy of narratives to predict changes in the natural and social\nenvironment. Each layer in the hierarchy represents a distinct 'view of the\nworld', but it also contributes to a global unitary perspective. Second, the\ngenerative models used for cognitive inference can create new narratives from\nthose states already experienced by an individual. We hypothesise that when a\nthreat is recognised, narratives are generated as a cognitive model of possible\nthreat scenarios. Using this framework, we suggest that OCD arises from a\ndysfunction in sub-surface levels of inference while the global unitary\nperspective remains intact. The failure of inference is felt as the external\nworld being 'not just right', and its automatic correction by the perceptual\nsystem is experienced as compulsion. Ordering and symmetry obsessions are the\neffects of the perceptual system trying to achieve precise inference. Checking\nbehaviour arises because the security system attempts to finesse inference as\npart of its protection behaviour. Similarly, fear of harm and distressing\nthoughts occur because the failure of inference results in an indistinct view\nof the past or the future. A wide variety of symptoms in OCD is thus explained\nby a single dysfunction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 16:33:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "P.

Forming synapses between neurons either by growing axons\nstarting at similar times for all neurons (much-overlapped time windows) or at\ndifferent time points (less-overlapped) may affect the topological and spatial\nproperties of neuronal networks.

Second, connection probability\ndecreased more rapidly with distance between neurons for parallel growth than\nfor serial growth. Third, bidirectional connections were more numerous for\nparallel growth.

Directly getting offspring is the most basic form of fitness, but\nfitness can also be increased indirectly by helping genetically related\nindividuals (such as kin) to increase their fitness. The combined effect is\nknown as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of\nfitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and\nit incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The\nevolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model\ncombining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of\nhigh fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness,\nimplicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been\nconjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model,\ninclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness\nincrease nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for\nthe indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the\nphenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive\nfitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs\nbecause groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with\nsimilar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger. Extensive\nfitness has two components, a direct component where individuals compete in\ninducing others to become like them and an indirect component where individuals\ncooperate and help others who are already similar to them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 06:29:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:21:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 12:36:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["van Hateren", "J.

Here we studied abnormalities in functional brain subnetworks in\nhigh-functioning individuals with ASD during free viewing of a movie containing\nsocial cues and interactions. Methods: Thirteen subjects with ASD and 13\nmatched-pair controls watched a 68 minutes movie during functional magnetic\nresonance imaging. For each subject, we computed Pearson`s correlation between\nhaemodynamic time-courses of each pair of 6-mm isotropic voxels. From the\nwhole-brain functional networks, we derived individual and group-level\nsubnetworks using graph theory. Scaled inclusivity was then calculated between\nall subject pairs to estimate intersubject similarity of connectivity structure\nof each subnetwork. Additional 27 individuals with ASD from the ABIDE\nresting-state database were included to test the reproducibility of the\nresults. Results: Between-group differences were observed in the composition of\ndefault-mode and a ventro-temporal-limbic (VTL) subnetwork. The VTL subnetwork\nincluded amygdala, striatum, thalamus, parahippocampal, fusiform, and inferior\ntemporal gyri. Further, VTL subnetwork similarity between subject pairs\ncorrelated significantly with similarity of symptom gravity measured with\nautism quotient. This correlation was observed also within the controls, and in\nthe reproducibility dataset with ADI-R and ADOS scores. Conclusions:\nReorganization of functional subnetworks in individuals with ASD clarifies the\nmixture of hypo- and hyper-connectivity findings. Importantly, only the\nfunctional organization of the VTL subnetwork emerges as a marker of\ninter-individual similarities that co-vary with behavioral measures across all\nparticipants.

In this work, we propose a generalized resonate-and-fire model described\nby a generalized Langevin equation that takes into account memory effects and\ncolored noise. We perform a comprehensive numerical analysis to study the\ndynamics and the point process statistics of the proposed model, highlighting\ninteresting new features like: i) non-monotonic behavior (emergence of peak\nstructures, enhanced by the choice of colored noise characteristic time-scale)\nof the coefficient of variation (CV) as a function of memory characteristic\ntime-scale, ii) colored noise-induced shift in the CV, and iii) emergence and\nsuppression of multimodality in the interspike interval (ISI) distribution due\nto memory-induced subthreshold oscillations. Moreover, in the noise-induced\nspike regime, we study how memory and colored noise affects the coherence\nresonance (CR) phenomenon. We found that for sufficiently long memory, CR is\nnot only suppressed, but also the minimum of the CV $\\times$ noise intensity\ncurve that characterizes the presence of CR may be replaced by a maximum. The\naforementioned features allow to interpret the interplay between memory and\ncolored noise as an effective control mechanism to neuronal variability. Since\nboth variability and non-trivial temporal patterns in the ISI distribution are\nubiquitous in biological cells, we hope the present model can be useful in\nmodeling real aspects of neurons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 00:50:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2015 23:09:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["da Silva", "L.

Currently, any of the existing theoretical models can\nexplain all aspects of GC-specific spatially selective patterns of activity. It\nis also not clear how these patterns are formed during the network development.\nOn the other hand, it was previously shown that the network that can learn to\nextract high principal components from the activity of the place cells could\nprovide the basis for GC-like activity patterns development. Supporting this\nhypothesis is the finding that PC activity remains spatially stable after the\ndisruption of the GC firing patterns and that grid patterns almost disappear\nwhen hippocampal cells are deactivated. Development of the early PCs before GCs\nformation also supports the role of PCs as the spatial information providers to\nGCs. Here we have developed a new theoretical model of grid fields formation\nbased on synaptic plasticity in synapses connecting PCs in hippocampus and\nneurons in entorhinal cortex. Learning of hexagonally symmetric fields in the\nmodel is due to complex action of several simple biologicaly motivated synaptic\nplasticity rules. These rules include associative synaptic plasticity rules\nsimilar to BCM rule and homeostatic plasticity rules which restrict synaptic\nweigths. In contrast to previously described models, this network could learn\nGC patterns after a very short experience of navigation in a novel environment.\nIn conclusion we suggest that learning on the basis of simple and biologically\nplausible associative synaptic plasticity rules could contribute to the\nformation of grid fields in early development and to maintainence of normal GCs\nactivity patterns in familiar environments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:33:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 11:09:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Stepanyuk", "Andrey", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.08030", "submitter": "Radoslaw Cichy", "authors": "Radoslaw Martin Cichy, Dimitrios Pantazis", "title": "Can visual information encoded in cortical columns be decoded from\n  magnetoencephalography data in humans?", "comments": "44 pages, 6 figures 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is a principal open question whether noninvasive imaging methods in humans\ncan decode information encoded at a spatial scale as fine as the basic\nfunctional unit of cortex: cortical columns.
