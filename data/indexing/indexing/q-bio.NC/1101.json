In theory, criticality provides many desirable\nfeatures for the behaving brain, optimizing computational capabilities,\ninformation transmission, sensitivity to sensory stimuli and size of memory\nrepertoires. However, a thorough characterization of neuronal avalanches in\nfreely-behaving (FB) animals is still missing, thus raising doubts about their\nrelevance for brain function. To address this issue, we employed chronically\nimplanted multielectrode arrays (MEA) to record avalanches of spikes from the\ncerebral cortex (V1 and S1) and hippocampus (HP) of 14 rats, as they\nspontaneously traversed the wake-sleep cycle, explored novel objects or were\nsubjected to anesthesia (AN). We then modeled spike avalanches to evaluate the\nimpact of sparse MEA sampling on their statistics. We found that the size\ndistribution of spike avalanches are well fit by lognormal distributions in FB\nanimals, and by truncated power laws in the AN group. The FB data are also\ncharacterized by multiple key features compatible with criticality in the\ntemporal domain, such as 1/f spectra and long-term correlations as measured by\ndetrended fluctuation analysis. These signatures are very stable across waking,\nslow-wave sleep and rapid-eye-movement sleep, but collapse during anesthesia.\nLikewise, waiting time distributions obey a single scaling function during all\nnatural behavioral states, but not during anesthesia.

Introduction: ADHD is one of\nthe most widely spread condition of school aged children affecting 5% of\nchildren of this age.The core clinical signs of ADHD are inattention,\nrestlessness and impulsivity. According to various authors direct measures of\nattention are of two types: 1. Recording the alpha rhythm on the EEG and\nevent-related potentials (ERP); 2. Tests of reaction time, continuous\nperformance tests, paired associated learning, and tests of memorization; The\nsecond one is evidence-based. As for the first one it is known that ERPs\nespecially of those with later response reflect the process of mental\neffortfullness to select the appropriate behavior and accomplish decision\nmaking during the action of target stimulus. Thus selection of action as well\nas decision making is the most important points affected in ADHD children.\nBesides in recent years EEG biofeedback (Neurofeedback) have become the\nevidence-based in the treatment of ADHD. Unfortunately the effectiveness of\nthis approach on ERPs parameters is still unknown. Thus we aimed to study the\nchanges of ERPs after neurofeedback therapy. Methods: We have examined 16\nchildren with ADHD before- and after 3- sessions of neurofeedback therapy and\n23 without treatment. Results: We have observed statistically significant\nimprovement of parameters of later response like P300 in treated children\ncompared with untreated ones whereas the treatment was non effective for\nearlier components of ERPs. Conclusions: Neurofeedback can affect on the\nprocess of selection of action and decision making by means of changing of P300\nparameters in ADHDchildren.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jan 2011 10:03:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-01-31", "authors_parsed": [["Bakhtadze", "Sophio", ""], ["Janelidze", "Marine", ""], ["Khachapuridze", "Nana", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.5539", "submitter": "Maria Teresa Giraudo", "authors": "Laura Sacerdote and Maria Teresa Giraudo", "title": "Stochastic Integrate and Fire Models: a review on mathematical methods\n  and their applications", "comments": "61 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Middelfart Summer School 2008,\n  Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics Biosciences", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR physics.bio-ph q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mathematical models are an important tool for neuroscientists. During the\nlast thirty years many papers have appeared on single neuron description and\nspecifically on stochastic Integrate and Fire models.

Reviews appeared recently collect the main features of these models but\ndo not focus on the methodologies employed to obtain them. Aim of this paper is\nto fill this gap by upgrading old reviews on this topic. The idea is to collect\nthe existing methods and the available analytical results for the most common\none dimensional stochastic Integrate and Fire models to make them available for\nstudies on networks. An effort to unify the mathematical notations is also\nmade.

Simultaneously, the convergence time to these attractors\ndecreases as a result of cooperative dynamics between the modules.

Using mean-field analysis and simulations, we show that a\nsynchronized phase with stable collective oscillations exists even with\nnon-deterministic refractory periods. Moreover, further increasing the coupling\nstrength leads to a reentrant transition, where the synchronized phase loses\nstability. In an intermediate regime, we also observe bistability (and\nconsequently hysteresis) between a synchronized phase and an active but\nincoherent phase without oscillations. The onset of the oscillations appears in\nthe mean-field equations as a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation, the nature of which\n(i.e. super- or subcritical) is determined by the first Lyapunov coefficient.\nThis allows us to determine the borders of the oscillating and of the bistable\nregions. The mean-field prediction thus obtained agrees quantitatively with\nsimulations of complete graphs and, for random graphs, qualitatively predicts\nthe overall structure of the phase diagram. The latter can be obtained from\nsimulations by defining an order parameter q suited for detecting collective\noscillations of excitable elements. We briefly review other commonly used order\nparameters and show (via data collapse) that q satisfies the expected finite\nsize scaling relations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Jan 2011 19:28:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Rozenblit", "Fernando", ""], ["Copelli", "Mauro", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.6074", "submitter": "Jie Ren", "authors": "Wen-Xu Wang, Jie Ren, Ying-Cheng Lai, Baowen Li", "title": "Reverse engineering of complex dynamical networks in the presence of\n  time-delayed interactions based on noisy time series", "comments": "6 pages.
