In the present study, we\ninvestigated the effects of selective inhibition of COX-2 with nimesulide (12\nmg/kg) and selective inhibition of COX-1 with valeryl salicylate (VAS, 12-120\nmg/kg) on prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, Evans\nblue (EB) extravasation and infarct volume in a standardized model of transient\nfocal cerebral ischaemia in the rat. Post-ischaemic treatment with nimesulide\nmarkedly reduced the increase in PGE2 levels in the ischaemic cerebral cortex\n24 h after stroke and diminished infarct size by 48% with respect to\nvehicle-treated animals after 3 days of reperfusion. Furthermore, nimesulide\nsignificantly attenuated the blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage and leukocyte\ninfiltration (as measured by EB leakage and MPO activity, respectively) seen at\n48 h after the initial ischaemic episode. These studies provide the first\nexperimental evidence that COX-2 inhibition with nimesulide is able to limit\nBBB disruption and leukocyte infiltration following transient focal cerebral\nischaemia. Neuroprotection afforded by nimesulide is observed even when the\ntreatment is delayed until 6 h after the onset of ischaemia, confirming a wide\ntherapeutic window of COX-2 inhibitors in experimental stroke. On the contrary,\nselective inhibition of COX-1 with VAS had no significant effect on the\nevaluated parameters. These data suggest that COX-2 activity, but not COX-1\nactivity, contributes to the progression of focal ischaemic brain injury, and\nthat the beneficial effects observed with non-selective COX inhibitors are\nprobably associated to COX-2 rather than to COX-1 inhibition.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2007 15:47:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Candelario-Jalil", "E", ""], ["Gonzalez-Falcon", "A", ""], ["Garcia-Cabrera", "M", ""], ["Leon", "OS", ""], ["Fiebich", "BL", ""]]}, {"id": "0708.0187", "submitter": "Eduardo Candelario-Jalil", "authors": "E.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate\nthe neuroprotective effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor nimesulide on\ncerebral infarction and neurological deficits in a standardized model of\ntransient focal cerebral ischemia in rats. Three doses of nimesulide (3, 6 and\n12 mg/kg; i.p.) or vehicle were administered immediately after stroke and\nadditional doses were given at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after ischemia. In other\nset of experiments, the effect of nimesulide was studied in a situation in\nwhich its first administration was delayed for 3-24 h after ischemia. Total,\ncortical and subcortical infarct volumes and functional outcome (assessed by\nneurological deficit score and rotarod performance) were determined 3 days\nafter ischemia. The effect of nimesulide on prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels\nin the injured brain was also investigated. Nimesulide dose-dependently reduced\ninfarct volume and improved functional recovery when compared to vehicle. Of\ninterest is the finding that neuroprotection conferred by nimesulide (reduction\nof infarct size and neurological deficits and improvement of rotarod\nperformance) was also observed when treatment was delayed until 24 h after\nischemia. Further, administration of nimesulide in a delayed treatment paradigm\ncompletely abolished PGE(2) accumulation in the postischemic brain, suggesting\nthat COX-2 inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy for cerebral ischemia\nto target the late-occurring inflammatory events which amplify initial damage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2007 16:09:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Candelario-Jalil", "E.", ""], ["Gonzalez-Falcon", "A.", ""], ["Garcia-Cabrera", "M.", ""], ["Leon", "O.
