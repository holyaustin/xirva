The frustration due to the competition between the neuron's natural\nfiring period and that of the oscillatory rhythm, leads to a rich structure of\nasymptotic phase locking patterns and ordering dynamics. The phase transitions\nbetween these states can be classified as either tangent or discontinuous\nbifurcations, each with its own characteristic scaling laws. The discontinuous\nbifurcations exhibit a new kind of phase transition that may be viewed as\nintermediate between continuous and first order, while tangent bifurcations\nbehave like continuous transitions with a diverging coherence scale.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Oct 2007 21:35:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Engelbrecht", "Jan R.", ""], ["Mirollo", "Renato", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.0443", "submitter": "Yohan Payan", "authors": "Nicolas Vuillerme (TIMC - IMAG), Matthieu Boisgontier (TIMC - IMAG),\n  Olivier Chenu (TIMC - IMAG), Jacques Demongeot (TIMC - IMAG), Yohan Payan\n  (TIMC - IMAG)", "title": "Tongue-placed tactile biofeedback suppresses the deleterious effects of\n  muscle fatigue on joint position sense at the ankle", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Experimental Brain Research 183, 2 (2007) 235-40", "doi": "10.1007/s00221-007-1039-4", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.NC", "license": null, "abstract": "  Whereas the acuity of the position sense at the ankle can be disturbed by\nmuscle fatigue, it recently also has been shown to be improved, under normal\nankle neuromuscular state, through the use of an artificial tongue-placed\ntactile biofeedback. The underlying principle of this biofeedback consisted of\nsupplying individuals with supplementary information about the position of\ntheir matching ankle position relative to their reference ankle position\nthrough electrotactile stimulation of the tongue. Within this context, the\npurpose of the present experiment was to investigate whether this biofeedback\ncould mitigate the deleterious effect of muscle fatigue on joint position sense\nat the ankle. To address this objective, sixteen young healthy university\nstudents were asked to perform an active ankle-matching task in two conditions\nof No-fatigue and Fatigue of the ankle muscles and two conditions of\nNo-biofeedback and Biofeedback. Measures of the overall accuracy and the\nvariability of the positioning were determined using the absolute error and the\nvariable error, respectively. Results showed that the availability of the\nbiofeedback allowed the subjects to suppress the deleterious effects of muscle\nfatigue on joint position sense at the ankle.
