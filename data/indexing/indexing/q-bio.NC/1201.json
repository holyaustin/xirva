Ideally, these\nstudies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to\nimproved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To\naccomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while\navoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of\npopulations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms\nthat influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop\na point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and\naccurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by\nthe framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a\ncascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be\nassociated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal\ndynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely\ndetermines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics\nfrom recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including\nthreshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie. The model also accounts for\nrefractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve\nfibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions\nto published physiological data and explain differences in auditory nerve\nresponses to high and low pulse rate stimulation. We close by performing an\nideal observer analysis of simulated spike trains in response to sinusoidally\namplitude modulated stimuli and find that carrier pulse rate does not affect\nmodulation detection thresholds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 02:14:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Goldwyn", "Joshua H.", ""], ["Rubinstein", "Jay T.", ""], ["Shea-Brown", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5721", "submitter": "Joaquin Torres", "authors": "J.
