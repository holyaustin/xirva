The action potential gives rise to a\nlarge quadrupole moment that contributes to the extracellular field up to\ndistances of almost 1 cm. This method will serve as a starting point in\nconnecting the microscopic generation of electric fields at the level of\nneurons to macroscopic observables such as the local field potential.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Nov 2007 22:57:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Milstein", "J.

We showed that the\ndecrease of synaptic current results in spike death through depressing the\nfeedback of sodium ionic current. In the networks with spike death property the\ndegree of synchronization is lower and unsensitive to the heterogeneity of\nneurons.
