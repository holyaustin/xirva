The spiking response of\nthe neuron to a complex, time-varying input can be predicted from the detailed\nbiophysical properties of the neuron, modeled as a deterministic nonlinear\ndynamical system. In the tradition of neural coding, however, a neuron or\nneural system is treated as a black box and statistical techniques are used to\nidentify functional models of its encoding properties. The goal of this work is\nto connect the mechanistic, biophysical approach to neuronal function to a\ndescription in terms of a coding model. Building from preceding work at the\nsingle neuron level, we develop from first principles a mathematical theory\nmapping the relationships between two simple but powerful classes of models:\ndeterministic integrate-and-fire dynamical models and linear-nonlinear coding\nmodels. To do so, we develop an approach for studying a nonlinear dynamical\nsystem by conditioning on an observed linear estimator. We derive asymptotic\nclosed-form expressions for the linear filter and estimates for the nonlinear\ndecision function of the linear/nonlinear model. We analytically derive the\ndependence of the linear filter on the input statistics and we show how\ndeterministic nonlinear dynamics can be used to modulate the properties of a\nprobabilistic code. We demonstrate that integrate-and-fire models without any\nadditional currents can perform perfect contrast gain control, a sophisticated\nadaptive computation, and we identify the general dynamical principles\nresponsible. We then design from first principles a nonlinear dynamical model\nthat implements gain control. While we focus on the integrate-and-fire models\nfor tractability, the framework we propose to relate LN and dynamical models\ngeneralizes naturally to more complex biophysical models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2011 00:57:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Dec 2011 22:13:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Famulare", "Michael", ""], ["Fairhall", "Adrienne", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.0309", "submitter": "Mohammadkarim Saeedghalati", "authors": "Mohammad-Farshad Abdollah-nia, Mohammadkarim Saeedghalati and\n  Abdolhossein Abbassian", "title": "Optimal Region of Latching Activity in an Adaptive Potts Model for\n  Networks of Neurons", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2012/02/P02018", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In statistical mechanics, the Potts model is a model for interacting spins\nwith more than two discrete states.

Our analysis reveals the interplay of the intrinsic properties\nof the individual cells and network topology and their respective contributions\nto this important effect. In particular, we show that networks on graphs with\nlarge algebraic connectivity or small total effective resistance are better\nequipped for implementing denoising.

In contrast to most earlier work, where only reliable\nsynaptic connections are considered, we mainly examine the effects of\nunreliable synapses on both types of neural activity propagation in this work.\nWe first study networks composed of purely excitatory neurons. Our results show\nthat both the successful transmission probability and excitatory synaptic\nstrength largely influence the propagation of these two types of neural\nactivities, and better tuning of these synaptic parameters makes the considered\nnetwork support stable signal propagation. It is also found that noise has\nsignificant but different impacts on these two types of propagation. The\nadditive Gaussian white noise has the tendency to reduce the precision of the\nsynfire activity, whereas noise with appropriate intensity can enhance the\nperformance of firing rate propagation. Further simulations indicate that the\npropagation dynamics of the considered neuronal network is not simply\ndetermined by the average amount of received neurotransmitter for each neuron\nin a time instant, but also largely influenced by the stochastic effect of\nneurotransmitter release. Second, we compare our results with those obtained in\ncorresponding feedforward neuronal networks connected with reliable synapses\nbut in a random coupling fashion. We confirm that some differences can be\nobserved in these two different feedforward neuronal network models.

One possibility is to balance decay modes of\nmembranes and synapses with recurrent excitation. To allow integration over\nlong timescales, however, this balance must be precise; this is known as the\nfine tuning problem. The need for fine tuning can be overcome via a\nratchet-like mechanism, in which momentary inputs must be above a preset limit\nto be registered by the circuit.
