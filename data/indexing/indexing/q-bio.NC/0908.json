From a physical perspective, the entropy of the RT\ndistribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing\nperformed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the\nconventional interpretation of individual RTs being either long or short, into\ntheir distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new\napproach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without\nreference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus\nproviding a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different\nsources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The\npaper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical\nvalidation using a database of human RTs in lexical tasks (visual lexical\ndecision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of RTs\nis more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical\nestimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads\nsharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it\nprovides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes\ninformation. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated\nempirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that\nsystematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular\ndemands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law,\nwhich posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental\ncontext.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2009 17:00:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-24", "authors_parsed": [["Mart\u00edn", "Ferm\u00edn Moscoso del Prado", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3268", "submitter": "Alain Destexhe", "authors": "Claude Bedard, Serafim Rodrigues, Noah Roy, Diego Contreras and Alain\n  Destexhe", "title": "Evidence for frequency-dependent extracellular impedance from the\n  transfer function between extracellular and intracellular potentials", "comments": "Journal of Computational Neuroscience (revised, May 2010)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We examine the properties of the transfer function F_T = V_m / V_{LFP}\nbetween the intracellular membrane potential (V_m) and the local field\npotential (V_{LFP}) in cerebral cortex.

Using a mean-field approximation, we\nobtain a method to estimate the impedance of the extracellular medium without\ninjecting currents. We examine the transfer function for bipolar (differential)\nLFPs and compare to simultaneous recordings of V_m and V_{LFP} during\ndesynchronized states in rat barrel cortex in vivo. The experimentally derived\nF_T matches the one derived theoretically, only if one assumes that the\nimpedance of the extracellular medium is frequency-dependent, and varies as\n1/sqrt(omega) (Warburg impedance) for frequencies between 3 and 500 Hz. This\nconstitutes indirect evidence that the extracellular medium is non-resistive,\nwhich has many possible consequences for modeling LFPs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2009 17:28:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2009 17:41:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 7 Mar 2010 17:48:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2010 16:26:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Mon, 17 May 2010 20:05:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Bedard", "Claude", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Serafim", ""], ["Roy", "Noah", ""], ["Contreras", "Diego", ""], ["Destexhe", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.3432", "submitter": "Ferm\\'in Moscoso del Prado Mart\\'in", "authors": "Ferm\\'in Moscoso del Prado Mart\\'in", "title": "The baseline for response latency distributions", "comments": "Submitted manuscript", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Response latency -- the time taken to initiate or complete an action or task\n-- is one of the principal measures used to investigate the mechanisms\nsubserving human and animal cognitive processes. The right tails of response\nlatency distributions have received little attention in experimental\npsychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been\nconsidered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected\nto reflect `contingent' neural events unrelated to the experimental question.\nMost current theories predict the right tail of response latency distributions\nto decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends\ndiscarding very long response latencies as `outliers'. Here, I show that the\nright tails of response latency distributions always follow a power-law with a\nslope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be\nconsidered outliers.
