Instantaneous population firing rate\n(IPFR) $R(t)$, which is directly obtained from the raster plot of neural\nspikes, is often used as a realistic collective quantity describing population\nactivities in both the computational and the experimental neuroscience. For the\ncase of spiking neurons, a realistic time-domain order parameter, based on\n$R(t)$, was introduced in our recent work to characterize the spike\nsynchronization transition. Unlike the case of spiking neurons, the IPFR $R(t)$\nof bursting neurons exhibits population behaviors with both the slow bursting\nand the fast spiking timescales. For our aim, we decompose the IPFR $R(t)$ into\nthe instantaneous population bursting rate $R_b(t)$ (describing the bursting\nbehavior) and the instantaneous population spike rate $R_s(t)$ (describing the\nspiking behavior) via frequency filtering, and extend the realistic order\nparameter to the case of bursting neurons. Thus, we develop the\nfrequency-domain bursting and spiking order parameters which are just the\nbursting and spiking \"coherence factors\" $\\beta_b$ and $\\beta_s$ of the\nbursting and spiking peaks in the power spectral densities of $R_b$ and $R_s$\n(i.e., \"signal to noise\" ratio of the spectral peak height and its relative\nwidth). Through calculation of $\\beta_b$ and $\\beta_s$, we obtain the bursting\nand spiking thresholds beyond which the burst and spike synchronizations break\nup, respectively.

In particular, we investigate the\ndynamical repertoire from normal spiking (milliseconds) to spreading depression\nand anoxic depolarization (tens of seconds) and show that FHM3 mutations render\ngray matter tissue more vulnerable to spreading depression despite opposing\neffects associated with action potential generation. We conclude that the\nclassification in terms of hypoexcitability vs. hyperexcitability is too simple\na scheme. Our mathematical analysis provides further basic insight into also\npreviously discussed criticisms against this scheme based on psychophysical and\nclinical data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Mar 2014 19:26:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Dahlem", "Markus A.", ""], ["Schumacher", "Julia", ""], ["H\u00fcbel", "Niklas", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7151", "submitter": "Luiz Pessoa", "authors": "Luiz Pessoa", "title": "Understanding brain networks and brain organization", "comments": "61 pages, 24 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.plrev.2014.03.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What is the relationship between brain and behavior? The answer to this\nquestion necessitates characterizing the mapping between structure and\nfunction. The aim of this paper is to discuss broad issues surrounding the link\nbetween structure and function in the brain that will motivate a network\nperspective to understanding this question. As others in the past, I argue that\na network perspective should supplant the common strategy of understanding the\nbrain in terms of individual regions. Whereas this perspective is needed for a\nfuller characterization of the mind-brain, it should not be viewed as panacea.\nFor one, the challenges posed by the many-to-many mapping between regions and\nfunctions is not dissolved by the network perspective. Although the problem is\nameliorated, one should not anticipate a one-to-one mapping when the network\napproach is adopted. Furthermore, decomposition of the brain network in terms\nof meaningful clusters of regions, such as the ones generated by\ncommunity-finding algorithms, does not by itself reveal 'true' subnetworks.\nGiven the hierarchical and multi-relational relationship between regions,\nmultiple decompositions will offer different 'slices' of a broader landscape of\nnetworks within the brain. Finally, I described how the function of brain\nregions can be characterized in a multidimensional manner via the idea of\ndiversity profiles. The concept can also be used to describe the way different\nbrain regions participate in networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Mar 2014 17:59:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Pessoa", "Luiz", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.7439", "submitter": "David Gall", "authors": "Vadim Shlyonsky, Freddy Dupuis and David Gall", "title": "The OpenPicoAmp : an open-source planar lipid bilayer amplifier for\n  hands-on learning of neuroscience", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures and supplementary information (9 files including\n  one movie).

We explore a more general model\nof decision-making that instead estimates the probability that each option is\ngood, allowing several options to be good simultaneously. This model predicts\nwith great generality the enhanced imitation in negative situations.
