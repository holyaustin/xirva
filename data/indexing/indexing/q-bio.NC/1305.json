Even during long-term experiments, cultured\nneurons subjected to CoDyPs generate seemingly random, but reproducible spike\npatterns. In voltage clamped cells CoDyPs induced highly reproducible current\nwaveforms that could be precisely predicted from the light-conductance transfer\nfunction of ChIEF. CoDyPs can replace the conventional, flash-evoked imprinting\nof spike patterns in in-vivo and in-vitro studies, preserving natural activity.\nWhen combined with non-invasive spike-detection, CoDyPs allows the acquisition\nof order of magnitudes larger data sets than previously possible, for studies\nof dynamical response properties of many individual neurons.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 May 2013 14:48:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 09:04:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Neef", "Andreas", ""], ["Hady", "Ahmed El", ""], ["Nagpal", "Jatin", ""], ["Br\u00f6king", "Kai", ""], ["Afshar", "Ghazaleh", ""], ["Schl\u00fcter", "Oliver M", ""], ["Geisel", "Theo", ""], ["Bamberg", "Ernst", ""], ["Fleischmann", "Ragnar", ""], ["St\u00fchmer", "Walter", ""], ["Wolf", "Fred", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.7271", "submitter": "David Albers", "authors": "D J Albers, J Claassen, M J Schmidt, G Hripcsak", "title": "A methodology for detecting and exploring non-convulsive seizures in\n  patients with SAH", "comments": "Submitted to NOLTA 2013", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A methodology for understanding and de- tecting nonconvulsive seizures in\nindividuals with sub- arachnoid hemorrhage is introduced.
