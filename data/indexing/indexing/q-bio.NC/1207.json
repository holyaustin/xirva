In addition to massive\ncellular depolarization, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and\nmetabolism -- aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to\ntraumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine.\n  In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on\nmodeling the features essential to understanding the implications of\nneurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium--ATPase,\nmainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a\nrate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is\ndetermined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an\neffective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium\nconcentration.

However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation\nplay important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery.

Since\nnew processes are constantly being discovered, biophysical neuron models\nincreasingly become \"too complex to be useful\" yet \"too simple to be\nrealistic\". A fundamental open question in theoretical neuroscience pertains to\nhow this deadlock may be resolved. In order to tackle this problem, we first\ndefine the notion of a \"excitable neuron model\". Then we analytically derive\nthe input-output relation of such neuronal models, relating input spike trains\nto output spikes based on known biophysical properties. Thus we obtain\nclosed-form expressions for the mean firing rates, all second order statistics\n(input-state-output correlation and spectra) and construct optimal linear\nestimators for the neuronal response and internal state. These results are\nguaranteed to hold, given a few generic assumptions, for any stochastic\nbiophysical neuron model (with an arbitrary number of slow kinetic processes)\nunder general sparse stimulation. This solution suggests that the common\nsimplifying approach that ignores much of the complexity of the neuron might\nactually be unnecessary and even deleterious in some cases. Specifically, the\nstochasticity of ion channels and the temporal sparseness of inputs is exactly\nwhat rendered our analysis tractable, allowing us to incorporate slow kinetics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jul 2012 12:21:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 11:33:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 19 Aug 2012 20:19:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 22:29:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Soudry", "Daniel", ""], ["Meir", "Ron", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6319", "submitter": "William Bialek", "authors": "Gasper Tkacik, Olivier Marre, Thierry Mora, Dario Amodei, Michael J.\n  Berry II, and William Bialek", "title": "The simplest maximum entropy model for collective behavior in a neural\n  network", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2013/03/P03011", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent work emphasizes that the maximum entropy principle provides a bridge\nbetween statistical mechanics models for collective behavior in neural networks\nand experiments on networks of real neurons.

Our motivation for recovering this well-known\nlearning prescription is two-fold: first, the switch-like nature of the induced\nsynaptic bonds, as there is evidence that biological synaptic transitions might\noccur in a discrete stepwise fashion. Second, the possibility that in the\nmammalian brain, unused, silent synapses might be pruned in the long-term.\nBesides the usual pattern and network capacities, we calculate the synaptic\ncapacity of the model, a recently proposed measure where only the functional\nsubset of synapses is taken into account. We find that in terms of network\ncapacity, Willshaw learning is strongly affected by the pattern coding rates,\nwhich have to be kept fixed and very low at any time to achieve a non-zero\ncapacity in the large network limit. The information carried per functional\nsynapse, however, diverges and is comparable to that of the pattern association\ncase, even for more realistic moderately low activity levels that are a\nfunction of network size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 09:42:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sacramento", "Jo\u00e3o", ""], ["Wichert", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7228", "submitter": "Matthias Schultze-Kraft", "authors": "Matthias Schultze-Kraft, Markus Diesmann, Sonja Gr\\\"un, Moritz Helias", "title": "Noise Suppression and Surplus Synchrony by Coincidence Detection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Schultze-Kraft M, Diesmann M, Gr\\\"un S, Helias M (2013) Noise\n  Suppression and Surplus Synchrony by Coincidence Detection.

In particular it is presently\nunclear how much synchrony is caused by afferent synchronized events and how\nmuch is intrinsic due to the connectivity structure of cortex. The available\nanalytical approaches based on the diffusion approximation do not allow to\nmodel spike synchrony, preventing a thorough analysis. Here we theoretically\ninvestigate to what extent common synaptic afferents and synchronized inputs\neach contribute to closely time-locked spiking activity of pairs of neurons. We\nemploy direct simulation and extend earlier analytical methods based on the\ndiffusion approximation to pulse-coupling, allowing us to introduce precisely\ntimed correlations in the spiking activity of the synaptic afferents. We\ninvestigate the transmission of correlated synaptic input currents by pairs of\nintegrate-and-fire model neurons, so that the same input covariance can be\nrealized by common inputs or by spiking synchrony. We identify two distinct\nregimes: In the limit of low correlation linear perturbation theory accurately\ndetermines the correlation transmission coefficient, which is typically smaller\nthan unity, but increases sensitively even for weakly synchronous inputs. In\nthe limit of high afferent correlation, in the presence of synchrony a\nqualitatively new picture arises. As the non-linear neuronal response becomes\ndominant, the output correlation becomes higher than the total correlation in\nthe input. This transmission coefficient larger unity is a direct consequence\nof non-linear neural processing in the presence of noise, elucidating how\nsynchrony-coded signals benefit from these generic properties present in\ncortical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 12:51:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2012 12:29:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Schultze-Kraft", "Matthias", ""], ["Diesmann", "Markus", ""], ["Gr\u00fcn", "Sonja", ""], ["Helias", "Moritz", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7257", "submitter": "Anca Radulescu", "authors": "Anca Radulescu, Paul Adams", "title": "Hebbian Crosstalk and Input Segregation", "comments": "17 pages manuscript text, 2 pages references, 9 figures, 4 appendices\n  (included within the main file)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Purpose: We previously proposed that Hebbian adjustments that are\nincompletely synapse specific (\"crosstalk\") might be analogous to genetic\nmutations. We analyze aspects of the effect of crosstalk in Hebbian learning\nusing the classical Oja model.\n  Methods: In previous work we showed that crosstalk leads to learning of the\nprincipal eigenvector of EC (the input covariance matrix pre-multiplied by an\nerror matrix that describes the crosstalk pattern), and found that with\npositive input correlations increasing crosstalk smoothly degrades performance.\nHowever, the Oja model requires negative input correlations to account for\nbiological ocular segregation. Although this assumption is biologically\nsomewhat implausible, it captures features that are seen in more complex\nmodels. Here, we analyze how crosstalk would affect such segregation.\n  Results: We show that for statistically unbiased inputs crosstalk induces a\nbifurcation from segregating to non-segregating outcomes at a critical value\nwhich depends on correlations. We also investigate the behavior in the vicinity\nof this critical state and for weakly biased inputs.\n  Conclusions: Our results show that crosstalk can induce a bifurcation under\nspecial conditions even in the simplest Hebbian models and that even the low\nlevels of crosstalk observed in the brain could prevent normal development.\nHowever, during learning pairwise input statistics are more complex and\ncrosstalk-induced bifurcations may not occur in the Oja model. Such\nbifurcations would be analogous to \"error catastrophes\" in genetic models, and\nwe argue that they are usually absent for simple linear Hebbian learning\nbecause such learning is only driven by pairwise correlations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2012 14:26:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 04:37:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Radulescu", "Anca", ""], ["Adams", "Paul", ""]]}]
