A seizure can be\ncharacterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime,\ni.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico\ntreatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the\nbrain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and\npotential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external\nstimulation.

We show, for neural\nsystems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via\nexternal stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be\napplied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas\nadjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'.

We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved\nin the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods: An\nelectrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to\ninvestigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single\npsychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the\nsensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results:\nUnder the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency:\n10-16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1-4Hz) oscillations were recorded in the\nfrontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual\njuxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and\nglutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN\ncells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials\n(7 to 15 APs at 200-700Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine\nfleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing\ngamma-(30-80Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing\npattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode.\nFurthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC\nconnectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine\neffects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations.\nConclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor\nhypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta\noscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN\nactivities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating\nsystem and the corticothalamic pathway.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 May 2020 09:57:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Pinault", "Didier", "", "FMTS"]]}, {"id": "2005.02181", "submitter": "Wei Ji Ma", "authors": "Wei Ji Ma and Benjamin Peters", "title": "A neural network walks into a lab: towards using deep nets as models for\n  human behavior", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  What might sound like the beginning of a joke has become an attractive\nprospect for many cognitive scientists: the use of deep neural network models\n(DNNs) as models of human behavior in perceptual and cognitive tasks.

The phase couplings between oscillators are shaped\nby the stimulus structure, causing cells to synchronize if the local contrast\nin their receptive fields is similar. In essence, relaxation in the oscillator\nnetwork solves a graph clustering problem with the graph representing feature\nsimilarity between different points in the image. We tested different model\nversions on the Berkeley Image Segmentation Data Set (BSDS). Networks with\nphase interactions set by standard representations of the feature graph\n(adjacency matrix, Graph Laplacian or modularity) failed to exhibit\nsegmentation performance significantly over the baseline, a model of\nindependent sensors. In contrast, a network with phase interactions that takes\ninto account not only feature similarities but also geometric distances between\nreceptive fields exhibited segmentation performance significantly above\nbaseline.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 May 2020 02:58:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Warner", "Christopher", ""], ["Sommer", "Friedrich T.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.02602", "submitter": "Ji-Hoon Jeong", "authors": "Kyung-Hwan Shim, Ji-Hoon Jeong, Seong-Whan Lee", "title": "Gradual Relation Network: Decoding Intuitive Upper Extremity Movement\n  Imaginations Based on Few-Shot EEG Learning", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE eess.SP q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication tool that connects users\nand external devices.

Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in\nneuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to\nsensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models.\nAccording to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian\ninference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active\ninference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational\napproximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others,\nperception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy\nminimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to\nLQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor\ncontrol in biological systems based on a process of biased perception.
