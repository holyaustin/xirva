We apply\nsuperthreshold electrical stimulation, specifically depolarizing DC current,\ninterrupted at different frequencies, to a simple model of a population of\ncortical neurons which uses phenomenological descriptions of neurons by\nIzhikevich and synaptic connections on a similar level of sophistication. With\nthis model, we are able to reproduce the optimal desynchronization around\n100Hz, as well as to predict the full frequency dependence of the efficiency of\ndesynchronization, and thereby to give a possible explanation for the action\nmechanism of TCES.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Mar 2012 16:16:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sch\u00fctt", "Markus", ""], ["Claussen", "Jens Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.5673", "submitter": "Yasser Roudi", "authors": "Joanna Tyrcha, Yasser Roudi, Matteo Marsili, John Hertz", "title": "The Effect of Nonstationarity on Models Inferred from Neural Data", "comments": "version in press in J Stat Mech", "journal-ref": "J.

Correlations in the statistics of neural spike trains also\narise as the effect of interaction between neurons. Here we show that these two\nsituations can be distinguished, with machine learning techniques, provided the\ndata are rich enough. In order to do this, we study the problem of inferring a\nkinetic Ising model, stationary or nonstationary, from the available data. We\napply the inference procedure to two data sets: one from salamander retinal\nganglion cells and the other from a realistic computational cortical network\nmodel. We show that many aspects of the concerted activity of the salamander\nretinal neurons can be traced simply to the external input. A model of\nnon-interacting neurons subject to a non-stationary external field outperforms\na model with stationary input with couplings between neurons, even accounting\nfor the differences in the number of model parameters. When couplings are added\nto the non-stationary model, for the retinal data, little is gained: the\ninferred couplings are generally not significant. Likewise, the distribution of\nthe sizes of sets of neurons that spike simultaneously and the frequency of\nspike patterns as function of their rank (Zipf plots) are well-explained by an\nindependent-neuron model with time-dependent external input, and adding\nconnections to such a model does not offer significant improvement. For the\ncortical model data, robust couplings, well correlated with the real\nconnections, can be inferred using the non-stationary model. Adding connections\nto this model slightly improves the agreement with the data for the probability\nof synchronous spikes but hardly affects the Zipf plot.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Mar 2012 14:08:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 13:19:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Tyrcha", "Joanna", ""], ["Roudi", "Yasser", ""], ["Marsili", "Matteo", ""], ["Hertz", "John", ""]]}, {"id": "1203.6832", "submitter": "Lucilla de Arcangelis", "authors": "Lucilla de Arcangelis and Hans J.
