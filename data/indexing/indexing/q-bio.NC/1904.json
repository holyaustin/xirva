The scaling\nexponent confirms that all normal sABR are classified into the non-stationary\nprocess. The average Hurst exponent is $H=0.77\\pm0.12$ at 68\\% confidence\ninterval indicating long-range correlation which shows the first universality\nbehavior of sABR. Our findings exhibit that fluctuations in the sABR series are\ndictated by a mechanism associated with long-term memory of the dynamic of the\nauditory system in the brainstem level. The $q-$dependency of $h(q)$\ndemonstrates that underlying data sets have multifractal nature revealing the\nsecond universality behavior of the normal sABR samples. Comparing Hurst\nexponent of original sABR with the results of the corresponding shuffled and\nsurrogate series, we conclude that its multifractality is almost due to the\nlong-range temporal correlations which are devoted to the third universality.\nFinally, the presence of long-range correlation which is related to the slow\ntimescales in the subcortical level and integration of information in the\nbrainstem network is confirmed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Mar 2019 07:36:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mozaffarilegha", "Marjan", ""], ["Movahed", "S.

We demonstrate that AFODF tractography improves\ncortico-cortical connectivity and provides highly consistent outcomes between\ntwo different field strengths (3T and 7T).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 6 Apr 2019 01:05:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Apr 2019 19:09:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-15", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Ye", ""], ["Hong", "Yoonmi", ""], ["Feng", "Yuanjing", ""], ["Shen", "Dinggang", ""], ["Yap", "Pew-Thian", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.03399", "submitter": "Bosiljka Tadic", "authors": "Bosiljka Tadic, Miroslav Andjelkovic, Roderick Melnik", "title": "Functional Geometry of Human Connectome and Robustness of Gender\n  Differences", "comments": "13 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn math.AT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Mapping the brain imaging data to networks, where each node represents a\nspecific area of the brain, has enabled an objective graph-theoretic analysis\nof human connectome.

The prediction procedure\nshould yield accurate results in a fast enough fashion to alert patients of\nimpending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to\nobtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic\nseizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the\ndata size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format\nthat can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

While the number of neurons that can be recorded\nsimultaneously is increasing at a fast pace, in most cases these recordings\ncannot access a complete population. In particular, it is hard to\nsimultaneously record all the neurons of the same type in a given area.

Here we show that we can\ninfer the activity of a full population of retina ganglion cells from\nsequential recordings, using a novel method based on copula distributions and\nmaximum entropy modeling. From just the spiking response of each ganglion cell\nto a repeated stimulus, and a few pairwise recordings, we could predict the\nnoise correlations using copulas, and then the full activity of a large\npopulation of ganglion cells of the same type using maximum entropy modeling.\nRemarkably, we could generalize to predict the population responses to\ndifferent stimuli and even to different experiments. We could therefore use our\nmethod to construct a very large population merging cells' responses from\ndifferent experiments.

We analyzed the\nassociation between cord-blood vitamin D level at birth and night-sleep\nduration trajectories for children between 2 and 5-6 years old in a\nnon-clinical cohort.Method: We included 264 children from the French EDEN\nmother-child birth-cohort with both cord-blood 25OHD level determined by\nradio-immunoassay at birth, and night-sleep trajectories for children between 2\nand 5-6 years old obtained by the group-based trajectory modeling method.\nAssociations between 25OHD and sleep trajectories were assessed by multinomial\nlogistic regression adjusted for maternal and child characteristics.Results:\nThe trajectories short sleep (<10h30/night), medium-low sleep\n(10h30-11h00/night), medium-high sleep ($\\approx$11h30/night), long sleep\n($\\ge$11h30/night) and changing sleep (decreased from $\\ge$11h30 to\n10h30-11h00/night) represented 5%, 46%, 37%, 4% and 8% of the children,\nrespectively. The mean 25OHD level was 19 ng/ml (SD=11, range 3 to 63). It was\n12 (SD=7), 20 (SD=11), 19 (SD=10), 14 (SD=7) and 16 (SD=8) ng/ml for children\nwith short, medium-low, medium-high, long and changing sleep trajectories,\nrespectively. On adjusted analysis, for each 1-ng/ml decrease in 25OHD level,\nthe odds of belonging to the short sleep versus medium-high sleep trajectory\nwas increased (odds ratio =1.12, 95% confidence interval [1.01-1.25]). We found\nno other significant association between 25OHD level and other\ntrajectories.Conclusion: Low 25OHD level at birth may be associated with\nincreased probability of being a persistent short sleeper in preschool years.\nThese results need confirmation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 10 Apr 2019 08:56:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Yong", "Chu Yan", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"], ["Reynaud", "Eve", "", "INSERM, CRESS -\n  U1153"], ["Forhan", "Anne", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"], ["Dargent-Molina", "Partricia", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"], ["Heude", "Barbara", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"], ["Charles", "Marie-Aline", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"], ["Plancoulaine", "Sabine", "", "INSERM, CRESS - U1153"]]}, {"id": "1904.05467", "submitter": "Mohammad Nami", "authors": "Ali-Mohammad Kamali, Mohammad Javad Gholamzadeh, Seyedeh Zahra\n  Mousavi, Maryam Vasaghi Gharamaleki, Mohammad Nami", "title": "Improved visual function in a case of ultra-low vision following\n  ischemic encephalopathy following transcranial electrical stimulation; A case\n  study", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cortical visual impairment is amongst the key pathological causes of\npediatric visual abnormalities predominantly resulting from hypoxic-ischemic\nbrain injury.

We show that an object with a\nhigh integrated information value is also more compressible, and is, therefore,\nmore sensitive to perturbations. We find that such a perturbation test\nquantifying compression sensitivity provides a system with a means to extract\nexplanations--causal accounts--of its own behaviour.

This\nhypothesis is partially supported by strong evidence for balanced\nspatiotemporal dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex, however, evidence of a\ncausal relationship between network interactions and cortex activity, as\npredicted by a branching process, is missing in humans. Here we test this\ncause-effect relationship by monitoring cortex activity under systematic\npharmacological reduction of cortical network interactions with antiepileptic\ndrugs. We report that cortical activity cascades, presented by the propagating\npatterns of epileptic spikes, as well as temporal correlations decline\nprecisely as predicted for a branching process. Our results provide the missing\nlink to the branching process theory of cortical network function with\nimplications for understanding the foundations of cortical excitability and its\nmonitoring in conditions like epilepsy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 02:55:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Meisel", "Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.13052", "submitter": "Haiping Huang", "authors": "Tianqi Hou, and K.Y.

This permutation symmetry plays an important\nrole in understanding the computation performance of a broad class of neural\nnetworks with two or more hidden units. However, a theoretical study of the\npermutation symmetry is still lacking. Here, we propose a minimal model with\nonly two hidden units in a restricted Boltzmann machine, which aims to address\nhow the permutation symmetry affects the critical learning data size at which\nthe concept-formation (or spontaneous symmetry breaking in physics language)\nstarts, and moreover semi-rigorously prove a conjecture that the critical data\nsize is independent of the number of hidden units once this number is finite.\nRemarkably, we find that the embedded correlation between two receptive fields\nof hidden units reduces the critical data size. In particular, the\nweakly-correlated receptive fields have the benefit of significantly reducing\nthe minimal data size that triggers the transition, given less noisy data.\nInspired by the theory, we also propose an efficient fully-distributed\nalgorithm to infer the receptive fields of hidden units. Furthermore, our\nminimal model reveals that the permutation symmetry can also be spontaneously\nbroken following the spontaneous symmetry breaking. Overall, our results\ndemonstrate that the unsupervised learning is a progressive combination of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and permutation symmetry breaking which are both\nspontaneous processes driven by data streams (observations). All these effects\ncan be analytically probed based on the minimal model, providing theoretical\ninsights towards understanding unsupervised learning in a more general context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 05:08:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2019 01:31:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-17", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Tianqi", ""], ["Wong", "K.
