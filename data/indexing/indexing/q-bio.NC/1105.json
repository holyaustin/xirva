There is a multimodal odd-all transition\nbetween the 2:1 and 3:1 locked-in states. A strong antiresonant effect is found\nbetween the states 3:1 and 4:1, where the modes (2+3n):1, $n=0,1,2,...$, are\nentirely absent. At high frequencies the excitation threshold is a nonmonotonic\nfunction of the stimulus and the perithreshold region is bistable, with the\nquiescent state coexisting with either a regular or chaotic firing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 May 2011 19:06:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 May 2013 14:25:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Borkowski", "L.

To model such systems Hindmarsh-Rose (HR) oscillators are considered\nas appropriate as they mimic the qualitative behaviour of neuronal firing. Here\nwe consider a large number of identical HR-oscillators interacting through the\nmean field created by the corresponding components of all oscillators.\nIntroducing additional coupling by feedback of Pyragas type, proportional to\nthe difference between the current value of the mean-field and its value some\ntime in the past, Rosenblum and Pikovsky (Phys. Rev. E 70, 041904, 2004)\ndemonstrated that the desirable desynchronization could be achieved with\nappropriate set of parameters for the system. Following our experience with\nstabilization of unstable steady states in dynamical systems, we show that by\nintroducing a variable delay, desynchronization is obtainable for much wider\nrange of parameters and that at the same time it becomes more pronounced.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 11:02:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Gjurchinovski", "Aleksandar", ""], ["Urumov", "Viktor", ""], ["Vasilkoski", "Zlatko", ""]]}]
