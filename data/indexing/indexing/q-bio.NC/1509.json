A key\ndifficulty is that these maps are collective, emergent phenomena that cannot be\nreduced to a simple combination of inputs provided by individual neurons. In\nthis paper we suggest computational frameworks for integrating the spiking\nsignals of individual cells into a spatial map, which we call schemas. We\nprovide examples of four schemas defined by different types of topological\nrelations that may be neurophysiologically encoded in the brain and demonstrate\nthat each schema provides its own large-scale characteristics of the\nenvironment---the schema integrals. Moreover, we find that, in all cases, these\nintegrals are learned at a rate which is faster than the rate of complete\ntraining of neural networks.

In a previous work we have reported the\nconstruction of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server\nhttp://connectome.pitgroup.org from the data recorded in the Human Connectome\nProject of the NIH.

When the value of $k$ is changed from\n$k=418$ through 1 by moving a slider at the webserver from right to left, more\nand more edges appear in the consensus graph. The astonishing observation is\nthat the appearance of the new edges is not random: it is similar to a growing\ntree.

For some of these risk factors, independent\nprior investigations have examined the effects of genetic alterations on the\ncellular electrical excitability and calcium homeostasis. In the present\nproof-of-concept study, we harnessed these experimental results for modeling of\ncomputational properties on layer V cortical pyramidal cell and identify\npossible common alterations in behavior across SCZ-related genes.\n  Methods: We applied a biophysically detailed multi-compartmental model to\nstudy the excitability of a layer V pyramidal cell. We reviewed the literature\non functional genomics for variants of genes associated with SCZ, and used\nchanges in neuron model parameters to represent the effects of these variants.\n  Results: We present and apply a framework for examining the effects of subtle\nsingle nucleotide polymorphisms in ion channel and Ca2+ transporter-encoding\ngenes on neuron excitability. Our analysis indicates that most of the\nconsidered SCZ- related genetic variants affect the spiking behavior and\nintracellular calcium dynamics resulting from summation of inputs across the\ndendritic tree.\n  Conclusions: Our results suggest that alteration in the ability of a single\nneuron to integrate the inputs and scale its excitability may constitute a\nfundamental mechanistic contributor to mental disease, alongside with the\npreviously proposed deficits in synaptic communication and network behavior.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 07:12:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["M\u00e4ki-Marttunen", "Tuomo", ""], ["Halnes", "Geir", ""], ["Devor", "Anna", ""], ["Witoelar", "Aree", ""], ["Bettella", "Francesco", ""], ["Djurovic", "Srdjan", ""], ["Wang", "Yunpeng", ""], ["Einevoll", "Gaute T.", ""], ["Andreassen", "Ole A.", ""], ["Dale", "Anders M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.07302", "submitter": "Bruno Umbria Pedroni", "authors": "Bruno U.

On the other side of the spectrum, neuromorphic\nsystems have shown great promise for low-power and parallelized cognitive\ncomputing, but lack well-suited applications and automation procedures. In this\nwork, we propose a systematic method for bridging the RBM algorithm and digital\nneuromorphic systems, with a generative pattern completion task as proof of\nconcept. For this, we first propose a method of producing the Gibbs sampler\nusing bio-inspired digital noisy integrate-and-fire neurons. Next, we describe\nthe process of mapping generative RBMs trained offline onto the IBM TrueNorth\nneurosynaptic processor -- a low-power digital neuromorphic VLSI substrate.\nMapping these algorithms onto neuromorphic hardware presents unique challenges\nin network connectivity and weight and bias quantization, which, in turn,\nrequire architectural and design strategies for the physical realization.\nGenerative performance metrics are analyzed to validate the neuromorphic\nrequirements and to best select the neuron parameters for the model. Lastly, we\ndescribe a design automation procedure which achieves optimal resource usage,\naccounting for the novel hardware adaptations.

Here, we investigate the latency response dynamics of\na single Hodgkin-Huxley neuron that is subject to both a suprathreshold\nperiodic stimulus and a background activity arriving through dynamic synapses.\nWe study the first spike latency response as a function of the presynaptic\nfiring rate f. This constitutes a more realistic scenario than previous works,\nsince f provides a suitable biophysically realistic parameter to control the\nlevel of activity in actual neural systems. We first report on the emergence of\nclassical NDD behavior as a function of f for the limit of static synapses.\nSecondly, we show that when short-term depression and facilitation mechanisms\nare included at synapses, different NDD features can be found due to the their\nmodulatory effect on synaptic current fluctuations. For example a new\nintriguing double NDD (DNDD) behavior occurs for different sets of relevant\nsynaptic parameters. Moreover, depending on the balance between synaptic\ndepression and synaptic facilitation, single NDD or DNDD can prevails, in such\na way that synaptic facilitation favors the emergence of DNDD whereas synaptic\ndepression favors the existence of single NDD. This is the first time it has\nbeen reported the existence of DNDD effect in response latency dynamics of a\nneuron.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 09:11:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Uzuntarla", "M.", ""], ["Ozer", "M.", ""], ["Ileri", "U.", ""], ["Calim", "A.", ""], ["Torres", "J.
