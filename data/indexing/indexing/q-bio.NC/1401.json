Especially\nthe measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic\nsurge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two\nprocesses requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes\nto estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these\nobservations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow\npooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle\nto the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes\nare often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues\ntheoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by\nestimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations.

We realized\nthat tubulin should play a role in these intracellular connections. The tubulin\nmolecules can form a connective wire because of a change of shape of the\nindividual tubulin dimers. This way the fast switch is realized by the switch\nof the tubulin dimer configuration. Because the cell should remember which\nswitch was activated and which one was not or less activated, we postulate the\nmemristor quality of microtubules.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jan 2014 10:07:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Dietrich", "Axel", ""], ["Been", "Willem", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.5186", "submitter": "Tomokatsu Onaga", "authors": "Tomokatsu Onaga and Shigeru Shinomoto", "title": "Bursting transition in a linear self-exciting point process", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Physical Review E 89 (2014) 042817", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.89.042817", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.data-an q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Self-exciting point processes describe the manner in which every event\nfacilitates the occurrence of succeeding events.

Interestingly, since Kuffler's\npioneering experiments on retinal ganglion cells, mathematical models have been\nvital for advancing our understanding of the receptive fields of visual\nneurons. However, existing models were not designed to describe the most\nsalient attributes of the highly specialized neurons in the V1 to MT motion\nprocessing stream; and they have not been able to do so. Here, we introduce the\nGabor-Einstein wavelet, a new family of functions for representing the\nreceptive fields of V1 to MT neurons. We show that the way space and time are\nmixed in the visual cortex is analogous to the way they are mixed in the\nspecial theory of relativity (STR). Hence we constrained the Gabor-Einstein\nmodel by requiring: (i) relativistic-invariance of the wave carrier, and (ii)\nthe minimum possible number of parameters. From these two constraints, the sinc\nfunction emerged as a natural descriptor of the wave carrier. The particular\ndistribution of lowpass to bandpass temporal frequency filtering properties of\nV1 to MT neurons (Foster et al 1985; DeAngelis et al 1993b; Hawken et al 1996)\nis clearly explained by the Gabor-Einstein basis. Furthermore, it does so in a\nmanner innately representative of the motion-processing stream's neuronal\nhierarchy. Our analysis and computer simulations show that the distribution of\ntemporal frequency filtering properties along the motion processing stream is a\ndirect effect of the way the brain jointly encodes space and time. We uncovered\nthis fundamental link by demonstrating that analogous mathematical structures\nunderlie STR and joint cortical spacetime encoding. This link will provide new\nphysiological insights into how the brain represents visual information.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 08:48:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-23", "authors_parsed": [["Odaibo", "Stephen G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.6207", "submitter": "Huisheng Liu", "authors": "Huisheng Liu, Hua Bai, Enfu Hui, Lu Yang, Chantell Evans, Zhao Wang,\n  Sung Kwon, and Edwin Chapman", "title": "Synaptotagmin 7 Functions as a Ca2+-sensor for Synaptic Vesicle\n  Replenishment", "comments": "41 pages, 17 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.7554/eLife.01524", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Synaptotagmin (syt) 7 is one of three syt isoforms found in all metazoans; it\nis ubiquitously expressed, yet its function in neurons remains obscure.

Although it\nis clearly a naturalistic phenomenon evolved through Darwinian evolution,\nexplaining it in terms of physicochemical, neural, or symbolic mechanisms\nremains elusive. Here I propose that two steps had to be taken in its\nevolution. First, living systems evolved an intrinsic goal-directedness by\ninternalizing Darwinian fitness as a self-estimated fitness. The self-estimated\nfitness participates in a feedback loop that effectively produces intrinsic\nmeaning in the organism. Second, animals with advanced nervous systems evolved\na special form of communication that modifies the way each partner estimates\nfitness. The resulting change in intrinsic meaning is experienced subjectively\nas a primary form of consciousness. This primary form is subsequently used to\ngenerate, partly through internalized dialogue, more complex forms of\nconsciousness, such as consciousness of the natural and social worlds,\nconsciousness of the self, and language-dependent forms of consciousness.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 07:58:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Oct 2014 09:34:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["van Hateren", "J.
