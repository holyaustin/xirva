Without\nrelying on head modeling BSS aims at estimating both the waveform and the scalp\nspatial pattern of the intracranial dipolar current responsible of the observed\nEEG. In this review we begin by placing the BSS linear instantaneous model of\nEEG within the framework of brain volume conduction theory. We then review the\nconcept and current practice of BSS based on second-order statistics (SOS) and\non higher-order statistics (HOS), the latter better known as independent\ncomponent analysis (ICA). Using neurophysiological knowledge we consider the\nfitness of SOS-based and HOS-based methods for the extraction of spontaneous\nand induced EEG and their separation from extra-cranial artifacts. We then\nillustrate a general BSS scheme operating in the time-frequency domain using\nSOS only. The scheme readily extends to further data expansions in order to\ncapture experimental source of variations as well. A simple and efficient\nimplementation based on the approximate joint diagonalization of Fourier\ncospectral matrices is described (AJDC). We conclude discussing useful aspects\nof BSS analysis of EEG, including its assumptions and limitations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Dec 2008 12:48:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Congedo", "Marco", "", "GIPSA-lab"], ["Gouy-Pailler", "C\u00e9dric", "", "GIPSA-lab"], ["Jutten", "Christian", "", "GIPSA-lab"]]}, {"id": "0812.1062", "submitter": "Anthony Norcia", "authors": "Richard T.

The product of Volterra analysis, the\nVolterra kernels, are particularly suited to quantifying intra- and inter-input\ninteractions. They are also readily interpretable, which means that they can be\nrelated directly to physical behaviors, and more distantly, to the underlying\nprocessing mechanisms of the system being tested. However, accurate estimation\nof a sufficient set of classical kernels is often not possible for complex\nsystems because the number of kernels that need to be determined, and hence\nexperiment time, increases radically with system memory, response frequency\nbandwidth, and non-linear interaction order. Practical approaches to kernel\nestimation often involve forced reductions of the generality of the analysis\nthat in turn compromise interpretability.\n  Here we illustrate the effects on kernel interpretability of two common\nreductions, slow-stimulation and the use of binary inputs, using both numerical\nsimulations and data from a Visual Evoked Potential experiment. We show how a\nnon-standard version of binary analysis, involving a different coding of the\ninputs and the use of particular groupings of kernel slices, improves kernel\ninterpretability. We bring together, in a comprehensive fashion, all of the\nmathematical considerations needed to apply and interpret the results of\nVolterra kernel analyses. The input-coding method we describe allows one to\ncorrectly quantify multi-input interactive effects that occur both within the\nseparate input channels and across them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 00:20:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Miller", "Richard T.", ""], ["Vildavski", "Vladimir Y.", ""], ["Norcia", "Anthony M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1086", "submitter": "Kilian Koepsell", "authors": "Kilian Koepsell, Xin Wang, Vishal Vaingankar, Yichun Wei, Qingbo Wang,\n  Daniel L.

For\nexample, intrinsic dynamics, such as oscillations of networks of neurons, also\nmodulate firing pattern. Here, we asked if retinal oscillations might help to\nconvey information to neurons downstream. Specifically, we made whole-cell\nrecordings from relay cells to reveal retinal inputs (EPSPs) and thalamic\noutputs (spikes) and analyzed these events with information theory. Our results\nshow that thalamic spike trains operate as two multiplexed channels. One\nchannel, which occupies a low frequency band (<30 Hz), is encoded by average\nfiring rate with respect to the stimulus and carries information about local\nchanges in the image over time. The other operates in the gamma frequency band\n(40-80 Hz) and is encoded by spike time relative to the retinal oscillations.\nBecause these oscillations involve extensive areas of the retina, it is likely\nthat the second channel transmits information about global features of the\nvisual scene. At times, the second channel conveyed even more information than\nthe first.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 08:12:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Koepsell", "Kilian", ""], ["Wang", "Xin", ""], ["Vaingankar", "Vishal", ""], ["Wei", "Yichun", ""], ["Wang", "Qingbo", ""], ["Rathbun", "Daniel L.", ""], ["Usrey", "W.

For this reason it is\ncurrently widely used, in particular for large scale simulations of neural\nnetworks. This model emulates the dynamics of the membrane potential of a\nneuron together with an adaptation variable. The subthreshold dynamics is\ngoverned by a two-parameter differential equation, and a spike is emitted when\nthe membrane potential variable reaches a given cutoff value. Subsequently the\nmembrane potential is reset, and the adaptation variable is added a fixed value\ncalled the spike-triggered adaptation parameter. We show in this note that when\nthe system does not converge to an equilibrium point, both variables of the\nsubthreshold dynamical system blow up in finite time whatever the parameters of\nthe dynamics. The cutoff is therefore essential for the model to be well\ndefined and simulated. The divergence of the adaptation variable makes the\nsystem very sensitive to the cutoff: changing this parameter dramatically\nchanges the spike patterns produced. Furthermore from a computational\nviewpoint, the fact that the adaptation variable blows up and the very sharp\nslope it has when the spike is emitted implies that the time step of the\nnumerical simulation needs to be very small (or adaptive) in order to catch an\naccurate value of the adaptation at the time of the spike. It is not the case\nfor the similar quartic (Touboul 2008) and exponential (Brette and Gerstner\n2005) models whose adaptation variable does not blow up in finite time, and\nwhich are therefore very robust to changes in the cutoff value.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 5 Dec 2008 15:25:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Touboul", "Jonathan", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.1248", "submitter": "David Schwab", "authors": "David J.
