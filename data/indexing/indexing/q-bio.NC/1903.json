Modern imaging\nmethods have proven successful at extracting such information. However, in\norder to analyze this type of data, neuronal morphology needs to be encoded in\na graph-theoretic method. This encoding enables the use of high throughput\ninformatic methods to extract and infer brain function. The application of\ngraph-theoretic methods to neuronal morphological representation comes with\ncertain difficulties. Here we report a novel, effective method to accomplish\nthis task.\n  The morphology of a neuron, which consists of its overall size, global shape,\nlocal branch patterns, and cell-specific biophysical properties, can vary\nsignificantly with the cell's identity, location, as well as developmental and\nphysiological state. Various algorithms have been developed to customize shape\nbased statistical and graph related features for quantitative analysis of\nneuromorphology, followed by the classification of neuron cell types using the\nfeatures. Unlike the classical feature extraction based methods from imaged or\n3D reconstructed neurons, we propose a model based on the rooted path\ndecomposition from the soma to the dendrites of a neuron and extract\nmorphological features on each path. We hypothesize that measuring the distance\nbetween two neurons can be realized by minimizing the cost of continuously\nmorphing the set of all rooted paths of one neuron to another. To validate this\nclaim, we first establish the correspondence of paths between two neurons using\na modified Munkres algorithm.

In previous works without STDPs, fast\nsparsely synchronized rhythms, related to diverse cognitive functions, were\nfound to appear in a range of noise intensity $D$ for static synaptic\nstrengths. By varying $D$, we investigate the effect of interpopulation STDPs\non diverse population and individual properties of fast sparsely synchronized\nrhythms that emerge in both the I- and the E-populations. Depending on values\nof $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) for\npopulation-averaged values of saturated interpopulation synaptic strengths are\nfound to occur, and they make effects on the degree of fast sparse\nsynchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree of good\nsynchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while in a\nregion of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking\nmeasure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the\nsynchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This\nkind of \"equalization effect\" is found to occur via cooperative interplay\nbetween the average occupation and pacing degrees of fast sparsely synchronized\nrhythms. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic\nplasticity is distinctly in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in\nintrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)\nsynchronization gets better (worse).

Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction\ncascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific\nsubcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,\nnumerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate\nat the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent\nactivation of calcium/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M. Another level\nconsists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and\ntranslational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.\nFinally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell\nassemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of\nmemory.

The morphology of type\nII terminals is characterized by the large number of en passant boutons. The\nlack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture in boutons\nresults in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons. Furthermore, the\nlarge number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move anterogradely, until they\nreach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture of a majority of DCVs\nbefore they turn around in the most distal bouton to move in the retrograde\ndirection. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs and a lack of DCV\ncirculation in type II terminals. The developed model simulates DCV\nconcentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age density\ndistributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons. Unlike\npublished experimental observations, our model predicts DCV circulation in type\nII terminals after these terminals are filled to saturation. This disagreement\nis likely because experimentally observed terminals were not at steady-state,\nbut rather were accumulating DCVs for later release. Our estimates show that\nthe number of DCVs in the transiting state is much smaller than that in the\nresident state. DCVs traveling in the axon, rather than DCVs transiting in the\nterminal, may provide a reserve of DCVs for replenishing boutons after a\nrelease.
