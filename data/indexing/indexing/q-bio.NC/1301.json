This proliferation of data challenges\nus on two parallel fronts. First, how can we form adequate theoretical\nframeworks for understanding how dynamical network processes cooperate across\nwidely disparate spatiotemporal scales to solve important computational\nproblems? And second, how can we extract meaningful models of neuronal systems\nfrom high dimensional datasets? To aid in these challenges, we give a\npedagogical review of a collection of ideas and theoretical methods arising at\nthe intersection of statistical physics, computer science and neurobiology. We\nintroduce the interrelated replica and cavity methods, which originated in\nstatistical physics as powerful ways to quantitatively analyze large highly\nheterogeneous systems of many interacting degrees of freedom. We also introduce\nthe closely related notion of message passing in graphical models, which\noriginated in computer science as a distributed algorithm capable of solving\nlarge inference and optimization problems involving many coupled variables. We\nthen show how both the statistical physics and computer science perspectives\ncan be applied in a wide diversity of contexts to problems arising in\ntheoretical neuroscience and data analysis. Along the way we discuss spin\nglasses, learning theory, illusions of structure in noise, random matrices,\ndimensionality reduction, and compressed sensing, all within the unified\nformalism of the replica method. Moreover, we review recent conceptual\nconnections between message passing in graphical models, and neural computation\nand learning.

It was observed that neurons with short-term\nfacilitating synapses form predominantly reciprocal pairwise connections, while\nneurons with short-term depressing synapses form unidirectional pairwise\nconnections. The cause of these structural differences in synaptic\nmicrocircuits is unknown. We propose that these connectivity motifs emerge from\nthe interactions between short-term synaptic dynamics (SD) and long-term\nspike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). While the impact of STDP on SD was\nshown in vitro, the mutual interactions between STDP and SD in large networks\nare still the subject of intense research. We formulate a computational model\nby combining SD and STDP, which captures faithfully short- and long-term\ndependence on both spike times and frequency. As a proof of concept, we\nsimulate recurrent networks of spiking neurons with random initial connection\nefficacies and where synapses are either all short-term facilitating or all\ndepressing. For identical background inputs, and as a direct consequence of\ninternally generated activity, we find that networks with depressing synapses\nevolve unidirectional connectivity motifs, while networks with facilitating\nsynapses evolve reciprocal connectivity motifs. This holds for heterogeneous\nnetworks including both facilitating and depressing synapses. Our study\nhighlights the conditions under which SD-STDP might the correlation between\nfacilitation and reciprocal connectivity motifs, as well as between depression\nand unidirectional motifs.
