In order to\nunderstand the physics underlying speech production, in this work we\nempirically analyse the statistics of large human speech datasets ranging\nseveral languages. We first show that during speech the energy is unevenly\nreleased and power-law distributed, reporting a universal robust\nGutenberg-Richter-like law in speech. We further show that such earthquakes in\nspeech show temporal correlations, as the interevent statistics are again\npower-law distributed. Since this feature takes place in the intra-phoneme\nrange, we conjecture that the responsible for this complex phenomenon is not\ncognitive, but it resides on the physiological speech production mechanism.\nMoreover, we show that these waiting time distributions are scale invariant\nunder a renormalisation group transformation, suggesting that the process of\nspeech generation is indeed operating close to a critical point. These results\nare put in contrast with current paradigms in speech processing, which point\ntowards low dimensional deterministic chaos as the origin of nonlinear traits\nin speech fluctuations. As these latter fluctuations are indeed the aspects\nthat humanize synthetic speech, these findings may have an impact in future\nspeech synthesis technologies. Results are robust and independent of the\ncommunication language or the number of speakers, pointing towards an universal\npattern and yet another hint of complexity in human speech.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 14:34:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Luque", "Jordi", ""], ["Luque", "Bartolo", ""], ["Lacasa", "Lucas", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1015", "submitter": "Guido Gigante", "authors": "Cristiano Capone, Carla Filosa, Guido Gigante, Federico\n  Ricci-Tersenghi, Paolo del Giudice", "title": "Inferring Synaptic Structure in presence of Neural Interaction Time\n  Scales", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 10, e0118412 (2015)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0118412", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Biological networks display a variety of activity patterns reflecting a web\nof interactions that is complex both in space and time. Yet inference methods\nhave mainly focused on reconstructing, from the network's activity, the spatial\nstructure, by assuming equilibrium conditions or, more recently, a\nprobabilistic dynamics with a single arbitrary time-step. Here we show that,\nunder this latter assumption, the inference procedure fails to reconstruct the\nsynaptic matrix of a network of integrate-and-fire neurons when the chosen time\nscale of interaction does not closely match the synaptic delay or when no\nsingle time scale for the interaction can be identified; such failure,\nmoreover, exposes a distinctive bias of the inference method that can lead to\ninfer as inhibitory the excitatory synapses with interaction time scales longer\nthan the model's time-step. We therefore introduce a new two-step method, that\nfirst infers through cross-correlation profiles the delay-structure of the\nnetwork and then reconstructs the synaptic matrix, and successfully test it on\nnetworks with different topologies and in different activity regimes. Although\nstep one is able to accurately recover the delay-structure of the network, thus\ngetting rid of any \\textit{a priori} guess about the time scales of the\ninteraction, the inference method introduces nonetheless an arbitrary time\nscale, the time-bin $dt$ used to binarize the spike trains. We therefore\nanalytically and numerically study how the choice of $dt$ affects the inference\nin our network model, finding that the relationship between the inferred\ncouplings and the real synaptic efficacies, albeit being quadratic in both\ncases, depends critically on $dt$ for the excitatory synapses only, whilst\nbeing basically independent of it for the inhibitory ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Aug 2014 16:10:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Aug 2014 09:33:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 14:35:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Capone", "Cristiano", ""], ["Filosa", "Carla", ""], ["Gigante", "Guido", ""], ["Ricci-Tersenghi", "Federico", ""], ["del Giudice", "Paolo", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.1245", "submitter": "Saeed Afshar", "authors": "Saeed Afshar (1), Libin George (1,2), Jonathan Tapson (1), Andre van\n  Schaik (1), Tara Julia Hamilton (1,2) ((1) University of Western Sydney, (2)\n  University of New South Wales)", "title": "Racing to Learn: Statistical Inference and Learning in a Single Spiking\n  Neuron with Adaptive Kernels", "comments": "In submission to Frontiers in Neuroscience", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE q-bio.NC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  This paper describes the Synapto-dendritic Kernel Adapting Neuron (SKAN), a\nsimple spiking neuron model that performs statistical inference and\nunsupervised learning of spatiotemporal spike patterns.

For example, Rubinstein-Taybi\nsyndrome (RTS) is due to a mutation in cbp, encoding the histone\nacetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP). CBP is a transcriptional\nco-activator for CREB, and induction of CREB-dependent transcription plays a\nkey role in long-term memory (LTM). In animal models of RTS, mutations of cbp\nimpair LTM and late-phase long-term potentiation (LTP). To explore intervention\nstrategies to rescue the deficits in LTP, we extended a previous model of LTP\ninduction to describe histone acetylation and simulated LTP impairment due to\ncbp mutation. Plausible drug effects were simulated by parameter changes, and\nmany increased LTP. However no parameter variation consistent with a\nbiochemical effect of a known drug fully restored LTP. Thus we examined paired\nparameter variations. A pair that simulated the effects of a phosphodiesterase\ninhibitor (slowing cAMP degradation) concurrent with a deacetylase inhibitor\n(prolonging histone acetylation) restored LTP. Importantly these paired\nparameter changes did not alter basal synaptic weight. A pair that simulated a\nphosphodiesterase inhibitor and an acetyltransferase activator was similarly\neffective. For both pairs strong additive synergism was present. These results\nsuggest that promoting histone acetylation while simultaneously slowing the\ndegradation of cAMP may constitute a promising strategy for restoring deficits\nin LTP that may be associated with learning deficits in RTS.

These differential equations are\nnon-smooth, and in particular are piecewise smooth continuous (PWSC). Here, we\nanalyze the smooth and non-smooth bifurcation structure of these equations and\nshow that the system is organized around a pair of co-dimension two\nbifurcations that involve, respectively, the collision between a Hopf\nequilibrium point and a switching manifold, and a saddle-node equilibrium point\nand a switching manifold. These two co-dimension 2 bifurcations can coalesce\ninto a co-dimension 3 non-smooth bifurcation. As the mean-field system we study\nis a non-generic piecewise smooth continuous system, we discuss possible\nregularizations of this system and how the bifurcations which occur are related\nto non-smooth bifurcations displayed by generic PWSC systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Aug 2014 19:12:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Nicola", "Wilten", ""], ["Campbell", "Sue Ann", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5371", "submitter": "Robert Leech", "authors": "Gregory Scott, Peter J.

However, current methodologies cannot easily evaluate both the\nspatial and temporal changes in brain networks with cognitive state. Here we\ncombine a simple data reorganization with spatial ICA, enabling a\nspatiotemporal ICA (stICA) which captures the consistent evolution of networks\nduring onset and offset of a task. The technique was applied to FMRI datasets\ninvolving alternating between rest and task and to simple synthetic data.\nStarting and finishing time-points of periods of interest (anchors) were\ndefined at task block onsets and offsets. For each subject, the ten volumes\nfollowing each anchor were extracted and concatenated spatially, producing a\nsingle 3D sample. Samples for all anchors and subjects were concatenated along\nthe fourth dimension. This 4D dataset was decomposed using ICA into\nspatiotemporal components. One component exhibited the transition with task\nonset from a default mode network (DMN) becoming less active to a\nfronto-parietal control network (FPCN) becoming more active. We observed other\nchanges with relevance to understanding network dynamics, e.g., the DMN showed\na changing spatial distribution, shifting to an anterior/superior pattern of\ndeactivation during task from a posterior/inferior pattern during rest. By\nanchoring analyses to periods associated with the onsets and offsets of task,\nour approach reveals novel aspects of the dynamics of network activity\naccompanying these transitions. Importantly, these findings were observed\nwithout specifying a priori either the spatial networks or the task time\ncourses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 17:58:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Scott", "Gregory", ""], ["Hellyer", "Peter J.", ""], ["Hampshire", "Adam", ""], ["Leech", "Robert", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5403", "submitter": "Peilei Liu", "authors": "Peilei Liu, Ting Wang", "title": "Neural Mechanism of Language", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.NE cs.CL q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper is based on our previous work on neural coding.

Unfortunately, for a neuron the ostensible\ndiscrepancy from this minimum is startling - ignoring inhibition the\ndiscrepancy is $10^7$ times this amount and taking inhibition into account\n$>10^9$. Here we point out that what has been defined as neural computation is\nactually a combination of computation and neural communication: the\ncommunication costs, transmission from each excitatory postsynaptic activation\nto the S4-gating-charges of the fast Na+ channels of the initial segment\n(fNa's), dominate the joule-costs. Making this distinction between\ncommunication to the initial segment and computation at the initial segment\n(i.e., adding up of the activated fNa's) implies that the size of the average\nsynaptic event reaching the fNa's is the size of the standard deviation of the\nthermal noise. Moreover, defining computation as the addition of activated\nfNa's, yields a biophysically plausible mechanism for approaching the desired\nminimum. This mechanism, requiring something like the electrical engineer's\nequalizer (not much more than the action potential generating conductances),\nonly operates at threshold. This active filter modifies the last few synaptic\nexcitations, providing barely enough energy to allow the last sub-threshold\ngating charge to transport. That is, the last, threshold-achieving S4-subunit\nactivation requires an energy that matches the information being provided by\nthe last few synaptic events, a ratio that is near kTln2 joules per bit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 17:02:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 01:55:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Levy", "William B.", ""], ["Berger", "Toby", ""], ["Fleidervish", "Ilya A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6849", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Nicole Carbert, Liane Gabora, Jasmine Schwartz, and Apara Ranjan", "title": "Cognitive States of Potentiality in Art-making", "comments": "6 pages", "journal-ref": "Carbert, N., Gabora, L., Schwartz, J., & Ranjan, A.

For example, people display\nclockwise or counter-clockwise biases in their walking behavior that is\nuncorrelated to their hand dominance, and lateralized behavioral biases have\nbeen shown in species as disparate as mice (paw usage), octopi (eye usage), and\ntortoises (side rolled on during righting).
