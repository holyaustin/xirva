However, despite extended and extensive research efforts,\nwhich encompass many exploration fields, the underlying fundamentals and\noperational principles of visual information processing in human brain remain\nunknown. We still are unable to figure out where and how along the path from\neyes to the cortex the sensory input perceived by the retina is converted into\na meaningful object representation, which can be consciously manipulated by the\nbrain. Studying the vast literature considering the various aspects of brain\ninformation processing, I was surprised to learn that the respected scholarly\ndiscussion is totally indifferent to the basic keynote question: \"What is\ninformation?\" in general or \"What is visual information?\" in particular. In the\nold days, it was assumed that any scientific research approach has first to\ndefine its basic departure points. Why was it overlooked in brain information\nprocessing research remains a conundrum. In this paper, I am trying to find a\nremedy for this bizarre situation. I propose an uncommon definition of\n\"information\", which can be derived from Kolmogorov's Complexity Theory and\nChaitin's notion of Algorithmic Information. Embracing this new definition\nleads to an inevitable revision of traditional dogmas that shape the state of\nthe art of brain information processing research. I hope this revision would\nbetter serve the challenging goal of human visual information processing\nmodeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Jul 2008 12:33:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Diamant", "Emanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1513", "submitter": "Jonathan Tapson", "authors": "J.

The\nmodel allows the conditional interspike-interval density and the stationary\ninterspike-interval density to be expressed as products of two separate\nfunctions, one of which describes only the neuron characteristics, and the\nother of which describes only the signal characteristics. This allows the use\nof this model to predict the response when the underlying neuron model is not\nknown or well determined. The approximation shows particularly clearly that\nsignal autocorrelations and cross-correlations arise as natural features of the\ninterspike-interval density, and are particularly clear for small signals and\nmoderate noise. We show that this model simplifies the design of spiking neuron\ncross-correlation systems, and describe a four-neuron mutual inhibition network\nthat generates a cross-correlation output for two input signals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Jul 2008 18:36:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Tapson", "J.", ""], ["Jin", "C.", ""], ["van Schaik", "A.", ""], ["Etienne-Cummings", "R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.1954", "submitter": "Ryota Kobayashi", "authors": "Ryota Kobayashi", "title": "Influence of firing mechanisms on gain modulation", "comments": "7 pages, 4 figures, conference proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2009/01/P01017", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We studied the impact of a dynamical threshold on the f-I curve-the\nrelationship between the input and the firing rate of a neuron-in the presence\nof background synaptic inputs.

This phenomenon is called burst firing. To analyze burst\nactivity in an insect system, grasshopper auditory receptor neurons were\nrecorded in vivo for several distinct stimulus types. The experimental data\nshow that both burst probability and burst characteristics are strongly\ninfluenced by temporal modulations of the acoustic stimulus. The tendency to\nburst, hence, is not only determined by cell-intrinsic processes, but also by\ntheir interaction with the stimulus time course. We study this interaction\nquantitatively and observe that bursts containing a certain number of spikes\noccur shortly after stimulus deflections of specific intensity and duration.\nOur findings suggest a sparse neural code where information about the stimulus\nis represented by the number of spikes per burst, irrespective of the detailed\ninterspike-interval structure within a burst. This compact representation\ncannot be interpreted as a firing-rate code. An information-theoretical\nanalysis reveals that the number of spikes per burst reliably conveys\ninformation about the amplitude and duration of sound transients, whereas their\ntime of occurrence is reflected by the burst onset time. The investigated\nneurons encode almost half of the total transmitted information in burst\nactivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Jul 2008 12:42:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Eyherabide", "Hugo G.", ""], ["Rokem", "Ariel", ""], ["Herz", "Andreas V.

One way to\ncharacterize this complexity is to take advantage of the high interconnectivity\nof cerebral cortex and use intracellular recordings of cortical neurons, which\ncontain information about the activity of thousands of other cortical neurons.\nIdentifying the membrane potential (Vm) to a stochastic process enables the\nextraction of important statistical signatures of this complex synaptic\nactivity. Typically, one estimates the total synaptic conductances (excitatory\nand inhibitory) but this type of estimation requires at least two Vm levels and\ntherefore cannot be applied to single Vm traces. We propose here a method to\nextract excitatory and inhibitory conductances (mean and variance) from single\nVm traces. This \"VmT method\" estimates conductance parameters using maximum\nlikelihood criteria, under the assumption are that synaptic conductances are\ndescribed by Gaussian stochastic processes and are integrated by a passive\nleaky membrane. The method is illustrated using models and is tested on\nguinea-pig visual cortex neurons in vitro using dynamic-clamp experiments. The\nVmT method holds promises for extracting conductances from single-trial\nmeasurements, which has a high potential for in vivo applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Jul 2008 13:47:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 10 Jan 2009 16:24:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Pospischil", "Martin", ""], ["Piwkowska", "Zuzanna", ""], ["Bal", "Thierry", ""], ["Destexhe", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.3608", "submitter": "Nicolas Vuillerme", "authors": "Nicolas Pinsault (TIMC), Nicolas Vuillerme (TIMC)", "title": "Differential postural effects of plantar-flexor muscles fatigue under\n  normal, altered and improved vestibular and neck somatosensory conditions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Experimental Brain Research (2008) 1-31", "doi": "10.1007/s00221-008-1500-z", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of plantar-flexor\nmuscles fatigue on postural control during quiet standing under normal, altered\nand improved vestibular and neck somatosensory conditions.
