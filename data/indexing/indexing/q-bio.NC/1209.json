A quantitative measure of the quality of a sleep-wake cycle\nis introduced and used to systematically study the generalized model for\ndifferent levels of noise and diversity. The model is shown to exhibit a clear\ndiversity-induced resonance: that is, the best wake-sleep cycle turns out to\ncorrespond to an intermediate level of diversity at the synapses of the\norexin-producing neurons. On the other hand only a mild evidence of stochastic\nresonance is found when the level of noise is varied. These results show that\ndisorder, especially in the form of quenched diversity, can be a key-element\nfor an efficient or optimal functioning of the homeostatic regulation of the\nsleep-wake cycle.

An important question in the field of\ncomputational neuroscience is how these sensory neurons encode environmental\ninformation in a way which may be simply analyzed by subsequent systems. Many\naspects of the form and function of the nervous system have been understood\nusing the concepts of optimal population coding. Most studies, however, have\nneglected the aspect of temporal coding. Here we address this shortcoming\nthrough a filtering theory of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We derive exact\nrelations for the minimal mean squared error of the optimal Bayesian filter and\nby optimizing the encoder, obtain optimal codes for populations of neurons. We\nalso show that a class of non-Markovian, smooth stimuli are amenable to the\nsame treatment, and provide results for the filtering and prediction error\nwhich hold for a general class of stochastic processes. This sets a sound\nmathematical framework for a population coding theory that takes temporal\naspects into account. It also formalizes a number of studies which discussed\ntemporal aspects of coding using time-window paradigms, by stating them in\nterms of correlation times and firing rates. We propose that this kind of\nanalysis allows for a systematic study of temporal coding and will bring\nfurther insights into the nature of the neural code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2012 09:51:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Susemihl", "Alex", ""], ["Meir", "Ron", ""], ["Opper", "Manfred", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5629", "submitter": "Wei Cheng", "authors": "Wei Cheng, Xuejuan Zhang, Ge Tian, Jianfeng Feng, Zhengge Wang,\n  Zhiqiang Zhang, GuangMing Lu", "title": "Identifying Brain Image Level Endophenotypes in Epilepsy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.med-ph q-bio.NC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  A brain wide association study (BWAS) based on the logistic regression was\nfirst developed and applied to a large population of epilepsy patients (168)\nand healthy controls (136). It was found that the most significant links\nassociated with epilepsy are those bilateral links with regions mainly\nbelonging to the default mode network and subcortex, such as amygdala, fusiform\ngyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, temporal pole, parahippocampal\ngyrus, insula, middle occipital gyrus, cuneus. These links were found to have\nmuch higher odd ratios than other links, and all of them showed reduced\nfunctional couplings in patients compared with controls. Interestingly, with\nthe increasing of the seizure onset frequency or duration of illness, the\nfunctional connection between these bilateral regions became further reduced.\nOn the other hand, as a functional compensation and brain plasticity,\nconnections of these bilateral regions to other brain regions were abnormally\nenhanced and became even much stronger with the increase of the seizure onset\nfrequency. Furthermore, patients had higher network efficiencies than healthy\ncontrols, and the seizure onset frequency was found to be positively correlated\nwith the network efficiency. A negative correlation between the bilateral\nconnection and the network efficiency was also observed. To further validate\nour findings, we then employed our BWAS results in discriminating patients from\nhealthy controls and the leave-one-out accuracy was around 78%.

The components include (1) a\nstructured terminology that provides semantic context to data, (2) a formal\ndata model for neuroimaging with robust tracking of data provenance, (3) a web\nservice-based application programming interface (API) that provides a\nconsistent mechanism to access and query the data model, and (4) a provenance\nlibrary that can be used for the extraction of provenance data by image\nanalysts and imaging software developers.

This measure is\ntime-resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train\ndissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high\ninstantaneous values for event-like firing patterns. Here we present a\nsubstantial improvement of this measure which eliminates this shortcoming. The\nreliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering,\ni.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains.\nAdditional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as\nwell as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a\ncausal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of\ndissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train\nsynchrony can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate that these methods are\ncapable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the\nsynchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally,\nthe applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to\ncontinuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG)\nrecordings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Sep 2012 18:54:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 8 Dec 2012 01:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Kreuz", "Thomas", ""], ["Chicharro", "Daniel", ""], ["Houghton", "Conor", ""], ["Andrzejak", "Ralph G", ""], ["Mormann", "Florian", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6607", "submitter": "Pamela Reinagel", "authors": "Kate S.

Indeed, while contrast changes\ncaused a combination of multiplicative gain change and additive shift in LGN\ncells, the additive shift predominated in ON cells. Modeling results supported\nthis theory: the ON cell latency trend was found when the distance-to-threshold\nshifted with contrast, but not when distance-to-threshold was fixed across\ncontrasts. In the model, latency also increases as surround-to-center ratios\nincrease, which has been shown to occur at higher contrasts.
