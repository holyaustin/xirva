An understanding of the simulator response to\ndifferent motion commands is therefore a crucial yet often underestimated step\ntowards the interpretation of experimental results. In this work, we developed\nanalysis methods based on signal processing techniques to quantify the noise in\nthe actual motion, and its deterministic and stochastic components. Our methods\nallow comparisons between commanded and actual motion as well as between\ndifferent actual motion profiles. A specific practical example from one of our\nstudies is used to illustrate the methodologies and their relevance, but this\ndoes not detract from its general applicability. Analyses of the simulator\ninertial recordings show direction-dependent noise and nonlinearity related to\nthe command amplitude. The Signal-to-Noise Ratio is one order of magnitude\nhigher for the larger motion amplitudes we tested, compared to the smaller\nmotion amplitudes. Deterministic and stochastic noise components are of similar\nmagnitude for the weaker motions, whereas for stronger motions the\ndeterministic component dominates the stochastic component. The effect of\nsimulator noise on animal/human motion sensitivity is discussed. We conclude\nthat accurate analyses of a simulator motion are a crucial prerequisite for the\ninvestigation of uncertainty in self-motion perception.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2013 14:16:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 09:14:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 10:52:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Nesti", "Alessandro", ""], ["Beykirch", "Karl A", ""], ["MacNeilage", "Paul R", ""], ["Barnett-Cowan", "Michael", ""], ["B\u00fclthoff", "Heinrich H", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.0448", "submitter": "David Schwab", "authors": "David J.

We\ncan in particular conclude that a coupling of extracellular ion concentrations\nto a large glial-vascular bath can take a role as an inhibitory mechanism\ncrucial in ion homeostasis, while the Na$^+$/K$^+$ pumps alone are insufficient\nto recover from FES. Our results provide the missing link between the HH\nformalism and activator-inhibitor models that have been successfully used for\nmodeling migraine phenotypes, and therefore will allow us to validate the\nhypothesis that migraine symptoms are explained by disturbed function in ion\nchannel subunits, Na$^+$/K$^+$ pumps, and other proteins that regulate ion\nhomeostasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 7 Oct 2013 20:15:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 16:43:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2014 12:30:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["H\u00fcbel", "Niklas", ""], ["Sch\u00f6ll", "Eckehard", ""], ["Dahlem", "Markus A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.2024", "submitter": "Silvia Scarpetta", "authors": "Silvia Scarpetta and Antonio de Candia", "title": "Neural Avalanches at the Critical Point between Replay and Non-Replay of\n  Spatiotemporal Patterns", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLOS ONE June 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e64162", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0064162", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We model spontaneous cortical activity with a network of coupled spiking\nunits, in which multiple spatio-temporal patterns are stored as dynamical\nattractors.

We investigated how these adaptation currents affect\nthe synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient\nadaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (aEIF) model and a biophysically\ndetailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation\ncurrents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike\nfrequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are\nnegligible.

We show that a paroxysmal-like spike is a single\nnonlinear event that appears instantly from a low background activity with a\nrapid onset, reaches a large amplitude, and ends up with an abrupt return to\nlower activity. These spikes are similar to single paroxysmal spikes and sharp\nwaves observed in EEG measurements. Our analysis shows that above the\nsaddle-node bifurcation, sustained network oscillations appear with a large\namplitude but a small frequency in contrast to network oscillations near the\nHopf bifurcation that have a small amplitude but a large frequency. We discuss\nan amazing similarity between excitability of the cortical model stimulated by\nshot noise and excitability of the Morris-Lecar neuron stimulated by an applied\ncurrent.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 00:42:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Lee", "K. -E.", ""], ["Lopes", "M.

We provide two contextual measures of\nconceptual distance-one using collapse probabilities and the other weighted\nproperties-and show how they can be applied to conjunctions using the pet fish\nproblem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2013 04:40:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2013 22:17:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Gabora", "Liane", ""], ["Aerts", "Diederik", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.7981", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Tomas Veloz, Liane Gabora, Mark Eyjolfson, and Diederik Aerts", "title": "Toward a Formal Model of the Shifting Relationship between Concepts and\n  Contexts during Associative Thought", "comments": "11 pages; 2 figures", "journal-ref": "(2011).

Here we experimentally demonstrate a mechanism where time-lags among\nneuronal spiking leap from several tens of milliseconds to nearly zero-lag\nsynchrony. It also allows sudden leaps out of synchrony, hence forming short\nepochs of synchrony. Our results are based on an experimental procedure where\nconditioned stimulations were enforced on circuits of neurons embedded within a\nlarge-scale network of cortical cells in vitro and are corroborated by\nsimulations of neuronal populations. The underlying biological mechanisms are\nthe unavoidable increase of the neuronal response latency to ongoing\nstimulations and temporal or spatial summation required to generate evoked\nspikes. These sudden leaps in and out of synchrony may be accompanied by\nmultiplications of the neuronal firing frequency, hence offering reliable\ninformation-bearing indicators which may bridge between the two principal\nneuronal coding paradigms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 13:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Vardi", "Roni", ""], ["Goldental", "Amir", ""], ["Guberman", "Shoshana", ""], ["Kalmanovich", "Alexander", ""], ["Marmari", "Hagar", ""], ["Kanter", "Ido", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8357", "submitter": "Daniele Marinazzo", "authors": "Guorong Wu, Enzo Tagliazucchi, Dante R.

Here, we present the strong\nand weak scaling and the profiling of the computational/communication\ncomponents of the DPSNN-STDP benchmark (Distributed Simulation of Polychronous\nSpiking Neural Network with synaptic Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity). In\nthis first test, we used the benchmark to exercise a small-scale cluster of\ncommodity processors (varying the number of used physical cores from 1 to 128).\nThe cluster was interconnected through a commodity network. Bidimensional grids\nof columns composed of Izhikevich neurons projected synapses locally and toward\nfirst, second and third neighboring columns. The size of the simulated network\nvaried from 6.6 Giga synapses down to 200 K synapses. The code demonstrated to\nbe fast and scalable: 10 wall clock seconds were required to simulate one\nsecond of activity and plasticity (per Hertz of average firing rate) of a\nnetwork composed by 3.2 G synapses running on 128 hardware cores clocked @ 2.4\nGHz.
