Here we study whether a particular type of spontaneous activity is\ngenerated by a network that is optimized for input processing. Neuronal\navalanches are a type of spontaneous activity observed in superficial cortical\nlayers in vitro and in vivo with statistical properties expected from a network\nin a 'critical state'. Theory predicts that the critical state and, therefore,\nneuronal avalanches are optimal for input processing, but until now, this is\nuntested in experiments. Here, we use cortex slice cultures grown on planar\nmicroelectrode arrays to demonstrate that cortical networks which generate\nneuronal avalanches benefit from maximized dynamic range, i.e. the ability to\nrespond to the greatest range of stimuli. By changing the ratio of excitation\nand inhibition in the cultures, we derive a network tuning curve for stimulus\nprocessing as a function of distance from the critical state in agreement with\npredictions from our simulations. Our findings suggest that in the cortex, (1)\nbalanced excitation and inhibition establishes the critical state, which\nmaximizes the range of inputs that can be processed and (2) spontaneous\nactivity and input processing are unified in the context of critical phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jun 2009 18:17:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2009 17:55:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Nov 2009 15:46:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-09", "authors_parsed": [["Shew", "Woodrow L.", ""], ["Yang", "Hongdian", ""], ["Petermann", "Thomas", ""], ["Roy", "Rajarshi", ""], ["Plenz", "Dietmar", ""]]}, {"id": "0906.0564", "submitter": "Giuseppe Vitiello", "authors": "Giuseppe Vitiello", "title": "Coherent states, fractals and brain waves", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "New Mathematics and Natural Computing Vol.5, No. 1 (2009) 245-264", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC q-bio.OT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  I show that a functional representation of self-similarity (as the one\noccurring in fractals) is provided by squeezed coherent states.
