Our path forward is to present a\ndesign for developmentally-inspired learning agents based on the Braitenberg\nVehicle. Using these agents to exemplify artificial embodied intelligence, we\nmove closer to modeling embodied experience and morphogenetic growth as\ncomponents of cognitive developmental capacity. We consider various factors\nregarding biological and cognitive development which influence the generation\nof adult phenotypes and the contingency of available developmental pathways.\nThese mechanisms produce emergent connectivity with shifting weights and\nadaptive network topography, thus illustrating the importance of developmental\nprocesses in training neural networks. This approach provides a blueprint for\nadaptive agent behavior that might result from a developmental approach: namely\nby exploiting critical periods or growth and acquisition, an explicitly\nembodied network architecture, and a distinction between the assembly of neural\nnetworks and active learning on these networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 7 Mar 2021 07:22:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Alicea", "Bradly", ""], ["Chakrabarty", "Rishabh", ""], ["Gopi", "Akshara", ""], ["Lim", "Anson", ""], ["Parent", "Jesse", ""]]}, {"id": "2103.05764", "submitter": "Ravi Kashyap", "authors": "Ravi Kashyap", "title": "Seven Survival Senses: Evolutionary Training makes Discerning\n  Differences more Natural than Spotting Similarities", "comments": "World Futures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1080/02604027.2020.1859315", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We discuss preliminary results from two experiments and put forth the notion\nthat the development of sensory systems might be more geared towards discerning\ndifferences rather than for spotting similarities.

For this purpose, we calculate the exact expression of optimal\ncontrol energy in terms of layer spectra and the relative alignment between the\neigenmodes of the input layer and the deeper target layer. For a range of\nnumerically constructed duplex networks, we then calculate the control\nproperties of the two layers as a function of target-layer densities and layer\ntopology. The alignment of layer eigenmodes emerges as an important parameter\nthat sets the cost and routing of the optimal energy for control. We understand\nthese results in a simplified limit of a single-mode approximation, and we\nbuild metrics to characterize the routing of optimal control energy through the\neigenmodes of each layer. Our analytical and numerical results together provide\ninsights into the relationships between structure and control in duplex\nnetworks.
