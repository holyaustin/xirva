Within each domain\nof either non-causal or time-causal time, these receptive field families are\nderived by uniqueness from the assumptions.\n  It is demonstrated how the presented framework allows for computation of\nbasic auditory features for audio processing and that it leads to predictions\nabout auditory receptive fields with good qualitative similarity to biological\nreceptive fields measured in the inferior colliculus (ICC) and primary auditory\ncortex (A1) of mammals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Apr 2014 08:18:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lindeberg", "Tony", ""], ["Friberg", "Anders", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.2078", "submitter": "Joost Broekens", "authors": "Joost Broekens and Tim Baarslag", "title": "Optimistic Risk Perception in the Temporal Difference error Explains the\n  Relation between Risk-taking, Gambling, Sensation-seeking and Low Fear", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.LG q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Understanding the affective, cognitive and behavioural processes involved in\nrisk taking is essential for treatment and for setting environmental conditions\nto limit damage.

To date, there have been two key\nexperimental observations supporting this hypothesis: i) neuronal avalanches\nwith power law distribution of size and ii) long-range temporal correlations\n(LRTCs) in the amplitude of neural oscillations. The case for how these\nmaximise dynamic range of information processing and communication is still\nbeing made and because a significant substrate for information coding and\ntransmission is neural synchrony it is of interest to link synchronisation\nmeasures with those of criticality. We propose a framework for characterising\ncriticality in synchronisation based on a new metric of phase synchronisation\n(rate of change of phase difference) and a set of methods we have developed for\ndetecting LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of\ncriticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these\nmodels aimed to more closely represent human brain dynamics. From these\nsimulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of\nLRTCs in phase synchronisation. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing\npairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of\ncorticomuscular phase synchronisation can be detected in the resting state. The\nexistence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronisation suggests that these\nfluctuations are governed by non-local behaviour. This has important\nimplications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see\nLRTCs in phase synchronisation.

Our approach relies on\nthe measure of interaction information (II). The sign of II provides\ninformation as to the extent to which the interaction of variables in triplets\nis redundant (R) or synergetic (S). Here, based on this approach, we calculated\nthe R and S status for triplets of electrophysiological data recorded from\ndrug-resistant patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in order to study\nthe spatial organization and dynamics of R and S close to the epileptogenic\nzone (the area responsible for seizure propagation). In terms of spatial\norganization, our results show that R matched the epileptogenic zone while S\nwas distributed more in the surrounding area. In relation to dynamics, R made\nthe largest contribution to high frequency bands (14-100Hz), whilst S was\nexpressed more strongly at lower frequencies (1-7Hz). Thus, applying\ninteraction information to such clinical data reveals new aspects of\nepileptogenic structure in terms of the nature (redundancy vs. synergy) and\ndynamics (fast vs. slow rhythms) of the interactions. We expect this\nmethodology, robust and simple, can reveal new aspects beyond pair-interactions\nin networks of interacting units in other setups with multi-recording data sets\n(and thus, not necessarily in epilepsy, the pathology we have approached here).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 Apr 2014 22:15:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 14:20:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Erramuzpe", "Asier", ""], ["Ortega", "Guillermo J.", ""], ["Pastor", "Jesus", ""], ["de Sola", "Rafael G.", ""], ["Marinazzo", "Daniele", ""], ["Stramaglia", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Cortes", "Jesus M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.6932", "submitter": "Kunihiko Goto", "authors": "Kunihiko Goto and Toshio Nakaye", "title": "Dynamic and integrated mechanical movements of a rat brain associated\n  with evoked potentials", "comments": "7 pages,and 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/", "abstract": "  By using a piezoelectric sensor, it was demonstrated that the visual evoked\npotential of a rat brain was accompanied by mechanical movements of the brain\nwhen it was excited.

In this\narticle, we investigate the consequences of several such factors that are\ncommon to neuromorphic devices, more specifically limited hardware resources,\nlimited parameter configurability and parameter variations. Our final aim is to\nprovide an array of methods for coping with such inevitable distortion\nmechanisms. As a platform for testing our proposed strategies, we use an\nexecutable system specification (ESS) of the BrainScaleS neuromorphic system,\nwhich has been designed as a universal emulation back-end for neuroscientific\nmodeling. We address the most essential limitations of this device in detail\nand study their effects on three prototypical benchmark network models within a\nwell-defined, systematic workflow. For each network model, we start by defining\nquantifiable functionality measures by which we then assess the effects of\ntypical hardware-specific distortion mechanisms, both in idealized software\nsimulations and on the ESS. For those effects that cause unacceptable\ndeviations from the original network dynamics, we suggest generic compensation\nmechanisms and demonstrate their effectiveness. Both the suggested workflow and\nthe investigated compensation mechanisms are largely back-end independent and\ndo not require additional hardware configurability beyond the one required to\nemulate the benchmark networks in the first place.

Early-stage\nwaves mediated by acetylcholine (ACh) manifest as slow, spreading bursts of\naction potentials. They are believed to be initiated by the spontaneous firing\nof Starburst Amacrine Cells (SACs), whose dense, recurrent connectivity then\npropagates this activity laterally. Their extended inter-wave intervals and\nshifting wave boundaries are the result of the slow after-hyperpolarization of\nthe SACs creating an evolving mosaic of recruitable and refractory cells, which\ncan and cannot participate in waves, respectively. Recent evidence suggests\nthat cholinergic waves may be modulated by the extracellular concentration of\nACh. Here, we construct a simplified, biophysically consistent,\nreaction-diffusion model of cholinergic retinal waves capable of recapitulating\nwave dynamics observed in mice retina recordings. The dense, recurrent\nconnectivity of SACs is modeled through local, excitatory coupling occurring\nvia the volume release and diffusion of ACh. In contrast with previous,\nsimulation-based models, we are able to use non-linear wave theory to connect\nwave features to underlying physiological parameters, making the model useful\nin determining appropriate pharmacological manipulations to experimentally\nproduce waves of a prescribed spatiotemporal character. The model is used to\ndetermine how ACh mediated connectivity may modulate wave activity, and how the\nnoise rate and sAHP refractory period contributes to critical wave size\nvariability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 22:26:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 11 Oct 2014 19:28:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lansdell", "Benjamin", ""], ["Ford", "Kevin", ""], ["Kutz", "J.

This framework is missing some fundamental features of\nthe affective nervous system, most importantly, the central role of goals in\ndriving and organizing behavior in a teleological manner. Even when\ngoal-directed behaviors are considered in current frameworks, they are\ntypically conceived of as arising in reaction to the environment, rather than\nbeing in place from the start. We hypothesize that goal-driven cognition is\nprimary, and organized into two discrete phases: goal selection and goal\nengaged, which each have a substantially different effective value function.\nThis dichotomy can potentially explain a wide range of phenomena, playing a\ncentral role in many clinical disorders, such as depression, OCD, ADHD, and\nPTSD, and providing a sensible account of the detailed biology and function of\nthe dopamine system and larger limbic system, including critical ventral and\nmedial prefrontal cortex. Computationally, reasoning backward from active goals\nto action selection is more tractable than projecting alternative action\nchoices forward to compute possible outcomes.
