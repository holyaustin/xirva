However, it can be difficult to distinguish normal\nfrom pathological HFOs, and the visual detection of HFOs is very\ntime-intensive. An automated algorithm for detecting HFOs and for wide-band\nspectral analysis is desirable.\n  Methods: The damped-oscillator oscillator detector (DOOD) is adapted for HFO\ndetection, and tested on recordings from one rat and one human. The rat data\nconsist of recordings from the hippocampus just prior to induction of status\nepilepticus, and again 6 weeks after induction, after the rat is epileptic. The\nhuman data are temporal lobe depth electrode recordings from a patient who\nunderwent pre-surgical evaluation.\n  Results: Sensitivities and positive predictive values are presented which\ndepend on specifying a threshold value for HFO detection. Wide-band\ntime-frequency and HFO-associated frequency spectra are also presented. In the\nrat data, four high frequency bands are identified at 80-250 Hz, 250-500 Hz,\n600-900 Hz and 1000-3000 Hz. The human data was low-passed filtered at 1000 Hz\nand showed HFO-associated bands at 15 Hz, 85 Hz, 400 Hz and 700 Hz.\n  Conclusion: The DOOD algorithm is capable of high resolution time-frequency\nspectra, and it can be adapted to detect HFOs with high positive predictive\nvalue. HFO-associated wide-band data show intricate low-frequency structure.\n  Significance: DOOD may ease the labor intensity of HFO detection. DOOD\nwide-band analysis may in future help distinguish normal from pathological\nHFOs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 16:10:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-05", "authors_parsed": [["Hsu", "David", ""], ["Hsu", "Murielle", ""], ["Grabenstatter", "Heidi L.", ""], ["Worrell", "Gregory A.", ""], ["Sutula", "Thomas P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.1654", "submitter": "Marc de Kamps", "authors": "Marc de Kamps", "title": "A Generic Approach to Solving Jump Diffusion Equations with Applications\n  to Neural Populations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Diffusion processes have been applied with great success to model the\ndynamics of large populations throughout science, in particular biology.

However, between-subject\nvariability can arise from an entirely different source from that driving\nwithin-subject effects, and here we report a clear-cut demonstration of this.\nWe examined the debated relationship between the visibility of a masked-prime\nstimulus and the direction of priming it causes (positive or reversed). Such\nreversal of priming has been hypothesized to reflect an automatic inhibitory\nmechanism that controls partially activated responses and allows behavioural\nflexibility. Within subjects, we found an unambiguous systematic transition\nfrom reversed priming to positive priming as prime visibility increased,\nreplicated seven times, and using different stimulus manipulations. However,\nacross individuals there was never a relationship between prime discrimination\nability and priming. Specifically, these data resolve the controversial debate\non visibility and reversed priming, indicating that they arise from independent\nprocesses relying on partially shared stimulus signals. More generally, they\nstand as an exemplar case in which variance between individuals arises from a\ndifferent source from that produced by stimulus manipulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Sep 2013 08:42:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Boy", "Frederic", ""], ["Sumner", "Petroc", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.3521", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Liane Gabora", "title": "Cultural Evolution Entails (Creativity Entails (Concept Combination\n  Entails Quantum Structure))", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Gabora, L.

The system displays avalanche dynamics in the form of cascades\nof neuronal firing separated by periods of silence.

We analytically derive the distributions of waiting times and\ninvestigate their temporal behaviour in relation to different levels of\nexternal input, showing that the system's dynamics can exhibit partial\nlong-range temporal correlations. We further show that as the system approaches\nthe critical state by two alternative `routes', different markers of\ncriticality (partial scale-free behaviour and long-range temporal correlations)\nare displayed.

However, when we\nhave learned to recognize a foreign accent, it seems plausible that recognition\nof a word rarely involves reconstruction of the speech gestures of the speaker\nrather than the listener. To better assess the motor theory and this\nobservation, we proceed in three stages. Part 1 places the motor theory of\nspeech perception in a larger framework based on our earlier models of the\nadaptive formation of mirror neurons for grasping, and for viewing extensions\nof that mirror system as part of a larger system for neuro-linguistic\nprocessing, augmented by the present consideration of recognizing speech in a\nnovel accent. Part 2 then offers a novel computational model of how a listener\ncomes to understand the speech of someone speaking the listener's native\nlanguage with a foreign accent. The core tenet of the model is that the\nlistener uses hypotheses about the word the speaker is currently uttering to\nupdate probabilities linking the sound produced by the speaker to phonemes in\nthe native language repertoire of the listener. This, on average, improves the\nrecognition of later words. This model is neutral regarding the nature of the\nrepresentations it uses (motor vs. auditory).

The Tsodyks and Markram (TM) model for STSP accurately\naccounts for a wide range of physiological responses at different types of\ncortical synapses. Here, we report for the first time a route to chaotic\nbehavior via a Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation that dynamically organises some\nof the responses in the TM model. In particular, the presence of such a\nhomoclinic bifurcation strongly affects the shape of the trajectories in the\nphase space and induces highly irregular transient dynamics; indeed, in the\nvicinity of the Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation, the number of population\nspikes and their precise timing are unpredictable and highly sensitive to the\ninitial conditions. Such an irregular deterministic dynamics has its\ncounterpart in stochastic/network versions of the TM model: the existence of\nthe Shilnikov homoclinic bifurcation generates complex and irregular spiking\npatterns and --acting as a sort of springboard-- facilitates transitions\nbetween the down-state and unstable periodic orbits. The interplay between the\n(deterministic) homoclinic bifurcation and stochastic effects may give rise to\nsome of the complex dynamics observed in neural systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:12:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Cortes", "Jesus M", ""], ["Desroches", "Mathieu", ""], ["Rodrigues", "Serafim", ""], ["Veltz", "Romain", ""], ["Munoz", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Sejnowski", "Terrence J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.7990", "submitter": "Bradly  Alicea", "authors": "Bradly Alicea", "title": "The Emergence of Animal Social Complexity: theoretical and biobehavioral\n  evidence", "comments": "22 pages, 4 figures.

These results\nwill be organized into a vertical model of social complexity. This will support\nthe perspective that social complexity is in essence an emergent phenomenon\nwhile helping to answer two interrelated questions. The first of these involves\nhow behavior is integrated at units of analysis larger than the individual\norganism. The second involves placing aggregate social events into the context\nof processes occurring within individual organisms over time (e.g. genomic and\nphysiological processes). By using a complex systems perspective, five\nprinciples of social complexity can be identified. These principles suggest\nthat lower-level mechanisms give rise to high-level mechanisms, ultimately\nresulting in metastable networks of social relations. These network structures\nthen constrain lower-level phenomena ranging from transient, collective social\ngroups to physiological regulatory mechanisms within individual organisms. In\nconclusion, the broader implications and drawbacks of applying the theory to a\ndiversity of natural populations will be discussed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Sep 2013 19:55:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Oct 2013 15:13:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Alicea", "Bradly", ""]]}]
