Most importantly, it ignores the potential effects of\nresponse bias.

This\nmodel assumes that input to V1 neurons is dominated by feed-forward projections\noriginating from a small set of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The typical\nspacing between adjacent cortical orientation columns preferring the same\norientation then arises via Moir\\'{e}-Interference between hexagonal ON/OFF RGC\nmosaics. While this Moir\\'{e}-Interference critically depends on long-range\nhexagonal order within the RGC mosaics, a recent statistical analysis of RGC\nreceptive field positions found no evidence for such long-range positional\norder. Hexagonal order may be only one of several ways to obtain spatially\nrepetitive OPMs in the statistical connectivity model. Here, we investigate a\nmore general requirement on the spatial structure of RGC mosaics that can seed\nthe emergence of spatially repetitive cortical OPMs, namely that angular\ncorrelations between so-called RGC dipoles exhibit a spatial structure similar\nto that of OPM autocorrelation functions. Both in cat beta cell mosaics as well\nas primate parasol receptive field mosaics we find that RGC dipole angles are\nspatially uncorrelated. To help assess the level of these correlations, we\nintroduce a novel point process that generates mosaics with realistic nearest\nneighbor statistics and a tunable degree of spatial correlations of dipole\nangles. Using this process, we show that given the size of available data sets,\nthe presence of even weak angular correlations in the data is very unlikely.
