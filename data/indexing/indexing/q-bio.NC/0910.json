The experiment\nconsists in activating externally an initial random fraction of the neurons and\nobserve the process of firing until its equilibrium. The final portion of\nneurons that are active depends in a non linear way on the initial fraction.\nThe main result of this paper is a theorem which enables us to find the\nasymptotic of final proportion of the fired neurons in the case of random\ndirected graphs with given node degrees as the model for interacting network.\nThis gives a rigorous mathematical proof of a phenomena observed by physicists\nin neural networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 4 Oct 2009 19:31:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Amini", "Hamed", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0805", "submitter": "Alain Destexhe", "authors": "Jonathan Touboul and Alain Destexhe", "title": "Can power-law scaling and neuronal avalanches arise from stochastic\n  dynamics?", "comments": "14 pages, 10 figures; PLoS One, in press (2010)", "journal-ref": "PLoS One 5(2): e8982, 2010.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0008982", "report-no": null, "categories": "nlin.AO q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The presence of self-organized criticality in biology is often evidenced by a\npower-law scaling of event size distributions, which can be measured by linear\nregression on logarithmic axes. We show here that such a procedure does not\nnecessarily mean that the system exhibits self-organized criticality. We first\nprovide an analysis of multisite local field potential (LFP) recordings of\nbrain activity and show that event size distributions defined as negative LFP\npeaks can be close to power-law distributions. However, this result is not\nrobust to change in detection threshold, or when tested using more rigorous\nstatistical analyses such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Similar power-law\nscaling is observed for surrogate signals, suggesting that power-law scaling\nmay be a generic property of thresholded stochastic processes. We next\ninvestigate this problem analytically, and show that, indeed, stochastic\nprocesses can produce spurious power-law scaling without the presence of\nunderlying self-organized criticality. However, this power-law is only apparent\nin logarithmic representations, and does not survive more rigorous analysis\nsuch as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The same analysis was also performed on an\nartificial network known to display self-organized criticality. In this case,\nboth the graphical representations and the rigorous statistical analysis reveal\nwith no ambiguity that the avalanche size is distributed as a power-law. We\nconclude that logarithmic representations can lead to spurious power-law\nscaling induced by the stochastic nature of the phenomenon. This apparent\npower-law scaling does not constitute a proof of self-organized criticality,\nwhich should be demonstrated by more stringent statistical tests.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 Oct 2009 16:49:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Dec 2009 08:33:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 9 Jan 2010 09:24:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Touboul", "Jonathan", ""], ["Destexhe", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.0988", "submitter": "Murilo Baptista S.", "authors": "M.
