The relation between two subtypes, migraine without aura (MWoA)\nand migraine with aura (MWA), is explored with the aim to identify targets for\nneuromodulation techniques. To this end, a dynamically regulated control system\nis schematically reduced to a network of the trigeminal nerve, which innervates\nthe cranial circulation, an associated descending modulatory network of\nbrainstem nuclei, and parasympathetic vasomotor efferents.

The goal of this paper is\nto determine which kind of stimulus features can be encoded in burst length,\nand how those features depend on the mathematical properties of the underlying\ndynamical system. We show that the initiation and termination of each burst is\ntriggered by specific stimulus features whose temporal characteristsics are\ndetermined by the types of bifurcations that initiate and terminate firing in\neach burst. As only a few bifurcations are possible, only a restricted number\nof encoded features exists. Here we focus specifically on describing parabolic,\nsquare-wave and elliptic bursters. We find that parabolic bursters, whose\nfiring is initiated and terminated by saddle-node bifurcations, behave as\nprototypical integrators: Firing is triggered by depolarizing stimuli, and\nlasts for as long as excitation is prolonged. Elliptic bursters, contrastingly,\nconstitute prototypical resonators, since both the initiating and terminating\nbifurcations possess well-defined oscillation time scales. Firing is therefore\ntriggered by stimulus stretches of matching frequency and terminated by a\nphase-inversion in the oscillation. The behavior of square-wave bursters is\nsomewhat intermediate, since they are triggered by a fold bifurcation of cycles\nof well-defined frequency but are terminated by a homoclinic bifurcation\nlacking an oscillating time scale. These correspondences show that stimulus\nselectivity is determined by the type of bifurcations. We also demonstrate that\nadditional biological properties that do not modify the bifurcation structure\nplay a minor role in stimulus encoding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 22:30:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Samengo", "In\u00e9s", ""], ["Mato", "Germ\u00e1n", ""], ["Elijah", "Daniel H.", ""], ["Schreiber", "Susanne", ""], ["Montemurro", "Marcelo A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.5616", "submitter": "Thomas Wiecki", "authors": "Thomas V.

In this review I will describe the\ncauses of this crisis and highlight recent efforts to overcome current\nchallenges. One particularly promising approach is the emerging field of\ncomputational psychiatry. By using methods and insights from computational\ncognitive neuroscience, computational psychiatry might enable us to move from a\nsymptom-based description of mental illness to descriptors based on objective\ncomputational multidimensional functional variables. To exemplify this I will\nsurvey recent efforts towards this goal. I will then describe a set of methods\nthat together form a toolbox of cognitive models to aid this research program.\nAt the core of this toolbox are sequential sampling models which have been used\nto explain diverse cognitive neuroscience phenomena but have so far seen little\nadoption in psychiatric research. I will then describe how these models can be\nfitted to subject data and highlight how hierarchical Bayesian estimation\nprovides a rich framework with many desirable properties and benefits compared\nto traditional optimization-based approaches. Finally, non-parametric Bayesian\nmethods provide general solutions to the problem of classifying mental illness\nwithin this framework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Mar 2013 13:38:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wiecki", "Thomas V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.6175", "submitter": "Ramon Ferrer i Cancho", "authors": "R.

Analyses of human\nlanguage and the behavior of a range of non-human animal species have provided\nevidence for a common pattern underlying diverse behavioral phenomena: words\nfollow Zipf's law of brevity (the tendency of more frequently used words to be\nshorter), and conformity to this general pattern has been seen in the behavior\nof a number of other animals. It has been argued that the presence of this law\nis a sign of efficient coding in the information theoretic sense. However, no\nstrong direct connection has been demonstrated between the law and compression,\nthe information theoretic principle of minimizing the expected length of a\ncode. Here we show that minimizing the expected code length implies that the\nlength of a word cannot increase as its frequency increases. Furthermore, we\nshow that the mean code length or duration is significantly small in human\nlanguage, and also in the behavior of other species in all cases where\nagreement with the law of brevity has been found. We argue that compression is\na general principle of animal behavior, that reflects selection for efficiency\nof coding.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Mar 2013 15:43:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ferrer-i-Cancho", "R.", ""], ["Hern\u00e1ndez-Fern\u00e1ndez", "A.", ""], ["Lusseau", "D.", ""], ["Agoramoorthy", "G.", ""], ["Hsu", "M.

The study focuses on globally modulated STDP, as\na special use-case of this method. Flexibility is achieved by embedding a\ngeneral-purpose processor dedicated to plasticity into the wafer. To evaluate\nthe suitability of the proposed system, we use a reward modulated STDP rule in\na spike train learning task. A single layer of neurons is trained to fire at\nspecific points in time with only the reward as feedback. This model is\nsimulated to measure its performance, i.e. the increase in received reward\nafter learning. Using this performance as baseline, we then simulate the model\nwith various constraints imposed by the proposed implementation and compare the\nperformance. The simulated constraints include discretized synaptic weights, a\nrestricted interface between analog synapses and embedded processor, and\nmismatch of analog circuits. We find that probabilistic updates can increase\nthe performance of low-resolution weights, a simple interface between analog\nsynapses and processor is sufficient for learning, and performance is\ninsensitive to mismatch. Further, we consider communication latency between\nwafer and the conventional control computer system that is simulating the\nenvironment. This latency increases the delay, with which the reward is sent to\nthe embedded processor. Because of the time continuous operation of the analog\nsynapses, delay can cause a deviation of the updates as compared to the not\ndelayed situation. We find that for highly accelerated systems latency has to\nbe kept to a minimum. This study demonstrates the suitability of the proposed\nimplementation to emulate the selected reward modulated STDP learning rule.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2013 00:05:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2013 08:04:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Friedmann", "Simon", ""], ["Fr\u00e9maux", "Nicolas", ""], ["Schemmel", "Johannes", ""], ["Gerstner", "Wulfram", ""], ["Meier", "Karlheinz", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7186", "submitter": "Thouis Jones", "authors": "Verena Kaynig, Amelio Vazquez-Reina, Seymour Knowles-Barley, Mike\n  Roberts, Thouis R.
