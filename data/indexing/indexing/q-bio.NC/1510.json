Characterizations of burst and spike synchronization are also made by\nemploying realistic order parameters and statistical-mechanical measures. Next,\nwe choose appropriate values of $J$ and $D$ where only the burst\nsynchronization occurs, and investigate the effect of the scale-free\nconnectivity on the burst synchronization by varying (1) the symmetric\nattachment degree and (2) the asymmetry parameter (representing deviation from\nthe symmetric case) in the $\\alpha-$process, and (3) the occurrence probability\nof the $\\beta-$process. In all these three cases, changes in the type and the\ndegree of population synchronization are studied in connection with the network\ntopology such as the degree distribution, the average path length $L_p$, and\nthe betweenness centralization $B_c$. It is thus found that not only $L_p$ and\n$B_c$ (affecting global communication between nodes) but also the in-degree\ndistribution (affecting individual dynamics) are important network factors for\neffective population synchronization in SFNs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 00:44:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Oct 2015 03:26:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kim", "Sang-Yoon", ""], ["Lim", "Woochang", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.00286", "submitter": "Nikos Kouvaris", "authors": "Johanne Hizanidis, Nikos E.

Question is what is the MHb doing and why it\nreceives information from hippocampus via septum? This study explores the MHb\nconnectivity, predicts its functional role and how it is linked to memory.\nCombination of known findings about the septum and MHb connectivity and\nfunction led to this circuit-based idea that posterior septum activates MHb,\nMHb activates IPN,and IPN stimulates MRN and its serotonin release. Proposed\nidea is that this MHb-IPN-MRN circuit promotes slow wave sleep (SWS), high\nserotonin and low acetylcholine state. My prediction is that this SWS-promoting\ncircuit reciprocally suppresses the theta oscillations promoting circuit,\nlinked to high acetylcholine levels in brain, and formed by supramamillary area\nprojections to the medial septum (MS) that induces theta rhythm in hippocampus\nand other theta-coupled regions.

Next, various forms of wire minimization rule (wire length, surface\narea, volume, or conduction delays) are analyzed, of which, only minimization\nof wire volume provides realistic results that are very close to the empirical\ncortical fractions. As an alternative, a new principle called \"spine economy\nmaximization\" is proposed and investigated, which is associated with\nmaximization of spine proportion in the cortex per spine size that yields\nequally good but more robust results. Additionally, a combination of wire cost\nand spine economy notions is considered as a meta-principle, and it is found\nthat this proposition gives only marginally better results than either pure\nwire volume minimization or pure spine economy maximization, but only if spine\neconomy component dominates. In sum, these results suggest that the new spine\neconomy principle may be important for brain evolutionary design in a broader\ncontext.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 13:23:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Karbowski", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08780", "submitter": "John Medaglia", "authors": "John D.

Mounting\nevidence suggests that executive function in adults may be driven by dynamic\ncontrol of neurophysiological processes. Yet, how these dynamics evolve over\nadolescence and contribute to cognitive development is unknown. Using a novel\ndynamic graph approach in which each moment in time is a node and the\nsimilarity in brain states at two different times is an edge, we identify two\nprimary brain states reminiscent of intrinsic and task-evoked systems. We\ndemonstrate that time spent in these two states increases over development, as\ndoes the flexibility with which the brain switches between them. Increasing\ntime spent in primary states and flexibility among states relates to increased\nexecutive performance over adolescence. Indeed, flexibility is increasingly\nadvantageous for performance toward early adulthood. These findings demonstrate\nthat brain state dynamics underlie the development of executive function during\nthe critical period of adolescence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 17:06:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Medaglia", "John D.", ""], ["Satterthwaite", "Theodore D.", ""], ["Moore", "Tyler M.", ""], ["Ruparel", "Kosha", ""], ["Gur", "Ruben C.", ""], ["Gur", "Raquel E.", ""], ["Bassett", "Danielle S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09035", "submitter": "Jose A.

Paired spiking (PS) enhancement plays a key role by\nacting as a temporal filter that deletes less informative spikes. We analyzed\nthe spontaneous neural activity evolution in a hippocampal and a cortical\nnetwork over several weeks exploring whether the same PS coding mechanism\nappears in neuronal cultures as well. We show that self-organized neural in\nvitro networks not only develop characteristic bursting activity, but feature\nrobust in vivo-like PS activity. PS activity formed spatiotemporal patterns\nthat started at early days in vitro (DIVs) and lasted until the end of the\nrecording sessions. Initially random-like and sparse PS patterns became robust\nafter three weeks in vitro (WIVs). They were characterized by a high number of\noccurrences and short inter-paired spike intervals (IPSIs). Spatially, the\ndegree of complexity increased by recruiting new neighboring sites in PS as a\nculture matured. Moreover, PS activity participated in establishing functional\nconnectivity between different sites within the developing network. Employing\ntransfer entropy (TE) as an information transfer measure, we show that PS\nactivity is robustly involved in establishing effective connectivities. Spiking\nactivity at both individual sites and network level robustly followed each PS\nwithin a short time interval. PS may thus be considered a spiking predictor.\nThese findings suggest that PS activity is preserved in spontaneously active in\nvitro networks as part of a robust coding mechanism as encountered in vivo. We\nsuggest that, presumably in lack of any external sensory stimuli, PS may act as\nan internal surrogate stimulus to drive neural activity at different\ndevelopmental stages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:56:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Martiniuc", "Aurel Vasile", ""], ["Boco\u015f-Bin\u0163in\u0163an", "Victor", ""], ["Habibey", "Rouhollah", ""], ["Golabchi", "Asiyeh", ""], ["Knoll", "Alois", ""], ["Blau", "Axel", ""]]}]
