By removing the jitter and, therefore, enabling more accurate\nestimation of neuronal responses, the dTAV algorithm can improve analysis and\ninterpretation of the responses and improve the accuracy of systems relaying on\nasynchronous detection of events from neuronal recordings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 10:17:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Milekovic", "Tomislav", ""], ["Mehring", "Carsten", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.05219", "submitter": "Ricardo Pio Monti", "authors": "Ricardo Pio Monti, Romy Lorenz, Peter Hellyer, Robert Leech,\n  Christoforos Anagnostopoulos, Giovanni Montana", "title": "Graph embeddings of dynamic functional connectivity reveal\n  discriminative patterns of task engagement in HCP data", "comments": "4 pages, 1 figure, 5th International Workshop on Pattern Recognition\n  in Neuroimaging, Stanford University, 2015", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  There is increasing evidence to suggest functional connectivity networks are\nnon-stationary.

The main goal of this work is to develop a model for multi-sensor\nsignals such as MEG or EEG signals, that accounts for the inter-trial\nvariability, suitable for corresponding binary classification problems. An\nimportant constraint is that the model be simple enough to handle small size\nand unbalanced datasets, as often encountered in BCI type experiments.\nApproach. The method involves linear mixed effects statistical model, wavelet\ntransform and spatial filtering, and aims at the characterization of localized\ndiscriminant features in multi-sensor signals. After discrete wavelet transform\nand spatial filtering, a projection onto the relevant wavelet and spatial\nchannels subspaces is used for dimension reduction. The projected signals are\nthen decomposed as the sum of a signal of interest (i.e. discriminant) and\nbackground noise, using a very simple Gaussian linear mixed model. Main\nresults.

The analysis of empirical functional correlations\nbetween neighboring voxels revealed faster decay as a function of distance in\nthe M1 region corresponding to the arm in BPA patients as compared to the\ncontrol group. No differences between the two groups were found in the face\narea. We also investigated whether such larger decay in patients could be\nattributed to a gray matter diminution in M1. Structural imaging analysis\nshowed no difference in gray matter density between groups.

Duncan Luce once mentioned in a conversation that he did not consider\nKolmogorov's probability theory well-constructed because it treats stochastic\nindependence as a \"numerical accident,\" while it should be treated as a\nfundamental relation, more basic than the assignment of numerical\nprobabilities. I argue here that stochastic independence is indeed a \"numerical\naccident,\" a special form of stochastic dependence between random variables\n(most broadly defined). The idea that it is fundamental may owe its\nattractiveness to the confusion of stochastic independence with stochastic\nunrelatedness, the situation when two or more random variables have no joint\ndistribution, \"have nothing to do with each other.\" Kolmogorov's probability\ntheory cannot be consistently constructed without allowing for stochastic\nunrelatedness, in fact making it a default situation: any two random variables\nrecorded under mutually incompatible conditions are stochastically unrelated.\nHowever, stochastically unrelated random variables can always be\nprobabilistically coupled, i.e., imposed a joint distribution upon, and this\ngenerally can be done in an infinity of ways, independent coupling being merely\none of them. The notions of stochastic unrelatedness and all possible couplings\nplay a central role in the foundation of probability theory and, especially, in\nthe theory of probabilistic contextuality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 21:09:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 Jul 2015 13:13:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 17:39:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 20 Jan 2016 14:41:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 02:46:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Dzhafarov", "Ehtibar", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08391", "submitter": "Ilan Golani", "authors": "Shay Cohen, Yoav Benjamini, and Ilan Golani", "title": "Coping with Space Neophobia in Drosophila melanogaster: The Asymmetric\n  Dynamics of Crossing a Doorway to the Untrodden", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0140207", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Insects exhibit remarkable cognitive skills in the field and several\ncognitive abilities have been demonstrated in Drosophila in the laboratory. By\ndevising an ethologically relevant experimental setup that also allows\ncomparison of behavior across remote taxonomic groups we sought to reduce the\ngap between the field and the laboratory, and reveal as yet undiscovered\nethological phenomena within a wider phylogenetic perspective. We tracked\nindividual flies that eclosed in a small (45mm) arena containing a piece of\nfruit, connected to a larger (130mm) arena by a wide (5mm) doorway. Using this\nsetup we show that the widely open doorway initially functions as a barrier:\nthe likelihood of entering the large arena increases gradually, requiring\nrepeated approaches to the doorway, and even after entering the flies\nimmediately return. Gradually the flies acquire the option to avoid returning,\nspending more relative time and performing relatively longer excursions in the\nlarge arena. The entire process may take up three successive days. This\nbehavior constitutes coping with space neophobia, the avoidance of untrodden\nspace. It appears to be the same as the neophobic doorway-crossing reported in\nmouse models of anxiety. In both mice and flies the moment-to-moment\ndevelopmental dynamics of transition between trodden and untrodden terrain\nappear to be the same, and in mice it is taken to imply memory and, therefore,\ncognition. Recent claims have been made for a deep homology between the\narthropod central complex and the vertebrate basal ganglia, two structures\ninvolved in navigation. The shared dynamics of space occupancy in flies and\nmice might indicate the existence of cognitive exploration also in the flies or\nelse a convergent structure exhibiting the same developmental dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2015 12:47:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Cohen", "Shay", ""], ["Benjamini", "Yoav", ""], ["Golani", "Ilan", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08995", "submitter": "Diego Fasoli", "authors": "Diego Fasoli, Anna Cattani, Stefano Panzeri", "title": "The complexity of dynamics in small neural circuits", "comments": "34 pages, 11 figures.
