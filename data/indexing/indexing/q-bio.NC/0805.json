Such noise usually increases the\nprobability that a neuron will send out a signal to its target cells 2-5. In\nstochastic resonance, which occurs in many physical and biological systems, an\noptimal response is found at a particular noise amplitude 6-9. We have found\nthat in a classical neuronal model the opposite can occur - that noise can\nsubdue or turn off repetitive neuronal activity in both single cells and\nnetworks of cells. Recent experiments on regularly firing neurons with noisy\ninputs confirm these predictions 10,11. Surprisingly, we find that in some\ncases there is a noise level at which the response is a minimum, a phenomenon\nwhich is called inverse stochastic resonance. Suppression of rhythmic behavior\nby noise and inverse stochastic resonance are predicted to occur not only in\nneuronal systems but more generally in diverse nonlinear dynamical systems\nwhere a stable limit cycle is attainable from a stable rest state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 5 May 2008 19:59:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-06", "authors_parsed": [["Gutkin", "Boris S.", ""], ["Jost", "Juergen", ""], ["Tuckwell", "Henry C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.1561", "submitter": "R.

This paper addresses this problem in two ways. First, we\nprovide physical arguments to show why these constraints on the time constants\ncan be relaxed. Second, we give a formal proof showing which constraints can be\nabolished. This proof rests on a generalization of the Carnevale-Hines lemma,\nwhich is a new tool for comparing double exponentials as they naturally occur\nin many cascaded decay systems including receptor-neurotransmitter dissociation\nfollowed by channel closing. We show that this lemma can be generalized and\nsubsequently used for lifting most of the original constraints on the time\nconstants.

In the\nexisting literature, relatively little attention has been given to the\ninfluence of neuron shape on the overall connectivity and dynamics of the\nemerging networks. The current work addresses this issue by considering\nsimplified neuronal shapes consisting of circular regions (soma/axons) with\nspokes (dendrites). Networks are grown by placing these patterns randomly in\nthe 2D plane and establishing connections whenever a piece of dendrite falls\ninside an axon. Several topological and dynamical properties of the resulting\ngraph are measured, including the degree distribution, clustering coefficients,\nsymmetry of connections, size of the largest connected component, as well as\nthree hierarchical measurements of the local topology. By varying the number of\nprocesses of the individual basic patterns, we can quantify relationships\nbetween the individual neuronal shape and the topological and dynamical\nfeatures of the networks. Integrate-and-fire dynamics on these networks is also\ninvestigated with respect to transient activation from a source node,\nindicating that long-range connections play an important role in the\npropagation of avalanches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 May 2008 14:02:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ahnert", "Sebastian", ""], ["Costa", "Luciano da Fontoura", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.1723", "submitter": "Nicolas Vuillerme", "authors": "Nicolas Vuillerme (TIMC), Nicolas Pinsault (TIMC), Olivier Chenu\n  (TIMC), Anthony Fleury (TIMC), Yohan Payan (TIMC), Jacques Demongeot (TIMC)", "title": "A Wireless Embedded Tongue Tactile Biofeedback System for Balance\n  Control", "comments": "Pervasive and Mobile Computing (2008) in press", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.pmcj.2008.04.001", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We describe the architecture of an original biofeedback system for balance\nimprovement for fall prevention and present results of a feasibility study.

In some forms of sensory adaptation, these linear\nfilters and gain curve adjust very rapidly to changes in the variance of a\nrandomly varying driving input. An apparently similar but previously unrelated\nissue is the observation of gain control by background noise in cortical\nneurons: the slope of the firing rate vs current (f-I) curve changes with the\nvariance of background random input. Here, we show a direct correspondence\nbetween these two observations by relating variance-dependent changes in the\ngain of f-I curves to characteristics of the changing empirical\nlinear/nonlinear model obtained by sampling. In the case that the underlying\nsystem is fixed, we derive relationships relating the change of the gain with\nrespect to both mean and variance with the receptive fields derived from\nreverse correlation on a white noise stimulus. Using two conductance-based\nmodel neurons that display distinct gain modulation properties through a simple\nchange in parameters, we show that coding properties of both these models\nquantitatively satisfy the predicted relationships.
