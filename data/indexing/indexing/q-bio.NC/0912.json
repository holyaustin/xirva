This interest stems from the realization that glia participates\nin cognitive functions and information processing and is involved in many brain\ndisorders and neurodegenerative diseases. An important process in neuron-glia\ncommunications is astrocyte encoding of synaptic information transfer: the\nmodulation of intracellular calcium dynamics in astrocytes in response to\nsynaptic activity. Here, we derive and investigate a concise mathematical model\nfor glutamate-induced astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ dynamics that captures the\nessential biochemical features of the regulatory pathway of inositol\n1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Starting from the well-known two-state Li-Rinzel\nmodel for calcium-induced-calcium release, we incorporate the regulation of the\nIP3 production and phosphorylation. Doing so we extended it to a three-state\nmodel (referred as the G-ChI model), that could account for Ca2+ oscillations\ntriggered by endogenous IP3 metabolism as well as by IP3 production by external\nglutamate signals. Compared to previous similar models, our three-state models\ninclude a more realistic description of the IP3 production and degradation\npathways, lumping together their essential nonlinearities within a concise\nformulation. Using bifurcation analysis and time simulations, we demonstrate\nthe existence of new putative dynamical features. The cross-couplings between\nIP3 and Ca2+ pathways endows the system with self-consistent oscillator\nproperties and favor mixed frequency-amplitude encoding modes over pure\namplitude modulation ones.

Experimental observations show\nthat Ca2+ signals in response to external stimuli encode information via\nfrequency modulation or alternatively via amplitude modulation. Although\nminimal models can capture separately both types of dynamics, they fail to\nexhibit different and more advanced encoding modes. By arguments of bifurcation\ntheory, we propose instead that under some biophysical conditions more complex\nmodes of information encoding can also be manifested by minimal models. We\nconsider the minimal model of Li and Rinzel and show that information encoding\ncan occur by amplitude modulation (AM) of Ca2+ oscillations, by frequency\nmodulation (FM) or by both modes (AFM). Our work is motivated by calcium\nsignalling in astrocytes, the predominant type of cortical glial cells that is\nnowadays recognized to play a crucial role in the regulation of neuronal\nactivity and information processing of the brain.

It\nallows systems at criticality to adapt swiftly to environmental changes (i.e.,\nhigh susceptibility) as well as to flexibly process and store information.\nThese unique properties prompted the conjecture that the brain might operate at\ncriticality (1), a view supported by the recent description of neuronal\navalanches in cortex in vitro (6-8), in anesthetized rats (9) and awake\nprimates (10), and in neuronal models (11-16). Despite the attractiveness of\nthis idea, its validity is hampered by the fact that its theoretical\nunderpinning relies solely on the replication of sizes and durations of\navalanches, which reflect only a portion of the rich dynamics found at\ncriticality. Here we show experimentally five fundamental properties of\navalanches consistent with criticality: (1) a separation of time scales, in\nwhich the power law probability density of avalanches sizes s, P(s) and the\nlifetime distribution of avalanches are invariant to slow, external driving;\n(2) stationary P(s) over time; (3) the avalanche probabilities preceding and\nfollowing main avalanches obey Omori law (17, 18) for earthquakes; (4) the\naverage size of avalanches following a main avalanche decays as a power law;\n(5) the spatial spread of avalanches has a fractal dimension and obeys\nfinite-size scaling. Thus, neuronal avalanches are a robust manifestation of\ncriticality in the brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Dec 2009 21:05:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Plenz", "Dietmar", ""], ["Chialvo", "Dante R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.5409", "submitter": "William Bialek", "authors": "Gasper Tkacik, Elad Schneidman, Michael J.
