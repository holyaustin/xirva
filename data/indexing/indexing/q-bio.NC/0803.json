Recent developments in\nelectrophysiology and imaging allow one to simultaneously record activities of\nhundreds of neurons. Inferring the underlying neuronal connectivity patterns\nfrom such multi-neuronal spike train data streams is a challenging statistical\nand computational problem. This task involves finding significant temporal\npatterns from vast amounts of symbolic time series data. In this paper we show\nthat the frequent episode mining methods from the field of temporal data mining\ncan be very useful in this context. In the frequent episode discovery\nframework, the data is viewed as a sequence of events, each of which is\ncharacterized by an event type and its time of occurrence and episodes are\ncertain types of temporal patterns in such data. Here we show that, using the\nset of discovered frequent episodes from multi-neuronal data, one can infer\ndifferent types of connectivity patterns in the neural system that generated\nit. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of mining for frequent episodes\nunder certain temporal constraints; the structure of these temporal constraints\nis motivated by the application. We present algorithms for discovering serial\nand parallel episodes under these temporal constraints. Through extensive\nsimulation studies we demonstrate that these methods are useful for unearthing\npatterns of neuronal network connectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Mar 2008 14:11:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 Mar 2008 02:24:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-03-11", "authors_parsed": [["Patnaik", "Debprakash", "", "Electical Engg.

It has recently\nbeen suggested that in the low-stimulus regime (h ~ 0) the response function\nF(h) of hypercubic deterministic systems behaves as a power law, F ~ h^m.\nMoreover the response exponent m has been predicted to depend only on the\ndimensionality d of the lattice, m = 1/(1+d) [T. Ohta and T. Yoshimura, Physica\nD 205, 189 (2005)]. In order to test this prediction, we study the response\nfunction of excitable lattices modeled by either coupled Morris-Lecar equations\nor Greenberg-Hastings cellular automata. We show that the prediction is\nverified in our model systems for d = 1, 2, and 3, provided that a minimum set\nof conditions is satisfied. Under these conditions, the dynamic range - which\nmeasures the range of stimulus intensities that can be coded by the network\nactivity - increases with the dimensionality d of the network. The power law\nscenario breaks down, however, if the system can exhibit self-sustained\nactivity (spiral waves). In this case, we recover a scenario that is common to\nprobabilistic excitable media: as a function of the conductance coupling G\namong the excitable elements, the dynamic range is maximized precisely at the\ncritical value G_c above which self-sustained activity becomes stable.
