Proposed dACC role is to generate a\nWARNING signal when things are going (or might end) bad or wrong to prevent\nnegative consequences: pain, harm, loss or failure. The AI signals about bad\nlow aversive qualities, which make us sick or cause discomfort. These cortical\ninputs activate directly and indirectly (via D2 loop of VS) the LHb, which\ninhibits dopamine and serotonin release (and is reciprocally inhibited by VTA,\nDRN) to avoid choosing and doing things leading to harm or loss, but also to\nmake us feel worse, down when overstimulated. We propose that dopamine\nattenuates the output of the adversity processing circuit, thus decreasing\ninhibitory avoidance and self-control, while serotonin attenuates dACC, AI,\nclOFC, D1 loop of VS, LHb, amygdala and pain pathway. Thus, by reciprocal\ninhibition, by causing dopamine and serotonin suppression - and by being\nsuppressed by them, the adversity processing circuit competes with reward\nprocessing circuit for control of choice behaviour and affective states. We\npropose stimulating effect of dopamine and calming inhibitory effect of\nserotonin on the active avoidance circuit involving amygdala, linked to threat\nprocessing, anger, fear, self-defense and violences. We describe causes and\nroles of dopamine and serotonin signaling, and mental dysfunctions. We add new\nidea on vACC role in signaling that we are doing well and in inducing\nserotonin, when we gain/reach safety, comfort, valuable resources,\nsocial/biological rewards, affection or goals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Apr 2013 19:05:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v10", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2014 14:54:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v11", "created": "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 10:10:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v12", "created": "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 08:18:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v13", "created": "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 15:03:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v14", "created": "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 17:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v15", "created": "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 12:52:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 7 May 2013 19:30:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 07:23:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2013 12:10:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 22 Jan 2014 15:13:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v6", "created": "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 08:09:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v7", "created": "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 09:10:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v8", "created": "Wed, 12 Feb 2014 10:39:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v9", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 18:04:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Vadovi\u010dov\u00e1", "Karin", ""], ["Gasparotti", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.4475", "submitter": "Monica De Angelis", "authors": "M.De Angelis", "title": "A priori estimates for excitable models", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1203.0448", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math-ph math.MP q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The reaction-diffusion system of Fitzhugh Nagumo is considered.

Several computational mechanisms have been proposed to account for such\nisochronous synchronization in the presence of long conduction delays: Of\nthese, the phenomenon of \"dynamical relaying\" - a mechanism that relies on a\nspecific network motif - has proven to be the most robust with respect to\nparameter mismatch and system noise. Surprisingly, despite a contrary belief in\nthe community, the common driving motif is an unreliable means of establishing\nzero-lag synchrony. Although dynamical relaying has been validated in empirical\nand computational studies, the deeper dynamical mechanisms and comparison to\ndynamics on other motifs is lacking. By systematically comparing\nsynchronization on a variety of small motifs, we establish that the presence of\na single reciprocally connected pair - a \"resonance pair\" - plays a crucial\nrole in disambiguating those motifs that foster zero-lag synchrony in the\npresence of conduction delays (such as dynamical relaying) from those that do\nnot (such as the common driving triad). Remarkably, minor structural changes to\nthe common driving motif that incorporate a reciprocal pair recover robust\nzero-lag synchrony. The findings are observed in computational models of\nspiking neurons, populations of spiking neurons and neural mass models, and\narise whether the oscillatory systems are periodic, chaotic, noise-free or\ndriven by stochastic inputs. The influence of the resonance pair is also robust\nto parameter mismatch and asymmetrical time delays amongst the elements of the\nmotif. We call this manner of facilitating zero-lag synchrony resonance-induced\nsynchronization, outline the conditions for its occurrence, and propose that it\nmay be a general mechanism to promote zero-lag synchrony in the brain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Apr 2013 02:20:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 25 Jan 2014 02:49:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-07", "authors_parsed": [["Gollo", "Leonardo L.", ""], ["Mirasso", "Claudio", ""], ["Sporns", "Olaf", ""], ["Breakspear", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.5232", "submitter": "Anca Radulescu", "authors": "Anca Radulescu", "title": "Neural network spectral robustness under perturbations of the underlying\n  graph", "comments": "manuscript: 27 pages; references: 5 pages; 2 appendices; 16 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cs.DM math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent studies have been using graph theoretical approaches to model complex\nnetworks (such as social, infrastructural or biological networks), and how\ntheir hardwired circuitry relates to their dynamic evolution in time.\nUnderstanding how configuration reflects on the coupled behavior in a system of\ndynamic nodes can be of great importance, for example in the context of how the\nbrain connectome is affecting brain function.

In particular it is hard to distinguish between\ngeneric properties and peculiarities due to the abstracted model. Here we\npresent a unified view on pairwise covariances in recurrent networks in the\nirregular regime. We consider the binary neuron model, the leaky\nintegrate-and-fire model, and the Hawkes process. We show that linear\napproximation maps each of these models to either of two classes of linear rate\nmodels, including the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process as a special case. The classes\ndiffer in the location of additive noise in the rate dynamics, which is on the\noutput side for spiking models and on the input side for the binary model. Both\nclasses allow closed form solutions for the covariance. For output noise it\nseparates into an echo term and a term due to correlated input. The unified\nframework enables us to transfer results between models. For example, we\ngeneralize the binary model and the Hawkes process to the presence of\nconduction delays and simplify derivations for established results. Our\napproach is applicable to general network structures and suitable for\npopulation averages. The derived averages are exact for fixed out-degree\nnetwork architectures and approximate for fixed in-degree. We demonstrate how\ntaking into account fluctuations in the linearization procedure increases the\naccuracy of the effective theory and we explain the class dependent differences\nbetween covariances in the time and the frequency domain. Finally we show that\nthe oscillatory instability emerging in networks of integrate-and-fire models\nwith delayed inhibitory feedback is a model-invariant feature: the same\nstructure of poles in the complex frequency plane determines the population\npower spectra.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2013 10:28:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Sep 2013 14:24:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-16", "authors_parsed": [["Grytskyy", "Dmytro", ""], ["Tetzlaff", "Tom", ""], ["Diesmann", "Markus", ""], ["Helias", "Moritz", ""]]}]
