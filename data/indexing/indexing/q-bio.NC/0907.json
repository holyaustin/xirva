Second: the processes that underlie the traffic of electrical signals\nacross these networks that accounts for all the experiences of conscious\nawareness. This paper addresses the former; namely, how the state of the\nbillions of neural networks and the trillions of additional axons, dendrites\nand synapses varies over the daily cycle - what physically changes when we go\nto sleep - what happens when we wake up.

Even for Caenorhabditis elegans,\nwhose neuronal network is relatively small and stereotypical from animal to\nanimal, published wiring diagrams are neither accurate nor complete and\nself-consistent. Using materials from White et al. and new electron micrographs\nwe assemble whole, self-consistent gap junction and chemical synapse networks\nof hermaphrodite C. elegans. We propose a method to visualize the wiring\ndiagram, which reflects network signal flow. We calculate statistical and\ntopological properties of the network, such as degree distributions, synaptic\nmultiplicities, and small-world properties, that help in understanding network\nsignal propagation. We identify neurons that may play central roles in\ninformation processing and network motifs that could serve as functional\nmodules of the network. We explore propagation of neuronal activity in response\nto sensory or artificial stimulation using linear systems theory and find\nseveral activity patterns that could serve as substrates of previously\ndescribed behaviors. Finally, we analyze the interaction between the gap\njunction and the chemical synapse networks. Since several statistical\nproperties of the C. elegans network, such as multiplicity and motif\ndistributions are similar to those found in mammalian neocortex, they likely\npoint to general principles of neuronal networks. The wiring diagram reported\nhere can help in understanding the mechanistic basis of behavior by generating\npredictions about future experiments involving genetic perturbations, laser\nablations, or monitoring propagation of neuronal activity in response to\nstimulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2009 15:06:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2009 15:27:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 22:18:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 11 Jun 2010 16:37:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Varshney", "Lav R.", ""], ["Chen", "Beth L.", ""], ["Paniagua", "Eric", ""], ["Hall", "David H.", ""], ["Chklovskii", "Dmitri B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.2540", "submitter": "Dominique Vuillaume", "authors": "F.

As the underlying model of neuronal dynamics, we use the efficient\nRulkov map with additive noise. We show that increasing the coupling strength\nenhances synchronization monotonously, whereas delay plays a more subtle role.\nIn particular, we found that depending on the inherent oscillation frequency of\nindividual neurons, regions of irregular and regular propagating excitatory\nfronts appear intermittently as the delay increases. These delay-induced\nsynchronization transitions manifest as well-expressed minima in the measure\nfor spatial synchrony, appearing at every multiple of the oscillation\nfrequency. Larger coupling strengths or average degrees can broaden the region\nof regular propagating fronts by a given information transmission delay and\nfurther improve synchronization.

Can this hypothesis apply also to spatial representations, as\ndescribed by recent neurophysiological recordings in rats?
