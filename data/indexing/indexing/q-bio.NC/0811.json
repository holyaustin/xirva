A State Transition between levels entails\nchanges of scale of observables and, concurrently, new formats of description\nat reduced dimensionality. It is here suggested that this principle can be\napplied to the hierarchic structure of the Nervous system, whereby the\nrelations between different levels of its functional organization can be viewed\nas successions of State Transitions. Upon State Transition, the lower level\npresents to the higher level an abstraction of itself, at reduced\ndimensionality and at a coarser scale. The re-scaling in the State Transitions\nis associated with new objects of description, displays new properties and\nobeys new laws, commensurate to the new scale. To illustrate this process, some\naspects of the neural events thought to be associated with Cognition and\nConsciousness are discussed. However, the intent is here also more general in\nthat State Transitions between all levels of organization are proposed as the\nmechanisms by which successively higher levels of organization emerge from\nlower levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Nov 2008 15:44:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Werner", "Gerhard", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.0903", "submitter": "Yasser Roudi", "authors": "Yasser Roudi, Sheila Nirenberg, Peter Latham", "title": "Pairwise maximum entropy models for studying large biological systems:\n  when they can and when they can't work", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000380", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the most critical problems we face in the study of biological systems\nis building accurate statistical descriptions of them. This problem has been\nparticularly challenging because biological systems typically contain large\nnumbers of interacting elements, which precludes the use of standard brute\nforce approaches. Recently, though, several groups have reported that there may\nbe an alternate strategy. The reports show that reliable statistical models can\nbe built without knowledge of all the interactions in a system; instead,\npairwise interactions can suffice. These findings, however, are based on the\nanalysis of small subsystems. Here we ask whether the observations will\ngeneralize to systems of realistic size, that is, whether pairwise models will\nprovide reliable descriptions of true biological systems. Our results show\nthat, in most cases, they will not. The reason is that there is a crossover in\nthe predictive power of pairwise models: If the size of the subsystem is below\nthe crossover point, then the results have no predictive power for large\nsystems. If the size is above the crossover point, the results do have\npredictive power. This work thus provides a general framework for determining\nthe extent to which pairwise models can be used to predict the behavior of\nwhole biological systems. Applied to neural data, the size of most systems\nstudied so far is below the crossover point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 6 Nov 2008 09:32:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Roudi", "Yasser", ""], ["Nirenberg", "Sheila", ""], ["Latham", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.1826", "submitter": "Yoram Burak", "authors": "Yoram Burak and Ila R.

However, in previous models\nsuggested for grid cell activity, errors accumulate rapidly in the integration\nof velocity inputs. To produce grid-cell like responses, these models would\nrequire frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues, casting doubt on\nthe dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the\naccuracy of path integration in continuous attractor models of grid cell\nactivity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor\nmodels can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that\nencode only the rat's velocity and heading. We consider the role of the network\nboundary in integration performance, and show that both periodic and aperiodic\nnetworks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important\ndifferences in their attractor manifolds. We show that the rate at which errors\naccumulate in the integration of velocity depends on the network's organization\nand size, and on the intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range\nof parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model can accurately\nintegrate velocity inputs over a maximum of ~10-100 m and ~1-10 minutes. These\nfindings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may\nunderlie velocity integration in dMEC. The simulations also generate pertinent\nupper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous\nattractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the\ncontinuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single\ncells establish their responses independently of each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Nov 2008 06:42:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 4 Dec 2008 20:41:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 20 Feb 2009 20:46:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Burak", "Yoram", ""], ["Fiete", "Ila R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.2551", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Liane Gabora", "title": "Modeling Cultural Dynamics", "comments": "8 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1005.1516", "journal-ref": "In A.

Diversity of actions is positively correlated with population size and\ndensity, and with barriers between populations. Slowly eroding borders increase\nfitness without sacrificing diversity by fostering specialization followed by\nsharing of fit actions. Introducing a leader that broadcasts its actions\nthroughout the population increases the fitness of actions but reduces\ndiversity of actions.
