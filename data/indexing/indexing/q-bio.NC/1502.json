Here we characterize the\ninformation flow through a complete sensorimotor circuit: from stimulus, to\nsensory neurons, to interneurons, to motor neurons, to muscles, to motion.\nSpecifically, we apply a recently developed framework for quantifying\ninformation flow to a previously published ensemble of models of salt\nklinotaxis in the nematode worm C. elegans. The models are grounded in the\nneuroanatomy and currently known neurophysiology of the worm. The unknown model\nparameters were optimized to reproduce the worm's behavior. Information flow\nanalysis reveals several key principles underlying how the models operate: (1)\nInterneuron class AIY is responsible for integrating information about positive\nand negative changes in concentration, and exhibits a strong left/right\ninformation asymmetry. (2) Gap junctions play a crucial role in the transfer of\ninformation responsible for the information symmetry observed in interneuron\nclass AIZ. (3) Neck motor neuron class SMB implements an information gating\nmechanism that underlies the circuit's state-dependent response. (4) The neck\ncarries non-uniform distribution about changes in concentration. Thus, not all\ndirections of movement are equally informative. Each of these findings\ncorresponds to an experimental prediction that could be tested in the worm to\ngreatly refine our understanding of the neural circuit underlying klinotaxis.\nInformation flow analysis also allows us to explore how information flow\nrelates to underlying electrophysiology. Despite large variations in the neural\nparameters of individual circuits, the overall information flow architecture\ncircuit is remarkably consistent across the ensemble, suggesting that\ninformation flow analysis captures general principles of operation for the\nklinotaxis circuit.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 15 Feb 2015 00:19:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-15", "authors_parsed": [["Izquierdo", "Eduardo J.", ""], ["Williams", "Paul L.", ""], ["Beer", "Randall D.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.04295", "submitter": "Wilhelm Stannat", "authors": "Martin Sauer and Wilhelm Stannat", "title": "Reliability of signal transmission in stochastic nerve axon equations", "comments": "9 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "J Comput Neurosci, vol. 40, pp. 103-111, 2016", "doi": "10.1007/s10827-015-0586-0", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC math.DS math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a method for computing probabilities for spontaneous activity\nand propagation fail- ure of the action potential in spatially extended,\nconductance-based neuronal models subject to channel noise, based on\nstatistical properties of the membrane potential.

However, while neurophysiologists have long been able to record\nthe responses of neurons in awake, behaving animals, it is another matter\nentirely to say what a given neuron does. A key problem is that in many sensory\ndomains, the space of all possible stimuli that one might encounter is\neffectively infinite; in vision, for instance, natural scenes are\ncombinatorially complex, and an organism will only encounter a tiny fraction of\npossible stimuli. As a result, even describing the response properties of\nsensory neurons is difficult, and investigations of neuronal functions are\nalmost always critically limited by the number of stimuli that can be\nconsidered. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop, optimization-based\nexperimental framework for characterizing the response properties of sensory\nneurons, building on past efforts in closed-loop experimental methods, and\nleveraging recent advances in artificial neural networks to serve as as a\nproving ground for our techniques.

For a simulated balanced random network of 1000 neurons,\nsynaptic connectivity is recovered with a misclassification error rate of less\nthan 1% under ideal conditions. We show that the error rate remains low in a\nseries of example cases under progressively less ideal conditions.

These features make this class a good candidate to describe the\ntime evolution of networks of spiking neurons. In this article we present a\ncritical reader's guide to recent papers dealing with this class of models,\nboth in discrete and in continuous time. We briefly sketch results concerning\nperfect simulation and existence issues, de-correlation between successive\ninterspike intervals, the longtime behavior of finite non-excited systems and\npropagation of chaos in mean field systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 14:41:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Galves", "A.", ""], ["L\u00f6cherbach", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06659", "submitter": "Somwrita Sarkar", "authors": "Somwrita Sarkar, Sanjay Chawla and Donna Xu", "title": "On inferring structural connectivity from brain functional-MRI data", "comments": "10 pages, 6 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The anatomical structure of the brain can be observed via non-invasive\ntechniques such as diffusion imaging. However, these are imperfect because they\nmiss connections that are actually known to exist, especially long range\ninter-hemispheric ones. In this paper we formulate the inverse problem of\ninferring the structural connectivity of brain networks from experimentally\nobserved functional connectivity via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI), by formulating it as a convex optimization problem. We show that\nstructural connectivity can be modeled as an optimal sparse representation\nderived from the much denser functional connectivity in the human brain. Using\nonly the functional connectivity data as input, we present (a) an optimization\nproblem that models constraints based on known physiological observations, and\n(b) an ADMM algorithm for solving it. The algorithm not only recovers the known\nstructural connectivity of the brain, but is also able to robustly predict the\nlong range inter-hemispheric connections missed by DSI or DTI, including a very\ngood match with experimentally observed quantitative distributions of the\nweights/strength of anatomical connections. We demonstrate results on both\nsynthetic model data and a fine-scale 998 node cortical dataset, and discuss\napplications to other complex network domains where retrieving effective\nstructure from functional signatures are important.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 00:20:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Sarkar", "Somwrita", ""], ["Chawla", "Sanjay", ""], ["Xu", "Donna", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.07009", "submitter": "Edward Frady", "authors": "E.

Measurements of heat changes during the action potential\nsuggest that the nerve pulse shares many characteristics with an adiabatic\npulse. First experiments in the 1980s suggested small changes in nerve\nthickness and length during the action potential. Such findings have led to the\nsuggestion that the action potential may be related to electromechanical\nsolitons traveling without dissipation. However, they have been no modern\nattempts to study mechanical phenomena in nerves. Here, we present\nultrasensitive AFM recordings of mechanical changes on the order of 2 - 12\n{\\AA} in the giant axons of the lobster. We show that the nerve thickness\nchanges in phase with voltage change. When stimulated at opposite ends of the\nsame axon, colliding action potentials pass through one another and do not\nannihilate.

All results are then exact rather than approximate, and as a\nconsequence, the $p$-values obtained are the theoretically best possible for\nthe available data and test statistic.
