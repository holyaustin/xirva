We prove that the STA is proportional to the\nderivative of the PRC. We compare these analytic results to numerical\ncalculations for the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron and we apply the method to neurons\nin the olfactory bulb of mice. This observation allows us to relate the\nstimulus-response properties of a neuron to its dynamics, bridging the gap\nbetween dynamical and information theoretic approaches to understanding brain\ncomputations and facilitating the interpretation of changes in channels and\nother cellular properties as influencing the representation of stimuli.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2007 14:56:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2007 18:49:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ermentrout", "G.

Here, we study a neurobiologically plausible on-line learning\nalgorithm that derives from Belief Propagation algorithms. We show that it\nperforms remarkably well in a model neuron with binary synapses, and a finite\nnumber of `hidden' states per synapse, that has to learn a random\nclassification task. Such system is able to learn a number of associations\nclose to the theoretical limit, in time which is sublinear in system size. This\nis to our knowledge the first on-line algorithm that is able to achieve\nefficiently a finite number of patterns learned per binary synapse.\nFurthermore, we show that performance is optimal for a finite number of hidden\nstates which becomes very small for sparse coding. The algorithm is similar to\nthe standard `perceptron' learning algorithm, with an additional rule for\nsynaptic transitions which occur only if a currently presented pattern is\n`barely correct'. In this case, the synaptic changes are meta-plastic only\n(change in hidden states and not in actual synaptic state), stabilizing the\nsynapse in its current state. Finally, we show that a system with two visible\nstates and K hidden states is much more robust to noise than a system with K\nvisible states. We suggest this rule is sufficiently simple to be easily\nimplemented by neurobiological systems or in hardware.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2007 16:23:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Baldassi", "Carlo", ""], ["Braunstein", "Alfredo", ""], ["Brunel", "Nicolas", ""], ["Zecchina", "Riccardo", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.4418", "submitter": "Juergen Jost", "authors": "Boris S.

We show that the\nleaders carry information about the identity of the burst, as measured by the\nsignature of the number of spikes per neuron in a burst. The number of spikes\nfrom leaders in the first few spikes of a precursor event is furthermore shown\nto be predictive with regard to the transition into a burst (pre-burst versus\nsmall event). We conclude that the leaders play a r\\^ole in the development of\nthe bursts, and conjecture that they are part of an underlying sub-network that\nis excited first and then act as nucleation centers for the burst.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2007 21:14:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-19", "authors_parsed": [["Eckmann", "Jean-Pierre", ""], ["Jacobi", "Shimshon", ""], ["Marom", "Shimon", ""], ["Moses", "Elisha", ""], ["Zbinden", "Cyrille", ""]]}]
