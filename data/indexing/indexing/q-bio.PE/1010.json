At the core of the argument lies\nthe observation that specialist plants, otherwise candidates to extinction,\ncould cope with the disruption thanks to their interaction with generalist\npollinators. We present a theoretical framework that supports this thesis. We\nanalyze a dynamical model of a system of mutualistic plants and pollinators,\nsubject to the destruction of their habitat. We analyze and compare two\nfamilies of interaction topologies, ranging from highly assortative to highly\ndisassortative ones, as well as real pollination networks. We found that\nseveral features observed in natural systems are predicted by the mathematical\nmodel. First, there is a tendency to increase the asymmetry of the network as a\nresult of the extinctions. Second, an entropy measure of the differential\nsusceptibility to extinction of specialist and generalist species show that\nthey tend to balance when the network is disassortative. Finally, the\ndisappearance of links in the network, as a result of extinctions, shows that\nspecialist plants preserve more connections than the corresponding plants in an\nassortative system, enabling them to resist the disruption.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Oct 2010 19:32:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Abramson", "Guillermo", ""], ["Soto", "Claudia A.

Although the plant response to\nenvironmental stresses is characterized by both architectural and functional\nplasticity, recent attempts to integrate biological knowledge into genetics\nmodels have mainly concerned specific physiological processes or crop models\nwithout architecture, and thus may prove limited when studying genotype x\nenvironment interactions. Consequently, this paper presents a simulation study\nintroducing genetics into a functional-structural growth model, which gives\naccess to more fundamental traits for quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection\nand thus to promising tools for yield optimization. Methods: The GreenLab model\nwas selected as a reasonable choice to link growth model parameters to QTL.\nVirtual genes and virtual chromosomes were defined to build a simple genetic\nmodel that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model.\nThe QTL Cartographer software was used to study QTL detection of simulated\nplant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotype for\nyield maximization based on the model parameters and the associated allelic\ncombination. Key Results and Conclusions: By keeping the environmental factors\nconstant and using a virtual population with a large number of individuals\ngenerated by a Mendelian genetic model, results for an ideal case could be\nsimulated. Virtual QTL detection was compared in the case of phenotypic traits\n- such as cob weight - and when traits were model parameters, and was found to\nbe more accurate in the latter case. The practical interest of this approach is\nillustrated by calculating the parameters (and the corresponding genotype)\nassociated with yield optimization of a GreenLab maize model. The paper\ndiscusses the potentials of GreenLab to represent environment x genotype\ninteractions, in particular through its main state variable, the ratio of\nbiomass supply over demand.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Oct 2010 19:03:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Letort", "Veronique", "", "MAS"], ["Mahe", "Paul", "", "MAS"], ["Courn\u00e8de", "Paul-Henry", "", "MAS"], ["De Reffye", "Philippe", "", "CIRAD"], ["Courtois", "Brigitte", "", "DAP"]]}, {"id": "1010.5478", "submitter": "Thilo Gross", "authors": "{\\AA}ke Br\\\"annstr\\\"om, Thilo Gross, Bernd Blasius, and Ulf Dieckmann", "title": "Consequences of fluctuating group size for the evolution of cooperation", "comments": "22 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Studies of cooperation have traditionally focused on discrete games such as\nthe well-known prisoner's dilemma, in which players choose between two pure\nstrategies: cooperation and defection. Increasingly, however, cooperation is\nbeing studied in continuous games that feature a continuum of strategies\ndetermining the level of cooperative investment. For the continuous snowdrift\ngame, it has been shown that a gradually evolving monomorphic population may\nundergo evolutionary branching, resulting in the emergence of a defector\nstrategy that coexists with a cooperator strategy. This phenomenon has been\ndubbed the 'tragedy of the commune'. Here we study the effects of fluctuating\ngroup size on the tragedy of the commune and derive analytical conditions for\nevolutionary branching. Our results show that the effects of fluctuating group\nsize on evolutionary dynamics critically depend on the structure of payoff\nfunctions. For games with additively separable benefits and costs, fluctuations\nin group size make evolutionary branching less likely, and sufficiently large\nfluctuations in group size can always turn an evolutionary branching point into\na locally evolutionarily stable strategy. For games with multiplicatively\nseparable benefits and costs, fluctuations in group size can either prevent or\ninduce the tragedy of the commune. For games with general interactions between\nbenefits and costs, we derive a general classification scheme based on second\nderivatives of the payoff function, to elucidate when fluctuations in group\nsize help or hinder cooperation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Oct 2010 18:47:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-10-27", "authors_parsed": [["Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m", "\u00c5ke", ""], ["Gross", "Thilo", ""], ["Blasius", "Bernd", ""], ["Dieckmann", "Ulf", ""]]}]
