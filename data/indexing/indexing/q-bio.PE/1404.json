Facilitators are here mirrors to their neighbors\n-- they cooperate with cooperators and defect with defectors -- but they do not\nparticipate in the exchange of strategies. As such, in addition to introducing\ndirect reciprocity, they also obstruct information exchange. In well-mixed\npopulations, facilitators favor the replacement and invasion of defection by\ncooperation as long as their number exceeds a critical value. In structured\npopulations, on the other hand, there exists a delicate balance between the\nbenefits of reciprocity and the deterioration of information exchange.\nExtensive Monte Carlo simulations of social dilemmas on various interaction\nnetworks reveal that there exists an optimal interplay between reciprocity and\ninformation exchange, which sets in only when a small number of facilitators\noccupies the main hubs of the scale-free network. The drawbacks of missing\ncooperative hubs are more than compensated by reciprocity and, at the same\ntime, the compromised information exchange is routed via the auxiliary hubs\nwith only marginal losses in effectivity.

We show that majority rule is accurate precisely when the ratio of the\nbirth (speciation) rate of the Yule process to the substitution rate exceeds\nthe value $4$. By contrast, maximum parsimony has been shown to be accurate\nonly when this ratio is at least 6. Our proof relies on a second moment\ncalculation, coupling, and a novel application of a reflection principle.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 03:43:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-11", "authors_parsed": [["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Steel", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.2685", "submitter": "Tatiana T.

Here we consider a three-state model with the\ncompartments: A, B and Dead. States A and B may be the states of any\ndichotomous variable, for example, Healthy and Ill, respectively. The\ntransitions between the states are described by change rates (or synonymously:\ndensities), which depend on calendar time and on age. So far, a rigorous\nmathematical calculation of the prevalence of property B has been difficult,\nwhich has limited the use of the model in epidemiology and public health.\n  Methods: We develop an equation that simplifies the use of the three-state\nmodel. To demonstrate the broad applicability and the validity of the equation,\nit is applied to simulated data and real world data from different\nhealth-related topics.\n  Results: The three-state model is governed by a partial differential equation\n(PDE) that links the prevalence with the change rates between the states. The\nvalidity of the PDE has been shown in two simulation studies, one about a\nhypothetical chronic disease and one about dementia. In two further\napplications, the equation may provide insights into smoking behaviour of males\nin Germany and the knowledge about the ovulatory cycle in Egyptian women.\n  Conclusions: We have found a simple equation that links the prevalence of a\ndichotomous variable with the transmission rates in the three-state model. The\nequation has a broad applicability in epidemiology and public health. Examples\nare the estimation of incidence rates from cross-sectional surveys, the\nprediction of the future prevalence of chronic diseases, and planning of\ninterventions against risky behaviour (e.g., smoking).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Apr 2014 05:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Brinks", "Ralph", ""]]}, {"id": "1404.7723", "submitter": "Amir Szitenberg", "authors": "Amir Szitenberg, Georgios Koutsovoulos, Mark L Blaxter and David H\n  Lunt", "title": "The evolution of tyrosine-recombinase elements in Nematoda", "comments": "18 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0106630", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transposable elements can be categorised into DNA and RNA elements based on\ntheir mechanism of transposition. Tyrosine recombinase elements (YREs) are\nrelatively rare and poorly understood, despite sharing characteristics with\nboth DNA and RNA elements. Previously, the Nematoda have been reported to have\na substantially different diversity of YREs compared to other animal phyla: the\nDirs1-like YRE retrotransposon was encountered in most animal phyla but not in\nNematoda, and a unique Pat1-like YRE retrotransposon has only been recorded\nfrom Nematoda. We explored the diversity of YREs in Nematoda by sampling\nbroadly across the phylum and including 34 genomes representing the three\nclasses within Nematoda. We developed a method to isolate and classify YREs\nbased on both feature organization and phylogenetic relationships in an open\nand reproducible workflow. We also ensured that our phylogenetic approach to\nYRE classification identified truncated and degenerate elements, informatively\nincreasing the number of elements sampled. We identified Dirs1-like elements\n(thought to be absent from Nematoda) in the nematode classes Enoplia and\nDorylaimia indicating that nematode model species do not adequately represent\nthe diversity of transposable elements in the phylum. Nematode Pat1-like\nelements were found to be a derived form of another pat1-like element that is\npresent more widely in animals. Several sequence features used widely for the\nclassification of YREs were found to be homoplasious, highlighting the need for\na phylogenetically-based classification scheme.

Both theory and simulations of\ncurrent models predict the onset of instability with growing size and\ncomplexity, so for decades it has been conjectured that ecosystems must have\nsome unidentified structural property exempting them from this outcome.

Furthermore, we prove\nthat a maximally coherent network with constant interaction strengths will\nalways be linearly stable. We also propose a simple model which, by correctly\ncapturing the trophic coherence of food webs, accurately reproduces their\nstability and other basic structural features. Most remarkably, our model shows\nthat stability can increase with size and complexity.

Introgressions from other archaic hominins were also implicated,\nhowever, identification of which poses a great technical challenge. Here, we\nintroduced an approach in identifying introgressions from all possible archaic\nhominins in Eurasian genomes, without referring to archaic hominin sequences.\nWe focused on mutations emerged in archaic hominins after their divergence from\nmodern humans (denoted as archaic-specific mutations), and identified\nintrogressive segments which showed significant enrichment of archaic-specific\nmutations over the rest of the genome. Furthermore, boundaries of\nintrogressions were identified using a dynamic programming approach to\npartition whole genome into segments which contained different levels of\narchaic-specific mutations. We found that detected introgressions shared more\narchaic-specific mutations with Altai Neanderthal than they shared with\nDenisovan, and 60.3% of archaic hominin introgressions were from Neanderthals.\nFurthermore, we detected more introgressions from two unknown archaic hominins\nwhom diverged with modern humans approximately 859 and 3,464 thousand years\nago. The latter unknown archaic hominin contributed to the genomes of the\ncommon ancestors of modern humans and Neanderthals. In total, archaic hominin\nintrogressions comprised 2.4% of Eurasian genomes.
