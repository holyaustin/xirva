We\npresent a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of\nprotein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of\ngenetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth\nrate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein\nconcentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the\ncorrelation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the\naverage concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the\ngrowth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate.\nHowever, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the\noptimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even\nwhen the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration.\nThe model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity,\nsuch as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not\nequal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its\ndescendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene\nregulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of\na gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of\nsynthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the\nfluctuations in the expression of its target gene. We discuss possible\nexperiments that could test our predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Nov 2007 03:52:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 4 May 2008 02:42:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Tanase-Nicola", "Sorin", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "0711.3852", "submitter": "Jean Bertoin", "authors": "Jean Bertoin (DMA, Pma)", "title": "The structure of the allelic partition of the total population for\n  Galton-Watson processes with neutral mutations", "comments": "This version corrects a significant mistake in the first one", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a (sub) critical Galton-Watson process with neutral mutations\n(infinite alleles model), and decompose the entire population into clusters of\nindividuals carrying the same allele.

The genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms\nand its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. The slippery inner\nsurfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far\nbeen considered as the key trapping devices. However, the occurrence of species\nlacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects\nsuggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. Methodology/Principal\nFindings : Using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and\nrheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of Nepenthes\nrafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial\nfor the retention of insects in its traps. Trapping efficiency is shown to\nremain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the\nelastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of\ninsect movements. Conclusions/Significance : This finding challenges the common\nclassification of Nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great\nadaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to\nhigh rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. The viscoelastic trap\nconstitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of Nepenthes\nspecies and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the\nsundew (Drosera) flypaper plants. Such large production of a highly\nviscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the\nplant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Nov 2007 14:07:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gaume", "Laurence", "", "AMAP"], ["Forterre", "Yo\u00ebl", "", "IUSTI"]]}, {"id": "0711.4887", "submitter": "Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "authors": "Vasils Hatzopoulos and Henrik Jeldtoft Jensen", "title": "The prisoners dilemma on a stochastic non-growth network evolution model", "comments": "8 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.78.011904", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.OT", "license": null, "abstract": "  We investigate the evolution of cooperation on a non - growth network model\nwith death/birth dynamics.
