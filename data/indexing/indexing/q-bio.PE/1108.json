In particular,\nwhile increasing values of $p$ promote biodiversity, they may act detrimental\non spatial pattern formation. For random initial conditions, we observe a phase\ntransition from biodiversity to an absorbing phase, whereby the critical value\nof mobility grows linearly with increasing values of $p$ on a log-log scale,\nbut then saturates as $p$ becomes large.

We then obtain the\nrelationship between the similarity parameters under the assumptions of (i)\nthat the ecosystem is in a dynamically balanced steady state and (ii) that\nthese functional groups are connected to each other by the flow of resource.\nThe expression that we obtain relates the level of complexity that the\necosystem can support to intrinsic macroscopic variables such as density,\ndiversity and characteristic length scales for foraging or dispersal, and\nextrinsic macroscopic variables such as habitat size and the rate of supply of\nresource. This expression relates these macroscopic variables to each other,\ngenerating commonly observed macroecological patterns; these broad trends\nsimply reflect the similarity property of ecosystems. We thus find that details\nof the ecosystem function are not required to obtain these broad\nmacroecological patterns this may explain why they are ubiquitous. Departures\nfrom our relationship may indicate that the ecosystem is in a state of rapid\nchange, i.e., abundance or diversity explosion or collapse. Our result provides\nnormalised variables that can be used to isolate the trend in one ecosystem\nvariable from another, providing a new method for isolating macroecological\npatterns in data. A dimensionless control parameter for ecosystem complexity\nemerges from our analysis and this will be a control parameter in dynamical\nmodels for ecosystems based on energy flow and conservation and will order the\nemergent behaviour of these models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2011 10:47:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 9 May 2013 12:12:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Chapman", "S.

Traveling-wave solutions to these PDEs are typically\nconcentrated on velocities and their dependence on the various parameters. Most\nof the investigations into the dynamical interaction of virus and defective\ninterfering particles (DIP), which are incomplete forms of the virus that\nreplicate through co-infection, have followed the same lines. In this work we\npresent an agent based model of viral infection with consideration of DIP and\nthe negative feedback loop introduced by interferon production as part of the\nhost innate immune response. The model is based high resolution microscopic\nimages of plaques of dead cells we took from mammalian cells infected with\nSendai virus with low and high DIP. In order to investigate the effects of the\ndiscrete stochastic microscopic mechanisms, which are responsible for virus\nspreading, have on the macroscopic growth of viral plaques, we generate an\nagent-based model of viral infection. The two main aims of this work are to (i)\ninvestigate the effects of discrete microscopic randomness on the macroscopic\ngrowth of viral plaques; and (ii) examine the dynamic interactions between the\nfull length virus, DIP and interferon, and interpret what may be the function\nof DIP. We find that we can explain the qualitative differences between our\nstochastic model and deterministic models in terms of the fractal geometry of\nthe resulting plaques, and that DIP have a delaying effect while the\ninteraction between interferon and DIP has a slowing effect on the growth of\nviral plaques, potentially contributing to viral latency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2011 18:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Clark", "Neil R.", ""], ["Tapia", "Karla A.", ""], ["Dandapani", "Aditi", ""], ["MacArthur", "Benjamin D.", ""], ["Lopez", "Carolina", ""], ["Ma`ayan", "Avi", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4950", "submitter": "Michele Bellingeri", "authors": "Simone Vincenzi and Michele Bellingeri", "title": "Consequences of catastrophic disturbances on population persistence and\n  adaptations", "comments": "22 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The intensification and increased frequency of weather extremes is emerging\nas one of the most important aspects of climate change.
