The isotopic composition of a consumer is a product of these factors as\nwell as the isotopic 'landscape' of its prey, i.e. the isotopic mixing space.\nHere we build a mechanistic framework that links the ecological and\nphysiological processes of an individual consumer to the isotopic distribution\nthat describes its diet, and ultimately to the isotopic composition of its own\ntissues, defined as its 'isotopic niche'. By coupling these processes, we\nsystematically investigate under what conditions the isotopic niche of a\nconsumer changes as a function of both the geometric properties of its mixing\nspace and foraging strategies that may be static or dynamic over time. Results\nof our derivations reveal general insight into the conditions impacting\nisotopic niche width as a function of consumer specialization on prey, as well\nas the consumer's ability to transition between diets over time. We show\nanalytically that moderate specialization on isotopically unique prey can serve\nto maximize a consumer's isotopic niche width, while temporally dynamic diets\nwill tend to result in peak isotopic variance during dietary transitions. We\ndemonstrate the relevance of our theoretical findings by examining a marine\nsystem composed of nine invertebrate species commonly consumed by sea otters.\nIn general, our analytical framework highlights the complex interplay of mixing\nspace geometry and consumer dietary behavior in driving expansion and\ncontraction of the isotopic niche.

To alleviate this problem, we develop here\nnew methods to compute the sampling probability for variable population size\nfunctions that are piecewise constant.

Examples include sanctioning of individuals who behave prosocially,\nor rewarding of freeriders who do not contribute to collective enterprises. We\ntherefore study the public goods game with antisocial and prosocial pool\nrewarding in order to determine the potential negative consequences on the\neffectiveness of positive incentives to promote cooperation. Contrary to a\nnaive expectation, we show that the ability of defectors to distribute rewards\nto their like does not deter public cooperation as long as cooperators are able\nto do the same. Even in the presence of antisocial rewarding the spatial\nselection for cooperation in evolutionary social dilemmas is enhanced. Since\nthe administration of rewards to either strategy requires a considerable degree\nof aggregation, cooperators can enjoy the benefits of their prosocial\ncontributions as well as the corresponding rewards. Defectors when aggregated,\non the other hand, can enjoy antisocial rewards, but due to their lack of\ncontributions to the public good they ultimately succumb to their inherent\ninability to secure a sustainable future. Strategies that facilitate the\naggregation of akin players, even if they seek to promote antisocial behaviour,\nthus always enhance the long-term benefits of cooperation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 19:27:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-30", "authors_parsed": [["Szolnoki", "Attila", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.08965", "submitter": "Boya Song", "authors": "Linda Ma, Boya Song, Thomas Curran, Nhu Phong, Emilie Dressaire and\n  Marcus Roper", "title": "Defining individual size in the model filamentous fungus\n  $\\textit{Neurospora crassa}$", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is challenging to apply the tenets of individuality to filamentous fungi:\na fungal mycelium can contain millions of genetically diverse but totipotent\nnuclei, each capable of founding new mycelia.

We use the continuous Donation Game as an example, which\nrepresents an instance of the Prisoner's Dilemma that intuitively extends to a\ncontinuous range of cooperation levels. Surprisingly, despite the fact that the\nopponent has infinitely many donation levels from which to choose, a player can\ndevise an autocratic strategy to enforce a linear relationship between his or\nher payoff and that of the opponent even when restricting his or her actions to\nmerely two discrete levels of cooperation. In particular, a player can use such\na strategy to extort an unfair share of the payoffs from the opponent.\nTherefore, although the action space of the continuous Donation Game dwarfs\nthat of the classical Prisoner's Dilemma, players can still devise relatively\nsimple autocratic and, in particular, extortionate strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 01:12:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 13:14:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 17:17:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["McAvoy", "Alex", ""], ["Hauert", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1510.09155", "submitter": "Momoko Hayamizu", "authors": "Momoko Hayamizu, Hiroshi Endo, and Kenji Fukumizu", "title": "A characterization of minimum spanning tree-like metric spaces", "comments": "9 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.DM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recent years have witnessed a surge of biological interest in the minimum\nspanning tree (MST) problem for its relevance to automatic model construction\nusing the distances between data points.
