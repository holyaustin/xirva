Inspired by an\ninsight gained during our study of robustness and stability in phage lambda\ngenetic switch in modern biology, we found that there exists a classification\nof generic nonequilibrium processes: In the continuous description in terms of\nstochastic differential equations, there exists four dynamical elements: the\npotential function $\\phi$, the friction matrix $ S$, the anti-symmetric matrix\n$ T $, and the noise. The generic feature of absence of detailed balance is\nthen precisely represented by $T$. For dynamical near a fixed point, whether or\nnot it is stable or not, the stochastic dynamics is linear. A rather complete\nanalysis has been carried out (Kwon, Ao, Thouless, cond-mat/0506280; PNAS, {\\bf\n102} (2005) 13029), referred to as SDS I. One important and persistent question\nis the existence of a potential function with nonlinear force and with\nmultiplicative noise, with both nice local dynamical and global steady state\nproperties. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical structure built into\nstochastic differential equation allows us to construct such a global\noptimization potential function. First, we provide the construction. One of\nmost important ingredient is the generalized Einstein relation. We then present\nan approximation scheme: The gradient expansion which turns every order into\nlinear matrix equations. The consistent of such methodology with other known\nstochastic treatments will be discussed in next paper, SDS III; and the\nexplicitly connection to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics will be\ndiscussed in a forthcoming paper, SDS IV.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2008 00:22:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ao", "P.", ""]]}]
