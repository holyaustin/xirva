Our algorithm has been made\npublicly available as the program LEV1ATHAN. It combines ideas from several\nknown theoretical algorithms for phylogenetic tree and network reconstruction\nwith two novel subroutines. Namely, an exponential-time exact and a greedy\nalgorithm both of which are of independent theoretical interest. Most\nimportantly, LEV1ATHAN runs in polynomial time and always constructs a level-1\nnetwork. If the data is consistent with a phylogenetic tree, then the algorithm\nconstructs such a tree. Moreover, if the input triplet set is dense and, in\naddition, is fully consistent with some level-1 network, it will find such a\nnetwork. The potential of LEV1ATHAN is explored by means of an extensive\nsimulation study and a biological data set. One of our conclusions is that\nLEV1ATHAN is able to construct networks consistent with a high percentage of\ninput triplets, even when these input triplets are affected by a low to\nmoderate level of noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2009 12:17:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Huber", "Katharina T.", ""], ["van Iersel", "Leo", ""], ["Kelk", "Steven", ""], ["Suchecki", "Radoslaw", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.4150", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc, Gyorgy Szabo", "title": "Phase diagrams for three-strategy evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games\n  on regular graphs", "comments": "7 two-column pages, 8 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E", "journal-ref": "Phys.

So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic\npopulation dynamics have received little attention. In particular, tuning and\ntesting of allometric models on empirical data and regressions has not been\ncarried out yet. Here, oscillations expected from a one-species (delayed\nlogistic) and a two-species (Rosenzweig-MacArthur) model were compared to\ncycles observed in laboratory experiments and field surveys for a wide range of\ninvertebrates and vertebrates. The parameters in the equations were linked to\nbody mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was\ncalibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by\nthe models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The\ncollected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body\nmass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of\naquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by\nthe two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent\nfor predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of\n4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a\nsize-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores\nand the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter\nspace for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,\namplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation\nperiods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from\nthe models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and\ndensity parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable\nestimate of independently measured cycle times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 08:25:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hendriks", "A.
