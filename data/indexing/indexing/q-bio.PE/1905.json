In this manuscript, the role of official social network\nperturbations generated by public health officials to slow down or stop a\ndisease outbreak are studied over distinct classes of static social networks.\nThe dynamics are stochastic in nature with individuals (nodes) being assigned\nfixed levels of education or wealth. Nodes may change their epidemiological\nstatus from susceptible, to infected and to recovered. Most importantly, it is\nassumed that when the prevalence reaches a pre-determined threshold level, P*,\ninformation, called awareness in our framework, starts to spread, a process\ntriggered by public health authorities. Information is assumed to spread over\nthe same static network and whether or not one becomes a temporary informer, is\na function of his/her level of education or wealth and epidemiological status.\nStochastic simulations show that threshold selection P* and the value of the\naverage basic reproduction number impact the final epidemic size\ndifferentially.

Cost and\nbenefit are non-linear functions of the PG production. The analysis of\nevolutionary stability yields an optimization problem for the expression of PG\nin dependency on the number of QS individuals within a colony.

Interestingly, at the level of the individual cell, the\nQS response is determined by the shape of the costs. All QS individuals respond\neither homogeneously if cost are a convex function of the PG production rate,\nor they respond heterogeneously with distinct ON/OFF responses if the costs are\nconcave. The latter finding is consistent with recent experimental findings,\nand contradicts the usual interpretation of QS as a mechanism to establish a\nuniform, synchronized response of a bacterial population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2019 14:47:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Hense", "Burkhard A.", ""], ["McIntosh", "Matthew", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Johannes", ""], ["Schuster", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1905.00592", "submitter": "Andrzej Jarynowski", "authors": "Andrzej Jarynowski, Vitaly Belik", "title": "Modeling the ASF (African Swine Fever) spread till summer 2017 and risk\n  assessment for Poland", "comments": "conference proceedings", "journal-ref": "Katedra Matematyki Uniwersytetu Przyrodniczego we Wroclawiu,XLVII\n  SEMINARIUM ZASTOSOWAN MATEMATYKI, Kobyla Gora 11 wrzesnia 2017", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE nlin.AO stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  African Swine Fever (ASF) is viral infection which causes acute disease in\ndomestic pigs and wild boar.
