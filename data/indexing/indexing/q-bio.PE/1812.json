Although many studies have revealed the\ndynamics of various collective behaviours, their main focus was on the\ninformation process inside the collective, not on the whole system itself. For\nexample, the qualitative difference between two elements and three elements as\na system has rarely been investigated. Tononi et al. have proposed Integrated\nInformation Theory (IIT) to measure the degree of consciousness $\\Phi$. IIT\npostulates that the amount of information loss caused by certain partitions is\nequivalent to the degree of information integration in the system. This measure\nis not only useful for estimating the degree of consciousness but can also be\napplied to more general network systems.

Under this control mode, global convergence towards\nthe mosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of sufficient condition\nthat relates the size and frequency of releases.

Under this control mode, global convergence to the\nmosquito-free equilibrium is proved on the grounds of another sufficient\ncondition that relates not only the size and frequency of periodic releases but\nalso the frequency of sparse measurements taken on wild populations.

A particular aspect of longevity addressed in this paper is the\ndifference in average observed duration of life for female and male population,\ncalled observed lifespan differential. Using the data from Human Mortality\nDatabase, the dynamics of the observed lifespan differential is studied for a\nlarge number of countries worldwide from 1960 to 2014. An interesting\nphenomenon that the growing trend of the observed lifespan differential at the\nbeginning of the studied interval does not persist, i.e. that it reverts to\nstagnation or even decline is revealed for a large majority of countries in the\ndataset. In a number of case studies, a strong association of lifespan dynamic\nwith disruptive events such as wars, dissolutions or integrations of states or\npolicy measures is demonstrated. Finally, a novel method of calculating the\nobserved lifespan differential of a population from mortality indicators of its\nsubpopulations is introduced and applied to the analysis of the observed\nlifespan differential in Israel from 1990 to 2000.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Dec 2018 09:34:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 May 2019 16:14:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Cosic", "Toni", ""], ["Misetic", "Roko", ""], ["Stefancic", "Hrvoje", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.08357", "submitter": "Sebastian Roch", "authors": "Sebastien Roch", "title": "On the variance of internode distance under the multispecies coalescent", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "RECOMB-CG 2018", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.CE math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the problem of estimating species trees from unrooted gene tree\ntopologies in the presence of incomplete lineage sorting, a common phenomenon\nthat creates gene tree heterogeneity in multilocus datasets.

Despite the age-old concern that unchecked population and\neconomic growth may be unsustainable, the prospect of societal collapse remains\ncontentious today. Contrasting with the usual approach to modeling human-nature\ninteractions, which are based on the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model with\nhumans as the predators and nature as the prey, here we address this issue\nusing a discrete-time population dynamics model of ecosystem engineers. The\ngrowth of the population of engineers is modeled by the Beverton-Holt equation\nwith a density-dependent carrying capacity that is proportional to the number\nof usable habitats. These habitats (e.g., farms) are the products of the work\nof the individuals on the virgin habitats (e.g., native forests), hence the\ndenomination engineers of ecosystems to those agents. The human-made habitats\ndecay into degraded habitats, which eventually regenerate into virgin habitats.\nFor slow regeneration resources, we find that the dynamics is dominated by\ncycles of prosperity and collapse, in which the population reaches vanishing\nsmall densities. However, increase of the efficiency of the engineers to\nexplore the resources eliminates the dangerous cyclical patterns of feast and\nfamine and leads to a stable equilibrium that balances population growth and\nresource availability. This finding supports the viewpoint of growth optimists\nthat technological progress may avoid collapse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2018 17:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-26", "authors_parsed": [["Lopes", "Guilherme M.", ""], ["Fontanari", "Jos\u00e9 F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1812.11184", "submitter": "Carl Boettiger", "authors": "Milad Memarzadeh, Carl Boettiger", "title": "Resolving the measurement uncertainty paradox in ecological management", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Ecological management and decision-making typically focus on uncertainty\nabout the future, but surprisingly little is known about how to account for\nuncertainty of the present: that is, the realities of having only partial or\nimperfect measurements. Our primary paradigms for handling decisions under\nuncertainty -- the precautionary principle and optimal control -- have so far\ngiven contradictory results. This paradox is best illustrated in the example of\nfisheries management, where many ideas that guide thinking about ecological\ndecision making were first developed. We find that simplistic optimal control\napproaches have repeatedly concluded that a manager should increase catch\nquotas when faced with greater uncertainty about the fish biomass. Current best\npractices take a more precautionary approach, decreasing catch quotas by a\nfixed amount to account for uncertainty. Using comparisons to both simulated\nand historical catch data, we find that neither approach is sufficient to avoid\nstock collapses under moderate observational uncertainty. Using partially\nobserved Markov decision process (POMDP) methods, we demonstrate how this\nparadox arises from flaws in the standard theory, which contributes to\nover-exploitation of fisheries and increased probability of economic and\necological collapse. In contrast, we find POMDP-based management avoids such\nover-exploitation while also generating higher economic value. These results\nhave significant implications for how we handle uncertainty in both fisheries\nand ecological management more generally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2018 18:07:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Memarzadeh", "Milad", ""], ["Boettiger", "Carl", ""]]}]
