These models suggest that the unique features of\nEarth are closely connected with its unique U and Th migration models and\ndistribution patterns. In the Earth, U and Th can combine with oxidative\nvolatile components and water, migrate up to the asthenosphere position to form\nan enrichment zone (EZ) of U and Th first, and then migrate up further to the\ncrusts through magmatism and metamorphism.

The heat-producing elements, currently\nmainly U and Th, in the EZ are also the energy sources that drive the formation\nand evolution of the crust of Earth and create special granitic continental\ncrusts. In other terrestrial planets, including Mercury, Venus, and Mars, an EZ\ncan not be formed because of a lack of oxidative volatile components and water.\nFor this reason, a plate tectonic system can not been developed in these\nplanets.

To investigate its underlying cellular mechanisms, we developed a\nbiophysically tractable model that explains the emergence, sustenance, and\neventual termination of short-term persistent activity. Using the model, we\nreproduced the features of reverberating activity that were observed in small\n(50-100 cells) networks of cultured hippocampal neurons, such as the appearance\nof polysynaptic current clusters, the typical inter-cluster intervals, the\ntypical duration of reverberation, and the response to changes in\nextra-cellular ionic composition. The model relies on action\npotential-triggered residual presynaptic calcium, which we suggest plays an\nimportant role in sustaining reverberations. We show that reverberatory\nactivity is maintained by enhanced asynchronous transmitter release from\npre-synaptic terminals, which in itself depends on the dynamics of residual\npresynaptic calcium. Hence, asynchronous release, rather than being a \"synaptic\nnoise\", can play an important role in network dynamics. Additionally, we found\nthat a fast timescale synaptic depression is responsible for oscillatory\nnetwork activation during reverberations, whereas the onset of a slow timescale\ndepression leads to the termination of reverberation.
