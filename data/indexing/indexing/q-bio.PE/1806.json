Here we develop a more general and biologically relevant model\nin which cells grow exponentially and generation times are correlated in a\nmanner which controls cell size. In addition to the fluctuating generation\ntimes, we also allow the single-cell growth rates to fluctuate and account for\ntheir correlations across the lineage tree.
