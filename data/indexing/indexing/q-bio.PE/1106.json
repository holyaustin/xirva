The notion of cancer progression as an evolutionary process has been\nexperiencing increasing interest in recent years. Many efforts have been made\nto better understand and predict the progression to cancer using mathematical\nmodels; these mostly consider the evolution of a well-mixed cell population,\neven though pre-cancerous cells often evolve in highly structured epithelial\ntissues. We propose a novel model of cancer progression that considers a\nspatially structured cell population where clones expand via adaptive waves.\nThis model is used to asses two different paradigms of asexual evolution that\nhave been suggested to delineate the process of cancer progression. The\nstandard scenario of periodic selection assumes that driver mutations are\naccumulated strictly sequentially over time. However, when the mutation supply\nis sufficiently high, clones may arise simultaneously on distinct genetic\nbackgrounds, and clonal adaptation waves interfere with each other. We find\nthat in the presence of clonal interference, spatial structure increases the\nwaiting time for cancer, leads to a patchwork structure of non-uniformly sized\nclones, decreases the survival probability of virtually neutral (passenger)\nmutations, and that genetic distance begins to increase over a characteristic\nlength scale, determined here. These characteristic features of clonal\ninterference may help to predict the onset of cancers with pronounced spatial\nstructure and to interpret spatially-sampled genetic data obtained from\nbiopsies. Our estimates suggest that clonal interference likely occurs in the\nprogressing colon cancer, and possibly other cancers where spatial structure\nmatters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Jun 2011 15:51:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Sep 2011 22:36:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2011 21:15:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Martens", "Erik A.", ""], ["Kostadinov", "R.", ""], ["Maley", "Carlo C.", ""], ["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.3035", "submitter": "Chuan Xue", "authors": "Chuan Xue and Elena O.

Viewing the set of all games as a vector space, we exhibit explicit\northonormal bases for the subspaces of potential games, zero-sum games, and\ntheir orthogonal complements which we call anti-potential games and\nanti-zero-sum games, respectively. Perhaps surprisingly, every anti-potential\ngame comes either from the Rock-Paper-Scissors type games (in the case of\nsymmetric games) or from the Matching Pennies type games (in the case of\nasymmetric games). Using these decompositions, we prove old (and some new)\ncycle criteria for potential and zero-sum games (as orthogonality relations\nbetween subspaces). We illustrate the usefulness of our decomposition by (a)\nanalyzing the generalized Rock-Paper-Scissors game, (b) completely\ncharacterizing the set of all null-stable games, (c) providing a large class of\nstrict stable games, (d) relating the game decomposition to the decomposition\nof vector fields for the replicator equations, (e) constructing Lyapunov\nfunctions for some replicator dynamics, and (f) constructing Zeeman games\n-games with an interior asymptotically stable Nash equilibrium and a pure\nstrategy ESS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2011 19:14:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 17:18:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-19", "authors_parsed": [["Hwang", "Sung-Ha", ""], ["Rey-Bellet", "Luc", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4049", "submitter": "Chaitanya Gokhale", "authors": "Chaitanya S.

Even complex biological phenomena can sometimes be\nabstracted to simple two-player games. But often, the interaction between\nseveral parties determines evolutionary success. Rather than pair-wise\ninteractions, in this case we must take into account the interactions between\nmany players, which are inherently more complicated than the usual two-player\ngames, but can still yield simple results. In this manuscript we derive the\ncomposition of a many-player multiple strategy system in the mutation-selection\nequilibrium. This results in a simple expression which can be obtained by\nrecursions using coalescence theory. This approach can be modified to suit a\nvariety of contexts, e.g. to find the equilibrium frequencies of a finite\nnumber of alleles in a polymorphism or that of different strategies in a social\ndilemma in a cultural context.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Jun 2011 21:23:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gokhale", "Chaitanya S.", ""], ["Traulsen", "Arne", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.4182", "submitter": "Gleb Oshanin", "authors": "C.Mejia-Monasterio, G.

The population is divided into a fixed large number\nof groups of fixed size. From generation to generation, new groups are formed\nthat descend from previous groups, through a two-level Fisher-Wright process,\nwith selection between groups and within groups and with migration between\ngroups at rate $m$. When $m=1$, the framework reduces to the often used\ntrait-group framework, so that our setting can be seen as an extension of that\napproach. Our framework allows the analysis of previously introduced models in\nwhich altruists and non-altruists compete, and provides new insights into these\nmodels. We focus on the situation in which initially there is a single\naltruistic allele in the population, and no further mutations occur. The main\nquestions are conditions for the viability of that altruistic allele to spread,\nand the fashion in which it spreads when it does. Because our results and\nmethods are rigorous, we see them as shedding light on various controversial\nissues in this field, including the role of Hamilton's rule, and of the Price\nequation, the relevance of linearity in fitness functions and the need to only\nconsider pairwise interactions, or weak selection. In this paper we analyze the\nearly stages of the evolution, during which the number of altruists is small\ncompared to the size of the population. We show that during this stage the\nevolution is well described by a multitype branching process. The driving\nmatrix for this process can be obtained, reducing the problem of determining\nwhen the altruistic gene is viable to a comparison between the leading\neigenvalue of that matrix, and the fitness of the non-altruists before the\naltruistic gene appeared. This leads to a generalization of Hamilton's\ncondition for the viability of a mutant gene.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jun 2011 17:45:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Schonmann", "Roberto H.", ""], ["Vicente", "Renato", ""], ["Caticha", "Nestor", ""]]}, {"id": "1106.5386", "submitter": "Dong-Ping Yang Dong-Ping Yang", "authors": "Dong-Ping Yang, Hai Lin, Chen-Xu Wu and Jianwei Shuai", "title": "Topological conditions of scale-free networks for cooperation to evolve", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.AO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evolutionary game theory is employed to study topological conditions of\nscale-free networks for the evolution of cooperation.
