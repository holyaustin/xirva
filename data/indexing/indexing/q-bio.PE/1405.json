In our simulations, agents\nevolve misrepresentations of objective reality that help them cooperate and\nmaintain higher social welfare in the Prisoner's dilemma. These agents act\nrationally on their subjective representations of the world, but irrationally\nfrom the perspective of an external observer. We model misrepresentations as\nsubjective perceptions of payoffs and quasi-magical thinking as an inferential\nbias, finding that the former is more conducive to cooperation. This highlights\nthe importance of internal representations, not just observed behavior, in\nevolutionary thought.

Our approach extends the capabilities of\nexisting agent-based models for individual movement developed to predict the\nspread of directly transmitted pathogens in populations. To extend to\nmosquito-borne disease, agent-based models are coupled with differential\nequations representing `clouds' of mosquitoes in geographic patches that\naccount for mosquito ecology, including heterogeneity in mosquito density,\nemergence rates, and extrinsic incubation period. We illustrate the method by\nadapting an agent-based model for human movement across a network to\nmosquito-borne disease. We investigated the importance of heterogeneity in\nmosquito population dynamics and host movement on pathogen transmission,\nmotivating the utility of detailed models of individual behavior. We observed\nthat the total number of infected people is greater in heterogeneous patch\nmodels with one high risk patch and high or medium human movement than it would\nbe in a random mixing homogeneous model. Our hybrid agent-based/differential\nequation model is able to quantify the importance of the heterogeneity in\npredicting the spread and invasion of mosquito-borne pathogens.

Previous analyses of their transcriptional\nregulatory networks have shown that they exhibit high plasticity during\nevolution and suggested that both converge to scale-free-like structures.\nNevertheless, beyond this suggestion, no analyses have been carried out to\nidentify the common systems-level components and principles governing these\norganisms. Here we show that these two phylogenetically distant organisms\nfollow a set of common novel biologically consistent systems principles\nrevealed by the mathematically and biologically founded natural decomposition\napproach. The discovered common functional architecture is a diamond-shaped,\nmatryoshka-like, three-layer (coordination, processing, and integration)\nhierarchy exhibiting feedback, which is shaped by four systems-level\ncomponents: global transcription factors (global TFs), locally autonomous\nmodules, basal machinery and intermodular genes. The first mathematical\ncriterion to identify global TFs, the $\\kappa$-value, was reassessed on B.\nsubtilis and confirmed its high predictive power by identifying all the\npreviously reported, plus three potential, master regulators and eight sigma\nfactors. The functional conserved cores of modules, basal cell machinery, and a\nset of non-orthologous common physiological global responses were identified\nvia both orthologous genes and non-orthologous conserved functions. This study\nreveals novel common systems principles maintained between two phylogenetically\ndistant organisms and provides a comparison of their lifestyle adaptations. Our\nresults shed new light on the systems-level principles and the fundamental\nfunctions required by bacteria to sustain life.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 23 May 2014 00:08:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Freyre-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Julio A.", ""], ["Trevi\u00f1o-Quintanilla", "Luis G.", ""], ["Valtierra-Guti\u00e9rrez", "Ilse A.", ""], ["Guti\u00e9rrez-R\u00edos", "Rosa Mar\u00eda", ""], ["Alonso-Pav\u00f3n", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.5993", "submitter": "Kohaku H.

In complement, measuring the Local Indicators of Spatial\nAssociation (LISA) for these candidate loci allows to detect whether similar\ngenotypes tend to gather in space, which constitutes a useful indication of the\npossible kinship relationship between individuals. In this paper, we also\nanalyze SNP data from Ugandan cattle to detect signatures of local adaptation\nwith Sam$\\beta$ada, BayEnv, LFMM and an outlier method (FDIST approach in\nArlequin) and compare their results. Sam$\\beta$ada is an open source software\nfor Windows, Linux and MacOS X available at \\url{http://lasig.epfl.ch/sambada}\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 May 2014 19:07:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 16:36:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Stucki", "Sylvie", ""], ["Orozco-terWengel", "Pablo", ""], ["Bruford", "Michael W.", ""], ["Colli", "Licia", ""], ["Masembe", "Charles", ""], ["Negrini", "Riccardo", ""], ["Taberlet", "Pierre", ""], ["Joost", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Consortium", "the NEXTGEN", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7870", "submitter": "Eleni Katifori", "authors": "Johannes Gr\\\"awer, Carl D.

In addition to the developmental\nalgorithms that build them, many also employ adaptive strategies to respond to\nstimuli, damage, and other environmental changes. We model these adapting\nnetwork architectures using a generic dynamical system on weighted graphs and\nfind in simulation that these networks ultimately develop a hierarchical\norganization of the final weighted architecture accompanied by the formation of\na system-spanning backbone. In addition, we find that the long term\nequilibration dynamics exhibit glassy behavior characterized by long periods of\nslow changes punctuated by bursts of reorganization events.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 May 2014 14:17:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gr\u00e4wer", "Johannes", ""], ["Modes", "Carl D.", ""], ["Magnasco", "Marcelo O.", ""], ["Katifori", "Eleni", ""]]}, {"id": "1405.7963", "submitter": "Fabien Campillo", "authors": "Coralie Fritsch (INRIA Sophia Antipolis, MISTEA, I3M), J\\'er\\^ome\n  Harmand (INRIA Sophia Antipolis, LBE), Fabien Campillo (INRIA Sophia\n  Antipolis, MISTEA)", "title": "A modeling approach of the chemostat", "comments": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1308.2411", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Population dynamics and in particular microbial population dynamics, though\nthey are complex but also intrinsically discrete and random, are conventionally\nrepresented as deterministic differential equations systems.
