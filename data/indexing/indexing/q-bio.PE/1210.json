Evolutionary game theory has shown that under certain conditions,\ncooperation nonetheless evolves stably, for example if players have the\nopportunity to punish cheaters that benefit from a public good yet refuse to\npay into the common pool. However, punishment has remained enigmatic because it\nis costly, and difficult to maintain. On the other hand, cooperation emerges\nnaturally in the Public Goods game if the synergy of the public good (the\nfactor multiplying the public good investment) is sufficiently high. In terms\nof this synergy parameter, the transition from defection to cooperation can be\nviewed as a phase transition with the synergy as the critical parameter. We\nshow here that punishment reduces the critical value at which cooperation\noccurs, but also creates the possibility of meta-stable phase transitions,\nwhere populations can \"tunnel\" into the cooperating phase below the critical\nvalue. At the same time, cooperating populations are unstable even above the\ncritical value, because a group of defectors that are large enough can\n\"nucleate\" such a transition. We study the mean-field theoretical predictions\nvia agent-based simulations of finite populations using an evolutionary\napproach where the decisions to cooperate or to punish are encoded genetically\nin terms of evolvable probabilities. We recover the theoretical predictions and\ndemonstrate that the population shows hysteresis, as expected in systems that\nexhibit super-heating and super-cooling.

These constraints have been\nsuggested to be the strongest during either early or mid-embryogenesis, which\ncorresponds to the early conservation model or the hourglass model,\nrespectively. Conflicting results have been reported, but in recent studies of\nanimal transcriptomes the hourglass model has been favored. Studies usually\nreport descriptive statistics calculated for all genes over all developmental\ntime points. This introduces dependencies between the sets of compared genes,\nand may lead to biased results. Here we overcome this problem using an\nalternative modular analysis. We used the Iterative Signature Algorithm to\nidentify distinct modules of genes co-expressed specifically in consecutive\nstages of zebrafish development. We then performed a detailed comparison of\nseveral gene properties between modules, allowing for a less biased and more\npowerful analysis. Notably, our analysis corroborated the hourglass pattern\nonly at the regulatory level, with sequences of regulatory regions being most\nconserved for genes expressed in mid-development, but not at the level of gene\nsequence, age or expression, in contrast to some previous studies. The early\nconservation model was supported with gene duplication and birth that were the\nmost rare for genes expressed in early development. Finally, for all gene\nproperties we observed the least conservation for genes expressed in late\ndevelopment or adult, consistent with both models.

Here, we consider\na two-dimensional three-species population model and study the spiralling\npatterns arising from the combined effects of generic cyclic dominance,\nmutation, pair-exchange and hopping of the individuals. The dynamics is\ncharacterised by nonlinear mobility and a Hopf bifurcation around which the\nsystem's phase diagram is inferred from the underlying complex Ginzburg-Landau\nequation derived using a perturbative multiscale expansion. While the dynamics\nis generally characterised by spiralling patterns, we show that spiral waves\nare stable in only one of the four phases. Furthermore, we characterise a phase\nwhere nonlinearity leads to the annihilation of spirals and to the spatially\nuniform dominance of each species in turn. Away from the Hopf bifurcation, when\nthe coexistence fixed point is unstable, the spiralling patterns are also\naffected by nonlinear diffusion.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2012 16:09:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Apr 2013 14:35:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Szczesny", "Bartosz", ""], ["Mobilia", "Mauro", ""], ["Rucklidge", "Alastair M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.8416", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Xiaofeng Wang, Matjaz Perc, Yongkui Liu, Xiaojie Chen, Long Wang", "title": "Beyond pairwise strategy updating in the prisoner's dilemma game", "comments": "9 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in Scientific\n  Reports", "journal-ref": "Sci.

Since a single neighbor is taken\nas reference, the information stemming from other neighbors is neglected, which\nbegets the consideration of alternative, possibly more realistic approaches.\nHere we show that strategy changes inspired not only by the performance of\nindividual neighbors but rather by entire neighborhoods introduce a\nqualitatively different evolutionary dynamics that is able to support the\nstable existence of very small cooperative clusters. This leads to phase\ndiagrams that differ significantly from those obtained by means of pairwise\nstrategy updating. In particular, the survivability of cooperators is possible\neven by high temptations to defect and over a much wider uncertainty range. We\nsupport the simulation results by means of pair approximations and analysis of\nspatial patterns, which jointly highlight the importance of local information\nfor the resolution of social dilemmas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2012 17:48:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Xiaofeng", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""], ["Liu", "Yongkui", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaojie", ""], ["Wang", "Long", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.8423", "submitter": "Etienne Rajon", "authors": "Etienne Rajon and Joshua B.

A. Fisher, a quantitative trait is\nencoded by many loci with small, additive effects. Recent advances in QTL\nmapping have begun to elucidate the genetic architectures underlying vast\nnumbers of phenotypes across diverse taxa, producing observations that\nsometimes contrast with Fisher's blueprint. Despite these considerable\nempirical efforts to map the genetic determinants of traits, it remains poorly\nunderstood how the genetic architecture of a trait should evolve, or how it\ndepends on the selection pressures on the trait. Here we develop a simple,\npopulation-genetic model for the evolution of genetic architectures. Our model\npredicts that traits under moderate selection should be encoded by many loci\nwith highly variable effects, whereas traits under either weak or strong\nselection should be encoded by relatively few loci. We compare these\ntheoretical predictions to qualitative trends in the genetics of human traits,\nand to systematic data on the genetics of gene expression levels in yeast. Our\nanalysis provides an evolutionary explanation for broad empirical patterns in\nthe genetic basis of traits, and it introduces a single framework that unifies\nthe diversity of observed genetic architectures, ranging from Mendelian to\nFisherian.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Oct 2012 18:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 Jan 2013 19:27:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Rajon", "Etienne", ""], ["Plotkin", "Joshua B.", ""]]}]
