Using a diploid model of trait\ndetermining both mating success and migration rate, we explored differentiation\nbetween two connected populations, assuming either co-dominance or strict\ndominance between alleles.

Such differentiation is less dependent on migration when\nassuming strict dominance between haplotypes. Dominant alleles frequently\ninvade populations because their phenotype is more frequently expressed,\nresulting in higher mating success and rapid decrease in migration.

However HIV can\nrapidly evolve resistance to CTL attack at different epitopes, inducing a\ndynamic network of interacting viral and immune response variants.

The dynamics in several cases are\nanalyzed and sharp polychotomies are derived characterizing persistent\nvariants. In particular, we prove that if the viral fitness costs for gaining\nresistance to each epitope are equal, then the system of $2^n$ virus strains\nconverges to a \"perfectly nested network\" with less than or equal to $n+1$\npersistent virus strains.

Two contrasting conceptual\naccounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg's vehicles\nprovide the iconic illustration of the dominant input-output (IO) view. Here\nthe basic role of neural elongations is to connect sensors to effectors, both\nsituated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural\nelongations are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections,\nwhich require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes\nto build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for\nearly nervous systems. Here the coordination of activity across extended parts\nof a multicellular body is held central, in particular for the contractions of\n(muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest\nproto-neural elongations could have been functional even when they were\ninitially simple short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the\npatterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present\ncomputational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random\nneural elongations can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can\ngenerate basic forms of patterning for small body-configurations, adding\nelongations allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies.
