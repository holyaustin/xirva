Since Darwin did not believe that reproductive barriers could be\nselected for, he proposed that most events of speciation would occur through a\nprocess of separation and divergence, and this point of view is still shared by\nmost evolutionary biologists today. Results: I do, however, contend that, if so\nmuch speciation occurs, the most likely explanation is that there must be\nconditions where reproductive barriers can be directly selected for. In other\nwords, situations where it is advantageous for individuals to reproduce\npreferentially within a small group and reduce their breeding with the rest of\nthe ancestral population. This leads me to propose a model whereby new species\narise not by populations splitting into separate branches, but by small\ninbreeding groups \"budding\" from an ancestral stock. This would be driven by\nseveral advantages of inbreeding, and mainly by advantageous recessive\nphenotypes, which could only be retained in the context of inbreeding.\nReproductive barriers would thus not arise as secondary consequences of\ndivergent evolution in populations isolated from one another, but under the\ndirect selective pressure of ancestral stocks. Many documented cases of\nspeciation in natural populations appear to fit the model proposed, with more\nspeciation occurring in populations with high inbreeding coefficients, and many\nrecessive characters identified as central to the phenomenon of speciation,\nwith these recessive mutations expected to be surrounded by patterns of limited\ngenomic diversity. Conclusions: Whilst adaptive evolution would correspond to\ngains of function that would, most of the time, be dominant, this type of\nspeciation by budding would thus be driven by mutations resulting in the\nadvantageous loss of certain functions since recessive mutations very often\ncorrespond to the inactivation of a gene. A very important further advantage of\ninbreeding is that it reduces the accumulation of recessive mutations in\ngenomes. A consequence of the model proposed is that the existence of species\nwould correspond to a metastable equilibrium between inbreeding and\noutbreeding, with excessive inbreeding promoting speciation, and excessive\noutbreeding resulting in irreversible accumulation of recessive mutations that\ncould ultimately only lead to extinction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 3 Nov 2010 08:49:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 28 Nov 2010 13:00:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 13 Aug 2011 06:46:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2011 13:15:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Joly", "Etienne", "", "IPBS"]]}, {"id": "1011.0953", "submitter": "Manuel Cebrian", "authors": "Manuel Cebrian, Manuel Alfonseca, and Alfonso Ortega", "title": "Overcoming Problems in the Measurement of Biological Complexity", "comments": "4 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE cs.NE nlin.AO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In a genetic algorithm, fluctuations of the entropy of a genome over time are\ninterpreted as fluctuations of the information that the genome's organism is\nstoring about its environment, being this reflected in more complex organisms.\nThe computation of this entropy presents technical problems due to the small\npopulation sizes used in practice.

Living systems, known as complex systems,\nrequire complexity in interactions among molecules, cells, organs, and\nindividuals or regulatory mechanisms to perform a variety of activities for\nsurvival. On this basis, aging can be understood in terms of a progressive loss\nof complexity with age; this suggests that complexity in living systems would\nevolve with age. In general, aging dynamics is mathematically depicted by a\nsurvival function, which monotonically changes from 1 to 0 with age. It would\nbe then useful to find an adequate survival function to link aging dynamics and\ncomplexity evolution. Here we describe a flexible survival function, which is\nderived from the stretched exponential function by adopting an age-dependent\nexponent. We note that the exponent is associated with evolving complexity,\ni.e., a fractal-like scaling in cumulative mortality.

This has been\nfollowed by a phase of even more rapid technological evolution and concomitant\nexpansion of the size of the population, that began when our own particular\n`sapiens' species emerged, just a few hundred thousand years ago. The present\ninvestigation exploits the analogy between the neo-Darwinian genetic evolution\nmechanism governing the first phase, and the memetic evolution mechanism\ngoverning the second phase. From the outset of the latter until very recently\n-- about the year 2000 -- the growth of the global population N was roughly\ngoverned by an equation of the form dN/Ndt= N/T*, in which T* is a coefficient\nintroduced (in 1960) by von Foerster, who evaluated it empirically as about two\nhundred thousand million years. It is shown here how the value of this hitherto\nmysterious timescale governing the memetic phase is explicable in terms of what\nhappenned in the preceding genetic phase. The outcome is that the order of\nmagnitude of the Foerster timescale can be accounted for as the product of the\nrelevant (human) generation timescale, about 20 years, with the number of bits\nof information in the genome, of the order of ten thousand million. Whereas the\norigin of our `homo' genus may well have involved an evolutionary hard step, it\ntranspires that the emergence of our particular `sapiens' species was rather an\nautomatic process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 15 Nov 2010 14:18:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Jan 2011 16:31:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2011 10:50:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Carter", "Brandon", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.3666", "submitter": "Wei Li Dr.", "authors": "Juergen Jost and Wei Li", "title": "The tragedy of the commons in a multi-population complementarity game", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures, ECCS 09", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.GT physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study a complementarity game with multiple populations whose members'\noffered contributions are put together towards some common aim.

Empirical analyses have been\nfurther limited by low-resolution data for primary producers.

The Serengeti ecosystem provides an\nopportunity to examine structure in a newly compiled food web that includes\nspecies-level resolution among plants, allowing us to address whether groups in\nthe food web correspond to tightly-connected compartments or functional groups,\nand whether network structure reflects spatial or trophic organization, or a\ncombination of the two. We have compiled the major mammalian and plant\ncomponents of the Serengeti food web from published literature, and we infer\nits group structure using our method. We find that network structure\ncorresponds to spatially distinct plant groups coupled at higher trophic levels\nby groups of herbivores, which are in turn coupled by carnivore groups. Thus\nthe group structure of the Serengeti web represents a mixture of trophic guild\nstructure and spatial patterns, in contrast to the standard compartments\ntypically identified in ecological networks.

But which one of these strategy sources should potentially\nbe copied? Previous research dealt with this question either by selecting the\nfittest or by selecting one player uniformly at random. Here we introduce a\nparameter $u$ that interpolates between these two extreme options. Setting $u$\nequal to zero returns the random selection of the opponent, while positive $u$\nfavor the fitter players. In addition, we divide the population into two\ngroups. Players from group $A$ select their opponents as dictated by the\nparameter $u$, while players from group $B$ do so randomly irrespective of $u$.\nWe denote the fraction of players contained in groups $A$ and $B$ by $v$ and\n$1-v$, respectively. The two parameters $u$ and $v$ allow us to analyze in\ndetail how aspirations in the context of the prisoner's dilemma game influence\nthe evolution of cooperation. We find that for sufficiently positive values of\n$u$ there exist a robust intermediate $v \\approx 0.5$ for which cooperation\nthrives best. The robustness of this observation is tested against different\nlevels of uncertainty in the strategy adoption process $K$ and for different\ninteraction networks. We also provide complete phase diagrams depicting the\ndependence of the impact of $u$ and $v$ for different values of $K$, and\ncontrast the validity of our conclusions by means of an alternative model where\nindividual aspiration levels are subject to evolution as well. Our study\nindicates that heterogeneity in aspirations may be key for the sustainability\nof cooperation in structured populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 15:20:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Perc", "Matjaz", ""], ["Wang", "Zhen", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5388", "submitter": "Steven Frank", "authors": "Steven A.

In this paper, I argue that the\nconsistency of pattern arises because diverse ecological mechanisms share a\ncommon symmetry with regard to measurement scale. By symmetry, I mean that\ndifferent ecological processes preserve the same measure of information and\nlose all other information in the aggregation of various perturbations. I frame\nthese explanations of symmetry, measurement, and aggregation in terms of a\nrecently developed extension to the theory of maximum entropy. I show that the\nnatural measurement scale for the species abundance distribution is log-linear:\nthe information in observations at small population sizes scales\nlogarithmically and, as population size increases, the scaling of information\ngrades from logarithmic to linear. Such log-linear scaling leads naturally to a\ngamma distribution for species abundance, which matches well with the observed\npatterns. Much of the variation between samples can be explained by the\nmagnitude at which the measurement scale grades from logarithmic to linear.\nThis measurement approach can be applied to the similar problem of allelic\ndiversity in population genetics and to a wide variety of other patterns in\nbiology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Nov 2010 15:02:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.5539", "submitter": "Mike Steel Prof.", "authors": "Arne Mooers, Olivier Gascuel, Tanja Stadler, Heyang Li, Mike Steel", "title": "Branch lengths on Yule trees and the expected loss of phylogenetic\n  diversity", "comments": "3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Diversification is nested, and early models suggested this could lead to a\ngreat deal of evolutionary redundancy in the Tree of Life.
