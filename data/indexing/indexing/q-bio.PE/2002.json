It is known that the\ndistribution of generation times obtained from a single lineage is, in general,\ninsufficient to determine a population's growth rate. Is there an explicit\nrelationship between observables obtained from a single lineage and the\npopulation growth rate? We show that a population's growth rate can be\nrepresented in terms of averages over isolated lineages. This lineage\nrepresentation is related to a large deviation principle that is a generic\nfeature of exponentially proliferating populations. Due to the large deviation\nstructure of growing populations, the number of lineages needed to obtain an\naccurate estimate of the growth rate depends exponentially on the duration of\nthe lineages, leading to a non-monotonic convergence of the estimate, which we\nverify in both synthetic and experimental data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2020 19:00:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-29", "authors_parsed": [["Levien", "Ethan", ""], ["GrandPre", "Trevor", ""], ["Amir", "Ariel", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.00070", "submitter": "Cristhian Montoya", "authors": "Cristhian Montoya and Jhoana P.

Instead, several metrics aiming\nat quantifying nestedness, based on different but not necessarily independent\nproperties of the networks, coexist in the literature blurring the comparison\nbetween ecosystems. In this work, we present a detailed critical study of the\nbehavior of six popular nestedness metrics and the variants of two of them. In\norder to evaluate their performance, we compare the obtained values of the\nnestedness of a large set of real networks among them and against a maximum\nentropy and maximum likelihood null model. Our results point out, first, that\nthe metrics do not rank the degree of nestedness of networks universally.\nFurthermore, several metrics show significant undesired dependencies on the\nnetwork properties considered. The study of these dependencies allows us to\nunderstand some of the systematic shifts between the real values of nestedness\nand the average over the null model.

SSMs are popular\nbecause they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological\nprocesses separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows\necologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear\nor nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the\ntwo sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate\nbetween biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the\nsampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological\nquantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly\nmodeled.

The modelling\napproach is based on the framework of Evolutionary Game Theory. To represent\nthis kind of heterogeneity, we implement small and local perturbations on the\npayoff matrix of simple 2-strategy games, as the Prisoner's Dilemma. So, while\nusually the payoff is considered as a global and time-invariant structure, i.e.\nit is the same for all individuals of a population at any time, in our model\nits value is continuously affected by small variations, both in time and space\n(i.e. position on a lattice).

This increase is often attributed to the \"accumulation of\ndamage\" known to occur in many biological structures and systems. The aim of\nthis paper is to describe a generic model of damage accumulation and death in\nwhich mortality increases exponentially with age. The damage-accumulation\nprocess is modeled by a stochastic process know as a queue, and risk of dying\nis a function of the accumulated damage, i.e. length of the queue. The model\nhas four parameters and the main characteristics of the model are: (i) damage\noccurs at random times with a constant high rate; (ii) the damage is repaired\nat a limited rate, and consequently damage can accumulate; (iii) the efficiency\nof the repair mechanism decays linearly with age; (iv) the risk of dying is a\nfunction of the accumulated damage. Using standard results from the\nmathematical theory of queues it is shown that there is an exponential\ndependence between risk of dying and age in these models, and that this\ndependency holds irrespective of how the damage-accumulation process is\nmodeled. Furthermore, the ways in which this exponential dependence is shaped\nby the model parameters are also independent of the details of the damage\naccumulation process. These generic features suggest that the model could be\nuseful when interpreting changes in the relation between age and mortality in\nreal data. To examplify, historical mortality data from Sweden are interpreted\nin the light of the model. The decrease in mortality seen between cohorts born\nin 1905, compared to those born in 1885, can be accounted for by higher\nthreshold to damage.

We apply these results to some\nexamples: the (classical) size-dependent model, a size structured cell\npopulation model, a size structured model with diffusion in structure space\n(under some particular assumptions) and a (physiological) age-structured model\nwith diffusion in structure space.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 21:51:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Barril", "Carles", ""], ["Calsina", "\u00c0ngel", ""], ["Cuadrado", "S\u00edlvia", ""], ["Ripoll", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "2002.10724", "submitter": "Guillaume Legendre", "authors": "Emeric Bouin (CEREMADE), Guillaume Legendre (CEREMADE), Yuan Lou,\n  Nichole Slover", "title": "Evolution of anisotropic diffusion in two-dimensional heterogeneous\n  environments", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.AP q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a system of two competing populations in two-dimensional\nheterogeneous environments.

Understanding the dynamics of lying is therefore of crucial importance\nacross different fields of research. While lying has been studied before in\nwell-mixed populations, it is a fact that real interactions are rarely\nwell-mixed. Indeed, they are usually structured and thus best described by\nnetworks. Here we therefore use the Monte Carlo method to study the evolution\nof lying in the sender-receiver game in a one-parameter family of networks,\nsystematically covering complete networks, small-world networks, and\none-dimensional rings. We show that lies which benefit the sender at a cost to\nthe receiver, the so-called black lies, are less likely to proliferate on\nnetworks than they do in well-mixed populations. Honesty is thus more likely to\nevolve, but only when the benefit for the sender is smaller than the cost for\nthe receiver. Moreover, this effect is particularly strong in small-world\nnetworks, but less so in the one-dimensional ring. For lies that favor the\nreceiver at a cost to the sender, the so-called altruistic white lies, we show\nthat honesty is also more likely to evolve than it is in well-mixed\npopulations. But contrary to black lies, this effect is more expressed in the\none-dimensional ring, whereas in small-world networks it is present only when\nthe cost to the sender is greater than the benefit for the receiver. Lastly,\nfor lies that benefit both the sender and the receiver, the so-called Pareto\nwhite lies, we show that the network structure actually favors the evolution of\nlying, but this only when the benefit for the sender is slightly greater than\nthe benefit for the receiver.

In this work, we\nintroduce a deterministic three-stage, two-species predator-prey model, which\nmodulates the impact of honest signals and cues on the interacting populations.\nThe model is built from a set of first principles originated from signaling and\nsocial learning theory in which the response of predators to transmitted honest\nsignals or cues is determined. The predators then use the signals to decide\nwhether to pursue the attack or save their energy for an easier catch. Other\nmembers from the prey population that are not familiar with signaling their\nfitness observe and learn the technique. Our numerical bifurcation analysis\nindicates that increasing the predator's search rate and the corresponding\nassimilation efficiency gives a journey from predator-prey abundance and\nscarcity, a stable transient cycle between persistence and near-extinction, a\nhomoclinic orbit pointing towards extinction, and ultimately, a quasi-periodic\norbit. A similar discovery is met under the increment of the prey's intrinsic\nbirth rate and carrying capacity.
