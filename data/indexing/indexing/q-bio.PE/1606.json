Here, we first show how these discrepancies affect\nthe prediction of the epidemic risk when these data are fed to numerical models\nof epidemic spread: low participation rate, under-reporting of contacts and\noverestimation of contact durations in contact diaries with respect to sensor\ndata determine indeed important differences in the outcomes of the\ncorresponding simulations {with for instance an enhanced sensitivity to initial\nconditions}. Most importantly, we investigate if and how information gathered\nfrom contact diaries can be used in such simulations in order to yield an\naccurate description of the epidemic risk, assuming that data from sensors\nrepresent the ground truth. The contact networks built from contact sensors and\ndiaries present indeed several structural similarities: this suggests the\npossibility to construct, using only the contact diary network information, a\nsurrogate contact network such that simulations using this surrogate network\ngive the same estimation of the epidemic risk as simulations using the contact\nsensor network. We present and {compare} several methods to build such\nsurrogate data, and show that it is indeed possible to obtain a good agreement\nbetween the outcomes of simulations using surrogate and sensor data, as long as\nthe contact diary information is complemented by publicly available data\ndescribing the heterogeneity of the durations of human contacts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 17:53:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 17:31:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-28", "authors_parsed": [["Mastrandrea", "Rossana", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""]]}, {"id": "1606.07995", "submitter": "Vladimir Minin", "authors": "Jonathan Fintzi, Xiang Cui, Jon Wakefield, Vladimir N.
