Standard SEIR\nmodels distinguish essentially two regimes: either the disease is controlled\nand the number of infected people rapidly decreases, or the disease spreads and\ncontaminates a significant fraction of the population until herd immunity is\nachieved. After lockdown, at first sight it seems that social distancing is not\nenough to control the outbreak. We discuss here a possible explanation, namely\nthat the lockdown is creating social heterogeneity: even if a large majority of\nthe population complies with the lockdown rules, a small fraction of the\npopulation still has to maintain a normal or high level of social interactions,\nsuch as health workers, providers of essential services, etc. This results in\nan apparent high level of epidemic propagation as measured through\nre-estimations of the basic reproduction ratio. However, these measures are\nlimited to averages, while variance inside the population plays an essential\nrole on the peak and the size of the epidemic outbreak and tends to lower these\ntwo indicators.

Here, we reveal\nthat, compared with \"forward\" tracing---tracing to whom disease spreads,\n\"backward\" tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly more\neffective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but\noverlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations\non both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that\neven at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically\nexecuted contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further\ntransmissions. We also show that---in terms of the number of prevented\ntransmissions per isolation---case isolation combined with a small amount of\ncontact tracing is more efficient than case isolation alone. By demonstrating\nthat backward contact tracing is highly effective at discovering\nsuper-spreading events, we argue that the potential effectiveness of contact\ntracing has been underestimated. Therefore, there is a critical need for\nrevisiting current contact tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms\nof biases.

Starting from the classical SEIR model, the model is\nmodified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying\npathogen and its infectious modes. In line with the large number of secondary\ninfections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the\nmodel includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious\nindividuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A\nBayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the\nrelevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new\ndata on the number of new infections and disease related death become\navailable. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate\nis dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of\nthe pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The\nsequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the\nuncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction\nnumber, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a\ndimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and\nsymptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the\nquantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that\nplays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we\napply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from\nseveral counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the\nproposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within\nboth states, thus proving to be a reliable summary of the success of the\nmitigation measures.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 9 May 2020 05:07:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2020 17:21:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Calvetti", "Daniela", ""], ["Hoover", "Alexander", ""], ["Rose", "Johnie", ""], ["Somersalo", "Erkki", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.04421", "submitter": "Nobuto Takeuchi", "authors": "Nobuto Takeuchi, Namiko Mitarai and Kunihiko Kaneko", "title": "Scaling laws of multilevel selection: a striking difference between\n  continuous-trait and binary-trait models", "comments": "Added results on a binary-trait model.

We then embed the\nsusceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) process over the mobility\ndynamics and develops the spatial SEIR model with travel contagion\n(Trans-SEIR), which explicitly accounts for contagions both during travel and\nduring daily activities. We investigate the theoretical properties of the\nproposed model and show how activity contagion and travel contagion contribute\nto the average number of secondary infections. In the numerical experiments, we\nexplore how the urban transportation system may alter the fundamental dynamics\nof the infectious disease, change the number of secondary infections, promote\nthe synchronization of the disease across the city, and affect the peak of the\ndisease outbreaks. The Trans-SEIR model is further applied to the understand\nthe disease dynamics during the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City, where we\nshow how the activity and travel contagion may be distributed and how effective\ntravel control can be implemented with only limited resources. The Trans-SEIR\nmodel along with the findings in our study may have significant contributions\nto improving our understanding of the coupling between urban transportation and\ndisease dynamics, the development of quarantine and control measures of disease\nsystem, and promoting the idea of disease-resilient urban transportation\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 10 May 2020 05:40:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Qian", "Xinwu", ""], ["Ukkusuri", "Satish V.", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.04704", "submitter": "Andrew Peterson", "authors": "Christopher Rose and Andrew J.

We delineated domains of\nmonostability (forest, grassland, savanna), of bistability (e.g.\nforest-grassland or forest-savanna) and even tristability. Notably, we\nhighlighted regions in which two savanna equilibria may be jointly stable\n(possibly in addition to forest or grassland). We verified that common\nknowledge about decreasing woody biomass with increasing fire frequency is\nrecovered for all levels of rainfall, contrary to previous attempts using\nanalogous ODE frameworks. Thus, this framework appears able to render more\nrealistic and diversified outcomes than often thought of. Our model can help\nfigure out the ongoing dynamics of savanna vegetation in large territories for\nwhich local data are sparse or absent.

The\nchallenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are\ncompounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this\nproblem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban\nsettings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the\npandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The\nsetting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2\ntransmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency\nof contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may\nchange over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an\nuninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other\ncommunities where the infection is present. To account for these important\naspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact\nbetween its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census\nand cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network,\nwhich can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation\nmeasures.

In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a\nscale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a\ntemporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary\nimmunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again.\nWhen the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model\nthree different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the\nepidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on\nmaximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a\nfinite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of\nthe pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of \"herd immunity\".\nFor each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which\nthis happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to\nflatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as\ndecrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic.\nHowever, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price\nfor the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the\nmaximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first\npeak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention.

In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost\npriority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.\n  Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission\ndynamics of COVID-19 in India.

We take into account the presence of\nasymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to\ncontain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the\npopulation, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by\nseparating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep\nworking during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group\nconsisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to\nquarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.\nIn the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of\ncontact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in\ntime, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an\nexplicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms\nof the parameters of the disease and of the control policies.

The first is a data driven approach\nfor predicting the Covid 19 pandemic dynamics, based on data from more advanced\ncountries.

We start by presenting\npreliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are\nsomewhat disappointing. Then, our main approach consists in an initial\nclustering of the world regions for which data is available and where the\npandemic is at an advanced stage, based on a set of manually engineered\nfeatures representing a country response to the early spread of the pandemic. A\nModified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to\npredict future data for Brazilian states.

Finally, curve\nfitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution\nthat best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks\nof the pandemic.

We utilise simple simulations\nof a population of individual cells in space to examine how changes in\nmechanical properties of invasive cells and their surroundings can affect the\nspeed of cell migration. We also find that the growth rate of large lesions\ndepends weakly on the migration speed of escaping cells, and has stronger and\nmore complex dependencies on the rates of other stochastic processes in the\nmodel, namely the rate at which cells transition to being motile and the\nreverse rate at which cells cease to be motile.\n  To examine how the rates of growth and evolution of an ensemble of cancerous\nlesions depends on their geometry and underlying fitness landscape, we develop\nan analytical framework in which the spatial structure is coarse grained and\nthe cancer treated as a continuously growing system with stochastic migration\nevents. Both approaches conclude that the whole ensemble can undergo\nmigration-driven exponential growth regardless of the dependence of size on\ntime of individual lesions, and that the relationship between growth rate and\nrate of migration is determined by the geometrical constraints of individual\nlesions. We also find that linear fitness landscapes result in\nfaster-than-exponential growth of the ensemble, and we can determine the\nexpected number of driver mutations present in several important cases of the\nmodel.\n  Finally, we study data from a clinical study of the effectiveness of a new\nlow-dose combined chemotherapy. This enables us to test some important\nhypotheses about the growth rate of pancreatic cancers and the speed with which\nevolution occurs in reality.

The PyRoss\nlibrary supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as\nmaster equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run\ntransitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental\nsubdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and\nallows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and\nforecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as\navailable, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be\nweighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact\nof idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological\ndata, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to\noptimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are\nincluded. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed\npopulations will in future reports be extended to include compartments\nstructured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes\nrelevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs.

We find that these unintuitive data may be explained through an\ninterplay of differences in transmissibility, effective protection, and\ndetection efficiencies between Hubei and other provinces. More generally, our\nresults demonstrate that regional differences may drastically shape infection\noutbursts. The obtained results demonstrate the applicability of our developed\nmethod to extract key infection parameters directly from publically available\ndata so that it can be globally applied to outbreaks of COVID-19 in a number of\ncountries. Overall, we show that applications of uncommon strategies, such as\nmethods and approaches from molecular systems biology research to mathematical\nepidemiology, may significantly advance our understanding of COVID-19 and other\ninfectious diseases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 19 May 2020 17:57:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 Jun 2020 19:52:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 28 Mar 2021 11:35:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Djordjevic", "Magdalena", ""], ["Rodic", "Andjela", ""], ["Salom", "Igor", ""], ["Zigic", "Dusan", ""], ["Milicevic", "Ognjen", ""], ["Ilic", "Bojana", ""], ["Djordjevic", "Marko", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.09769", "submitter": "Chaolun Ma", "authors": "Xiubin Bruce Wang, Chaolun Ma", "title": "Controlling the Hidden Growth of COVID-19", "comments": "13 pages, 1 figure", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The COVID-19 pandemic has plagued the world for months.

This new containment regime is hard to explain\nby traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until\nherd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new\ncases).

We generalized this model to any mammal, based on the core\nmorphometric characteristics shared by all mammals' lungs and on their\nallometric scaling from the literature. Since the main energetic costs of\nventilation are related to the convective transport, we prove that, for all\nmammals, the localization of the shift from a convective transport into a\ndiffusive transport plays a critical role on keeping that cost low while\nfulfilling the lung function.

From\nthat optimal localization, we are able to predict allometric scaling laws for\nboth tidal volumes and breathing rates, at any metabolic regime.

Implementation of different strategies to counter the\nspread of the disease requires a certain degree of quantitative understanding\nof the time dependence of the outcome. In this paper, our main objective is to\ngather understanding of the dependence of outcome on the rate of progress of\nHI. We generalize the celebrated SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) by\ncompartmentalizing the susceptible population into two categories- (i)\nvulnerables and (ii) resilients, and study dynamical evolution of the disease\nprogression. We achieve such a classification by employing different rates of\nrecovery of vulnerables vis-a-vis resilients. We obtain the relative fatality\nof these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable\nand resilient population, and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment\nof herd immunity. Our results quantify the adverse effects on the recovery\nrates of vulnerables in the course of attaining the herd immunity. We find the\nimportant result that a slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal.\nHowever, a slower progress towards HI could be complicated by many intervening\nfactors.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2020 10:49:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mondal", "Sayantan", ""], ["Mukherjee", "Saumyak", ""], ["Bagchi", "Biman", ""]]}, {"id": "2005.14532", "submitter": "Tomasz Piasecki", "authors": "Tomasz Piasecki, Piotr B.

We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity\nand social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the\n\"post-Pause\" period in the City. We find that testing capacity must increase\ndramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in\nsocial distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular,\nif the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing\nmeasures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of\nSeptember can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to\nsomewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000\ntests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept\nat around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly\nmust be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress\nexcessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the \"pre-Pause\" social\ndistancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number\nof deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be\nperforming 500,000 tests per day.
