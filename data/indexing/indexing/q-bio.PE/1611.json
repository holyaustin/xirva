In the limit\nof a small introduction rate of new species, the model exhibits a discontinuous\ntransition from a high-diversity state to a low-diversity state as the\ninteraction probability between species, $\\gamma$, is increased from zero. Here\nwe explore the effects of finite introduction rates and system-size on the\nphase transition by utilizing efficient parallel computing.

As $\\gamma$ is increased further, the\nhigh state approaches to the low state, suggesting the possibility that the two\nstates merge at a high $\\gamma$. We find that the fraction of time spent in the\nhigh state becomes longer with higher introduction rates, but the availability\nof the two states is rather insensitive to the value of the introduction rate.\nFurthermore we establish a relation between the introduction rate and the\nsystem size, which preserves the probability for the system to remain in the\nhigh-diversity state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 09:55:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 18:06:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-22", "authors_parsed": [["Uekermann", "Florian", ""], ["Mathiesen", "Joachim", ""], ["Mitarai", "Namiko", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.00212", "submitter": "Xiaolong Chen", "authors": "Xiaolong Chen, Tianshou Zhou, Ling Feng, Junhao Liang, Fredrik\n  Liljeros, Shlomo Havlin, Yanqing Hu", "title": "Non-trivial Resource Amount Requirement in the Early Stage for\n  Containing Fatal Diseases", "comments": "12 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

The performance of these schemes is studied numerically,\nfocusing on the influence of the household size distribution and the degree\ndistribution of the social network. We find that acquaintance vaccination can\nsignificantly outperform the best household-based scheme if the degree\ndistribution of the social network is heavy-tailed.

It is\nderived from a discrete level approach, and it is shown to be well-posed and to\nattain a unique solution for (almost) every parameter set.

The invasion of the Ae. albopictus across all over the world is\nthought to be the most rapid spread of any insect species in the last four\ndecades in tropical, subtropical and temperate climate zones. In addition, Ae.\nalbopictus is a potential vector for at least 27 viruses as well as for several\nparasites and plays a major role in the global transmission of dengue virus and\nchikungunya virus; and its contribution to the rapid spread of zika virus is\ncurrently under investigation.

As a result of these\ninvestigations, a high potential for this species to become a threat to public\nhealth in many more countries, especially in temperate climatic zones, can be\nseen.
