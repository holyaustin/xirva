The availability of the S.\ncerevisiae genome led to many insights into its five known transposable element\nfamilies (Ty1-Ty5) in the years shortly after its completion. However,\nsubsequent advances in bioinformatics tools for analysing transposable elements\nand the recent availability of genome sequences for multiple strains and\nspecies of yeast motivates new investigations into Ty evolution in S.\ncerevisiae. Here we provide a comprehensive phylogenetic and population genetic\nanalysis of Ty families in S. cerevisiae based on a reannotation of Ty elements\nin the S288c reference genome. We show that previous annotation efforts have\nunderestimated the total copy number of Ty elements for all known families. In\naddition, we identify a new family of Ty3-like elements related to the S.\nparadoxus Ty3p which is composed entirely of degenerate solo LTRs. Phylogenetic\nanalyses of LTR sequences identified three families with short-branch, recently\nactive clades nested among long branch, inactive insertions (Ty1, Ty3, Ty4),\none family with essentially all recently active elements (Ty2) and two families\nwith only inactive elements (Ty3p and Ty5). Population genomic data from 38\nadditional strains of S. cerevisiae show that elements present in active clades\nare predominantly polymorphic, whereas most of the inactive elements are fixed.\nFinally, we use comparative genomic data to provide evidence that the Ty2 and\nTy3p families have arisen in the S. cerevisiae genome by horizontal transfer.\nOur results demonstrate that the genome of a single individual contains\nimportant information about the state of TE population dynamics within a\nspecies and suggest that horizontal transfer may play an important role in\nshaping the diversity of transposable elements in unicellular eukaryotes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Sep 2012 19:56:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Carr", "Martin", ""], ["Bensasson", "Douda", ""], ["Bergman", "Casey M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0176", "submitter": "Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier", "authors": "Anna-Sophie Fiston-Lavier, Charles E.

The dynamics of their insertion and deletion depend on diverse\nfactors varying in strength and nature along the genome. We address here how TE\nsequence evolution is affected by neighboring genes and the chromatin status\n(euchromatin or heterochromatin) at their insertion site. Results: We estimated\nages of TE sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana, and found that they depend on the\ndistance to the nearest genes: TEs located close to genes are older than those\nthat are more distant. Consequently, TE sequences in heterochromatic regions,\nwhich are gene-poor regions, are surprisingly younger and longer than that\nelsewhere. Conclusions: We provide evidence for biased TE age distribution\nclose or near to genes. Interestingly, TE sequences in euchromatin and those in\nheterochromatin evolve at different rates, and as a result, could explain that\nTE sequences in heterochromatin tend to be younger and longer. Then, we revisit\nmodels of TE sequence dynamics and point out differences for TE-rich genomes,\nsuch as maize and wheat, compared to TE-poor genomes such as fly and A.\nthaliana.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 2 Sep 2012 13:38:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 24 Nov 2013 16:30:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-26", "authors_parsed": [["Fiston-Lavier", "Anna-Sophie", ""], ["Vejnar", "Charles E.", ""], ["Quesneville", "Hadi", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.0364", "submitter": "Brian Williams Dr", "authors": "Brian G.

We define weak monotonicity of fitness\nlandscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are\ncontinuous and open at the optimum. This theoretical result motivates our\nhypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions in such landscapes will\nincrease when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling\nthe control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis\nexperimentally by analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control\nfunctions in 115 complete landscapes of binding scores between DNA sequences\nand transcription factors.

Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that\nindividuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this\nresearch area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter\nentering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative\ncontribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global\nbecause it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.\nFurther, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social\nscience. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists\nto use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,\nI characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic\necosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a\nsmall fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the\nsystem activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes\ngenerate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant\nnodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the\n130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary\nproducers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality\nindicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power\nconcentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these\nresults are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis\nbased on economic input-output analysis.

An important goal of these studies is discerning which\nevolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that\nswarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes\nconfusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this\nselective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we\nshow that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve\nswarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary\neffect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the\nstructure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,\nhigh-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on\nswarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming\nin response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the\nfunctional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey\ndensity increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual\nconstraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on\nprey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions\nbetween predators and prey.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 21:31:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2013 00:36:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 3 Apr 2013 19:56:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Olson", "Randal S.", ""], ["Hintze", "Arend", ""], ["Dyer", "Fred C.", ""], ["Knoester", "David B.", ""], ["Adami", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.3380", "submitter": "Jean-Stephane Dhersin", "authors": "Jean-Stephane Dhersin (IG, LAGA), Martin Moehle", "title": "On the external branches of coalescents with multiple collisions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A recursion for the joint moments of the external branch lengths for\ncoalescents with multiple collisions ($\\Lambda$-coalescents) is provided.

To describe TE dynamics in populations, many previous studies have\nused models of transposition-selection equilibrium that rely on the assumption\nof a constant rate of transposition. However, since TE invasions are known to\nhappen in bursts through time, this assumption may not be reasonable in natural\npopulations. Here we propose a test of neutrality for TE insertions that does\nnot rely on the assumption of a constant transposition rate. We consider the\ncase of TE insertions that have been ascertained from a single haploid\nreference genome sequence and have subsequently had their allele frequency\nestimated in a population sample. By conditioning on the age of an individual\nTE insertion (using information contained in the number of substitutions that\nhave occurred within the TE sequence since insertion), we determine the\nprobability distribution for the insertion allele frequency in a population\nsample under neutrality. Taking models of varying population size into account,\nwe then evaluate predictions of our model against allele frequency data from\n190 retrotransposon insertions sampled from North American and African\npopulations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this non-equilibrium model, we\nare able to explain about 80% of the variance in TE insertion allele\nfrequencies based on age alone. Controlling both for nonequilibrium dynamics of\ntransposition and host demography, we provide evidence for negative selection\nacting against most TEs as well as for positive selection acting on a small\nsubset of TEs.

Relevant features of sauropod cervical\nvertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in\na mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of\nvarying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. Other\nlong-necked tetrapods lacked important features of sauropods, preventing the\nevolution of longer necks: for example, giraffes have relatively small torsos\nand large, heavy heads, share the usual mammalian constraint of only seven\ncervical vertebrae, and lack an air-sac system and pneumatic bones. Among\nnon-sauropods, their saurischian relatives the theropod dinosaurs seem to have\nbeen best placed to evolve long necks, and indeed they probably surpassed those\nof giraffes. But 150 million years of evolution did not suffice for them to\nexceed a relatively modest 2.5 m.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Sep 2012 21:51:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Taylor", "Michael P.", ""], ["Wedel", "Mathew J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.5466", "submitter": "Jeffrey Ross-Ibarra", "authors": "Lisa B.

The\nstructure and diversity of the Ab10 meiotic drive haplotype is poorly\nunderstood. We developed a BAC library from an Ab10 line and used the data to\ndevelop sequence-based markers, focusing on the proximal portion of the\nhaplotype that shows partial homology to normal chromosome 10. These molecular\nand additional cytological data demonstrate that two previously identified Ab10\nvariants (Ab10-I and Ab10-II) share a common origin. Dominant PCR markers were\nused with FISH to assay 160 diverse teosinte and maize landrace populations\nfrom across the Americas, resulting in the identification of a previously\nunknown but prevalent form of Ab10 (Ab10-III). We find that Ab10 occurs in at\nleast 75% of teosinte populations at a mean frequency of 15%. Ab10 was also\nfound in 13% of the maize landraces, but does not appear to be fixed in any\nwild or cultivated population. Quantitative analyses suggest that the abundance\nand distribution of Ab10 is governed by a complex combination of intrinsic\nfitness effects as well as extrinsic environmental variability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Sep 2012 01:10:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Kanizay", "Lisa B.", ""], ["Pyh\u00e4j\u00e4rvi", "Tanja", ""], ["Lowry", "Elizabeth G.", ""], ["Hufford", "Matthew B.", ""], ["Peterson", "Daniel G.", ""], ["Ross-Ibarra", "Jeffrey", ""], ["Dawe", "R.

We show that it is possible to obtain detailed information\nabout inbreeding when a relatively small set of whole-genome sequences is\navailable. Rather than focus on testing for deviations from Hardy-Weinberg\ngenotype frequencies at each site, we analyze the entire distribution of\nheterozygotes conditioned on the number of copies of the derived\n(non-chimpanzee) allele. Using Levene's exact test, we reject Hardy-Weinberg in\nboth populations. We generalized Levene's distribution to obtain the exact\ndistribution of the number of heterozygous individuals given that every\nindividual has the same inbreeding coefficient, F. We estimated F to be 0.0026\nin Europeans and 0.0005 in Yorubans, but we could also reject the hypothesis\nthat F was the same in each individual. We used a composite likelihood method\nto estimate F in each individual and within each chromosome. Variation in F\nacross chromosomes within individuals was too large to be consistent with\nsampling effects alone. Furthermore, estimates of F for each chromosome in\ndifferent populations were not correlated. Our results show how detailed\ncomparisons of population genomic data can be made to theoretical predictions.\nThe application of methods to the Complete Genomics data set shows that the\nextent of apparent inbreeding varies across chromosomes and across individuals,\nand estimates of inbreeding coefficients are subject to unexpected levels of\nvariation which might be partly accounted for by selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Sep 2012 19:48:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Schraiber", "Joshua G.", ""], ["Shih", "Stephannie", ""], ["Slatkin", "Montgomery", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.6596", "submitter": "Serik Sagitov", "authors": "Vladimir Vatutin, Elena Dyakonova, Peter Jagers, and Serik Sagitov", "title": "A decomposable branching process in a Markovian environment", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A population has two types of individuals, each occupying an island.
