All three models are trees, as that term is\ncommonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the\nbiological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and\nHennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these\ntwo kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other\nhand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different\nmathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For\neach phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same\ninformation, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves\nnecessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it\nis necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of\na Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One\npossibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the\nedges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little\nmore than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint\nof phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson\ncladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of\nsynapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2008 02:22:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Jeremy L.", ""], ["Wiley", "E.

(3) Units of\ndiversity are recognized regardless of kind or degree of divergence. (4) Fate\nis not an intrinsic property of systems and is an inappropriate consideration\nin species models.

Observations of a\nhost-parasitoid interaction in the shrub's foliage, in which victims are\nsignificantly less motile than their exploiters, record stable spatial patterns\nin a fairly homogeneous environment. Though such pattern formation has been\nfound in reaction-diffusion models, the correspondence of these models to\ncontinuous-time predator-prey interactions does not reflect the reality of the\nsystem being studied. Near the root of the lupine, another host-parasitoid\ninteraction is also of considerable interest. In some cases this interaction,\nwhich promotes the health of the lupine, has been observed to be much more\npersistent than suggested by mathematical models.\n  In this work a discrete-time spatial model of the first host-parasitoid\nsystem is introduced. We analyze the model, describing its transient behavior\nand finding the conditions under which spatial patterns occur, as well as an\nestimate of outbreak size under those conditions. We consider the feasibility\nof the necessary conditions in the natural system by modeling the mechanisms\nresponsible for them, and discuss the effects of variable habitat on pattern\nformation. We also explore one possible explanation for the persistence of the\nsecond host-parasitoid system -- the existence of an alternate host. Under\ncertain surprising conditions and by means quite different from previous models\nof similar situations, an alternate host can greatly enhance persistence of the\nnematode parasitoid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Aug 2008 20:08:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wright", "Roy Werner", ""]]}, {"id": "0808.4014", "submitter": "Aaron Clauset", "authors": "Aaron Clauset and Sidney Redner", "title": "Evolutionary Model of Species Body Mass Diversification", "comments": "4 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
