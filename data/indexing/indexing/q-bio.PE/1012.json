We show in\nthis paper that this model can be mapped into an influence dynamical process on\nnetworks subjected to external influences. The panmictic case considered by\nMoran corresponds to fully connected networks and can be completely solved in\nterms of hypergeometric functions. Other types of networks correspond to\nstructured populations, for which approximate solutions are also available.\nThis new approach to the classic Moran model leads to a relation between\nregular networks based on spatial grids and the mechanism of isolation by\ndistance. We discuss the consequences of this connection for topopatric\nspeciation and the theory of neutral speciation and biodiversity. We show that\nthe effect of mutations in structured populations, where individuals can mate\nonly with neighbors, is greatly enhanced with respect to the panmictic case. If\nmating is further constrained by genetic proximity between individuals, a\nbalance of opposing tendencies take place: increasing diversity promoted by\nenhanced effective mutations versus decreasing diversity promoted by similarity\nbetween mates. Stabilization occurs with speciation via pattern formation. We\nderive an explicit relation involving the parameters characterizing the\npopulation that indicates when speciation is possible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Dec 2010 15:59:27 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 Mar 2011 15:26:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 16 Apr 2011 00:20:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["de Aguiar", "Marcus A.

However, this\nextension relies heavily on mathematical peculiarities of the K3ST model, and\nproviding an analogous augmentation of the general Markov model has thus far\nbeen elusive. In this paper we rectify this shortcoming by showing how to\nextend the general Markov model on trees to to include arbitrary splits; and\neven further to more general network models. This is achieved by exploring the\nalgebra of the generators of the continuous-time Markov chain together with the\n\"splitting\" operator that generates the branching process on phylogenetic\ntrees. For simplicity we proceed by discussing the two state case and note that\nour results are easily extended to more states with little complication.\nIntriguingly, upon restriction of the two state general Markov model to the\nparameter space of the binary symmetric model, our extension is\nindistinguishable from the previous approach only on trees; as soon as any\nincompatible splits are introduced the two approaches give rise to differing\nprobability distributions with disparate structure. Through exploration of a\nsimple example, we give a tentative argument that our approach to extending to\nmore general networks has desirable properties that the previous approaches do\nnot share. In particular, our construction allows for the possibility of\nconvergent evolution of previously divergent lineages; a property that is of\nsignificant interest for biological applications.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Dec 2010 09:01:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Sumner", "J.

Despite the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence\nof HIV among MSM increases. In the long term the contradictory effects of risk\nbehavior and effective therapy are still poorly understood. Using a previously\npresented Complex Agent Network model, we describe steady and casual\npartnerships to predict the HIV spreading among MSM. Behavior-related\nparameters and values, inferred from studies on Amsterdam MSM, are fed into the\nmodel; we validate the model using historical yearly incidence data.\nSubsequently, we study scenarios to assess the contradictory effects of risk\nbehavior and effective therapy, by varying corresponding values of parameters.\nFinally, we conduct quantitative analysis based on the resulting incidence\ndata. The simulated incidence reproduces the ACS historical incidence well and\nhelps to predict the HIV epidemic among MSM in Amsterdam. Our results show that\nin the long run the positive influence of effective therapy can be outweighed\nby an increase in risk behavior of at least 30% for MSM.
