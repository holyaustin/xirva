Existing HMM-based imputation\napproaches require individual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method\nfor Gaussian imputation from summary association statistics, a type of data\nthat is becoming widely available. In simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G)\ndata, this method recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size for common\n(>5%) and low-frequency (1-5%) variants (increasing to 87% (60%) when summary\nLD information is available from target samples) versus 89% (67%) for HMM-based\nimputation, which cannot be applied to summary statistics. Our approach\naccounts for the limited sample size of the reference panel, a crucial step to\neliminate false-positive associations, and is computationally very fast. As an\nempirical demonstration, we apply our method to 7 case-control phenotypes from\nthe WTCCC data and a study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC).\nGaussian imputation from summary statistics recovers 95% (105%) of the\neffective sample size (as quantified by the ratio of $\\chi^2$ association\nstatistics) compared to HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes at\nthe 227 (176) published SNPs in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition,\nfor publicly available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of 4 lipid\ntraits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G SNPs, which\ncould not have been obtained using previously published methods, and\ndemonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the data. We show that 1000G\nimputation using our approach increases the magnitude and statistical evidence\nof enrichment at genic vs. non-genic loci for these traits, as compared to an\nanalysis without 1000G imputation.

In some respects culture appears\nto be Darwinian, i.e., a process of differential replication and selection\namongst randomly generated variants. This suggests that knowledge of biological\nevolution can be put to use to gain insight into culture. However, attempts to\napply Darwinian theory to culture have not yielded the kind of unifying\nframework for the social sciences that it provided for the biological sciences,\nlargely because of the nonrandom manner in which the mind-the hub of cultural\nchange-generates and assimilates novelty. This paper investigates how and when\nhumans became capable of supporting culture, and what previously held it back,\nfocusing on how we attained the creative powers we now possess. To invent in\nthe strategic, intuitive manner characteristic of humans requires a cognitive\narchitecture that supports the capacity to spontaneously adapt concepts to new\ncircumstances and merge them together to conceptualize new situations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 18 Sep 2013 17:22:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Jun 2019 02:27:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 5 Jul 2019 21:51:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-09", "authors_parsed": [["Gabora", "Liane", ""], ["Aerts", "Diederik", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.4761", "submitter": "Benjamin Greenbaum", "authors": "Benjamin Greenbaum, Pradeep Kumar, and Albert Libchaber", "title": "Amino Acid Distributions and the Effect of Optimal Growth Temperature", "comments": "31 pages, 7 Figures, 2 Tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We perform an exhaustive analysis of genome statistics for organisms,\nparticularly extremophiles, growing in a wide range of physicochemical\nconditions.

In this paper we\nstudy two fundamental questions of detection: first, given a snapshot view of a\n(perhaps vanishingly small) fraction of those infected, under what conditions\nis an epidemic spreading via contact (e.g., Influenza), distinguishable from a\n\"random illness\" operating independently of any contact network (e.g., seasonal\nallergies); second, if we do have an epidemic, under what conditions is it\npossible to determine which network of interactions is the main cause of the\nspread -- the causative network -- without any knowledge of the epidemic, other\nthan the identity of a minuscule subsample of infected nodes?\n  The core, therefore, of this paper, is to obtain an understanding of the\ndiagnostic power of network information. We derive sufficient conditions\nnetworks must satisfy for these problems to be identifiable, and produce\nefficient, highly scalable algorithms that solve these problems. We show that\nthe identifiability condition we give is fairly mild, and in particular, is\nsatisfied by two common graph topologies: the grid, and the Erdos-Renyi graphs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Sep 2013 15:33:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Milling", "Chris", ""], ["Caramanis", "Constantine", ""], ["Mannor", "Shie", ""], ["Shakkottai", "Sanjay", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6551", "submitter": "Alon Keinan", "authors": "Elodie Gazave, Li Ma, Diana Chang, Alex Coventry, Feng Gao, Donna\n  Muzny, Eric Boerwinkle, Richard Gibbs, Charles F.

Through analytical calculations and numerical\nsimulations we show that the heterogeneity of the length of stay alters the\nexpression of the threshold between local outbreak and global invasion, and,\nmoreover, it changes the epidemic behavior of the system in case of a global\noutbreak. Additionally, our theoretical framework allows us to study the effect\nof changes in the traveling behavior in response to the infection, by\nconsidering a scenario in which sick individuals do not leave their home\nlocation.

Here, we dissect the molecular\nmechanisms and functional pressures driving heterochromatin formation and\ndosage compensation of the recently formed neo-sex chromosomes of Drosophila\nmiranda. We show that the onset of heterochromatin formation on the neo-Y is\ntriggered by an accumulation of repetitive DNA. The neo-X has evolved partial\ndosage compensation and we find that diverse mutational paths have been\nutilized to establish several dozen novel binding consensus motifs for the\ndosage compensation complex on the neo-X, including simple point mutations at\npre-binding sites, insertion and deletion mutations, microsatellite expansions,\nor tandem amplification of weak binding sites. Spreading of these silencing or\nactivating chromatin modifications to adjacent regions results in massive\nmis-expression of neo-sex linked genes, and little correspondence between\nfunctionality of genes and their silencing on the neo-Y or dosage compensation\non the neo-X. Intriguingly, the genomic regions being targeted by the dosage\ncompensation complex on the neo-X and those becoming heterochromatic on the\nneo-Y show little overlap, possibly reflecting different propensities along the\nancestral chromosome to adopt active or repressive chromatin configurations.\nOur findings have broad implications for current models of sex chromosome\nevolution, and demonstrate how mechanistic constraints can limit evolutionary\nadaptations.

The distributions of commuting fluxes per link from both\nsources of data - mobile phones and census - are similar and highly correlated,\nhowever a systematic overestimation of commuting traffic in the mobile phone\ndata is observed. This leads to epidemics that spread faster than on census\ncommuting networks, however preserving the order of infection of newly infected\nlocations.
