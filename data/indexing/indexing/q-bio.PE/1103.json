Exploiting a correspondence between the propagation\ndynamics and a dynamical process performing progressive network generation, we\ndevelop an analytic approach that accurately captures the dynamical interaction\nbetween epidemics on overlay networks. The formalism allows for overlay\nnetworks with arbitrary joint degree distribution and overlap. To illustrate\nthe versatility of our approach, we consider a hypothetical delayed\nintervention scenario in which an immunizing agent is disseminated in a host\npopulation to hinder the propagation of an undesirable agent (e.g. the spread\nof preventive information in the context of an emerging infectious disease).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 21 Mar 2011 15:42:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Jun 2011 18:00:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Marceau", "Vincent", ""], ["No\u00ebl", "Pierre-Andr\u00e9", ""], ["H\u00e9bert-Dufresne", "Laurent", ""], ["Allard", "Antoine", ""], ["Dub\u00e9", "Louis J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1103.4339", "submitter": "Andrii Mironchenko", "authors": "Andrii Mironchenko and Jan Kozlowski", "title": "Optimal allocation patterns and optimal seed mass of a perennial plant", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.SY math.OC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present a novel optimal allocation model for perennial plants, in which\nassimilates are not allocated directly to vegetative or reproductive parts but\ninstead go first to a storage compartment from where they are then optimally\nredistributed.

Aging is prejudicial to the individual and evolutionary forces should\nprevent it, but many species show signs of senescence as individuals age. Here,\nI will propose a model for aging based on assumptions that are compatible with\nevolutionary theory: i) competition is between individuals; ii) there is some\ndegree of locality, so quite often competition will between parents and their\nprogeny; iii) optimal conditions are not stationary, mutation helps each\nspecies to keep competitive. When conditions change, a senescent species can\ndrive immortal competitors to extinction. This counter-intuitive result arises\nfrom the pruning caused by the death of elder individuals. When there is change\nand mutation, each generation is slightly better adapted to the new conditions,\nbut some older individuals survive by random chance. Senescence can eliminate\nthose from the genetic pool. Even though individual selection forces always win\nover group selection ones, it is not exactly the individual that is selected,\nbut its lineage. While senescence damages the individuals and has an\nevolutionary cost, it has a benefit of its own. It allows each lineage to adapt\nfaster to changing conditions.
