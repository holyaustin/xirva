Moreover, a sufficiently effective toxin inhibits the\nsusceptible species to such a degree that an `inhibition zone' is formed\nseparating the two colonies. In the special case of truly non-motile bacteria,\ni.e. with zero bacterial diffusivity, we derive analytical expressions\ndescribing the bacterial distributions and size of the inhibition zone.

This asymptotic wavespeed is independent of interspecific\ncompetition and due to the formation of the inhibition zone; when the colonies\nare thus separated, there is no longer direct competition between the two\nspecies and the producer can invade effectively unimpeded by its competitor. We\nnote that the minimum toxin strength required to produce an inhibition zone\nincreases rapidly with increasing bacterial diffusivity, suggesting that even\nmoderately motile bacteria must produce very strong toxins if they are to\nbenefit in this way.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Mar 2019 21:48:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 13 Mar 2019 09:51:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 18 Jul 2019 15:52:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-23", "authors_parsed": [["Dean", "Andrew D.", ""], ["Horsburgh", "Malcolm J.", ""], ["Vasiev", "Bakhti", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.04795", "submitter": "Anne Modat", "authors": "Nadir Birmani, Saima Naz, Gabriel Mouahid (IHPE)", "title": "First Record of Echinoparyphium recurvatum (Trematoda, Echinostomatidae)\n  in Pakistan with New Avian Definitive Host, Vanellus leucurus", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Archives on Veterinary Science and Technology, Gavin Publishers,\n  2019", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Parasitological examinations of White-tailed Lapwing Vanellus leucurus\n(Charadriiformes: Charadriidae) collected from Dadu district (Sindh Province,\nSouthern Pakistan) were carried out at the Department of Zoology, University of\nSindh, Jamshoro.

In order to abstract from the details of measuring\ndistances, we define reciprocal best matches here as pairwise most closely\nrelated leaves in a gene tree, arguing that conceptually this is the notion\nthat is pragmatically approximated by distance- or similarity-based heuristics.\nWe start by showing that a graph $G$ is an RBMG if and only if its quotient\ngraph w.r.t.\\ a certain thinness relation is an RBMG. Furthermore, it is\nnecessary and sufficient that all connected components of $G$ are RBMGs.

Some argue that failing to find reciprocal food sharing means\nthat some process other than reciprocity must be occurring, whereas others\nargue for models that allow reciprocity to span domains in the form of trade.2\nMultilayer networks, high-dimensional networks that allow us to consider\nmultiple sets of relationships at the same time, are ubiquitous and have\nconsequences, so processes giving rise to them are important social phenomena.\nThe analysis of multi-dimensional social networks has recently garnered the\nattention of the network science community.3 Recent models of these processes\nshow how ignoring layer interdependencies can lead one to miss why a layer\nformed the way it did, and/or draw erroneous conclusions.6 Understanding the\nstructuring processes that underlie multiplex networks will help understand\nincreasingly rich datasets, giving more accurate and complete pictures of\nsocial interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Mar 2019 22:40:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2020 17:27:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Atkisson", "Curtis", ""], ["G\u00f3rski", "Piotr J.", ""], ["Jackson", "Matthew O.", ""], ["Ho\u0142yst", "Janusz A.", ""], ["D'Souza", "Raissa M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.11373", "submitter": "Dalit Engelhardt", "authors": "Dalit Engelhardt", "title": "Dynamic Control of Stochastic Evolution: A Deep Reinforcement Learning\n  Approach to Adaptively Targeting Emergent Drug Resistance", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Machine Learning Research 21(203): 1-30, 2020", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The challenge in controlling stochastic systems in which low-probability\nevents can set the system on catastrophic trajectories is to develop a robust\nability to respond to such events without significantly compromising the\noptimality of the baseline control policy. This paper presents CelluDose, a\nstochastic simulation-trained deep reinforcement learning adaptive feedback\ncontrol prototype for automated precision drug dosing targeting stochastic and\nheterogeneous cell proliferation. Drug resistance can emerge from random and\nvariable mutations in targeted cell populations; in the absence of an\nappropriate dosing policy, emergent resistant subpopulations can proliferate\nand lead to treatment failure. Dynamic feedback dosage control holds promise in\ncombatting this phenomenon, but the application of traditional control\napproaches to such systems is fraught with challenges due to the complexity of\ncell dynamics, uncertainty in model parameters, and the need in medical\napplications for a robust controller that can be trusted to properly handle\nunexpected outcomes. Here, training on a sample biological scenario identified\nsingle-drug and combination therapy policies that exhibit a 100% success rate\nat suppressing cell proliferation and responding to diverse system\nperturbations while establishing low-dose no-event baselines.

Human activities such as fishing\ntogether with environmental drivers (e.g. climate change) are triggering major\nthreats to marine biodiversity, and impact directly the services they provide.\nIn the South and Southwest coasts of Portugal, the deep-water crustacean trawl\nfishery is not exemption. This fishery is recognized to have large effects on a\nnumber of species while generating high rates of unwanted catches. However,\ntaking into account an ecosystem-based perspective, the fishing impacts along\nthe food web accounting for biological interactions between and among species\ncaught remains poorly understood. These impacts are particularly troubling and\nare a cause of concern given the cascading effects that might arise. Facing the\nmain policies and legislative instruments for the restoration and conservation\nof the marine environment, times are calling for implementing ecosystem-based\napproaches to fisheries management. To this end, we use a food web modelling\n(Ecopath with Ecosim) approach to assess the fishing impacts of this particular\nfishery on the marine ecosystem of southern and southwestern Portugal. In\nparticular, we describe the food web structure and functioning, identify the\nmain keystone species and/or groups, quantify the major trophic and energy\nflows, and ultimately assess the impact of fishing on the target species but\nalso on the ecosystem by means of ecological and ecosystem-based indicators.\nFinally, we examine limitations and weaknesses of the model for potential\nimprovements and future research directions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Mar 2019 14:48:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-28", "authors_parsed": [["Torres", "Maria Angeles", ""], ["Fonseca", "Paulo", ""], ["Erzini", "Karim", ""], ["Borges", "Teresa Cerveira", ""], ["Campos", "Aida", ""], ["Castro", "Margarida", ""], ["Santos", "Jorge", ""], ["Costa", "Maria Esmeralda", ""], ["Marcalo", "Ana", ""], ["Oliveira", "Nuno", ""], ["Vingada", "Jose", ""]]}, {"id": "1903.11627", "submitter": "Gabriel Birzu", "authors": "Gabriel Birzu, Sakib Matin, Oskar Hallatschek and Kirill S.

The dependence, however, switches to a sublinear power law\nand then to a linear increase as the density-dependence becomes strongly\npositive. We develop a unified framework revealing that the transitions between\ndifferent regimes of diversity loss are controlled by a single, universal\nparameter: the ratio of the expansion velocity to the geometric mean of\ndispersal and growth rates at expansion edge.
