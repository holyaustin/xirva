The model is based on predator-prey\ninteractions between a host plants and their pathogens. Such interactions are\noften frequency-dependent, so that pathogen attack is focused on the most\nabundant plant phenotype, while rare plant types may escape pathogen attack.\nThus, frequency dependence can generate disruptive selection, which can give\nrise to speciation if distant phenotypes become reproductively isolated. Based\non recent experimental evidence from {\\it Arabidopsis}, we assume that at the\nmolecular level, incompatibility between strains is caused by epistatic\ninteractions between two proteins in the plant immune system, the guard and the\nguardee. Within each plant strain, immune reactions occur when the guardee\nprotein is modified by a pathogen effector, and the guard subsequently binds to\nthe guardee, thus precipitating an immune response. However, when guard and\nguardee proteins come from phenotypically distant parents, a hybrid's immune\nsystem can be triggered by erroneous interactions between these proteins even\nin the absence of pathogen attack, leading to severe autoimmune reactions in\nhybrids.

The population is\ndescribed by a continuous limit of the stepping stone model, which leads to the\nstochastic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscounov equation with additional terms\ndescribing mutations. Although the stepping stone model was first proposed for\npopulation genetics, it is closely related to \"voter models\" of interest in\nnonequilibrium statistical mechanics.

This segregation slows down genetic drift and\nselection because these two evolutionary forces can only act at the boundaries\nbetween the domains; the effects of mutation, however, are not significantly\naffected by the segregation. Although fixation in the neutral well-mixed (or\n\"zero dimensional\") model occurs exponentially in time, it occurs only\nalgebraically fast in the one-dimensional model. If selection is weak,\nselective sweeps occur exponentially fast in both well-mixed and\none-dimensional populations, but the time constants are different.
