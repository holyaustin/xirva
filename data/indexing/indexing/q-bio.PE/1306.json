The approach involves the transgenic\nexpression of a misfolded mutant of human preproinsulin, hINSC96Y, which is a\ncause of the disease. When expressed in fly imaginal discs, hINSC96Y causes a\nreduction of adult structures, including the eye, wing and notum. Eye imaginal\ndiscs exhibit defects in both the structure and arrangement of ommatidia. In\nthe wing, expression of hINSC96Y leads to ectopic expression of veins and\nmechano-sensory organs, indicating disruption of wild type signaling processes\nregulating cell fates. These readily measurable disease phenotypes are\nsensitive to temperature, gene dose and sex. Mutant (but not wild type)\nproinsulin expression in the eye imaginal disc induces IRE1-mediated Xbp1\nalternative splicing, a signal for endoplasmic reticulum stress response\nactivation, and produces global change in gene expression. Mutant hINS\ntransgene tester strains, when crossed to stocks from the Drosophila Genetic\nReference Panel produces F1 adults with a continuous range of disease\nphenotypes and large broad-sense heritability. Surprisingly, the severity of\nmutant hINS-induced disease in the eye is not correlated with that in the notum\nin these crosses, nor with eye reduction phenotypes caused by the expression of\ntwo dominant eye mutants acting in two different eye development pathways, Drop\n(Dr) or Lobe (L) when crossed into the same genetic backgrounds. The tissue\nspecificity of genetic variability for mutant hINS-induced disease thus has its\nown distinct signature. The genetic dominance of disease-specific phenotypic\nvariability makes this approach amenable to genome-wide association study\n(GWAS) in a simple F1 screen of natural variation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 May 2013 20:55:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Soo-Young", ""], ["Ludwig", "Michael Z.", ""], ["Tamarina", "Natalia A.", ""], ["He", "Bin Z.", ""], ["Carl", "Sarah H.", ""], ["Dickerson", "Desiree A.", ""], ["Barse", "Levi", ""], ["Arun", "Bharath", ""], ["Williams", "Calvin", ""], ["Miles", "Cecelia M.", ""], ["Philipson", "Louis H.", ""], ["Steiner", "Donald F.", ""], ["Bell", "Graeme I.", ""], ["Kreitman", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.0069", "submitter": "Stephen Montgomery-Smith", "authors": "Stephen Montgomery-Smith, Francis J.

The focus of this work is on the block model introduced by A.S.\nPerelson and C.A. Macken [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 92:9657 (1995)] where the\ngenome is decomposed into disjoint sets of loci (`modules') that contribute\nindependently to fitness, and fitness values within blocks are assigned at\nrandom. We show that the number of accessible paths can be written as a product\nof the path numbers within the blocks, which provides a detailed analytic\ndescription of the path statistics. The block model can be viewed as a special\ncase of Kauffman's NK-model, and we compare the analytic results to simulations\nof the NK-model with different genetic architectures. We find that the mean\nnumber of accessible paths in the different versions of the model are quite\nsimilar, but the distribution of the path number is qualitatively different in\nthe block model due to its multiplicative structure. A similar statement\napplies to the number of local fitness maxima in the NK-models, which has been\nstudied extensively in previous works. The overall evolutionary accessibility\nof the landscape, as quantified by the probability to find at least one\naccessible path to the global maximum, is dramatically lowered by the modular\nstructure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2013 16:02:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Oct 2013 10:14:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 12:45:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Schmiegelt", "Benjamin", ""], ["Krug", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.2029", "submitter": "Karthik Shekhar", "authors": "Karthik Shekhar, Claire F.

To encourage rational individuals to make\nvoluntary contributions, a government or other social organizations can offer\nrewards, to be shared among the volunteers.

Furthermore, at\nthese intermediate reward levels, we find a hysteresis effect such that\nincreasing or decreasing group sizes can trigger different social outcomes. In\nparticular, when group size is increased, the fraction of volunteers first\nincreases gradually before jumping up abruptly; when group size is then\ndecreased again, the fraction of volunteers not only remains high, but even\ncontinues to increase. As the shared reward is increased beyond a critical\nlevel, the bi-stability underlying this hysteresis effect vanishes altogether,\nand only a single social outcome remains, corresponding to the stable\ncoexistence of volunteers and non-volunteers.

Our analysis explain how a circular\nshape and fringes are formed, and how the aridity level influences the size of\nthe fairy circles. In agreement with field observation, these theoretical\nfindings, provide a link between a strong non-local interaction of plants and\nthe formation of stable fairy circles. Finally, we show that the proposed\nmechanism is model-independent: indeed, it also applies to the\nreaction-diffusion type of model that emphasises the influence of water\ntransport on the vegetation dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 20 Jun 2013 12:26:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Fernandez-Oto", "C.", ""], ["Tlidi", "M.", ""], ["Escaff", "D.", ""], ["Clerc", "M.

Models of composite\nsearch can generate predictions about how optimal foragers should behave in\neach search mode, and how they should determine when to switch between search\nmodes. Most of these models assume that foragers use resource encounters to\ndecide when to switch between search modes. Empirical observations indicate\nthat a variety of organisms use non-directional sensory cues to identify areas\nthat warrant intensive search. These cues are not precise enough to allow a\nforager to directly orient itself to a resource, but can be used as a criterion\nto determine the appropriate search mode. As a potential example, a forager\nmight use olfactory information, which could help it determine if an area is\nworth searching carefully. We developed a model of composite search based on\nnon-directional sensory cues. With simulations, we compared the search\nefficiencies of composite foragers that use resource encounters as their\nmode-switching criterion with those that use non-directional sensory cues. We\nidentified optimal search patterns and mode-switching criteria on a variety of\nresource distributions, characterized by different levels of resource\naggregation and density. On all resource distributions, foraging strategies\nbased on the non-directional sensory criterion were more efficient than those\nbased on the resource encounter criterion. Strategies based on the\nnon-directional sensory criterion were also more robust to changes in resource\ndistribution. Our results suggest that current assumptions about the role of\nresource encounters in models of optimal composite search should be\nre-examined.

But as long as the sex\nratio maximizes the local equilibrium density for given mortality rates, a\ncommon homogeneous distribution for both sexes that spans a critical distance\nyields a similarly low cost.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 16:04:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Molnar", "F.", "Jr"], ["Caragine", "C.", ""], ["Caraco", "T.", ""], ["Korniss", "G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1306.6313", "submitter": "Jack O'Brien", "authors": "John O'Brien and Xavier Didelot and Zamin Iqbal and LucasAmenga-Etego\n  and Bartu Ahiska and Daniel Falush", "title": "A Bayesian approach to inferring the phylogenetic structure of\n  communities from metagenomic data", "comments": "25 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Metagenomics provides a powerful new tool set for investigating evolutionary\ninteractions with the environment.
