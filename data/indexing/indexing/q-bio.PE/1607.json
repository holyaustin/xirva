A\nfull solution to this problem for an arbitrary K x K mutation rate matrix\ninvolves solving for the stationary solution of a forward Kolmogorov equation\nover a (K - 1)-dimensional simplex, and remains intractable. In most practical\nsituations mutations rates are slow on the scale of the diffusion limit and the\nsolution is heavily concentrated on the corners and edges of the simplex. In\nthis paper we present a practical approximate solution for slow mutation rates\nin the form of a set of line densities along the edges of the simplex. The\nmethod of solution relies on parameterising the general non-reversible rate\nmatrix as the sum of a reversible part and a set of (K - 1)(K - 2)/2\nindependent terms corresponding to fluxes of probability along closed paths\naround faces of the simplex.

Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents,\nlike bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of\ndefectors that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the host. In turn,\nthe latter is composed of cells, mapped to a population of cooperators, that\naim to kill pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells is fundamental for the\nemergence of the living functions of the whole organism, since each one\ncontributes to a specific set of tasks. So, broadly speaking, their\ncontribution can be viewed as a form of energy. When bacteria are spatially\nclose to a cell, the latter can use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On\nthe other hand, when bacteria survive an attack, they absorb the received\nenergy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition,\nsince bacteria play as defectors, their unique target is to increase their\nwealth, without supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the\nhost temperature plays a relevant role in the host-pathogen equilibrium. For\ninstance, in animals like human beings, a neural mechanism triggers the\nincreasing of the body temperature in order to activate the immune system.\nHere, cooperators succeed once bacteria are completely removed while, in the\nopposite scenario, the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood\npoisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the\nproposed model allow to reach a variety of states. At a very high level of\nabstraction, some of these states seem to be similar to those that can be\nobserved in some living systems. Therefore, to conclude, we deem that our model\nmight be exploited for studying further biological phenomena.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 19:22:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 15:48:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-03", "authors_parsed": [["Javarone", "Marco Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.01008", "submitter": "Pamela P.

While size-spectrum models have\nexplained this phenomenon for assemblages of multicellular organisms, this\npaper introduces a species-resolved size-spectrum model to explain the\nphenomenon in unicellular plankton. A Sheldon spectrum spanning the cell-size\nrange of unicellular plankton necessarily consists of a large number of\ncoexisting species covering a wide range of characteristic sizes. The\ncoexistence of many phytoplankton species feeding on a small number of\nresources is known as the Paradox of the Plankton. Our model resolves the\nparadox by showing that coexistence is facilitated by the allometric scaling of\nfour physiological rates. Two of the allometries have empirical support, the\nremaining two emerge from predator-prey interactions exactly when the\nabundances follow a Sheldon spectrum. Our plankton model is a scale-invariant\ntrait-based size-spectrum model: it describes the abundance of phyto- and\nzooplankton cells as a function of both size and species trait (the maximal\nsize before cell division). It incorporates growth due to resource consumption\nand predation on smaller cells, death due to predation, and a flexible cell\ndivision process. We give analytic solutions at steady state for both the\nwithin-species size distributions and the relative abundances across species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 14 Jul 2016 15:00:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cuesta", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""], ["Delius", "Gustav W.", ""], ["Law", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.04269", "submitter": "Attila Szolnoki", "authors": "Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Zealots tame oscillations in the spatial rock-paper-scissors game", "comments": "6 two-column pages, 4 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E", "journal-ref": "Phys.

In this paper, we use occupancy data to\nmeasure habitat quality and habitat selection response for the Puerto Rican\nVireo, an endemic songbird whose population growth is depressed by brood\nparasitism from the Shiny Cowbird. We were interested in how vireo habitat\nquality and vireo habitat selection varied among three land uses (forest,\nshaded coffee plantations, and sun coffee) in Puerto Rico. We estimated vireo\noccupancy probability as a measure of habitat selection, and the probability of\ncowbird occurrence given vireo presence as a measure of habitat quality.

Vireos preferentially selected forested\nsites and shaded coffee sites over sun coffee sites. By our measure of habitat\nquality, either type of coffee plantation was poor quality, and the forested\nsites were high quality.

In this\nlimit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by\nmutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored\nthrough mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the\nprobabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a\npopulation, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities\nof allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used\nin population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an\nextension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.\nAlthough our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which\nalleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of\nlandscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more\ntractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from\nsequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and\nselection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.\nTherefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key\nevolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving\npopulations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our\ntheory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the\ninfinite allele limit and the \"full connectivity\" assumption in which each\nallele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework\nestablishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from\nsamples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2016 20:53:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Khromov", "Pavel", ""], ["Malliaris", "Constantin D.", ""], ["Morozov", "Alexandre V.", ""]]}, {"id": "1607.07970", "submitter": "Krzysztof Bartoszek", "authors": "Krzysztof Bartoszek, Sylvain Gl\\'emin, Ingemar Kaj, Martin Lascoux", "title": "The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with migration: evolution with\n  interactions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology 429:35-45, 2017", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.011", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.PR stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process plays a major role in the analysis of the\nevolution of phenotypic traits along phylogenies.

We furthermore\npresent a detailed simulation study that clearly indicates the adverse effects\nof ignoring migration. Similarity between species due to migration could be\nmisinterpreted as very strong convergent evolution without proper correction\nfor these additional dependencies. Our model can also be useful for studying\nlocal adaptation among populations within the same species.

Depending on the number of defectors within a group, a\ntolerant player can either cooperate in or abstain from a particular instance\nof the game. We show that the diversity of tolerance can give rise to\nsynergistic effects, wherein players with a different threshold in terms of the\ntolerated number of defectors in a group compete most effectively against\ndefection and default abstinence. Such synergistic associations can stabilise\nstates of full cooperation where otherwise defection would dominate.
