Analysis and interpretation of such data represents a challenge: the\ntiming of animal behaviors may be stochastic and modulated by kinematic\nvariables, by the interaction with the environment or with the conspecifics\nwithin the animal group, and dependent on internal cognitive or behavioral\nstate of the individual. Existing models for collective motion typically fail\nto incorporate the discrete, stochastic, and internal-state-dependent aspects\nof behavior, while models focusing on individual animal behavior typically\nignore the spatial aspects of the problem. Here we propose a probabilistic\nmodeling framework to address this gap. Each animal can switch stochastically\nbetween different behavioral states, with each state resulting in a possibly\ndifferent law of motion through space. Switching rates for behavioral\ntransitions can depend in a very general way, which we seek to identify from\ndata, on the effects of the environment as well as the interaction between the\nanimals. We represent the switching dynamics as a Generalized Linear Model and\nshow that: (i) forward simulation of multiple interacting animals is possible\nusing a variant of the Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm; (ii)\nformulated properly, the maximum likelihood inference of switching rate\nfunctions is tractably solvable by gradient descent; (iii) model selection can\nbe used to identify factors that modulate behavioral state switching and to\nappropriately adjust model complexity to data.

We explore the properties of\nsampled ecological networks by simulating large-scale ecological networks with\npredetermined topologies, and sampling them with different mathematical\nprocedures. Several types of modular networks were generated, intended to\nrepresent a wide variety of communities that vary in size and types of\necological interactions.

Networks with random or scale-free modules require more\ncomplete sampling compared to networks whose modules are nested or bipartite.\nOverall, the structure of nested modules was the easiest to detect, regardless\nof sampling design. Sampling according to species degree was consistently found\nto be the most accurate strategy to estimate network structure.

Yet an open\nproblem is to transition between BHV tree spaces of different maximal\ndimension, where each maximal dimension corresponds to the complete set of\nedge-weighted trees with a fixed number of leaves. We show a combinatorial\nmethod to transition between copies of BHV tree spaces in which trees with\ndifferent numbers of taxa can be studied, derived from its topological\nstructure and geometric properties. This method removes obstacles for embedding\nproblems such as supertree and consensus methods in the BHV treespace\nframework.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 19:51:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 3 Dec 2017 20:44:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ren", "Yingying", ""], ["Zha", "Sihan", ""], ["Bi", "Jingwen", ""], ["Sanchez", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""], ["Monical", "Cara", ""], ["Delcourt", "Michelle", ""], ["Guzman", "Rosemary", ""], ["Davidson", "Ruth", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.02686", "submitter": "Daniel Juliano Pamplona Da Silva", "authors": "Daniel Juliano Pamplona da Silva, Renato Pacheco Villar, Lorielen\n  Calixto Ramos", "title": "Isolation effects in a system of two mutually communicating identical\n  patches", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Starting from the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovskii-Piskunov equation (FKPP) we\nmodel the dynamic of a diffusive system with two mutually communicating\nidentical patches and isolated of the remaining matrix.

Here we study the problem of front propagation in this\nsystem, comparing the stochastic dynamics to the heuristic approximation of\nthis system by a deterministic system where the linear growth term is cut off\nbelow some critical density. Of particular interest is the nontrivial pattern\nleft behind the front. For large population density, or small cutoff, there is\na constant velocity wave propagating from the populated region to the\nunpopulated region. As in the local Fisher equation, the spreading velocity is\nmuch lower than the Fisher velocity which is the spreading velocity for\ninfinite population size. The stochastic simulations give approximately the\nsame spreading velocity as the deterministic simulation with appropriate birth\ncutoff. When the population density is small enough, there is a different\nmechanism of population spreading. The population is concentrated on clusters\nwhich divide and separate. This mode of spreading has small spreading velocity,\ndecaying exponentially with the range of the interaction kernel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 17 Aug 2017 05:25:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-04-25", "authors_parsed": [["Ganan", "Yehuda A.", ""], ["Kessler", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.05453", "submitter": "Mikhail Tikhonov", "authors": "Mikhail Tikhonov, Remi Monasson", "title": "Innovation rather than improvement: a solvable high-dimensional model\n  highlights the limitations of scalar fitness", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures + Supplementary Material", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s10955-018-1956-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.stat-mech", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Much of our understanding of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms derives\nfrom analysis of low-dimensional models: with few interacting species, or few\naxes defining \"fitness\".

The test, available as part of the ASTRAL package, can help\nsystematists decide whether their datasets are sufficient to resolve specific\nrelationships of interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 02:25:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 04:08:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 2 Dec 2017 01:22:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 7 Feb 2018 03:52:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Sayyari", "Erfan", ""], ["Mirarab", "Siavash", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.08944", "submitter": "William DeWitt", "authors": "William S.

As experimentally documented, the proper development of\na colony is related to the nest temperature, whose value is maintained around\nthe optimal value if the colony population is sufficiently large. Then, the\nenvironmental temperature, the way in which this influence the nest temperature\nand the colony population size, are variables closely linked to each other and\ndeserve to be taken into account in a model that aims to describe the\npopulation dynamics. In the present study, as first step, the continuous-time\nautonomous system proposed by Khoury, Myerscoug and Barron (KMB) in 2011 was\napproximated by means a Nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) scheme in order to\nobtain a set of autonomous difference equations. Subsequently, with the aim to\nintroduce the seasonal effects, a nonautonomous version (NAKMB) was proposed\nand formulated in discrete-time domain via a NSFD scheme, by introducing a\ntime-dependent formulation for the queen bee laying rate and the recruitment\nrate coefficients. By means the phase-plane analysis was possible to deduce\nthat, with an appropriate choice of the parameters, the NAKMB model admits both\na limit cycle at nonzero population size and an equilibrium point marking the\ncolony collapse, depending on the initial population size.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 18:21:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gabbriellini", "Gianluca", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09462", "submitter": "Majid Jaberi-Douraki", "authors": "Majid Jaberi Douraki", "title": "Continuous and discrete dynamics of a deterministic model of HIV\n  infection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We will study a mathematical model of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\ninfection in the presence of combination therapy that includes within-host\ninfectious dynamics. The deterministic model requires us to analyze asymptotic\nstability of two distinct steady states, disease-free and endemic equilibria.\nPrevious results have focused on investigating the global asymptotic stability\nof the trivial steady state using an implicit finite-difference method which\ngenerates a system of difference equations. We, instead, provide analytic\nsolutions and long term attractive behavior for the endemic steady state using\nthe theory of difference equations. The dynamics of estimated model is\nappropriately determined by a certain quantity threshold maintaining the immune\nresponse to a sufficient level. The result also indicates that a forward\nbifurcation in the model happens when the disease-free equilibrium loses its\nstability and a stable endemic equilibrium appears as the basic reproduction\nnumber exceeds unity. In this scenario, the classical requirement of the\nreproduction number being less than unity becomes a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for disease mitigation. When the associated reproduction number is in\nexcess of unity, a stable endemic equilibrium emerges with an unstable\ndisease-free equilibrium (leading to the persistence and existence of HIV\nwithin the infected individuals). The attractivity of the model reveals that\nthe disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under certain\nassumptions. A comparison between the continuous and estimated discrete models\nis also provided to have a clear perception in understanding the behavioral\ndynamics of disease modelling. Finally, we show that the associated estimation\nmethod is very robust in the sense of numerical stability since the equilibria\nand the stability conditions are independent of the time step.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 20:43:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 14:01:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Douraki", "Majid Jaberi", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09646", "submitter": "David A.

Here we compare the results of two\noperator-splitting techniques suggested for simulating the corresponding\nLangevin equation, one by Pechenik and Levine (PL) and the other by Dornic,\nChat\\'e and Mu\\~noz (DCM). We identify an anomalously strong bias toward the\nactive phase in the numerical scheme of DCM, a bias which is not present in the\nalternative scheme of PL. This bias strongly distorts the phase diagram\ndetermined via the DCM procedure for the range of time-steps used in such\nsimulations. We pinpoint the underlying cause in the inclusion of the\ndiffusion, treated as an on-site decay with a constant external source, in the\nstochastic part of the algorithm. Treating the diffusion deterministically is\nshown to remove this unwanted bias while keeping the simulation algorithm\nstable, thus a hybrid numerical technique, in which the DCM approach to\ndiffusion is applied but the diffusion is simulated deterministically, appears\nto be optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 10:06:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-12", "authors_parsed": [["Weissmann", "Haim", ""], ["Shnerb", "Nadav M.", ""], ["Kessler", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1708.09665", "submitter": "Peter Czuppon", "authors": "Peter Czuppon and Arne Traulsen", "title": "Fixation probabilities in populations under demographic fluctuations", "comments": "31 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematical Biology, 2018", "doi": "10.1007/s00285-018-1251-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  We study the fixation probability of a mutant type when introduced into a\nresident population.
