These interactions can\nbe abstracted as patterns of connections among distinct units such as genes,\nproteins, individual organisms, or species which form a hierarchy of biological\norganisation. Connections in this hierarchy are arranged in a nested structure:\ngene and protein networks shape phenotypic traits and together constitute\nindividuals, individuals are embedded within populations, populations within\ncommunities, and communities within ecosystems. This pervasive \"nestedness\" of\nnetworks can result in propagation of the effects from within-level\ninteractions at one level to units at higher or lower levels of organization.\nThe concept of nested biological networks is implicit in a variety of\ndisciplines ranging from the study of genetic circuits regulating phenotypic\ntrait expression (Babu et al. 2004), to the study of predator-prey interactions\ninfluencing community composition (Poisot et al. 2016). However, studies\ntypically only address interactions within and among directly neighbouring\nhierarchical levels, such as genotypes and phenotypic traits, or populations\nand communities. Here, we formalise nested networks as having nodes that can\ncontain, or be embedded in, other nodes, and where edges can bridge connections\nbetween sets of embedded nodes. We then argue that explicitly accounting for\nnetwork nestedness across levels of organization will encourage integrative\nthinking on new interdisciplinary research fronts. We focus on two phenomena in\nparticular: (i) indirect connections among units can arise from the structure\nof connections at higher or lower levels of organisation, (ii) the propagation\nof effects across neighbouring hierarchical levels of organization.

We propose that the (hitherto implicit) goal of the\ntopological approach to recombination is the estimation of novelty profiles. We\nthen study the problem of obtaining a lower bound on the novelty profile using\nbarcodes. We focus on a low-recombination regime, where the evolutionary\nhistory can be described by a directed acyclic graph called a galled tree,\nwhich differs from a tree only by isolated topological defects. We show that in\nthis regime, under a complete sampling assumption, the $1^\\mathrm{st}$ barcode\nyields a lower bound on the novelty profile, and hence on the number of\nrecombination events. For $i>1$, the $i^{\\mathrm{th}}$ barcode is empty. In\naddition, we use a stability principle to strengthen these results to ones\nwhich hold for any subsample of an arbitrary evolutionary history. To establish\nthese results, we describe the topology of the Vietoris--Rips filtrations\narising from evolutionary histories indexed by galled trees. As a step towards\na probabilistic theory, we also show that for a random history indexed by a\nfixed galled tree and satisfying biologically reasonable conditions, the\nintervals of the $1^{\\mathrm{st}}$ barcode are independent random variables.\nUsing simulations, we explore the sensitivity of these intervals to\nrecombination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Apr 2018 14:56:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:46:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["Lesnick", "Michael", ""], ["Rabad\u00e1n", "Ra\u00fal", ""], ["Rosenbloom", "Daniel I.

In Part I of this paper, we provide a unified\nframework for measuring, comparing and partitioning diversity that incorporates\nall of these aspects. A new principle called the Nesting Principle is\nestablished, stating that diversity remains invariant under arbitrary nesting\nor partitioning of the constituent categories or individual elements. An\nimportant consequence of this principle is that the weight on the category\nprevalence must be set such that the diversity function depends quadratically\non the relative abundances of categories, while the other weight on the\nbetween-category dissimilarity can be adjusted independently and continuously.\nThe resulting diversity index has a unique interpretation in terms of a certain\ncorrelation sum defined within the assemblage whose diversity is to be\nmeasured. The formula for the effective dissimilarity between two arbitrary\nassemblages is also provided, which takes the form of a cross-correlation sum,\nand is compatible with the Nesting Principle.

These differ markedly in several aspects but\nnevertheless must encode proteins that are compatible with one another. Here we\nintroduce a network model of the hypothetical co-evolution of the two most\ncommon modes of cellular division for reproduction: by mitosis (supporting\nasexual reproduction) and by meiosis (supporting sexual reproduction). Our\nmodel is based on a random hypergraph, with two nodes for each possible\ngenotype, each encompassing both ncDNA and mtDNA. One of the nodes is\nnecessarily generated by mitosis occurring at a parent genotype, the other by\nmeiosis occurring at two parent genotypes. A genotype's fitness depends on the\ncompatibility of its ncDNA and mtDNA. The model has two probability parameters,\n$p$ and $r$, the former accounting for the diversification of ncDNA during\nmeiosis, the latter for the diversification of mtDNA accompanying both meiosis\nand mitosis. Another parameter, $\\lambda$, is used to regulate the relative\nrate at which mitosis- and meiosis-generated genotypes are produced. We have\nfound that, even though $p$ and $r$ do affect the existence of evolutionary\npathways in the network, the crucial parameter regulating the coexistence of\nthe two modes of cellular division is $\\lambda$. Depending on genotype size,\n$\\lambda$ can be valued so that either mode of cellular division prevails. Our\nstudy is closely related to a recent hypothesis that views the appearance of\ncellular division by meiosis, as opposed to division by mitosis, as an\nevolutionary strategy for boosting ncDNA diversification to keep up with that\nof mtDNA. Our results indicate that this may well have been the case, thus\nlending support to the first hypothesis in the field to take into account the\nrole of such ubiquitous and essential organelles as mitochondria.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Apr 2018 13:33:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Barbosa", "Valmir C.", ""], ["Donangelo", "Raul", ""], ["Souza", "Sergio R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1804.10964", "submitter": "Frederick Matsen IV", "authors": "Branden J.

The \"Lie closure\" of a set of matrices is the smallest\nmatrix Lie algebra which contains the set. In the context of Markov chain\ntheory, if a set of rate matrices form a Lie algebra, their corresponding\nMarkov matrices are closed under matrix multiplication; this has been found to\nbe a useful property in phylogenetics. Inspired by previous research involving\nLie closures of DNA models, it was hypothesised that finding the Lie closure of\na codon model could help to solve the problem of mis-estimation of the\nnon-synonymous/synonymous rate ratio, $ \\omega $. We propose two different\nmethods of finding a linear space from a model: the first is the \\emph{linear\nclosure} which is the smallest linear space which contains the model, and the\nsecond is the \\emph{linear version} which changes multiplicative constraints in\nthe model to additive ones. For each of these linear spaces we then find the\nLie closures of them. Under both methods, it was found that closed codon models\nwould require thousands of parameters, and that any partial solution to this\nproblem that was of a reasonable size violated stochasticity. Investigation of\ntoy models indicated that finding the Lie closure of matrix linear spaces which\ndeviated only slightly from a simple model resulted in a Lie closure that was\nclose to having the maximum number of parameters possible. Given that Lie\nclosures are not practical, we propose further consideration of the two\nvariants of linearly closed models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2018 00:43:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 8 May 2018 05:52:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 6 Aug 2020 00:54:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Shore", "Julia A.", ""], ["Sumner", "Jeremy G.", ""], ["Holland", "Barbara R.", ""]]}]
