Mapping out the\nantibody-antigen affinity landscape can give us insight into the accessible\npaths during this rapid evolutionary process. By developing a carefully\ncontrolled null model for noninteracting mutations, we characterized epistasis\nin affinity measurements of a large library of antibody variants obtained by\nTite-Seq, a recently introduced Deep Mutational Scan method yielding physical\nvalues of the binding constant. We show that representing affinity as the\nbinding free energy minimizes epistasis. Yet, we find that epistatically\ninteracting sites contribute substantially to binding. In addition to negative\nepistasis, we report a large amount of beneficial epistasis, enlarging the\nspace of high-affinity antibodies as well as their mutational accessibility.\nThese properties suggest that the degeneracy of antibody sequences that can\nbind a given antigen is enhanced by epistasis - an important property for\nvaccine design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Dec 2017 19:51:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Adams", "Rhys M.", ""], ["Kinney", "Justin B.", ""], ["Walczak", "Aleksandra M.", ""], ["Mora", "Thierry", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.04127", "submitter": "Simone Linz", "authors": "Janosch D\\\"ocker and Simone Linz", "title": "On the existence of a cherry-picking sequence", "comments": "Accepted for publication in Theoretical Computer Science", "journal-ref": "Theoretical Computer Science, 714:36-50, 2018", "doi": "10.1016/j.tcs.2017.12.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Recently, the minimum number of reticulation events that is required to\nsimultaneously embed a collection P of rooted binary phylogenetic trees into a\nso-called temporal network has been characterized in terms of cherry-picking\nsequences.

We\naddress this question by analysing some recently published data of alien plants\nin Greece. Mixed effects models were used with alien species presences in 8.25\nx 8.25 km cells as dependent variable and the percentage of protected area, as\nwell as the agricultural and artificial land cover types richness (as\nindicators of human presence) as independent variables. In addition, the\nspatial cross-correlation between the percentage of protected area and alien\nspecies richness was examined across scales. Results indicated that the\npercentage of protected area per cell is a poor predictor of alien species\nrichness. Spatial analysis indicated that cells with higher percentage of\nprotected areas have slightly less alien species than cells with lower\npercentage of protected areas. This result is likely to be driven by the\noverall negative correlation between habitat protection and anthropogenic\nactivities. Thus, the conclusions deduced by data deriving from protected areas\nare likely to hold true for patterns of alien species in non-protected areas\nwhen the human pressures are accounted for.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Dec 2017 08:48:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-27", "authors_parsed": [["Moustakas", "Aristides", ""], ["Voutsela", "Anneta", ""], ["Katsanevakis", "Stelios", ""]]}, {"id": "1712.09275", "submitter": "Shumpei Ujiyama", "authors": "Shumpei Ujiyama, Kazuki Tsuji", "title": "Controlling invasive ant species: a theoretical strategy for efficient\n  monitoring in the early stage of invasion", "comments": "Revised the manuscript", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports.
