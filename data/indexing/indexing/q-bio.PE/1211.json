We performed forward simulations under realistic gene-structure and\nselection scenarios to investigate whether such linkage effects impinge on the\nability of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to infer the rate of positive\nselection (\\alpha) from polymorphism and divergence data. We find that in the\npresence of slightly deleterious mutations, MK estimates of \\alpha\\ severely\nunderestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with\npopulation frequencies under 50% are excluded. Furthermore, already under\nintermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site\nfrequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under\nmutation-selection-drift balance. MK-type approaches that first infer\ndemography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to\ncorrect the estimation of \\alpha\\ obtain almost the correct \\alpha\\ in our\nsimulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population\nexpansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting\ndoubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous\npolymorphism data. We suggest a simple asymptotic extension of the MK test that\nshould yield accurate estimates of \\alpha\\ even in the presence of linkage\neffects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Nov 2012 00:07:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Messer", "Philipp W.", ""], ["Petrov", "Dmitri A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1211.0251", "submitter": "Po-Ru Loh", "authors": "Po-Ru Loh, Mark Lipson, Nick Patterson, Priya Moorjani, Joseph K\n  Pickrell, David Reich, and Bonnie Berger", "title": "Inferring Admixture Histories of Human Populations Using Linkage\n  Disequilibrium", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Long-range migrations and the resulting admixtures between populations have\nbeen important forces shaping human genetic diversity.

Hess, Nobel Lecture,\nDecember 12, 1936\n  High-energy radiation bursts are commonplace in our Universe. From nearby\nsolar flares to distant gamma ray bursts, a variety of physical processes\naccelerate charged particles to a wide range of energies, which subsequently\nreach the Earth. Such particles contribute to a number of physical processes\noccurring in the Earth system. A large fraction of the energy of charged\nparticles gets deposited in the atmosphere, ionizing the atmosphere, causing\nchanges in its chemistry and affecting the global electric circuit. Remaining\nsecondary particles contribute to the background dose of cosmic rays on the\nsurface and parts of the subsurface region. Life has evolved over the past ~ 3\nbillion years in presence of this background radiation, which itself has varied\nconsiderably during the period. As demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment,\nlightning plays a very important role in the formation of complex organic\nmolecules, which are the building blocks of more complex structures forming\nlife. There is growing evidence of increase in the lightning rate with\nincreasing flux of charged particles. Is there a connection between enhanced\nrate of cosmic rays and the origin of life? Cosmic ray secondaries are also\nknown to damage DNA and cause mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases.\nIt is now possible to compute radiation doses from secondary particles, in\nparticular muons and neutrons.

However, life-history models predict that males\nbenefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing\nage-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to\ngrow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition.\nEarly evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent\ntraits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate\nchoice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely\nencounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits\ntherefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of\npreferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population.\nTraits in the model depended on age and condition (\"good genes\") in a\npopulation with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits\nand their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and\nthe size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus\nage-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the\npopulation; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with\nage-dependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at\nsmaller sizes than age-independent traits. Evolution of age-independent traits\ndepends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends\non both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence\ninto populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with\nage-dependence predominating at small trait sizes.

Moreover, the structural organization\nof Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared to Europe,\nspecies interactions in Beringian communities before the LGM were highly\ncompartmentalized, or modular.
