Its original\nmean field form provides the important intuition that migration and extinction\ninteract to determine the dynamics of a population composed of subpopulations.\nFrom its conception, it has been evident that the very essence of the\nmetapopulation paradigm centers on the process of local extinction. We note\nthat there are two qualitatively distinct types of extinction, gradual and\ncatastrophic, and explore their impact on the dynamics of metapopulation\nformation using discrete iterative maps. First, by modifying the classic\nlogistic map with the addition of the Allee effect, we show that catastrophic\nlocal extinctions in subpopulations are a pre-requisite of metapopulation\nformation. When subpopulations experience gradual extinction, increased\nmigration rates force synchrony and drive the metapopulation below the Allee\npoint resulting in migration induced destabilization of the system across\nparameter space. Second, a sawtooth map (an extension of the Bernoulli bit\nshift map) is employed to simultaneously explore the increasing and decreasing\nmodes of population behavior.

There exists a gradient between stable\nmetapopulation formation and population synchrony, with critical transitions\nfrom no metapopulation to metapopulation to synchronization, the latter\nfrequently inducing metapopulation extinction. 3.

The attachment of planktonic cells\nplays a prominent role in the initial phase of biofilm lifecycle as it\ninitiates the colony formation. During the maturation stage, biofilms harbor\nnumerous microenvironments which lead to metabolic heterogeneity. Such\nmicroniches provide conditions suitable for the growth of new species, which\nare present in the bulk liquid as planktonic cells and can penetrate the porous\nbiofilm matrix. We present a 1D continuum model on the interaction of sessile\nand planktonic phenotypes in biofilm lifestyle which considers both the initial\nattachment and colonization phenomena. The model is formulated as a\nhyperbolic-elliptic free boundary value problem with vanishing initial value.\nHyperbolic equations reproduce the transport and growth of sessile species,\nwhile elliptic equations model the diffusion and conversion of planktonic cells\nand dissolved substrates. The attachment is modelled as a continuous,\ndeterministic process which depends on the concentrations of the attaching\nspecies. The growth of new species is modelled through a reaction term in the\nhyperbolic equations which depends on the concentration of planktonic species\nwithin the biofilm. Existence and uniqueness of solutions are discussed and\nproved for the attachment regime.

We investigate the\ninteraction of power asymmetry and partner choice in games of conflict over a\ncontested resource. We introduce three models to study the emergence and\nresilience of cooperation among unequals when interaction is random, when\nindividuals can choose their partners, and where power asymmetries dynamically\ndepend on accumulated payoffs. We find that the ability to avoid bullies with\nhigher competitive ability afforded by partner choice mostly restores\ncooperative conventions and that the competitive hierarchy never forms. Partner\nchoice counteracts the hyper dominance of bullies who are isolated in the\nnetwork and eliminates the need for others to coordinate in a coalition. When\ncompetitive ability dynamically depends on cumulative payoffs, complex cycles\nof coupled network-strategy-rank changes emerge. Effective collaborators gain\npopularity (and thus power), adopt aggressive behavior, get isolated, and\nultimately lose power. Neither the network nor behavior converge to a stable\nequilibrium. Despite the instability of power dynamics, the cooperative\nconvention in the population remains stable overall and long-term inequality is\ncompletely eliminated. The interaction between partner choice and dynamic power\nasymmetry is crucial for these results: without partner choice, bullies cannot\nbe isolated, and without dynamic power asymmetry, bullies do not lose their\npower even when isolated.

Otherwise, the algorithm must compute the fitness of all N neighbors\nin every time step, consuming a high amount of resources. In order to get\naround this problem, I describe an algorithm that allows search to logically\nterminate relatively early, without having to evaluate fitness of all N\nneighbors at every time step. I further suggest that when the efficacy of two\nalgorithms need to be compared head to head, imposing a common limit on the\nnumber of alternatives evaluated - metering - provides the necessary level\nfield.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Apr 2021 14:42:41 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 11 May 2021 16:37:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-12", "authors_parsed": [["Chanda", "Sasanka Sekhar", ""]]}, {"id": "2104.12875", "submitter": "Lu Ling", "authors": "Lu Ling, Xinwu Qian, Satish V.

Taking daily cases and deaths data\nduring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in the U.S. as a case\nstudy, we develop a mobility-augmented geographically and temporally weighted\nregression (M-GTWR) model to quantify the spatiotemporal impacts of\nsocial-demographic factors and human activities on the COVID-19 dynamics.\nDifferent from the base GTWR model, we incorporate a mobility-adjusted distance\nweight matrix where travel mobility is used in addition to the spatial\nadjacency to capture the correlations among local observations. The model\nresiduals suggest that the proposed model achieves a substantial improvement\nover other benchmark methods in addressing the spatiotemporal nonstationarity.\nOur results reveal that the impacts of social-demographic and human activity\nvariables present significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity. In particular, a 1%\nincrease in population density may lead to 0.63% and 0.71% more daily cases and\ndeaths, and a 1% increase in the mean commuting time may result in 0.22% and\n0.95% increases in daily cases and deaths. Although increased human activities\nwill, in general, intensify the disease outbreak, we report that the effects of\ngrocery and pharmacy-related activities are insignificant in areas with high\npopulation density. And activities at the workplace and public transit are\nfound to either increase or decrease the number of cases and deaths, depending\non particular locations.

On the\nother hand, we show that a reduced reproduction probability has a smaller\nimpact on the abundance of \"weak\" species, generally leading to a slight\ndecrease of its population size -- the increase of the population size of one\nof the \"weak\" species being more than compensated by the reduction of the\nother, in the two species case.
