We\nidentified 7877 ancestral genes that were created from 3026 duplication events\nat early vertebrates, and more than 50% of the duplication events show synteny\nevidence.

Infectious disease outbreaks in plants threaten ecosystems, agricultural\ncrops and food trade. Currently, several fungal diseases are affecting forests\nworldwide, posing a major risk to tree species, habitats and consequently\necosystem decay. Prediction and control of disease spread are difficult, mainly\ndue to the complexity of the interaction between individual components\ninvolved.\n  2. In this work, we introduce a lattice-based epidemic model coupled with a\nstochastic process that mimics, in a very simplified way, the interaction\nbetween the hosts and pathogen. We studied the disease spread by measuring the\npropagation velocity of the pathogen on the susceptible hosts. Quantitative\nresults indicate the occurrence of a critical transition between two stable\nphases: local confinement and an extended epiphytotic outbreak that depends on\nthe density of the susceptible individuals.\n  3. Quantitative predictions of epiphytotics are performed using the framework\nearly-warning indicators for impending regime shifts, widely applied on\ndynamical systems. These signals forecast successfully the outcome of the\ncritical shift between the two stable phases before the system enters the\nepiphytotic regime.\n  4. Synthesis: Our study demonstrates that early-warning indicators could be\nuseful for the prediction of forest disease epidemics through mathematical and\ncomputational models suited to more specific pathogen-host-environmental\ninteractions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 21 Feb 2018 13:29:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 22:06:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Orozco-Fuentes", "S.", ""], ["Griffiths", "G.", ""], ["Holmes", "M.

In chemical systems however,\nwhich can sometimes be quite complex, we do not appear to observe intricate\ncooperative interactions. A key question for the origin of life, is then how\ncan molecular cooperation first arise in an abiotic system prior to the\nemergence of biological replication. We postulate that selection at the\nmolecular level is a driving force behind the complexification of chemical\nsystems, particularly during the origins of life. In the theory of multilevel\nselection the two selective forces are: within-group and between-group, where\nthe former tends to favor \"selfish\" replication of individuals and the latter\nfavor cooperation between individuals enhancing the replication of the group as\na whole. These forces can be quantified using the Price equation, which is a\nstandard tool used in evolutionary biology to quantify evolutionary change. Our\ncentral claim is that replication and heredity in chemical systems are subject\nto selection, and quantifiable using the multilevel Price equation. We\ndemonstrate this using the Graded Autocatalysis Replication Domain computer\nmodel, describing simple protocell composed out of molecules and its\nreplication, which respectively analogue to the group and the individuals. In\ncontrast to previous treatments of this model, we treat the lipid molecules\nthemselves as replicating individuals and the protocells they form as groups of\nindividuals.

Here we relax these restrictions\nand find that the clustering pattern is robust to contributions of unknown or\nunobserved niche axes. However, it may not be visible unless measured traits\nare close proxies for niche strategies. We conclude that patterns along single\nniche axes may reveal properties of interspecific competition in nature, but\ndetecting these patterns requires natural history expertise firmly tying traits\nto niches.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 01:16:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["D'Andrea", "Rafael", ""], ["Ostling", "Annette", ""], ["O'Dwyer", "James P", ""]]}]
