Gyrodactylids are helminth ectoparasites of teleost fish which have\nmany dynamical characteristics of microparasites but offer the advantage that\nthey can be quantified and tracked over time, allowing further insight into\nwithin-host and epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we design a model to describe\nhost-parasite dynamics of the well-studied guppy-Gyrodactylus turnbulli system,\nusing experimental data to estimate parameters and validate it. We estimate the\nbasic reproduction number (R_0), for this system. Sensitivity analysis reveals\nthat parasite growth rate, and the rate at which the guppy mounts an immune\nresponse have the greatest impact on outbreak peak and timing both for initial\noutbreaks and on longer time scales.

The key difference lies in\nthe fact that institutions can create hierarchy with only a single leader,\nwhich is unlikely to occur in unregulated informal hierarchy. To investigate if\nthis difference can affect group decision-making and explain the evolution of\ninstitutional hierarchy, we first build an opinion-formation model that\nsimulates group decision making.

For this, one requires a mathematical model that predicts\nmicrobial community composition and the emergent behavior of microbial\ncommunities. We seek a modeling strategy that can capture emergent behavior\nwhen built from sets of universal individual interactions. Our investigation\nreveals that species-metabolite interaction modeling is better able to capture\nemergent behavior in community composition dynamics than direct species-species\nmodeling.\n  Using publicly available data, we examine the ability of species-species\nmodels and species-metabolite models to predict trio growth experiments from\nthe outcomes of pair growth experiments. We compare quadratic species-species\ninteraction models and quadratic species-metabolite interaction models, and\nconclude that only species-metabolite models have the necessary complexity to\nto explain a wide variety of interdependent growth outcomes. We also show that\ngeneral species-species interaction models cannot match patterns observed in\ncommunity growth dynamics, whereas species-metabolite models can. We conclude\nthat species-metabolite modeling will be important in the development of\naccurate, clinically useful models of microbial communities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jul 2019 22:08:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2019 16:08:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Brunner", "James D.", ""], ["Chia", "Nicholas", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.04765", "submitter": "Junqing Tang", "authors": "Han Hu, Junqing Tang, Yi Wang, Hongfeng Zhang, Dong Wu, Yingchun Lin,\n  Lina Su, Yan Liu, Wei Zhang, Chao Wang, Xiaomin Wu", "title": "Evaluating bird collision risk of a high-speed railway crossing the\n  habitat of the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Qinling Mountains, China", "comments": "25 pages, 6 figures, preprint for submission to Transportation\n  Research Part D: Transport and Environment", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bird collisions with high-speed transport modes is a vital topic on vehicle\nsafety and wildlife protection, especially when high-speed trains, with an\naverage speed of 250km/h, have to run across the habitat of an endangered bird\nspecies.

This\ninherently far-from-equilibrium process finds striking manifestations in the\nadaptive immune system, where highly variable antigens and a finite repertoire\nof immune receptors coevolve on comparable timescales. This unique challenge to\nthe immune system motivates general questions: How do ecological and\nevolutionary processes interplay to shape diversity? What determine the\nendurance and fate of coevolution? Here, we take the perspective of responsive\nenvironments and develop a phenotypic model of coevolution between receptors\nand antigens that both exhibit cross-reactivity (one-to-many responses). The\ntheory predicts that the extent of asymmetry in cross-reactivity is a key\ndeterminant of repertoire composition: small asymmetry supports persistent\nlarge diversity, whereas strong asymmetry yields long-lived transients of\nquasispecies in both populations. The latter represents a new type of Turing\nmechanism. More surprisingly, patterning in the trait space feeds back on\npopulation dynamics: spatial resonance between the Turing modes breaks the\ndynamic balance, leading to antigen extinction or unrestrained growth. Model\npredictions can be tested via combined genomic and phenotypic measurements. Our\nwork identifies cross-reactivity as an important regulator of diversity and\ncoevolutionary outcome, and reveals the remarkable effect of ecological\nfeedback in pattern-forming systems, which drives evolution toward non-steady\nstates different than the Red Queen persistent cycles.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jul 2019 09:04:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-18", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Hongda", ""], ["Wang", "Shenshen", ""]]}, {"id": "1907.12654", "submitter": "Rudy Arthur", "authors": "R.

In particular, we are concerned with\nmodels described by the Kingman coalescent (K), models exhibiting so-called\nweak seed banks described by a time-changed Kingman coalescent (W), models with\nso-called strong seed bank described by the seed bank coalescent (S) and the\nclassical two-island model by Wright, described by the structured coalescent\n(TI). As the presence of a (strong) seed bank should stratify a population, we\nexpect it to produce a signal roughly comparable to the presence of population\nstructure.\n  We begin with a brief analysis of Wright's $F_{ST}$, which is a classical but\ncrude measure for population structure, followed by a derivation of the\nexpected site frequency spectrum (SFS) in the infinite sites model based on\n'phase-type distribution calculus' as recently discussed by Hobolth et al.\n(2019). Both the $F_{ST}$ and the SFS can be readily computed under various\npopulation models, they discard statistical signal. Hence we also derive exact\nlikelihoods for the full sampling probabilities, which can be achieved via\nrecursions and a Monte Carlo scheme both in the infinite alleles and the\ninfinite sites model. We employ a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\nof Andrieu and Roberts (2009) to provide a method for simultaneous model\nselection and parameter inference under the so-called infinitely-many sites\nmodel, which is the most relevant in real applications.\n  It turns out that this full likelihood method can reliably distinguish among\nthe model classes (K, W), (S) and (TI) on the basis of simulated data even from\nmoderate sample sizes.
