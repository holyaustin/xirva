In contrast, if mutants grow slower than wild-types, there is an\nantagonism between selection pressure against mutants and growth by merging of\nmutant domains with an ensuing absorbing state phase transition to an\nall-mutant front. We find that surface roughening has a marked effect on the\ncritical properties of the absorbing state phase transition. While reference\nmodels, which keep the expanding front flat, exhibit directed percolation\ncritical behavior, the exponents of the two-species Eden model strongly deviate\nfrom it. In turn, the mutation-selection process induces an increased surface\nroughness with exponents distinct from that of the classical Eden model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Oct 2011 12:15:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 19 Oct 2011 16:29:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 26 Oct 2011 16:23:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-15", "authors_parsed": [["Kuhr", "Jan-Timm", ""], ["Leisner", "Madeleine", ""], ["Frey", "Erwin", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.2834", "submitter": "Deok-Sun Lee", "authors": "Seong Eun Maeng, Jae Woo Lee, Deok-Sun Lee", "title": "Interspecific competition underlying mutualistic networks", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures, accepted version in PRL", "journal-ref": "Physical Review Letters 108, 108701 (2012)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.108701", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The architecture of bipartite networks linking two classes of constituents is\naffected by the interactions within each class.

The production of large\nmolecules, as we know it today, requires good catalysts, and the only good\ncatalysts we know that can accomplish this task consist of large molecules.\nThus the origin of large molecules is a chicken and egg problem in chemistry.\nHere we present a mechanism, based on autocatalytic sets (ACSs), that is a\npossible solution to this problem. We discuss a mathematical model describing\nthe population dynamics of molecules in a stylized but prebiotically plausible\nchemistry. Large molecules can be produced in this chemistry by the coalescing\nof smaller ones, with the smallest molecules, the `food set', being buffered.\nSome of the reactions can be catalyzed by molecules within the chemistry with\nvarying catalytic strengths. Normally the concentrations of large molecules in\nsuch a scenario are very small, diminishing exponentially with their size.\nACSs, if present in the catalytic network, can focus the resources of the\nsystem into a sparse set of molecules. ACSs can produce a bistability in the\npopulation dynamics and, in particular, steady states wherein the ACS molecules\ndominate the population. However to reach these steady states from initial\nconditions that contain only the food set typically requires very large\ncatalytic strengths, growing exponentially with the size of the catalyst\nmolecule. We present a solution to this problem by studying `nested ACSs', a\nstructure in which a small ACS is connected to a larger one and reinforces it.\nWe show that when the network contains a cascade of nested ACSs with the\ncatalytic strengths of molecules increasing gradually with their size (e.g., as\na power law), a sparse subset of molecules including some very large molecules\ncan come to dominate the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 09:42:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Giri", "Varun", ""], ["Jain", "Sanjay", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.3723", "submitter": "Istvan Kiss Z", "authors": "Istvan Z.

We introduce a new method, termed environ\ncentrality, to determine the relative importance of a species in an ecosystem\nnetwork with respect to ecosystem energy--matter exchange. We demonstrate the\nuniqueness of environ centrality by comparing it to other common centrality\nmetrics and then show its ecological significance. Specifically, we tested two\nhypotheses on a set of 50 empirically-based ecosystem network models. The first\nconcerned the distribution of centrality in the community. We hypothesized that\nthe functional importance of species would tend to be concentrated into a few\ndominant species followed by a group of species with lower, more even\nimportance as is often seen in dominance--diversity curves. Second, we tested\nthe systems ecology hypothesis that indirect relationships homogenize the\nfunctional importance of species in ecosystems. Our results support both\nhypotheses and highlight the importance of detritus and nutrient recyclers such\nas fungi and bacteria in generating the energy--matter flow in ecosystems. Our\nhomogenization results suggest that indirect effects are important in part\nbecause they tend to even the importance of species in ecosystems. A core\ncontribution of this work is that it creates a formal, mathematical method to\nquantify the importance species play in generating ecosystem activity by\nintegrating direct, indirect, and boundary effects in ecological systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2011 00:20:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Fann", "Sarah L.", ""], ["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1110.5704", "submitter": "Alexander Sch\\\"onhuth", "authors": "Iman Hajirasouliha, Alexander Sch\\\"onhuth, David Juan, Alfonso\n  Valencia and S.Cenk Sahinalp", "title": "Mirroring co-evolving trees in the light of their topologies", "comments": "13 pages, 2 figures, Iman Hajirasouliha and Alexander Sch\\\"onhuth are\n  joint first authors", "journal-ref": "Bioinformatics, 28(9), 1202-1208, 2012", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Determining the interaction partners among protein/domain families poses hard\ncomputational problems, in particular in the presence of paralogous proteins.\nAvailable approaches aim to identify interaction partners among protein/domain\nfamilies through maximizing the similarity between trimmed versions of their\nphylogenetic trees. Since maximization of any natural similarity score is\ncomputationally difficult, many approaches employ heuristics to maximize the\ndistance matrices corresponding to the tree topologies in question.
