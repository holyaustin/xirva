To systematically\nascertain the extent to which TFs contribute to regulatory divergence, we\nanalyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc\nfinger (C2H2-ZF) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years\nof evolution.

In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF\ndomains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~47% of domains shared\nbetween D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These diverging\nDNA-contacting residues, found in ~66% of the D. melanogaster C2H2-ZF genes in\nour analysis and corresponding to ~24% of all annotated D. melanogaster TFs,\nshow evidence of functional constraint: they tend to be conserved across\nphylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues. These same\nvariations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D.\nmelanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted\nspecificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic\ndistances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence.\nFurther, whereas proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in\ndevelopmental functions, those with varying domains exhibit no functional\nenrichments. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely\nunstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and\nother metazoans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 16:59:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Nadimpalli", "Shilpa", ""], ["Persikov", "Anton V.", ""], ["Singh", "Mona", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.0388", "submitter": "Juan Carlos Gonzalez Avella Dr.", "authors": "J.

The model was constructed as a system of first order nonlinear ODEs\nin four compartment variables. We perform a bifurcation analysis of the\nequilibria of the model using the severity of the hotbeds as the control\nparameter. Depending on the non-dimensional grapevine density of the vineyard\nwe find either a single family of equilibria in which the health of the\nvineyard gradually deteriorates for progressively more severe hotbeds, or\nmultiple equilibria that give rise to sudden transitions from a nearly healthy\nvineyard to a severely deteriorated one when the severity of the hotbeds\ncrosses a critical value. These results suggest some lines of intervention for\nlimiting the spread of the disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Jul 2014 14:20:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-07-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lessio", "Federico", ""], ["Portaluri", "Alessandro", ""], ["Paparella", "Francesco", ""], ["Alma", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.4116", "submitter": "Min-Sheng Peng MSP", "authors": "Ni-Ni Shi, Long Fan, Yong-Gang Yao, Min-Sheng Peng, Ya-Ping Zhang", "title": "Mitochondrial Genomes of Domestic Animals Need Scrutiny", "comments": "129 Pages, 1 figure, 3 tables, and 5 supplementary materials", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  More than 1000 complete or near-complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences\nhave been deposited in GenBank for eight common domestic animals (i.e. cattle,\ndog, goat, horse, pig, sheep, yak and chicken) and their close wild ancestors\nor relatives.

Here we use the Maximum Entropy (ME)\napproach to infer from experimental data of natural flocks the effective\ninteractions between birds. Compared to previous studies, we make a significant\nstep forward as we retrieve the full functional dependence of the interaction\non distance and find that it decays exponentially over a range of a few\nindividuals. The fact that ME gives a short-range interaction even though its\nexperimental input is the long-range correlation function, shows that the\nmethod is able to discriminate the relevant information encoded in such\ncorrelations and single out a minimal number of effective parameters. Finally,\nwe show how the method can be used to capture the degree of anisotropy of\nmutual interactions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Jul 2014 13:30:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 16:11:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-07", "authors_parsed": [["Cavagna", "Andrea", ""], ["Del Castello", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Dey", "Supravat", ""], ["Giardina", "Irene", ""], ["Melillo", "Stefania", ""], ["Parisi", "Leonardo", ""], ["Viale", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.6888", "submitter": "Thierry Mora", "authors": "Andreas Mayer, Vijay Balasubramanian, Thierry Mora, Aleksandra M.\n  Walczak", "title": "How a well-adapted immune system is organized", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1073/pnas.1421827112", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cond-mat.dis-nn physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The repertoire of lymphocyte receptors in the adaptive immune system protects\norganisms from diverse pathogens.

However, these factors have explained only a\nsmall fraction of these traits' genetic heritability. It is argued that many\nmore genetic factors remain undiscovered. These genetic factors likely are\nweakly associated at the population level and sparsely distributed across the\ngenome. In this paper, we adapt the recent innovations on Tukey's Higher\nCriticism (Tukey [The Higher Criticism (1976) Princeton Univ.]; Donoho and Jin\n[Ann. Statist. 32 (2004) 962-994]) to SNP-set analysis of GWAS, and develop a\nnew theoretical framework in large-scale inference to assess the joint\nsignificance of such rare and weak effects for a quantitative trait. In the\ncore of our theory is the so-called detection boundary, a curve in the\ntwo-dimensional phase space that quantifies the rarity and strength of genetic\neffects. Above the detection boundary, the overall effects of genetic factors\nare strong enough for reliable detection. Below the detection boundary, the\ngenetic factors are simply too rare and too weak for reliable detection. We\nshow that the HC-type methods are optimal in that they reliably yield detection\nonce the parameters of the genetic effects fall above the detection boundary\nand that many commonly used SNP-set methods are suboptimal. The superior\nperformance of the HC-type approach is demonstrated through simulations and the\nanalysis of a GWAS data set of Crohn's disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 12:37:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wu", "Zheyang", ""], ["Sun", "Yiming", ""], ["He", "Shiquan", ""], ["Cho", "Judy", ""], ["Zhao", "Hongyu", ""], ["Jin", "Jiashun", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8398", "submitter": "Joshua N.

In our example, a GWAS examining late-onset Alzheimer's disease, the\n$p$-values among the most strongly associated SNPs in the APOE gene tend to\ndecrease, with the smallest $p$-value decreasing from $1.23\\times10^{-8}$ to\n$7.70\\times 10^{-9}$. Furthermore, as a part of our simulations, we reevaluate\nour expectations about the use of families in GWAS. We show that, although\nadding only half as many unique chromosomes, genotyping affected siblings is\nmore efficient than genotyping randomly ascertained cases. We also show that\ngenotyping cases with a family history of disease will be less beneficial when\nsearching for SNPs with smaller effect sizes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jul 2014 13:02:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Sampson", "Joshua N.", ""], ["Wheeler", "Bill", ""], ["Li", "Peng", ""], ["Shi", "Jianxin", ""]]}, {"id": "1407.8477", "submitter": "George Constable Dr", "authors": "George W.
