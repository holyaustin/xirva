However, new protein\nfunctions evolve when selection begins to favor other, \"promiscuous\" functions\nthat are incidental to a protein's biological role. If mutations that are\nneutral with respect to a protein's primary biological function cause\nsubstantial changes in promiscuous functions, these mutations could enable\nfuture functional evolution.\n  RESULTS: Here we investigate this possibility experimentally by examining how\ncytochrome P450 enzymes that have evolved neutrally with respect to activity on\na single substrate have changed in their abilities to catalyze reactions on\nfive other substrates. We find that the enzymes have sometimes changed as much\nas four-fold in the promiscuous activities. The changes in promiscuous\nactivities tend to increase with the number of mutations, and can be largely\nrationalized in terms of the chemical structures of the substrates. The\nactivities on chemically similar substrates tend to change in a coordinated\nfashion, potentially providing a route for systematically predicting the change\nin one function based on the measurement of several others.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work suggests that initially neutral genetic drift can lead\nto substantial changes in protein functions that are not currently under\nselection, in effect poising the proteins to more readily undergo functional\nevolution should selection \"ask new questions\" in the future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 May 2007 05:02:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Bloom", "Jesse D", ""], ["Romero", "Philip A", ""], ["Lu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Arnold", "Frances H", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.0227", "submitter": "Graeme J.

Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently\nobserve the Big Bang scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as\nsoon as favorable sequence-structure combinations (precursors of stable\nproteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space\nabruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that\nprotein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at time scales much\ngreater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the\nlifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law.\nThe separation of evolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and\ngeneration of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and\nsuperfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same\ndistributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence\nof species, subpopulations which carry similar genomes. Further we present a\nsimple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of\nemerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first\nprinciples picture of how first gene families developed in the course of early\nevolution\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 May 2007 02:26:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Zeldovich", "Konstantin", ""], ["Chen", "Peiqiu", ""], ["Shakhnovich", "Boris", ""], ["Shakhnovich", "Eugene", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.3983", "submitter": "Emmanuel Tannenbaum", "authors": "Yoav Raz, Emmanuel Tannenbaum", "title": "The influence of horizontal gene transfer on the mean fitness of\n  unicellular populations in static environments", "comments": "27 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper develops a mathematical model describing the influence that\nconjugation-mediated Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) has on the\nmutation-selection balance in an asexually reproducing population of\nunicellular, prokaryotic organisms. It is assumed that mutation-selection\nbalance is reached in the presence of a fixed background concentration of\nantibiotic, to which the population must become resistant in order to survive.\nWe analyze the behavior of the model in the limit of low and high\nantibiotic-induced first-order death rate constants, and find that the highest\nmean fitness is obtained at low rates of bacterial conjugation. As the rate of\nconjugation crosses a threshold, the mean fitness decreases to a minimum, and\nthen rises asymptotically to a limiting value as the rate of conjugation\nbecomes infinitely large. However, this limiting value is smaller than the mean\nfitness obtained in the limit of low conjugation rate. This dependence of the\nmean fitness on the conjugation rate is fairly small for the parameter ranges\nwe have considered, and disappears as the first-order death rate constant due\nto the presence of antibiotic approaches zero. For large values of the\nantibiotic death rate constant, we have obtained an analytical solution for the\nbehavior of the mean fitness that agrees well with the results of simulations.\nThe results of this paper suggest that conjugation-mediated HGT has a slightly\ndeleterious effect on the mean fitness of a population at mutation-selection\nbalance. Therefore, we argue that HGT confers a selective advantage by allowing\nfor faster adaptation to a new or changing environment. The results of this\npaper are consistent with the observation that HGT can be promoted by\nenvironmental stresses on a population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 27 May 2007 22:13:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 4 Jul 2009 20:02:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Raz", "Yoav", ""], ["Tannenbaum", "Emmanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0705.4062", "submitter": "Eugene Shakhnovich", "authors": "Konstantin Zeldovich, Peiqiu Chen, Eugene Shakhnovich", "title": "The Hypercube of Life: How Protein Stability Imposes Limits on Organism\n  Complexity and Speed of Molecular Evolution", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM q-bio.PE", "license": null, "abstract": "  Classical population genetics a priori assigns fitness to alleles without\nconsidering molecular or functional properties of proteins that these alleles\nencode.

Here, we investigate the in silico evolution of modularity and\nrobustness in complex artificial metabolic networks that encode an increasing\namount of information about their environment while acquiring ubiquitous\nfeatures of biological, social, and engineering networks, such as scale-free\nedge distribution, small-world property, and fault-tolerance.
