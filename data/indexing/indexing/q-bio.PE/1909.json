One of the frequently observed features at\nrange margins is fragmentation, caused internally by population dynamics or\nexternally by the limited availability of suitable habitat sites. We study both\ncauses, and describe the transition from a connected to a fragmented state\nacross space by means of a gradient metapopulation model. The main features of\nour approach are the following. 1) Inhomogeneities can occur at two spatial\nscales: there is a broad-scale gradient, which can be patterned by fine-scale\nheterogeneities. The latter is implemented by dispersing a variable number of\nsmall obstacles over the terrain, which can be penetrable or unpenetrable by\nthe spreading species. 2) We study the occupancy of this terrain in a\nsteady-state on two temporal scales: in snapshots and by long-term averages.\nThe simulations reveal some general scaling laws that are applicable in various\nenvironments, independently of the mechanism of fragmentation. The edge of the\nconnected region (the hull) is a fractal with dimension 7/4. Its width and\nlength changes with the gradient according to universal scaling laws, that are\ncharacteristic for percolation transitions. The results suggest that\npercolation theory is a powerful tool for understanding the structure of range\nmargins in a broad variety of real-life scenarios, including those in which the\nenvironmental gradient is combined with fine-scale heterogeneity. This provides\na new method for comparing the range margins of different species in various\ngeographic regions, and monitoring range shifts under climate change.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Sep 2019 07:52:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 08:04:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Juh\u00e1sz", "R.", ""], ["Oborny", "B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.00651", "submitter": "Istvan Kiss Z", "authors": "Nicos Georgiou, Istv\\'An Z.

Our analysis not only suggests\nthat the innovation space can be interpreted as a natural system in which\nadvantageous capabilities are selected by evolutionary pressure, but also that\nthe emerging structure of capabilities is not independent of the scale of\nobservation at which they are observed. Expanding on this insight allows us to\nunderstand whether the capabilities characterizing the innovation space at a\ngiven scale are compatible with a complex evolutionary dynamics or, rather, a\nset of essentially independent activities allowing to reduce the system at that\nscale to a set of disjoint non interacting sub-systems. This yields a measure\nof the innovation complexity of the system, i.e. of the degree of\ninterdependence between the sets of capabilities underlying the system's\nbuilding blocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 12 Sep 2019 12:36:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Pugliese", "Emanuele", ""], ["Napolitano", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Chinazzi", "Matteo", ""], ["Chiarotti", "Guido", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.05794", "submitter": "Juan Kuntz", "authors": "Juan Kuntz, Philipp Thomas, Guy-Bart Stan, Mauricio Barahona", "title": "Stationary distributions of continuous-time Markov chains: a review of\n  theory and truncation-based approximations", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR cond-mat.stat-mech math.OC q-bio.MN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Computing the stationary distributions of a continuous-time Markov chain\n(CTMC) involves solving a set of linear equations.

We show that adding the effect of peer pressure to an adaptive\nvoter model leaves its fragmentation transition, i.e., the transition upon\nvarying the re-wiring rate from a single majority state into to a fragmented\nstate of two different opinion subgraphs, intact. Yet, above and below the\nfragmentation transition, we observe that the peer pressure has substantial\nquantitative effects. It accelerates the transition to a single-opinion state\nbelow the transition and also speeds up the system dynamics towards\nfragmentation above the transition. Furthermore, we quantify that there is a\nmultiscale hierarchy in the model leading to the depletion of 2-simplices,\nbefore the depletion of active edges.

Since a disease\nspreading in one country could become a pandemic with a potential worldwide\nhumanitarian and economic impact, it is important to develop models to estimate\nthe probability of a worldwide pandemic. In this paper, we propose a model of\ndisease spreading in a structural modular complex network (having communities)\nand study how the number of bridge nodes $n$ that connect communities affects\ndisease spread. We find that our model can be described at a global scale as an\ninfectious transmission process between communities with global infectious and\nrecovery time distributions that depend on the internal structure of each\ncommunity and $n$. We find that near the critical point as $n$ increases, the\ndisease reaches most of the communities, but each community has only a small\nfraction of recovered nodes. In addition, we obtain that in the limit $n \\to\n\\infty$, the probability of a pandemic increases abruptly at the critical\npoint. This scenario could make the decision on whether to launch a pandemic\nalert or not more difficult. Finally, we show that link percolation theory can\nbe used at a global scale to estimate the probability of a pandemic since the\nglobal transmissibility between communities has a weak dependence on the global\nrecovery time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 Sep 2019 19:41:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 20:07:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Valdez", "L.

The\nenormous increase in throughput and reduction in cost per cell now allow this\ntechnology to be applied to large-scale population genetics studies.

Following this challenge,\nhere we develop a Markovian framework which enables to address the impact of\nrecurrent mobility patterns on the epidemic onset at different temporal scales.\nThis formalism is validated by comparing their predictions with results from\nmechanistic simulations. The fair agreement between both theory and simulations\nenables to get an analytical expression for the epidemic threshold which\ncaptures the critical conditions triggering epidemic outbreaks. Finally, by\nperforming an exhaustive analysis of this epidemic threshold, we reveal that\nthe impact of tuning human mobility on the emergence of diseases is strongly\naffected by the temporal scales associated to both epidemiological and mobility\nprocesses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Sep 2019 15:01:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Soriano-Pa\u00f1os", "David", ""], ["Ghoshal", "Gourab", ""], ["Arenas", "Alex", ""], ["G\u00f3mez-Garde\u00f1es", "Jes\u00fas", ""]]}, {"id": "1909.13754", "submitter": "Benjamin Hollering", "authors": "Benjamin Hollering and Seth Sullivant", "title": "Identifiability in Phylogenetics using Algebraic Matroids", "comments": "17 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO math.AG q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Identifiability is a crucial property for a statistical model since\ndistributions in the model uniquely determine the parameters that produce them.\nIn phylogenetics, the identifiability of the tree parameter is of particular\ninterest since it means that phylogenetic models can be used to infer\nevolutionary histories from data.
