In the new approaches stable population size is a dynamic\nequilibrium between different mortality and fecundity factors instead of an\narbitrary fixed carrying capacity. The latest replicator dynamics models assume\nthat regulation of the population size acts through feedback driven by density\ndependent juvenile mortality. Here, we consider a simplified model to extract\nthe properties of this approach. We show that at the stable population size,\nthe structure of the frequency dependent evolutionary game emerges. Turnover of\nindividuals induces a lottery mechanism where for each nest site released by a\ndead adult individual a single newborn is drawn from the pool of newborn\ncandidates.

This result is\nimportant for the discussion about universal fitness measures and which\nparameters are maximized by natural selection. This is related to the fitness\nmeasures R0 and r, because the number of newborns per single dead individual\nequals lifetime production of newborn R0 in models without ageing.

This discretization consists of the unit\nage classes and the timescale is chosen that only a fraction of individuals\nplay single game round. This implies linear dynamics within single time unit\nwhen individuals not killed during game round are moved from one age class to\nanother. Since its local linear behaviour the system is equivalent to large\nBernadelli-Lewis-Leslie matrix. Then the methodology of multipopulation games\nis used for the derivation of two, mutually equivalent systems of equations.\nThe first contains equations describing the evolution of the strategy\nfrequencies in the whole population completed by subsystems of equations\ndescribing the evolution of the age structure for each strategy. The second\nsystem contains equations describing the changes of the general population's\nage structure, completed with subsystems of equations describing the selection\nof the strategies within each age class. Then the obtained system of replicator\ndynamics is presented in the form of the mixed ODE-PDE system. The obtained\nresults are illustrated by example of the sex ratio model which shows that when\ndifferent mortalities of both sexes are assumed, the sex ratio of 0.5 is\nobtained but that Fisher's mechanism driven by the reproductive value of the\ndifferent sexes is not in equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 6 Mar 2013 19:23:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Apr 2020 21:02:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:46:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 31 Mar 2021 16:17:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Argasinski", "Krzysztof", ""], ["Broom", "Mark", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.1442", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "Surveillance of the Incidence of Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) with\n  Prevalence Data: Theory and Application to Diabetes in Denmark", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Secular trends of the incidence of NCDs are especially important as they\nindicate changes of the risk profile of a population.

By analyzing within-patient longitudinal\nsequence data, we make four observations that shed a light on the underlying\nprocesses and allow us infer the short-term effective population size of the\nviral population in a patient. Our first observation is that the evolution of\ndrug resistance usually occurs by the fixation of one drug-resistance mutation\nat a time, as opposed to several changes simultaneously. Second, we find that\nthese fixation events are accompanied by a reduction in genetic diversity in\nthe region surrounding the fixed drug-resistance mutation, due to the\nhitchhiking effect.

In a hard sweep, a\nresistance mutation arises in a single viral particle and drives all linked\nmutations with it when it spreads in the viral population, which dramatically\nreduces genetic diversity. On the other hand, in a soft sweep, a resistance\nmutation occurs multiple times on different genetic backgrounds, and the\nreduction of diversity is weak.

Here, we apply a\nmultiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (known as RAD-seq) to genotype\na large collection of S. cerevisiae strains, isolated from a wide range of\ngeographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the\nsequencing of the same 1% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence\nalignment of 116,880 bases across 262 strains.

At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives and\nsake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One\npopulation, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high\nlevels of heterozygosity and mixtures of alleles from European and Asian\npopulations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. In the context of\nthis global diversity, we demonstrate that a collection of seven strains\ncommonly used in the laboratory encompasses only one quarter of the genetic\ndiversity present in the full collection of strains, underscoring the\nrelatively limited genetic diversity captured by the current set of lab\nstrains.

A fortiori, the same holds for the\nevolution of the economy, legal systems, social systems, and culture.

Numerous\nstudies have claimed an association between this variation and the motion of\nthe Sun around the Galaxy, invoking the modulation of cosmic rays, gamma rays\nand comet impact frequency as a cause of this biodiversity variation. However,\nsome of these studies exhibit methodological problems, or were based on coarse\nassumptions (such as a strict periodicity of the solar orbit). Here we\ninvestigate this link in more detail, using a model of the Galaxy to\nreconstruct the solar orbit and thus a predictive model of the temporal\nvariation of the extinction rate due to astronomical mechanisms. We compare\nthese predictions as well as those of various reference models with\npaleontological data. Our approach involves Bayesian model comparison, which\ntakes into account the uncertainties in the paleontological data as well as the\ndistribution of solar orbits consistent with the uncertainties in the\nastronomical data. We find that various versions of the orbital model are not\nfavored beyond simpler reference models. In particular, the distribution of\nmass extinction events can be explained just as well by a uniform random\ndistribution as by any other model tested. Although our negative results on the\norbital model are robust to changes in the Galaxy model, the Sun's coordinates\nand the errors in the data, we also find that it would be very difficult to\npositively identify the orbital model even if it were the true one. (In\ncontrast, we do find evidence against simpler periodic models.)

During this transition,\nthe efficiency of information transport is a key factor to prevent cohesion\nloss and preserve robustness. The precise mechanism by which natural groups\nachieve such efficiency, though, is currently not fully understood. Here, we\npresent an experimental study of starling flocks performing collective turns in\nthe field. We find that the information to change direction propagates across\nthe flock linearly in time with negligible attenuation, hence keeping group\ndecoherence to a minimum. This result contrasts with current theories of\ncollective motion, which predict a slower and dissipative transport of\ndirectional information. We propose a novel theory whose cornerstone is the\nexistence of a conserved spin current generated by the gauge symmetry of the\nsystem. The theory turns out to be mathematically identical to that of\nsuperfluid transport in liquid helium and it explains the dissipationless\npropagating mode observed in turning flocks. Superfluidity also provides a\nquantitative expression for the speed of propagation of the information,\naccording to which transport must be swifter the stronger the group's\norientational order. This prediction is verified by the data. We argue that the\nlink between strong order and efficient decision-making required by\nsuperfluidity may be the adaptive drive for the high degree of behavioural\npolarization observed in many living groups. The mathematical equivalence\nbetween superfluid liquids and turning flocks is a compelling demonstration of\nthe far-reaching consequences of symmetry and conservation laws across\ndifferent natural systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Mar 2013 11:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Attanasi", "Alessandro", ""], ["Cavagna", "Andrea", ""], ["Del Castello", "Lorenzo", ""], ["Giardina", "Irene", ""], ["Grigera", "Tomas S.", ""], ["Jeli\u0107", "Asja", ""], ["Melillo", "Stefania", ""], ["Parisi", "Leonardo", ""], ["Pohl", "Oliver", ""], ["Shen", "Edward", ""], ["Viale", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "1303.7116", "submitter": "Johannes Knebel", "authors": "Johannes Knebel, Torben Kr\\\"uger, Markus F.
