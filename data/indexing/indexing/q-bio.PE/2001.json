To investigate the completeness of recorded\nprostate cancer mortality, we compared other-cause (non-prostate cancer)\nmortality in men found and not found to have prostate cancer following a needle\nbiopsy.\n  Methods: We linked Medicare claims data to SEER data to analyze survival in\nthe population of men aged 65+ enrolled in Medicare who resided in a SEER area\nand received a needle biopsy in 1993-2001. We compared other-cause mortality in\nmen found to have prostate cancer (n=53,462) to that in men not found to have\nprostate cancer (n=103,659).\n  Results: The age-race adjusted other-cause mortality rate was 471 per 10,000\nperson-years in men found to have prostate cancer vs. 468 per 10,000 in men not\nfound to have prostate cancer (RR = 1.01;95% CI:0.98-1.03). The effect was\nmodified, however, by age. The RR declined in a stepwise fashion from 1.08 (95%\nCI:1.03-1.14) in men age 65-69 to 0.89 (95% CI:0.83-0.95) in men age 85 and\nolder. If the excess (or deficit) in other-cause mortality were added to the\nrecorded prostate cancer mortality, prostate cancer mortality would rise 23% in\nthe youngest age group (from 90 to 111 per 10,000) and would fall 30% in the\noldest age group (from 551 to 388 per 10,000).\n  Conclusion: Although recorded prostate cancer mortality appears to be an\naccurate measure overall, it systematically underestimates the mortality\nassociated with prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment in younger men and\noverestimates it in the very old. We surmise that in younger men\ntreatment-related deaths are incompletely captured in recorded prostate cancer\nmortality, while in older men the diagnosis \"sticks\"-- once diagnosed, they are\nmore likely to be said to have died from the disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 2 Jan 2020 15:37:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Welch", "H.

Epidemic models of STIs are often used to characterize the\ncontribution of risk groups to overall transmission by projecting the\ntransmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unmet prevention and\ntreatment needs within risk groups. However, evidence suggests that STI risk is\ndynamic over an individual's sexual life course, which manifests as turnover\nbetween risk groups. We sought to examine the mechanisms by which turnover\ninfluences modelled projections of the tPAF of high risk groups. METHODS. We\ndeveloped a unifying, data-guided framework to simulate risk group turnover in\ndeterministic, compartmental transmission models. We applied the framework to\nan illustrative model of an STI and examined the mechanisms by which risk group\nturnover influenced equilibrium prevalence across risk groups. We then fit a\nmodel with and without turnover to the same risk-stratified STI prevalence\ntargets and compared the inferred level of risk heterogeneity and tPAF of the\nhighest risk group projected by the two models. RESULTS. The influence of\nturnover on group-specific prevalence was mediated by three main phenomena:\nmovement of infectious individuals between risk groups; changes to herd\nimmunity; and changes in discordant partnerships. Faster turnover led to a\nsmaller ratio of STI prevalence between the highest and lowest risk groups.\nCompared to the fitted model without turnover, the fitted model with turnover\ninferred greater risk heterogeneity and consistently projected a larger tPAF of\nthe highest risk group over time. IMPLICATIONS. If turnover is not captured in\nepidemic models, the projected contribution of high risk groups, and thus, the\npotential impact of prioritizing interventions to address their needs, could be\nunderestimated. To aid the next generation of tPAF models, data collection\nefforts to parameterize risk group turnover should be prioritized.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Jan 2020 21:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-10", "authors_parsed": [["Knight", "Jesse", ""], ["Baral", "Stefan D.", ""], ["Schwartz", "Sheree", ""], ["Wang", "Linwei", ""], ["Ma", "Huiting", ""], ["Young", "Katherine", ""], ["Hausler", "Harry", ""], ["Mishra", "Sharmistha", ""]]}, {"id": "2001.02843", "submitter": "Yuval Elhanati", "authors": "Zachary Sethna (1), Giulio Isacchini (2 and 3), Thomas Dupic (2),\n  Thierry Mora (2), Aleksandra M.

Pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) for children (as well as older\nadults) in Russia was introduced in 2014, with no prior PCV7 use. While\npneumonia hospitalization rates, both in children and adults did not decrease\nin the following years, respiratory mortality rates did decline with time.\nMoreover, there is a strong association between antibiotic, including multidrug\nresistance and PCV13 vaccine serotypes for S. pneumoniae in children in Russia,\nand presence of S. pneumoniae among sepsis cases in Russia during the recent\nyears has been very low. Annual variability in influenza circulation may affect\nsome of the changes in respiratory mortality rates. Methods. We applied the\ninference method from our recent study of influenza-associated mortality in\nRussia to relate monthly respiratory mortality rates between 09/2010 and\n08/2019 to monthly indices of influenza circulation and baseline rates of\nmortality not associated with influenza, allowing for a potential trend in the\nbaseline rates starting 2015. Results. Baseline rates of respiratory mortality\nnot associated with influenza decreased with time starting from the 2014/15\nseason (with each season running from September to August), with the 2018/19\nbaseline rates of respiratory mortality per 100,000 individuals being lower by\n12.41 (95% CI (10.6,14.2)) compared to the 2010-2014 period. Conclusions. While\nimprovement in care might have contributed to the reduction in the rates of\nrespiratory mortality not associated with influenza in Russia, the above\ntemporally consistent reduction is compatible with the gradual replacement of\nvaccine serotypes in the transmission and carriage of S. pneumoniae following\nthe introduction of PCV13.

The present paper\nstudies evolution of self-editing algorithms that undergo some form of natural\nor artificial selection. We show that such an algorithm may be simply\nprogrammed, by a procedure we call diagonalization, so as to use selection as\nan information, to adjust accordingly its genetic behavior. We provide a lot of\nexamples regarding this principle, including ones that diagonalization is used\nto evolve its own mechanism. (This last one being possible due to self-editing\nproperty and to the general nature of this procedure).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jan 2020 11:04:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 10 Apr 2020 07:21:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-29", "authors_parsed": [["Arvanitakis", "A.
