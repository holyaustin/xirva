We developed a\nlandscape and flux framework to quantify the global stability and global\ndynamics of the game theory. As an example, we investigated the models of\nthree-strategy games: a special replicator-mutator game, the repeated prison\ndilemma model. In this model, one stable state, two stable states and limit\ncycle can emerge under different parameters. The repeated Prisoner's Dilemma\nsystem has Hopf bifurcation transitions from one stable state to limit cycle\nstate, and then to another one stable state or two stable states, or vice\nversa. We explored the global stability of the repeated Prisoner's Dilemma\nsystem and the kinetic paths between the basins of attractor. The paths are\nirreversible due to the non-zero flux.

In this paper we consider an\napproach to species tree reconstruction that addresses both these hurdles.\nSpecifically, we propose an algorithm for phylogeny reconstruction under the\nmultispecies coalescent model with a standard model of site substitution. The\nmultispecies coalescent is commonly used to model gene tree discordance due to\nincomplete lineage sorting, a well-studied population-genetic effect.\n  In previous work, an information-theoretic trade-off was derived in this\ncontext between the number of loci, $m$, needed for an accurate reconstruction\nand the length of the locus sequences, $k$. It was shown that to reconstruct an\ninternal branch of length $f$, one needs $m$ to be of the order of $1/[f^{2}\n\\sqrt{k}]$. That previous result was obtained under the molecular clock\nassumption, i.e., under the assumption that mutation rates (as well as\npopulation sizes) are constant across the species phylogeny.\n  Here we generalize this result beyond the restrictive molecular clock\nassumption, and obtain a new reconstruction algorithm that has the same data\nrequirement (up to log factors). Our main contribution is a novel reduction to\nthe molecular clock case under the multispecies coalescent. As a corollary, we\nalso obtain a new identifiability result of independent interest: for any\nspecies tree with $n \\geq 3$ species, the rooted species tree can be identified\nfrom the distribution of its unrooted weighted gene trees even in the absence\nof a molecular clock.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Jul 2017 20:22:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-17", "authors_parsed": [["Dasarathy", "Gautam", ""], ["Mossel", "Elchanan", ""], ["Nowak", "Robert", ""], ["Roch", "Sebastien", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.04668", "submitter": "Brandon Schlomann", "authors": "Brandon H.

In this work we extend that simplified\nmodel to include independently the role of the populations of antibodies, in\nthe control of the immune response, producing mechanisms of differentiation and\nregulation in a more complete way. Although the antibodies have the same\nmolecular shape of the B-cells receptors (BCR), they should present a different\ntime evolution and thus should be treated separately. We have also studied a\npossible model for the network immune memory, suggesting a random memory\nregeneration, which is self-perpetuating.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 11 Jul 2017 21:55:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["de Castro", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09361", "submitter": "James Moore", "authors": "James Moore, Hasan Ahmed", "title": "High Dimensional Random Walks Can Appear Low Dimensional: Application to\n  Influenza H3N2 Evolution", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One important feature of the mammalian immune system is the highly specific\nbinding of antigens to antibodies. Antibodies generated in response to one\ninfection may also provide some level of cross immunity to other infections.\nOne model to describe this cross immunity is the notion of antigenic space,\nwhich assigns each antibody and each virus a point in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. Past\nstudies have suggested the dimensionality of antigenic space, $n$, may be\nsmall. In this study we show that data from hemagglutination assays suggest a\nhigh dimensional random walk (or self avoiding random random walk). The\ndiscrepancy between our result and prior studies is due to the fact that random\nwalks can appear low dimensional according to a variety of analyses. including\nprincipal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Jul 2017 21:20:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Moore", "James", ""], ["Ahmed", "Hasan", ""]]}, {"id": "1707.09908", "submitter": "Mareike Fischer", "authors": "Kristina Wicke and Mareike Fischer", "title": "On the Shapley value of unrooted phylogenetic trees", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Shapley value, a solution concept from cooperative game theory, has\nrecently been considered for both unrooted and rooted phylogenetic trees. Here,\nwe focus on the Shapley value of unrooted trees and first revisit the so-called\nsplit counts of a phylogenetic tree and the Shapley transformation matrix that\nallows for the calculation of the Shapley value from the edge lengths of a\ntree. We show that non-isomorphic trees may have permutation-equivalent Shapley\ntransformation matrices and permutation-equivalent null spaces. This implies\nthat estimating the split counts associated with a tree or the Shapley values\nof its leaves does not suffice to reconstruct the correct tree topology. We\nthen turn to the use of the Shapley value as a prioritization criterion in\nbiodiversity conservation and compare it to a greedy solution concept.
