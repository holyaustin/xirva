Nonetheless, ape\nsocieties remain essentially hierarchical, and coalitions rarely weaken social\ninequality. In contrast, human hunter-gatherers show a remarkable tendency to\negalitarianism, and human coalitions and alliances occur not only among\nindividuals and groups, but also among groups of groups.

The model shows that alliances often emerge in a phase\ntransition-like fashion if the group size, awareness, aggressiveness, and\npersuasiveness of individuals are large and the decay rate of individual\naffinities is small. With cultural inheritance of social networks, a single\nleveling alliance including all group members can emerge in several\ngenerations.

After a short review, we\nintroduce a stochastic individual-centered particle model to describe the\nevolution in continuous time of a population with (continuous) age and trait\nstructures. The individuals reproduce asexually, age, interact and die. The\n'trait' is an individual heritable property (d-dimensional vector) that may\ninfluence birth and death rates and interactions between individuals, and vary\nby mutation. In a large population limit, the random process converges to the\nsolution of a Gurtin-McCamy type PDE. We show that the random model has a long\ntime behavior that differs from its deterministic limit.

Survival probability is typically associated with the 'fitness' of a\nparticular variation. In this paper we argue that the notion of fitness is an a\nposteriori concept, in the sense that one can assign higher fitness to species\nthat survive but one can generally not derive or even measure fitness - or\nfitness landscapes - per se. For this reason we think that in a 'physical'\ntheory of evolution such notions should be avoided. In this spirit, here we\npropose a random matrix model of evolution where selection mechanisms are\nencoded in the interaction matrices of species. We are able to recover some key\nfacts of evolution dynamics, such as punctuated equilibrium, i.e. the existence\nof intrinsic large extinctions events, and, at the same time, periods of\ndramatic diversification, as known e.g. from fossil records. Further, we\ncomment on two fundamental technical problems of a 'physics of evolution', the\nnon-closedness of its phase space and the problem of co-evolving boundary\nconditions, apparent in all systems subject to evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Sep 2008 14:38:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Hanel", "Rudolf", ""], ["Thurner", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "0809.4305", "submitter": "Karo Michaelian", "authors": "K.
