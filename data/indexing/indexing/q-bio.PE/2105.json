Our focus is on the phase of\nQuasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE) which has many similarities to equilibrium\nstatistical mechanics, and how the stability of that phase is lost. The QLE\nphenomenon was discovered by Motoo Kimura and was extended and generalized to\nthe global genome scale by Neher & Shraiman (2011). What we will refer to as\nthe Kimura-Neher-Shraiman (KNS) theory describes a population evolving due to\nthe mutations, recombination, genetic drift, natural selection (pairwise\nepistatic fitness). The main conclusion of KNS is that QLE phase exists at\nsufficiently high recombination rate ($r$) with respect to the variability in\nselection strength (fitness). Combining these results with the techniques of\nthe Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) we show that in QLE epistatic fitness can be\ninferred from the knowledge of the (dynamical) distribution of genotypes in a\npopulation. Extending upon our earlier work Zeng & Aurell (2020) here we\npresent an extension to high mutation and recombination rate. We further\nconsider evolution of a population at higher selection strength with respect to\nrecombination and mutation parameters ($r$ and $\\mu$). We identify a new\nbi-stable phase which we call the Non-Random Coexistence (NRC) phase where\ngenomic mutations persist in the population without either fixating or\ndisappearing. We also identify an intermediate region in the parameter space\nwhere a finite population jumps stochastically between QLE-like state and\nNRC-like behaviour.

This linear relationship\ncan be set arbitrarily by a ZD player. Hence, a subclass of ZD strategies can\nfix the opponent's expected payoff and another subclass of the strategies can\nexceed the opponent for the expected payoff. Since this discovery, theories for\nZD strategies are extended to cope with various natural situations. It is\nespecially important to consider the theory of ZD strategies for repeated games\nwith a discount factor and observation errors because it allows the theory to\nbe applicable in the real world. Recent studies revealed their existence of ZD\nstrategies even in repeated games with both factors. However, the conditions\nfor the existence has not been sufficiently analyzed.

First, we derived\nthe thresholds of a discount factor and observation errors which ensure the\nexistence of Equalizer and positively correlated ZD (pcZD) strategies, which\nare well-known subclasses of ZD strategies.
