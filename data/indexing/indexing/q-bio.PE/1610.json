What if only\nthose players can initiate a group formation and establish a game who are\nsuccessful enough to the neighbors? To elaborate this idea we employ a modified\nprotocol and demonstrate that a carefully chosen threshold to establish joint\nventure could efficiently improve the cooperation level even if the synergy\nfactor would suggest a full defector state otherwise. The microscopic mechanism\nwhich is responsible for this effect is based on the asymmetric consequences of\ncompeting strategies: while the success of a cooperator provides a long-time\nwell-being for the neighborhood, the temporary advantage of defection cannot be\nmaintained if the protocol is based on the success of leaders.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 19:38:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-19", "authors_parsed": [["Szolnoki", "Attila", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaojie", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.03915", "submitter": "Michael Deem", "authors": "Yidan Pan and Michael W.

Human influenza epidemics are caused by types A and B, with\nroughly 25% of human cases due to influenza B. Influenza B is a single-stranded\nRNA virus with a high mutation rate, and both prior immune history and\nvaccination put significant pressure on the virus to evolve. Due to the high\nrate of viral evolution, the influenza B vaccine component of the annual\ninfluenza vaccine is updated, roughly every other year in recent years. To\npredict when an update to the vaccine is needed, an estimate of expected\nvaccine effectiveness against a range of viral strains is required. We here\nintroduce a method to measure antigenic distance between the influenza B\nvaccine and circulating viral strains. The measure correlates well with\neffectiveness of the influenza B component of the annual vaccine in humans\nbetween 1979 and 2014.

We extend the concept of reconciliation to protein\ntrees, and we define a new reconciliation problem called MinDRGT that consists\nin finding a gene tree that minimizes a double reconciliation cost with a given\nprotein tree and a given species tree. We define a second problem called\nMinDRPGT that consists in finding a protein tree and a gene tree minimizing a\ndouble reconciliation cost, given a species tree and a set of protein subtrees.\nWe provide algorithmic exact and heuristic solutions for some versions of the\nproblems, and we present the results of an application to the correction of\ngene trees from the Ensembl database. An implementation of the heuristic method\nis available at https://github.com/UdeS-CoBIUS/Protein2GeneTree.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 23:52:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 14:38:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 3 Jul 2017 18:28:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-05", "authors_parsed": [["Kuitche", "Esaie", ""], ["Lafond", "Manuel", ""], ["Ouangraoua", "A\u00efda", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.09937", "submitter": "Sourya Bhattacharyya", "authors": "Sourya Bhattacharyya and Jayanta Mukhopadhyay", "title": "COSPEDTree-II: Improved Couplet based Phylogenetic Supertree", "comments": "8 page detailed manuscript corresponding to the short paper (of the\n  same title) accepted for the proceedings of IEEE BIBM 2016", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A Supertree synthesizes the topologies of a set of phylogenetic trees\ncarrying overlapping taxa set. In process, conflicts in the tree topologies are\naimed to be resolved with the consensus clades. Such a problem is proved to be\nNP-hard. Various heuristics on local search, maximum parsimony, graph cut, etc.\nlead to different supertree approaches, of which the most popular methods are\nbased on analyzing fixed size subtree topologies (such as triplets or\nquartets). Time and space complexities of these methods, however, depend on the\nsubtree size considered. Our earlier proposed supertree method COSPEDTree, uses\nevolutionary relationship among individual couplets (taxa pair), to produce\nslightly conservative (not fully resolved) supertrees. Here we propose its\nimproved version COSPEDTree-II, which produces better resolved supertree with\nlower number of missing branches, and incurs much lower running time. Results\non biological datasets show that COSPEDTree-II belongs to the category of high\nperformance and computationally efficient supertree methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 14:29:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bhattacharyya", "Sourya", ""], ["Mukhopadhyay", "Jayanta", ""]]}]
