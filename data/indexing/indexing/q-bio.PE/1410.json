However, when\nconsidering habitat modeling in ecology, a natural constraint comes from\nnearest-neighbor correlations between the suitable/unsuitable states of the\nspatial units forming the habitat. Such constraints are also relevant in the\nphysics of aggregation where underlying processes may lead to a form of\ncorrelated percolation. However, in ecology, the processes leading to habitat\ncorrelations are in general not known or very complex. As proposed by Hiebeler\n[Ecology {\\bf 81}, 1629 (2000)], these correlations can be captured in a\nlattice model by an observable aggregation parameter $q$, supplementing the\ndensity $p$ of suitable sites. We investigate this model as an instance of\ncorrelated percolation. We analyze the phase diagram of the percolation\ntransition and compute the cluster size distribution, the pair-connectedness\nfunction $C(r)$ and the correlation function $g(r)$. We find that while $g(r)$\ndisplays a power-law decrease associated with long-range correlations in a wide\ndomain of parameter values, critical properties are compatible with the\nuniversality class of uncorrelated percolation. We contrast the correlation\nstructures obtained respectively for the correlated percolation model and for\nthe Ising model, and show that the diversity of habitat configurations\ngenerated by the Hiebeler model is richer than the archetypal Ising model. We\nalso find that emergent structural properties are peculiar to the implemented\nalgorithm, leading to questioning the notion of a well-defined model of\naggregated habitat. We conclude that the choice of model and algorithm have\nstrong consequences on what insights ecological studies can get using such\nmodels of species habitat.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 12:55:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-23", "authors_parsed": [["Huth", "G.", ""], ["Lesne", "A.", ""], ["Munoz", "F.", ""], ["Pitard", "E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0322", "submitter": "Matthew Burgess", "authors": "Matthew G.

This prevents harvesting to\nextinction. A known exception can occur if consumer demand causes a declining\nspecies' harvest price to rise faster than costs. This threat may affect rare\nand valuable species, such as large land mammals, sturgeons, and bluefin tunas.\nWe analyze a similar but underappreciated threat, which arises when the\ngeographic area (range) occupied by a species contracts as its abundance\ndeclines. Range contractions maintain the local densities of declining\npopulations, which facilitates harvesting to extinction by preventing abundance\ndeclines from causing harvest costs to rise. Factors causing such range\ncontractions include schooling, herding, or flocking behaviors--which,\nironically, can be predator-avoidance adaptations; patchy environments; habitat\nloss; and climate change. We use a simple model to identify combinations of\nrange contractions and price increases capable of causing extinction from\nprofitable overharvesting, and we compare these to an empirical review. We find\nthat some aquatic species that school or forage in patchy environments\nexperience sufficiently severe range contractions as they decline to allow\nprofitable harvesting to extinction even with little or no price increase; and\nsome high-value declining aquatic species experience severe price increases.\nFor terrestrial species, the data needed to evaluate our theory are scarce, but\navailable evidence suggests that extinction-enabling range contractions may be\ncommon among declining mammals and birds. Thus, factors causing range\ncontraction as abundance declines may pose unexpectedly large extinction risks\nto harvested species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 18:31:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 23:15:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 05:24:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 00:30:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-31", "authors_parsed": [["Burgess", "Matthew G.", ""], ["Costello", "Christopher", ""], ["Fredston-Hermann", "Alexa", ""], ["Pinsky", "Malin L.", ""], ["Gaines", "Steven D.", ""], ["Tilman", "David", ""], ["Polasky", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.0587", "submitter": "Alexey Mikaberidze", "authors": "Alexey Mikaberidze, Christopher C.

A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)].

Although the human milk microbiome has received\nincreasing attention with the expansion of research on the human microbiome,\nour understanding of the milk microbiome has been limited to cataloguing OTUs\nand computation of community diversity indexes. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk\nmicrobiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community\nnetwork with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA\nsequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis\nrevealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected\nsub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of\nseven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria\nare facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other\nsub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are\nmutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include\nsome opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between\nStaphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes\nwho cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the\n'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk\nmicrobiome should have important health implications to lactating women and\ntheir infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be\nresponsible for dysbiosis of the milk microbiome that permits mastitis.

The results show that prior to the peak of\nthe flu season, our forecasting method projected the actual outcome with a high\nprobability.

Terraces add ambiguity and complexity to\nphylogenetic inference particularly in settings where inference is already\nchallenging: data sets with many taxa and relatively few loci. In this paper we\npresent five new findings about terraces and their impacts on phylogenetic\ninference. First we clarify assumptions about model parameters that are\nnecessary for the existence of terraces. Second, we explore the dependence of\nterrace size on partitioning scheme and indicate how to find the partitioning\nscheme associated with the largest terrace containing a given tree. Third, we\nhighlight the impact of terraces on bootstrap estimates of confidence limits in\nclades, and characterize the surprising result that the bootstrap proportion\nfor a clade can be entirely determined by the frequency of bipartitions on a\nterrace, with some bipartitions receiving high support even when incorrect.\nFourth, we dissect some effects of prior distributions of edge lengths on the\ncomputed posterior probabilities of clades on terraces, to understand an\nexample in which long edges \"attract\" each other in Bayesian inference. Fifth,\nwe show that even if data are not partitioned, patterns of missing data studied\nin the terrace problem can lead to instances of apparent statistical\ninconsistency when even a small element of heterotachy is introduced to the\nmodel generating the sequence data.
