In a neutral population with constant size $N$, we\nassume that each individual at time $0$ carries a distinct type, or allele. We\nconsider the joint dynamics of these $N$ alleles, for example the dynamics of\ntheir respective frequencies and more plainly the nonincreasing process\ncounting the number of alleles remaining by time $t$. We call this process the\nextinction process. We show that in the Moran model, the extinction process is\ndistributed as the process counting (in backward time) the number of common\nancestors to the whole population, also known as the block counting process of\nthe $N$-Kingman coalescent. Stimulated by this result, we investigate: (1)\nwhether it extends to an identity between the frequencies of blocks in the\nKingman coalescent and the frequencies of alleles in the extinction process,\nboth evaluated at jump times; (2) whether it extends to the general case of\n$\\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Jan 2018 15:21:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Achaz", "Guillaume", ""], ["Lambert", "Amaury", ""], ["Schertzer", "Emmanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1801.00982", "submitter": "Philip Ernst", "authors": "Philip A.

For example, for\ninbreeding avoidance it can be sufficient that one sex disperses away from the\nnatal site. Attempts to understand sex-specific dispersal evolution have\ncreated a rich body of theoretical literature, which we review here. We\nhighlight an interesting gap between empirical and theoretical literature. The\nformer associates different patterns of sex-biased dispersal with mating\nsystems, such as female-biased dispersal in monogamous birds and male-biased\ndispersal in polygynous mammals. The predominant explanation is traceable back\nto Greenwood's (1980) ideas of how successful philopatric or dispersing\nindividuals are at gaining mates or resources required to attract them. Theory,\nhowever, has developed surprisingly independently of these ideas: predominant\nideas in theoretical work track how immigration and emigration change\nrelatedness patterns and alleviate competition for limiting resources,\ntypically considered sexually distinct, with breeding sites and fertilisable\nfemales limiting reproductive success for females and males, respectively. We\nshow that the link between mating system and sex-biased dispersal is far from\nresolved: there are studies showing that mating systems matter, but the\noft-stated association between polygyny and male-biased dispersal is not a\nstraightforward theoretical expectation...

For example, it\nhas long been known that under the Yule model, a pure birth process, imbalanced\ntrees are more likely than balanced ones. Also, concerning ordered search\ntrees, more balanced ones allow for more efficient data structuring than\nimbalanced ones. Therefore, different methods to measure the balance of trees\nwere introduced. The Sackin index is one of the most frequently used measures\nfor this purpose. In many contexts, statements about the minimal and maximal\nvalues of this index have been discussed, but formal proofs have only been\nprovided for some of them, and only in the context of ordered binary (search)\ntrees, not for general rooted trees. Moreover, while the number of trees with\nmaximal Sackin index as well as the number of trees with minimal Sackin index\nwhen the number of leaves is a power of 2 are relatively easy to understand,\nthe number of trees with minimal Sackin index for all other numbers of leaves\nhas been completely unknown. In this manuscript, we extend the findings on\ntrees with minimal and maximal Sackin indices from the literature on ordered\ntrees and subsequently use our results to provide formulas to explicitly\ncalculate the numbers of such trees. We also extend previous studies by\nanalyzing the case when the underlying trees need not be binary.
