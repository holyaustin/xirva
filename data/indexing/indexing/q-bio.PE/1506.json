A fundamental difference between phylogenetic and functional\nanalyses is that phylogeny is intrinsically dependent on a tree-like structure.\nWhen the branches of a phylogenetic tree have lengths, then each evolutionary\nunit on these branches can be considered as a basic entity on which\ndissimilarities among sites should be measured. Several of the recent measures\nof phylogenetic dissimilarities among sites thus are traditional dissimilarity\nindices where species are replaced by evolutionary units. The resulting indices\nwere named PD-dissimilarity indices. Here I review and compare indices and\nordination approaches that, although first developed to analyse the differences\nin the species compositions of sites, can be adapted to describe\nPD-dissimilarities among sites, thus revealing how lineages are distributed\nalong environmental gradients, or among habitats or regions.

This\nphylogenetic incongruence is attributed to the reticulated evolutionary history\nof most species due to meiotic sexual recombination in eukaryotes, or\nhorizontal transfers of genetic materials in prokaryotes. Nonetheless, most\ngenes do display topologically related phylogenies; this implies they form\ncohesive subsets (clusters). In this work, we compare popular clustering\nmethods, and show how the performance of the normalized cut framework is\nefficient and statistically accurate when obtaining clusters on the set of gene\ntrees based on the geodesic distance between them over the\nBillera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space. We proceed to present a computational\nstudy on the performance of different clustering methods with and without\npreprocessing under different distance metrics and using a series of dimension\nreduction techniques. Results: First, we show using simulated data that indeed\nthe Ncut framework accurately clusters the set of gene trees given a species\ntree under the coalescent process. We then depict the success of our framework\nby comparing its performance to other clustering techniques, including k-means\nand hierarchical clustering. The main computational results can be summarized\nto the stellar performance of the Ncut framework even without dimension\nreduction, the similar performance portrayed by k-means and Ncut under most\ndimension reduction schemes, the utter failure of hierarchical clustering to\naccurately capture clusters, as well as the significantly better performance of\nthe NJp method, as compared to MLE.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 07:42:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 18:12:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Yoshida", "Ruriko", ""], ["Fukumizu", "Kenji", ""], ["Vogiatzis", "Chrysafis", ""]]}, {"id": "1506.08483", "submitter": "Andrew J.

The preferences and social dynamics\nof a population can have a large impact on the course of an outbreak as well as\nthe effectiveness of interventions intended to influence individual behavior.\nIn addition, individuals may alter their sexual behavior in response to the\npresence of STIs, creating a feedback loop between transmission and behavior.\nWe investigate the consequences of modeling the interaction between STI\ntransmission and prophylactic use with a model that links a\nSusceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) system to evolutionary game dynamics\nthat determine the effective contact rate. The combined model framework allows\nus to address protective behavior by both infected and susceptible individuals.\nFeedback between behavioral adaptation and prevalence creates a wide range of\ndynamic behaviors in the combined model, including damped and sustained\noscillations as well as bistability, depending on the behavioral parameters and\ndisease growth rate. We found that disease extinction is possible for multiple\nregions where R0 > 1, due to behavior adaptation driving the epidemic downward,\nalthough conversely endemic prevalence for arbitrarily low R0 is also possible\nif contact rates are sufficiently high. We also tested how model\nmisspecification might affect disease forecasting and estimation of the model\nparameters and R0.

The uncertainty emerges from number\nfluctuations, called genetic drift, arising in the small number of particularly\nfit individuals of the population. Random genetic drift in this evolutionary\nvanguard also limits the speed of adaptation, which diverges in deterministic\nmodels that ignore these chance effects. Several approaches have been developed\nto analyze the crucial role of noise on the expected dynamics of adaptation,\nincluding the mean fitness of the entire population, or the fate of newly\narising beneficial deleterious mutations. However, very little is known about\nhow genetic drift causes fluctuations to emerge on the population level,\nincluding fitness distribution variations and speed variations. Yet, these\nphenomena control the replicability of experimental evolution experiments and\nare key to a truly predictive understanding of evolutionary processes. Here, we\ndevelop an exact approach to these emergent fluctuations by a combination of\ncomputational and analytical methods. We show, analytically, that the infinite\nhierarchy of moment equations can be closed at any arbitrary order by a\nsuitable choice of a dynamical constraint. This constraint regulates (rather\nthan fixes) the population size, accounting for resource limitations. The\nresulting linear equations, which can be accurately solved numerically, exhibit\nfluctuation-induced terms that amplify short-distance correlations and suppress\nlong-distance ones. Importantly, by accounting for the dynamics of\nsub-populations, we provide a systematic route to key population genetic\nquantities, such as fixation probabilities and decay rates of the genetic\ndiversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:35:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""], ["Geyrhofer", "Lukas", ""]]}]
