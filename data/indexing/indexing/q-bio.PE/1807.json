By natural selection through the abiotic\nenvironment and by co-adaptation within the community, species evolve, thereby\ngiving rise to the ecological networks we regard as ecosystems. This\nreductionist perspective can be contrasted with the view that as species have\nto fit in the surrounding system, the system itself exerts selection pressure\non the evolutionary pathways of the species. This interplay of bottom-up and\ntop-down control in the development and growth of ecological systems has long\nbeen discussed, however empirical ecosystem data is scarce and a comprehensive\nmathematical framework is lacking. We present a way of quantifying the relative\nweight of natural selection and coadaptation grounded in information theory, to\nassess the relative role of bottom-up and top-down control in the evolution of\necological systems, and analyse the information transfer in an individual based\nstochastic complex systems model, the Tangled Nature Model of evolutionary\necology. We show that ecological communities evolve from mainly bottom-up\ncontrolled early-successional systems to more strongly top-down controlled\nlate-successional systems, as coadaptation progresses. Species which have a\nhigh influence on selection are also generally more abundant. Hence our\nfindings imply that ecological communities are shaped by a dialogue of\nbottom-up and top-down control, where the role of the systemic selection and\nintegrity becomes more pronounced the further the ecosystem is developed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Jul 2018 08:30:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Brinck", "Katharina", ""], ["Jensen", "Henrik Jeldtoft", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00701", "submitter": "Adam Kleczkowski", "authors": "Adam Kleczkowski, Andrew Bate, Michael Redenti and Nick Hanley", "title": "Weakest-link control of invasive species: Impacts of memory, bounded\n  rationality and network structure in repeated cooperative games", "comments": "29 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The nature of dispersal of many invasive pests and pathogens in agricultural\nand forestry makes it necessary to consider how the actions of one manager\naffect neighbouring properties.

In this work, we develop such a theory for a\nnew class of deterministic individual based models describing individual births\nand deaths, which captures the essential features of standard stochastic\nindividual-based models and become identical with the latter under maximal\ncompetition. The key motivation is to derive the canonical equation of adaptive\ndynamics from this microscopic ecological model, which can be regarded as a\n\"toy model\" for evolution, in a simple way and give it an intuitive geometric\ninterpretation. Another goal is to study evolution and sympatric speciation\nunder \"maximal\" competition. We show that these models, in the deterministic\nlimit of adaptive dynamics, lead to the same equations that describe the\nunraveling of the mean evolutionary trajectory as those obtained from the\nstandard stochastic models. We further study conditions under which these\nmodels lead to evolutionary branching and find them to be similar with those\nobtained from the standard stochastic models. We find that though deterministic\nmodels result in a strong competition that leads to a speed up in the temporal\ndynamics of a population cloud in the phenotypic space as well as an increase\nin the rate of generation of biodiversity, it does not seem to result in an\nabsolute increase in biodiversity as far as total number of species are\nconcerned.

In addition, a consensus curve based on the climatic and eustatic data\nis obtained to explain the fluctuations of the Phanerozoic biodiversity curve.\nThus, the reconstructed biodiversity curve based on genomic, climatic and\neustatic data agrees with Sepkoski's curve based on fossil data.

This approach (AIC model averaging; hereafter AvgAICc) is\noften preferable than alternatives based on the selection of a single model.\nSurprisingly, AvgAICc has not yet been introduced in ecological niche modeling\n(ENM). We aimed to introduce AvgAICc in the context of ENM to serve both as an\noptimality criterion in analyses that tune-up model parameters and as a\nmulti-model prediction strategy.\n  Innovation: Results from the AvgAICc approach differed from those of\nalternative approaches with respect to model complexity, contribution of\nenvironmental variables, and predicted amount and geographic location of\nsuitable conditions for the focal species. Two theoretical properties of the\nAvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over\nalternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a\nsingle model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important\npredictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative\noptimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this\nbeing of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model\ntransference.\n  Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its\ntheoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over\nalternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the\nAvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use\nof the AvgAICc approach.

Here, we show that such a relationship arises\nnaturally from a model in which T cell expansion is limited by decaying levels\nof presented antigen. The same model also accounts for the observed dependence\nof T cell expansion on affinity for antigen and on the kinetics of antigen\nadministration. Extending the model to address expansion of multiple T cell\nclones competing for antigen, we find that higher affinity clones can suppress\nthe proliferation of lower affinity clones, thereby promoting the specificity\nof the response. Employing the model to derive optimal vaccination protocols,\nwe find that exponentially increasing antigen doses can achieve a nearly\noptimized response. We thus conclude that the dynamics of presented antigen is\na key regulator of both the size and specificity of the adaptive immune\nresponse.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2018 08:39:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Mayer", "Andreas", ""], ["Zhang", "Yaojun", ""], ["Perelson", "Alan S.", ""], ["Wingreen", "Ned S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.10556", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "Morbidity, mortality and the illness-death model", "comments": "5 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article, we use the illness-death model to present a mathematical\nframework for studying the compression of morbidity (COM) hypothesis.

Thus, understanding its causes has become a\npriority of scholars across many disciplines. Here we demonstrate that shifts\nin socialization strategies analogous to political polarization and identity\npolitics can arise as a locally-beneficial response to both rising wealth\ninequality and economic decline. Adopting a perspective of cultural evolution,\nwe develop a framework to study the emergence of polarization under shifting\neconomic environments. In many contexts, interacting with diverse out-groups\nconfers benefits from innovation and exploration greater than those that arise\nfrom interacting exclusively with a homogeneous in-group. However, when the\neconomic environment favors risk-aversion, a strategy of seeking low-risk\ninteractions can be important to maintaining individual solvency. To capture\nthis dynamic, we assume that in-group interactions have a lower expected\noutcome, but a more certain one. Thus in-group interactions are less risky than\nout-group interactions. Our model shows that under conditions of economic\ndecline or increasing wealth inequality, some members of the population benefit\nfrom adopting a risk-averse, in-group favoring strategy. Moreover, we show that\nsuch in-group polarization can spread rapidly to the whole population and\npersist even when the conditions that produced it have reversed. Finally we\noffer empirical support for the role of income inequality as a driver of\naffective polarization in the United States, mirroring findings on a panel of\ndeveloped democracies.
