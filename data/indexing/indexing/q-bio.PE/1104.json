One\nreason these patterns of direct connections are critical is that they establish\nthe pathways through which elements influence each other indirectly. Here, we\ntested a hypothesized consequence of connectivity in ecosystems: the\nhomogenization of resource distributions in flow networks. Specifically, we\ntested the generality of the systems ecology hypothesis of resource\nhomogenization in 50 empirically derived trophic ecosystem models representing\n35 distinct ecosystems. We applied Ecological Network Analysis to calculate\nresource homogenization for these models. We further evaluated the robustness\nof our results in two ways. First, we verified the close correspondence between\nthe input- and output-oriented homogenization values to ensure that our results\nwere not biased by our decision to focus on the output orientation. Second, we\nconducted a Monte Carlo based uncertainty analysis to determine the robustness\nof our results to +/-5% error introduced into the original flow matrices for\neach model. Our results show that resource homogenization occurs universally in\nthe 50 ecosystem models tested. We confirm that our results are not biased by\nusing the output-oriented homogenization values because there is a significant\nlinear regression between the input and output oriented homogenization (r^2 =\n0.38, p < 0.001). Finally, we found that our results are robust to +/-5% error\nin the flow matrices. In conclusion, we found strong support for the resource\nhomogenization hypothesis in 50 empirically derived ecosystem models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 20:16:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""], ["Salas", "Andria K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0025", "submitter": "Chris Adami", "authors": "Christoph Adami, Jifeng Qian, Matthew Rupp, and Arend Hintze", "title": "Information content of colored motifs in complex networks", "comments": "21 pages, 8 figures, to appear in Artificial Life", "journal-ref": "Artificial Life 17 (2011) 375-390", "doi": "10.1162/artl_a_00045", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.IT math.IT nlin.AO q-bio.MN q-bio.NC q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study complex networks in which the nodes of the network are tagged with\ndifferent colors depending on the functionality of the nodes (colored graphs),\nusing information theory applied to the distribution of motifs in such\nnetworks.

We demonstrate that the model is\nable to realistically hindcast the expansion speed and the inhomogeneous\nspace-time evolution of the transition to agropastoralism in Europe. GLUES, in\ncontrast to models that do not resolve endogenous sociocultural dynamics, also\ndescribes and explains how and why the Neolithic advanced in stages. In the\nmodel analysis, we uncouple the mechanisms of migration and information\nexchange. We find that (1) an indigenous form of agropastoralism could well\nhave arisen in certain Mediterranean landscapes, but not in Northern and\nCentral Europe, where it depended on imported technology and material, (2) both\ndemic diffusion by migration or cultural diffusion by trade may explain the\nwestern European transition equally well, (3) [...]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 11 Apr 2011 11:15:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Aug 2011 08:14:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Lemmen", "Carsten", ""], ["Gronenborn", "Detlef", ""], ["Wirtz", "Kai W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.1930", "submitter": "Lennart Hilbert", "authors": "Lennart Hilbert", "title": "Shifting gears: Thermodynamics of genetic information storage suggest\n  stress-dependence of mutation rate, which can accelerate adaptation", "comments": "15 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph nlin.AO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Acceleration of adaptation dynamics by stress-induced\nhypermutation has been found experimentally.

Rosenzweig in a class of\npredator-prey models. Two of the parameters in the models are crucial for the\nparadox. These two parameters are the prey's carrying capacity and prey's\nhalf-saturation for predation. Intuitively, increasing the carrying capacity\ndue to enrichment of the prey's environment should lead to a more stable\npredator-prey system. Analytically, it turns out that increasing the carrying\ncapacity always leads to an unstable predator-prey system that is susceptible\nto extinction from environmental random perturbations. This is the so-called\nparadox of enrichment. Our resolution here rests upon a closer investigation on\na dimensionless number $H$ formed from the carrying capacity and the prey's\nhalf-saturation. By recasting the models into dimensionless forms, the models\nare in fact governed by a few dimensionless numbers including $H$. The effects\nof the two parameters: carrying capacity and half-saturation are incorporated\ninto the number $H$. In fact, increasing the carrying capacity is equivalent\n(i.e. has the same effect on $H$) to decreasing the half-saturation which\nimplies more aggressive predation. Since there is no paradox between more\naggressive predation and instability of the predator-prey system, the paradox\nof enrichment is resolved.\n  We also further explore spatially dependent models for which the phase space\nis infinite dimensional. The spatially independent limit cycle which is\ngenerated by a Hopf bifurcation from an unstable steady state, is linearly\nstable in the infinite dimensional phase space. Numerical simulations indicate\nthat the basin of attraction of the limit cycle is riddled. This shows that\nspatial perturbations can sometimes (neither always nor never) remove the\nparadox of enrichment near the limit cycle!\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2011 20:38:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 19:32:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Feng", "Z.

The weak point of this method is\nthat subjective judgment plays a relevant role.\n  Recently, we have proposed a new automated method which is motivated by the\nanalogy with genetics. The new approach avoids any subjectivity and results can\nbe easily replicated by other scholars. The distance between two languages is\ndefined by considering a renormalized Levenshtein distance between pair of\nwords with the same meaning and averaging on the words contained in a list. The\nrenormalization, which takes into account the length of the words, plays a\ncrucial role, and no sensible results can be found without it.\n  In this paper we give a short review of our automated method and we\nillustrate it by considering the cluster of Malagasy dialects.

Cooperation survives because it is possible\nfor close-knit communities of cooperation to be shielded from invasion by\ndefectors. Here we show that parameter ranges in which cooperation can survive\nare strongly expanded if game play on networks is skewed towards more frequent\ninteractions with more successful neighbours. In particular, if agents\nexclusively select neighbors for game play that are more successful than\nthemselves, cooperation can even dominate in situations in which it would die\nout if interaction neighbours were chosen without a bias or with a preference\nfor less successful opponents. We demonstrate that the \"selecting fitter\nneighbours\" strategy is evolutionarily stable.
