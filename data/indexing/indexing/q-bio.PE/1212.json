More specifically, at a\nmicroscopic level, matter and energy are no longer retained within their simple\nform, and quantum mechanical models are proposed wherein potential form is\nconsidered in addition to actual form. In this paper we propose an alternative\nto standard Neodarwinian evolution theory. We suggest that the starting point\nof evolution theory cannot be limited to actual variation whereupon is\nselected, but to variation in the potential of entities according to the\ncontext. We therefore develop a formalism, referred to as Context driven\nActualization of Potential (CAP), which handles potentiality and describes the\nevolution of entities as an actualization of potential through a reiterated\ninteraction with the context. As in quantum mechanics, lack of knowledge of the\nentity, its context, or the interaction between context and entity leads to\ndifferent forms of indeterminism in relation to the state of the entity. This\nindeterminism generates a non-Kolmogorovian distribution of probabilities that\nis different from the classical distribution of chance described by Darwinian\nevolution theory, which stems from a 'actuality focused', i.e. materialistic,\nview of nature. We also present a quantum evolution game that highlights the\nmain differences arising from our new perspective and shows that it is more\nfundamental to consider evolution in general, and biological evolution in\nspecific, as a process of actualization of potential induced by context, for\nwhich its material reduction is only a special case.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Dec 2012 13:04:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-04", "authors_parsed": [["Aerts", "Diederik", ""], ["Bundervoet", "Stan", ""], ["Czachor", "Marek", ""], ["D'Hooghe", "Bart", ""], ["Gabora", "Liane", ""], ["Polk", "Philip", ""], ["Sozzo", "Sandro", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.0109", "submitter": "Diederik Aerts", "authors": "Diederik Aerts, Jan Broekaert, Marek Czachor, Maciej Kuna, Barry\n  Sinervo and Sandro Sozzo", "title": "Quantum Structure in Competing Lizard Communities", "comments": "28 pages", "journal-ref": "Ecological Modelling, 281, pp. 38-51, 2014", "doi": "10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2014.02.009", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.PE quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Almost two decades of research on applications of the mathematical formalism\nof quantum theory as a modeling tool in domains different from the micro-world\nhas given rise to many successful applications in situations related to human\nbehavior and thought, more specifically in cognitive processes of\ndecision-making and the ways concepts are combined into sentences.

The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural\nselection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,\noccasionally, the gain of a novel one.

In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions\nin diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives\nrise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a\npopulation. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory\nactivator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a\ndiploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their\ntranscriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or\nto its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are\nintroduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it\nis shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that\nemerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is\ndeleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The\ndiploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific\nexpression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network\nenables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.\nThis is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,\nwhereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single\ncells.

Theoretical work and empirical\ninvestigation in Escherichia coli have shown that negative autoregulation\nconfers both rapid response times and reduced intrinsic noise, which is\nreflected in the fact that almost half of Escherichia coli transcription\nfactors are negatively autoregulated. However, negative autoregulation is\nexceedingly rare amongst the transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\nThis difference is all the more surprising because E. coli and S. cerevisiae\notherwise have remarkably similar profiles of network motifs. In this study we\nfirst show that regulatory interactions amongst the transcription factors of\nDrosophila melanogaster and humans have a similar dearth of negative\nautoregulation to that seen in S. cerevisiae. We then present a model\ndemonstrating that this fundamental difference in the noise reduction\nstrategies used amongst species can be explained by constraints on the\nevolution of negative autoregulation in diploids. We show that regulatory\ninteractions between pairs of homologous genes within the same cell can lead to\nunder-dominance - mutations which result in stronger autoregulation, and\ndecrease noise in homozygotes, paradoxically can cause increased noise in\nheterozygotes. This severely limits a diploid's ability to evolve negative\nautoregulation as a noise reduction mechanism. Our work offers a simple and\ngeneral explanation for a previously unexplained difference between the\nregulatory architectures of E. coli and yeast, Drosophila and humans.

Asymmetric division of each stem cell into one stem\ncell and one differentiated cell can accomplish both tasks. However, in\nmammalian cycling tissues, some stem cells divide symmetrically into two\ndifferentiated cells and are replaced by a neighbor that divides symmetrically\ninto two stem cells. Besides this heterogeneity in fate (population asymmetry),\nstem cells also exhibit heterogenous proliferation-rates; in the long run,\nhowever, all stem cells proliferate at the same average rate (equipotency).

Essentially, slow-dividing stem cells proliferate and\npurge the population of the fast-dividing --older-- cells which had undertaken\nthe majority of the tissue-generation burden. As the number of slow-dividing\ncells grows, their proliferation-rate increases, eventually turning them into\nfast-dividers, which are themselves replaced by newly emerging slow-dividers.\nGoing beyond current experiments, we propose a mechanism for equipotency that\ncan potentially halve the rate of replicative aging.

Hitherto, research of natural HGT\nhas mainly focused on three mechanisms: conjugation, natural competence, and\nviral transduction. This paper discusses the feasibility of a fourth such\nmechanism - cell electroporation and/or electrofusion triggered by atmospheric\nelectrostatic discharges (lightnings). A description of electroporation as a\nphenomenon is followed by a review of experimental evidence that\nelectroporation of prokaryotes in aqueous environments can result in release of\nnon-denatured DNA, as well as uptake of DNA from the surroundings and\ntransformation. Similarly, a description of electrofusion is followed by a\nreview of experiments showing that prokaryotes devoid of cell wall can\nelectrofuse into hybrids expressing the genes of their both precursors. Under\nsufficiently fine-tuned conditions, electroporation and electrofusion are\nefficient tools for artificial transformation and hybridization, respectively,\nbut the quantitative analysis developed here shows that conditions for\nelectroporation-based DNA release, DNA uptake and transformation, as well as\nfor electrofusion are also present in many natural aqueous environments exposed\nto lightnings. Electroporation is thus a plausible contributor to natural HGT\namong prokaryotes, and could have been particularly important during the early\nevolution, when the other mechanisms might have been scarcer or nonexistent. In\nmodern prokaryotes, natural absence of the cell wall is rare, but it is\nreasonable to assume that the wall has formed during evolution, and at least\nprior to this, electrofusion could also have contributed to HGT. The concluding\nsection outlines several guidelines for assessment of the feasibility of\nlightning-triggered HGT.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 13:52:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kotnik", "Tadej", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.5439", "submitter": "Eric  Werner", "authors": "Eric Werner", "title": "A Developmental Network Theory of Gynandromorphs, Sexual Dimorphism and\n  Species Formation", "comments": "22 pages.
