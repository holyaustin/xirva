These different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect\nswarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations\nthat would arise in the absence of fluid. Depending upon the overall\ninteraction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),\nand the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective\nthree-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,\nrecirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain\nparticles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures.

Although the meaning of this axis -- identified with a \"niche\"\ndimension -- has remained a mystery, it is assumed to lie at the basis of the\nhighly non-trivial structure of food webs. With this in mind, most trophic\nnetwork modelling has for decades been based on assigning species a niche value\nby hand. However, we argue here that intervality should not be considered the\ncause but rather a consequence of food-web structure. First, analysing a set of\n$46$ empirical food webs, we find that they also exhibit {\\it predator}\nintervality: the predators of any given species are as likely to be contiguous\nas the prey are, but in a different ordering. Furthermore, this property is not\nexclusive of trophic networks: several networks of genes, neurons, metabolites,\ncellular machines, airports, and words are found to be approximately as\ninterval as food webs. We go on to show that a simple model of food-web\nassembly which does not make use of a niche axis can nevertheless generate\nsignificant intervality. Therefore, the niche dimension (in the sense used for\nfood-web modelling) could in fact be the consequence of other, more fundamental\nstructural traits, such as trophic coherence. We conclude that a new approach\nto food-web modelling is required for a deeper understanding of ecosystem\nassembly, structure and function, and propose that certain topological features\nthought to be specific of food webs are in fact common to many complex\nnetworks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 10:53:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Dom\u00ednguez-Garc\u00eda", "Virginia", ""], ["Johnson", "Samuel", ""], ["Mu\u00f1oz", "Miguel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.04007", "submitter": "Bertrand Roehner", "authors": "Sylvie Berrut, Violette Pouillard, Peter Richmond, Bertrand M.

In\nline with reliability theory, \"infant\" will refer here to the time interval\nfollowing birth during which the mortality (or failure) rate decreases. This\ndefinition provides a systems science perspective in which birth constitutes a\nsudden transition which falls within the field of application of the \"Transient\nShock\" (TS) conjecture put forward in Richmond et al. (2016c). This conjecture\nprovides predictions about the timing and shape of the death rate peak. (i) It\nsays that there will be a death rate spike whenever external conditions change\nabruptly and drastically. (ii) It predicts that after a steep rising there will\nbe a much longer hyperbolic relaxation process. These predictions can be tested\nby considering living organisms for which birth is a multi-step process. Thus,\nfor fish there are three states: egg, yolk-sac phase, young adult. The TS\nconjecture predicts a mortality spike at the end of the yolk-sac phase, and\nthis timing is indeed confirmed by observation. Secondly, the hyperbolic nature\nof the relaxation process can be tested using high accuracy Swiss statistics\nwhich give postnatal death rates from one hour after birth up to the age of 10\nyears. It turns out that since the 19th century despite a great overall\nreduction in infant mortality, the shape of the age-specific death rate has\nremained basically unchanged. This hyperbolic pattern is not specific to\nhumans. It can also be found in small primates as recorded in the archives of\nzoological gardens.

The\nLake Kariba area of Southern Province, Zambia, is part of a multi-country\nelimination effort and presents a particular challenge as it is an\ninterconnected region of variable transmission intensities.\n  Methods In 2012-13, six rounds of mass-screen-and-treat drug campaigns were\ncarried out in the Lake Kariba region. A spatial dynamical model of malaria\ntransmission in the Lake Kariba area, with transmission and climate modeled at\nthe village scale, was calibrated to the 2012-13 prevalence survey data, with\ncase management rates, insecticide-treated net usage, and drug campaign\ncoverage informed by surveillance. The model was used to simulate the effect of\nvarious interventions implemented in 2014-22 on reducing regional transmission,\nachieving elimination by 2022, and maintaining elimination through 2028.\n  Findings The model captured the spatio-temporal trends of decline and rebound\nin malaria prevalence in 2012-13 at the village scale. Simulations predicted\nthat elimination required repeated mass drug administrations coupled with\nsimultaneous increase in net usage. Drug campaigns targeted only at high-burden\nareas were as successful as campaigns covering the entire region.\n  Interpretation Elimination in the Lake Kariba region is possible through\ncoordinating mass drug campaigns with high-coverage vector control. Targeting\nregional hotspots is a viable alternative to global campaigns when human\nmigration within an interconnected area is responsible for maintaining\ntransmission in low-burden areas.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:37:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-08", "authors_parsed": [["Nikolov", "Milen", ""], ["Bever", "Caitlin A.", ""], ["Upfill-Brown", "Alexander", ""], ["Hamainza", "Busiku", ""], ["Miller", "John M.", ""], ["Eckhoff", "Philip A.", ""], ["Wenger", "Edward A.", ""], ["Gerardin", "Jaline", ""]]}, {"id": "1603.04955", "submitter": "Stephen Pankavich", "authors": "Paul Diaz, Paul Constantine, Kelsey Kalmbach, Eric Jones, and Stephen\n  Pankavich", "title": "A Modified SEIR Model for the Spread of Ebola in Western Africa and\n  Metrics for Resource Allocation", "comments": "28 pages, 9 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.NA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A modified, deterministic SEIR model is developed for the 2014 Ebola epidemic\noccurring in the West African nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone.

This process explores and takes advantage of the reciprocal relation\nthat solid tumours establish with the extracellular matrix (ECM) components and\nother multiple distinct cell types from the surrounding microenvironment.\nThrough the secretion of various proteolytic enzymes such as matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMP) or the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), the\ncancer cell population alters the configuration of the surrounding ECM\ncomposition and overcomes the physical barriers to ultimately achieve local\ncancer spread into the surrounding tissue. The active interplay between the\ntissue-scale tumour dynamics and the molecular mechanics of the involved\nproteolytic enzymes at the cell-scale underlines the biologically multiscale\ncharacter of invasion, and raises the challenge of modelling this process with\nan appropriate multiscale approach. In this paper, we present a new two-scale\nmoving boundary model of cancer invasion that explores the tissue scale tumour\ndynamics in conjunction with the molecular dynamics of the urokinase\nplasminogen activation system. Building on the multiscale moving boundary\nmethod proposed in [58], the modelling that we propose here allows us to study\nthe changes in tissue scale tumour morphology caused by the cell-scale uPA\nmicro-dynamics occurring along the invasive edge of the tumour. Our\ncomputational simulation results demonstrate a range of heterogeneous dynamics\nwhich are qualitatively similar to the invasive growth patterns observed in a\nnumber of different types of cancer, such as the tumour infiltrative growth\npatterns discussed in [33].\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 11:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Peng", "Lu", ""], ["Trucu", "Dumitru", ""], ["Lin", "Ping", ""], ["Thompson", "Alastair", ""], ["Chaplain", "Mark A.
