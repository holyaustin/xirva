In the fields\nof population and evolutionary genetics, measures of genetic differentiation\nare commonly used to gather this information. One potential caveat is that\nthese measures assume gene flow to be symmetric. However, asymmetric gene flow\nis common in nature, especially in systems driven by physical processes such as\nwind or water currents. Since information about levels of asymmetric gene flow\namong populations is essential for the correct interpretation of the\ndistribution of contemporary genetic diversity within species, this should not\nbe overlooked. To obtain information on asymmetric migration patterns from\ngenetic data, complex models based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches\ngenerally need to be employed, often at great computational cost. Here, a new\nsimpler and more efficient approach for understanding gene flow patterns is\npresented. This approach allows the estimation of directional components of\ngenetic divergence between pairs of populations at low computational effort,\nusing any of the classical or modern measures of genetic differentiation. These\ndirectional measures of genetic differentiation can further be used to\ncalculate directional relative migration and to detect asymmetries in gene flow\npatterns. This can be done in a user-friendly web application called\ndivMigrate-online introduced in this paper. Using simulated data sets with\nknown gene flow regimes, we demonstrate that the method is capable of resolving\ncomplex migration patterns under a range of study designs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Mar 2013 15:30:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 04:52:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 13:56:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sundqvist", "Lisa", ""], ["Keenan", "Kevin", ""], ["Zackrisson", "Martin", ""], ["Prod\u00f6hl", "Paulo", ""], ["Kleinhans", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.0132", "submitter": "Shampa Ghosh", "authors": "Shampa M.

Instead, sex is\nwidespread and it is clonal species that face early obsolescence. One possible\nreason is that sex is an adaptation to resist ubiquitous parasites, which\nevolve rapidly and potentially antagonistically. We use a heuristic approach to\nmodel mutation-selection in finite populations where a parasitic haploid mounts\na negative frequency-dependent attack on a diploid host. The host evolves\nreflexively to reduce parasitic load. Both host and parasite populations\ngenerate novel alleles by mutation and have access to large allele spaces. Sex\noutcompetes cloning by two overlapping mechanisms. First, sexual diploids adopt\nadvantageous homozygous mutations more rapidly than clonal diploids under\nconditions of lag load. This rate advantage can offset the lesser fecundity of\nsex. Second, a relative advantage to sex emerges under host mutation rates that\nare fast enough to retain fitness in a rapidly mutating parasite environment\nand increase host polymorphism. Clonal polymorphic populations\ndisproportionately experience interference with selection at high mutation\nrates, both between and within loci. This slows clonal population adaptation to\na changing parasite environment and reduces clonal population fitness relative\nto sex. The interference increases markedly with the number of loci under\nindependent selection. Rates of parasite mutation exist that not only allow sex\nto survive despite the two-fold cost of males but which enable sexual and\nclonal populations to have equal fitness and co-exist.

Here we first estimate the case reproduction number, R0, for\ncountries in sub-Saharan Africa and for India using data on the rate at which\nthe prevalence of HIV increased at the start of the epidemic and the life\nexpectancy of people living with HIV who are not on ART. R0 determines the\nmagnitude of the control problem, that is to say, the extent to which\ntransmission must be reduced to eliminate HIV. We show that in sub-Saharan\nAfrica the median value of R0 is 4.6 and in all but five countries R0 is less\nthan 6.3. If the 90-90-90 target is reached, 73% of all those living with HIV\nwill have full viral load suppression.

Results Here we characterise the\ngenomes of wild Medaka catches obtained from a single Southern Japanese\npopulation in Kiyosu as a precursor for the establishment of a near isogenic\npanel of wild lines. The population is free of significant detrimental\npopulation structure, and has advantageous linkage disequilibrium properties\nsuitable for establishment of the proposed panel. Analysis of morphometric\ntraits in five representative inbred strains suggests phenotypic mapping will\nbe feasible in the panel.

This shows inconsistency\nbetween population genetic models of sex ratio evolution and classical\nstrategic models. In this work a novel technique of change of coordinates will\nbe applied to the new model. This will reveal new aspects of the modelled\nphenomenon which cannot be shown or proven in the original formulation. The\nunderlying goal is to describe the dynamics of selection of particular genes in\nthe entire population, instead of in the same sex subpopulation, as in the\nprevious paper and earlier population genetics approaches. This allows for\nanalytical derivation of the unbiased strategic model from the model with\nrigorous non-simplified genetics. In effect, an alternative system of\nreplicator equations is derived. It contains two subsystems: the first\ndescribes changes in gene frequencies (this is an alternative unbiased\nformalization of the Fisher-Dusing argument), whereas the second describes\nchanges in the sex ratios in subpopulations of carriers of genes for each\nstrategy. An intriguing analytical result of this work is that fitness of a\ngene depends on the current sex ratio in the subpopulation of its carriers, not\non the encoded individual strategy. Thus, the argument of the gene fitness\nfunction is not constant but is determined by the trajectory of the sex ratio\namong carriers of that gene. This aspect of the modelled phenomenon cannot be\nrevealed by the static analysis. Dynamics of the sex ratio among gene carriers\nis driven by a dynamic \"tug of war\" between female carriers expressing the\nencoded strategic trait value and random partners of male carriers expressing\nthe average population strategy (a primary sex ratio). This mechanism can be\ncalled \"double level selection\". Therefore, gene interest perspective leads to\nmulti-level selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Apr 2013 19:50:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 2 Mar 2014 23:00:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-05", "authors_parsed": [["Argasinski", "Krzysztof", ""]]}, {"id": "1304.5603", "submitter": "Zi-Niu  Wu", "authors": "W.B.

This\nfaster-X effect can arise either as a consequence of hemizygosity, which leads\nto more efficient selection for recessive beneficial mutations in the\nheterogametic sex, or as a consequence of reduced effective population size of\nthe hemizygous chromosome, which leads to increased fixation of weakly\ndeleterious mutations due to random genetic drift. Empirical results to date\nhave suggested that, while the overall pattern across taxa is complicated, in\ngeneral systems with male-heterogamy show a faster-X effect primarily\nattributable to more efficient selection while the only female-heterogamy taxon\nstudied to date (birds) shows a faster-Z effect primarily attributable to\nincreased drift. In order to test the generality of the faster-Z pattern seen\nin birds, we sequenced the genome of the Lepidopteran insect Bombyx huttoni, a\nclose outgroup of the domesticated silkmoth Bombyx mori. We show that silkmoths\nexperience faster-Z evolution, but unlike in birds, the faster-Z effect appears\nto be attributable to more efficient positive selection in females. These\nresults suggest that female-heterogamy alone is unlikely to be sufficient to\nexplain the reduced efficacy of selection on the bird Z chromosome. Instead, it\nis likely that a combination of patterns of dosage compensation and overall\neffective population size, among other factors, influence patterns of faster-Z\nevolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2013 14:26:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Aug 2013 05:56:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-10", "authors_parsed": [["Sackton", "Timothy B.", ""], ["Corbett-Detig", "Russell B.", ""], ["Nagaraju", "Javaregowda", ""], ["Vaishna", "R.
