Recently, this\napproach has been generalized in \\cite{LHN} by arranging individuals on the\nnodes of a network. Undirected networks seem to have a smoother behavior than\ndirected ones, and thus it is more challenging to find suppressors/amplifiers\nof selection. In this paper we present the first class of undirected graphs\nwhich act as suppressors of selection, by achieving a fixation probability that\nis at most one half of that of the complete graph, as the number of vertices\nincreases. Moreover, we provide some generic upper and lower bounds for the\nfixation probability of general undirected graphs. As our main contribution, we\nintroduce the natural alternative of the model proposed in \\cite{LHN}, where\nall individuals interact simultaneously and the result is a compromise between\naggressive and non-aggressive individuals. That is, the behavior of the\nindividuals in our new model and in the model of \\cite{LHN} can be interpreted\nas an \"aggregation\" vs. an \"all-or-nothing\" strategy, respectively. We prove\nthat our new model of mutual influences admits a \\emph{potential function},\nwhich guarantees the convergence of the system for any graph topology and any\ninitial fitness vector of the individuals. Furthermore, we prove fast\nconvergence to the stable state for the case of the complete graph, as well as\nwe provide almost tight bounds on the limit fitness of the individuals. Apart\nfrom being important on its own, this new evolutionary model appears to be\nuseful also in the abstract modeling of control mechanisms over invading\npopulations in networks. We demonstrate this by introducing and analyzing two\nalternative control approaches, for which we bound the time needed to stabilize\nto the \"healthy\" state of the system.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 16 Feb 2011 20:54:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 30 Sep 2011 19:38:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 17:58:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Mertzios", "George B.", ""], ["Nikoletseas", "Sotiris", ""], ["Raptopoulos", "Christoforos", ""], ["Spirakis", "Paul G.", ""]]}, {"id": "1102.3709", "submitter": "Steven Frank", "authors": "Steven A.

These alternative theories are in fact incommensurable.\nWright's theory is a detailed dynamical model of evolutionary change in actual\npopulations. Fisher's theory is an abstract invariance and conservation law\nthat, like all physical laws, captures essential features of a system but does\nnot account for all aspects of dynamics in real examples. This key contrast\nbetween embodied theories of real cases and abstract laws is missing from prior\nanalyses of Wright versus Fisher. They never argued about this contrast.\nInstead, the issue at stake in their arguments concerned the actual dynamics of\nreal populations. Both agreed that fluctuations of nonadditive (epistatic) gene\ncombinations play a central role in evolution. Wright emphasized stochastic\nfluctuations of gene combinations in small, isolated populations. By contrast,\nFisher believed that fluctuating selection in large populations was the main\ncause of fluctuation in nonadditive gene combinations.

It is therefore of interest to identify viable\nmechanisms that provide additional support for the evolution of cooperation.\nInspired by the fact that the environment may be just as important as\ninheritance for individual development, we introduce a simple switch that\nallows a player to either keep its original payoff or use the average payoff of\nall its neighbors.
