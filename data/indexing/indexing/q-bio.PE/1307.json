Moreover,\nALC is effective even when the subpopulations have high extinction rates:\nconditions under which one other control algorithm has previously failed to\nattain stability. Importantly, ALC not only reduces the fluctuation in\nmetapopulation sizes, but also the global extinction probability.

Here, we present\nnovel analyses detailing the origin of the selfing species, Capsella rubella,\nwhich recently split from its outcrossing sister, Capsella grandiflora. Due to\nthe recency of the split, most variation within C. rubella is found within C.\ngrandiflora. We can therefore identify genomic regions where two C. rubella\nindividuals have inherited the same or different segments of ancestral\ndiversity (i.e. founding haplotypes) present in C. rubella's founder(s). Based\non this analysis, we show that C. rubella was founded by multiple individuals\ndrawn from a diverse ancestral population closely related to extant C.\ngrandiflora, that drift and selection have rapidly homogenized most of this\nancestral variation since C. rubella's founding, and that little novel\nvariation has accumulated within this time. Despite the extensive loss of\nancestral variation, the approximately 25% of the genome for which two C.\nrubella individuals have inherited different founding haplotypes makes up\nroughly 90% of the genetic variation between them. To extend these findings, we\ndevelop a coalescent model that utilizes the inferred frequency of founding\nhaplotypes and variation within founding haplotypes to estimate that C. rubella\nwas founded by a potentially large number of individuals 50-100 kya, and has\nsubsequently experienced a 20X reduction in its effective population size.

Unfortunately, most of the\nprevious approaches are designed only either for host-parasite systems, for\ngene tree/species tree reconciliation, or biogeography. Hence, a method is\ndesirable, which addresses the general problem of mapping phylogenetic trees\nand covering all varieties of coevolving systems, including e.g., predator-prey\nand symbiotic relationships. To overcome this gap, we introduce a generalized\ncophylogenetic event model considering the combinatorial complete set of local\ncoevolutionary events. We give a dynamic programming based heuristic for\nsolving the maximum parsimony reconciliation problem in time O(n^2), for two\nphylogenies each with at most n leaves. Furthermore, we present an exact\nbranch-and-bound algorithm which uses the results from the dynamic programming\nheuristic for discarding partial reconciliations. The approach has been\nimplemented as a Java application which is freely available from\nhttp://pacosy.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/coresym.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 05:47:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wieseke", "Nicolas", ""], ["Bernt", "Matthias", ""], ["Middendorf", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.7903", "submitter": "Satoru Morita", "authors": "Satoru Morita and Jin Yoshimura", "title": "Analytical solution of stochastic model of risk-spreading with global\n  coupling", "comments": "4 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

One\ninvolved populations related to Niger-Congo-speaking African populations, and\nthe other introduced ancestry most closely related to west Eurasian (European\nor Middle Eastern) populations. We date this latter admixture event to\napproximately 900-1,800 years ago, and show that it had the largest demographic\nimpact in Khoisan populations that speak Khoe-Kwadi languages. A similar signal\nof west Eurasian ancestry is present throughout eastern Africa. In particular,\nwe also find evidence for two admixture events in the history of Kenyan,\nTanzanian, and Ethiopian populations, the earlier of which involved populations\nrelated to west Eurasians and which we date to approximately 2,700 - 3,300\nyears ago. We reconstruct the allele frequencies of the putative west Eurasian\npopulation in eastern Africa, and show that this population is a good proxy for\nthe west Eurasian ancestry in southern Africa.

This paper observes that the NOAA and\nLUMCON have now published errant predictions of possible record size areas of\ntemporary bottom water hypoxia (\"dead zones\") three times since 2005, in 2008,\n2011, and 2013 and that the LUMCON predictions of the area of hypoxic bottom\nwater average 31% higher than the actual measured hypoxic areas from 2006 to\n2014. These systematically high predictions depend on the assumption that the\nsusceptibility of the Gulf of Mexico to forming hypoxic areas in response to\nnutrient loading has been relatively constant since 2001, though the\nsusceptibility has been occasionally adjusted upward in different models. It\nhas been previously suggested that tropical storms in a given year that occur\non the Louisiana-Texas shelf between the peak nutrient loading in spring and\nformation of the hypoxic zone in summer can mitigate the size of the hypoxic\nzone that year through mixing of stratified well oxygenated lighter and warmer\nsurface layers and oxygen depleted heavier and cooler bottom layers. This paper\nsuggests several reasons why the Louisiana-Texas shelf may be systematically\ngrowing less susceptible to a given level of nutrient loading over time so that\npredictions based on the measured area of temporary bottom water hypoxia prior\nto 2006 tend to be too big in recent years.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 17:45:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 06:13:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Courtney", "Michael W.", ""], ["Courtney", "Joshua M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.8143", "submitter": "Sivan Leviyang", "authors": "Sivan Leviyang", "title": "Constructing Lower-Bounds for CTL Escape Rates in Early HIV and SIV\n  Infection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Intrahost simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) evolution is marked by repeated\nviral escape from cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTLs) response.

Many authors have developed methods to quantify the strength of CTL\nresponse by measuring the rate at which CTL escape occurs, but such methods\nusually depend on sampling at two or more timepoints, while many datasets\ncapture the dynamics of the first CTL escape at only a single timepoint. Here,\nwe develop inference methods for CTL escape rates applicable to single\ntimepoint datasets. Through a model of early infection dynamics, we construct\nconfidence intervals for escape rates, but since early infection dynamics are\nnot completely understood, we also develop a one-sided confidence interval\nserving as a lower bound for escape rates over a collection of early infection\nmodels. We apply our methods to two SIV datasets, using our lower bounds and\nexisting methods to show that escape rates are relatively high during the\ninitial days of the first CTL escape and then drop to lower levels as the\nescape proceeds. We also compare escape in the lymph nodes and the rectal\nmucosa, showing that escape in the lymph nodes is initially faster, but as the\nfirst escape proceeds, the rate of escape in the lymph nodes drops below the\nrate seen in the rectal mucosa.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 20:51:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Leviyang", "Sivan", ""]]}, {"id": "1307.8252", "submitter": "Simone Pigolotti", "authors": "Simone Pigolotti and Roberto Benzi", "title": "Selective advantage of diffusing faster", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures (Main Text + Supplementary Information).
