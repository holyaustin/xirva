Understanding its spreading dynamics is of fundamental\nimportance for both public health and scientific researches. Recent studies\nhave focused mainly on evaluation and prediction of on-going spreading, which\nstrongly depends on detailed information about the structure of social\ncontacts, human traveling patterns and biological activity of virus, etc.\n  Methodology/Principal Findings: In this work we analyzed the distributions of\nconfirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) in different levels and find the Zipf's\nlaw and Heaps' law. Similar scaling properties were also observed for severe\nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and bird cases of H5N1. We also found a\nhierarchical spreading pattern from countries with larger population and GDP to\ncountries with smaller ones. We proposed a model that considers generic control\neffects on both the local growth and transregional transmission, without the\nneed of the above mentioned detailed information. We studied in detail the\nimpact of control effects and heterogeneity on the spreading dynamics in the\nmodel and showed that they are responsible for the scaling and hierarchical\nspreading properties observed in empirical data.\n  Conclusions/Significance: Our analysis and modeling showed that although\nstrict control measures for interregional travelers could delay the outbreak in\nthe regions without local cases, the focus should be turned to local prevention\nafter the outbreak of local cases. Target control on a few regions with the\nlargest number of active interregional travelers can efficiently prevent the\nspreading. This work provided not only a deeper understanding of the generic\nmechanisms underlying the spread of infectious diseases, but also some\npractical guidelines for decision makers to adopt suitable control strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Dec 2009 02:37:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Jan 2011 01:59:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Han", "Xiao-Pu", ""], ["Wang", "Bing-Hong", ""], ["Zhou", "Chang-Song", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""], ["Zhu", "Jun-Fang", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.1627", "submitter": "Tibor Antal", "authors": "Ivana Bozic, Tibor Antal, Hisashi Ohtsuki, Hannah Carter, Dewey Kim,\n  Sining Chen, Rachel Karchin, Kenneth W.

Species trees represent populations of individuals\n-- each with many genes -- splitting into new populations or species. The\ncoalescent process, which models ancestry of gene copies within populations, is\noften used to model the probability distribution of gene trees given a fixed\nspecies tree. This multispecies coalescent model provides a framework for\nphylogeneticists to infer species trees from gene trees using maximum\nlikelihood or Bayesian approaches. Because the coalescent models a branching\nprocess over time, all trees are typically assumed to be rooted in this\nsetting. Often, however, gene trees inferred by traditional phylogenetic\nmethods are unrooted.\n  We investigate probabilities of unrooted gene trees under the multispecies\ncoalescent model. We show that when there are 4 species with one gene sampled\nper species, the distribution of unrooted gene tree topologies identifies the\nunrooted species tree topology and some, but not all, information in the\nspecies tree edges (branch lengths). The location of the root on the species\ntree is not identifiable in this situation. However, for 5 or more species with\none gene sampled per species, we show that the distribution of unrooted gene\ntree topologies identifies the rooted species tree topology and all its\ninternal branch lengths. The length of any pendent branch leading to a leaf of\nthe species tree is also identifiable for any species from which more than one\ngene is sampled.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2009 18:00:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 29 Jul 2010 18:07:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-07-30", "authors_parsed": [["Allman", "Elizabeth S.", ""], ["Degnan", "James H.", ""], ["Rhodes", "John A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0912.4502", "submitter": "Steven Kelk", "authors": "Leo van Iersel and Steven Kelk", "title": "A short note on the tractability of constructing phylogenetic networks\n  from clusters", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In [2] it was proven that the Cass algorithm is a polynomial-time algorithm\nfor constructing level<=2 networks from clusters.
