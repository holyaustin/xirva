Within this general framework, which applies to a wide\nrange of social dilemmas including, among others, public goods, donation and\nsnowdrift games, we study the cooperation dynamics on a variety of complex\nnetwork examples. By interpreting the studied model through the lenses of\nnonlinear dynamical systems, we show that cooperation through generalized\nreciprocity always emerges as the unique attractor in which the overall level\nof cooperation is maximized, while simultaneously exploitation of the\nparticipating individuals is prevented. The analysis elucidates the role of the\nnetwork structure, here captured by a local centrality measure which uniquely\nquantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by dictating\nthe degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and macroscopic level.\nWe demonstrate the applicability of the analysis on a practical example by\nconsidering an interaction structure that couples a donation process with a\npublic goods game.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Feb 2018 22:15:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2018 09:00:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 28 Feb 2019 12:57:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Stojkoski", "Viktor", ""], ["Utkovski", "Zoran", ""], ["Basnarkov", "Lasko", ""], ["Kocarev", "Ljupco", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00487", "submitter": "Joshua Dijksman", "authors": "Joshua A Dijksman", "title": "Universal fitness dynamics through an adaptive resource utilization\n  model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fitness of a species determines its abundance and survival in an\necosystem.

At population sizes typically found in currently available\ndatasets for species-rich plant communities we find only a very low power to\ndetect interactions.

If an area has towns and cities where a majority of the population is\nconcentrated its average density is meaningless.

This\nempirical observation comes as a welcome confirmation of the classical KMK\n(Kermack-McKendrick 1927) model. Indeed, one of its key predictions is that the\nsize of the epidemic increases strongly (and in a non linear way) with the\ninitial density of susceptibles.\n  An interesting consequence is that, contrary to common beliefs, in sparsely\npopulated territories, like Alaska, Australia or the west coast of the United\nstates the size of epidemics among native populations must have been limited by\nthe low density even for diseases for which the natives had no immunity (i.e.,\nwere susceptibles).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 10 Mar 2018 14:05:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-15", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Ruiqi", ""], ["Richmond", "Peter", ""], ["Roehner", "Bertrand M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.04024", "submitter": "Brandon Milholland", "authors": "Brandon Milholland, Xiao Dong and Jan Vijg", "title": "The shortness of human life constitutes its limit", "comments": "11 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we affirm our earlier findings of evidence for a limit to\nhuman lifespan.
