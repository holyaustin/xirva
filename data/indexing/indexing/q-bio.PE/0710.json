Selection wins this\ncompetition if mutations performed at birth are few enough. By slowly\nincreasing the average number m of mutations, however, the population suddenly\nundergoes a mutational degradation precisely at a transition point mc.

One important and surprising observation is the\nL-independence of the transition curves, for large L. They are also independent\non the population size. Another is that mc is near unity, i.e. life cannot be\nstable with much more than one mutation per diploid genome, independent of the\nchromosome length, in agreement with reality. One possible consequence is that\nan eventual evolutionary jump towards larger L enabling the storage of more\ngenetic information would demand an improved DNA copying machinery in order to\nkeep the same total number of mutations per offspring.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Oct 2007 19:58:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["de Oliveira", "P.

We find that different random vaccination strategies can have\nwidely different results in decreasing expected time till extinction, for the\nsame total amount of vaccines used. Vaccination strategies are considered in\nterms of two parameters: average frequency of vaccinations, given by $\\gamma$,\nand the amplitude of the vaccinations, $\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon \\ll 1$\nrefers to the proportion of the population being vaccinated at some particular\ninstant. It is found that while the average number of individuals vaccinated\nper unit time, $\\gamma \\epsilon$, is kept constant, the particular values of\n$\\gamma$ and $\\epsilon$ can play a highly significant role in increasing the\nchance of epidemic extinction. The findings suggest that expected time till\nextinction can be significantly shortened if less frequent vaccinations occur\nin larger groups, corresponding to low $\\gamma$, high $\\epsilon$ strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Oct 2007 00:34:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Nov 2007 00:28:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Landsman", "Alexandra S.", ""], ["Schwartz", "Ira B.", ""]]}, {"id": "0710.4997", "submitter": "Viet Chi Tran", "authors": "Sylvie M\\'el\\'eard (CMAP), Viet Chi Tran (LPP)", "title": "Age-structured Trait Substitution Sequence Process and Canonical\n  Equation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Mathematical Biology 58, 6 (2009) 881-921", "doi": "10.1007/s00285-008-0202-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.PE", "license": null, "abstract": "  We are interested in a stochastic model of trait and age-structured\npopulation undergoing mutation and selection.
