(3) Motivated by the recent\nCovid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the $R_0$ of a\nmodel disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are\nadjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute\nthe probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic. In all cases we\nfind such probability to be very low if no interventions are put in place.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 8 Jun 2020 19:41:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Goncalo", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.04954", "submitter": "D.

Together these states make up\n43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their\ninitial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The\nevolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact\nand recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are\nlarger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate\nfrom sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well\nunderway in several states before first detected and that California might have\nseen more than one influx of the pandemic.

Further declines and stabilizations are\nfound in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at\nApril 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From\nMarch 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below\none. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be\nattributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes.\nAdditional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly.\nLiberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus,\nthe effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover,\nassessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates\nand the influence of test volume.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 12 Jun 2020 14:13:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Jun 2020 21:52:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2020 11:54:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Wieland", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.07341", "submitter": "Peter Cotton", "authors": "Peter Cotton", "title": "Addressing the Herd Immunity Paradox Using Symmetry, Convexity\n  Adjustments and Bond Prices", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph q-fin.MF", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In constant parameter compartmental models an early onset of herd immunity is\nat odds with estimates of R values from early stage growth.

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials\nmust start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that\nimproves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in\ndeath. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence\nabout clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating\nmortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in\nbetween \"cure\" and \"death\" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity\nscores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary\nmeasure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in\nrelating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes\nmeasured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An\nendpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem.\nHowever, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the\nordinal scale to a binary state of \"recovered\" vs \"not recovered.\"\n  Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for\nCOVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent\nCOVID-19 treatment trials.\n  Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time\nselected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not\nspecify a time-point.

Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering\nnew patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed \"one-mask\nprotection\") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be\ncritical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to > 50% was found to be\nadvantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of\nintensive care.

We\ndevelop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herd\nimmunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect\nexternalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control\nproblem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either\nnaturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of\nlockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages\n20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via\noptimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the\nlevel of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns\nonce herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown\nsignificantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases\nin mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission\nrate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased\ninfection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown\nefficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and\nhigh-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses.\nOverall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd\nimmunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can\nreduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing\nhigh-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:36:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bayraktar", "Erhan", ""], ["Cohen", "Asaf", ""], ["Nellis", "April", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16487", "submitter": "Thomas Mellan", "authors": "Swapnil Mishra, Tresnia Berah, Thomas A.

In the recent\nliterature this has been done by applying the Quasi-Linkage Equilibrium (QLE)\nregime first obtained by Kimura in the limit of high recombination. Here we\nshow that the approach also works in the interesting regime where the effects\nof mutations are comparable to or larger than recombination. This leads to a\nmodified main epistatic fitness inference formula where the rates of mutation\nand recombination occur together. We also derive this formula using by a\npreviously developed Gaussian closure that formally remains valid when\nrecombination is absent. The findings are validated through numerical\nsimulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:45:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:21:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2021 07:50:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zeng", "Hong-Li", ""], ["Mauri", "Eugenio", ""], ["Dichio", "Vito", ""], ["Cocco", "Simona", ""], ["Monasson", "Remi", ""], ["Aurell", "Erik", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.16761", "submitter": "Andres Colubri", "authors": "Andres Colubri, Kailash Yadav, Abhishek Jha, Pardis C.

The\nstate of Arizona in the U.S. emerges as one of the country's newest COVID-19\nhot spots. Accurate forecasting for COVID-19 cases will help governments to\nimplement necessary measures and convince more people to take personal\nprecautions to combat the virus. It is difficult to accurately predict the\nCOVID-19 cases due to many human factors involved. This paper aims to provide a\nforecasting model for COVID-19 cases with the help of human activity data from\nthe Google Community Mobility Reports. To achieve this goal, a specific partial\ndifferential equation (PDE) is developed and validated with the COVID-19 data\nfrom the New York Times at the county level in the state of Arizona in the U.S.\nThe proposed model describes the combined effects of transboundary spread among\ncounty clusters in Arizona and human actives on the transmission of COVID-19.\nThe results show that the prediction accuracy of this model is well acceptable\n(above 94\\%). Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of personal precautions\nsuch as wearing face masks and practicing social distancing on COVID-19 cases\nat the local level. The localized analytical results can be used to help to\nslow the spread of COVID-19 in Arizona. To the best of our knowledge, this work\nis the first attempt to apply PDE models on COVID-19 prediction with the Google\nCommunity Mobility Reports.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2020 15:55:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 19:39:19 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Jul 2020 14:16:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Haiyan", ""], ["Yamamoto", "Nao", ""]]}]
