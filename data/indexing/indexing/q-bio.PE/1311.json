We also show that\nthe mutational robustness of phenotypes scales very roughly logarithmically\nwith phenotype redundancy and is positively correlated with phenotypic\nevolvability. Although our GP map describes the assembly of disconnected\nobjects, it shares many properties with other popular GP maps for connected\nunits, such as models for RNA secondary structure or the HP lattice model for\nprotein tertiary structure. The remarkable fact that these important properties\nsimilarly emerge from such different models suggests the possibility that\nuniversal features underlie a much wider class of biologically realistic GP\nmaps.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2013 17:50:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Greenbury", "Sam F.", ""], ["Johnston", "Iain G.", ""], ["Louis", "Ard A.", ""], ["Ahnert", "Sebastian E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.0651", "submitter": "Bastien Boussau", "authors": "Gergely J.

Yet, most\nphylogeneticists seek to reveal the history of species. Although the histories\nof genes and species are tightly linked, they are seldom identical, because\ngenes duplicate, are lost or horizontally transferred, and because alleles can\nco-exist in populations for periods that may span several speciation events.\nBuilding models describing the relationship between gene and species trees can\nthus improve the reconstruction of gene trees when a species tree is known, and\nvice-versa. Several approaches have been proposed to solve the problem in one\ndirection or the other, but in general neither gene trees nor species trees are\nknown. Only a few studies have attempted to jointly infer gene trees and\nspecies trees. In this article we review the various models that have been used\nto describe the relationship between gene trees and species trees. These models\naccount for gene duplication and loss, transfer or incomplete lineage sorting.\nSome of them consider several types of events together, but none exists\ncurrently that considers the full repertoire of processes that generate gene\ntrees along the species tree. Simulations as well as empirical studies on\ngenomic data show that combining gene tree-species tree models with models of\nsequence evolution improves gene tree reconstruction. In turn, these better\ngene trees provide a better basis for studying genome evolution or\nreconstructing ancestral chromosomes and ancestral gene sequences.

However, most existing models are\nadapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can\ncertainly be adapted to capture some computer virus spreading scenarios\n(especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of\ncomputer virus spreading is not well understood because it has many important\nperspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic\nmodels. In this paper we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that\nof adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More\nspecifically, we investigate a non-homogeneous\nSusceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may\nvary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call\nsemi-adaptive defense and fully-adaptive} defense, which accommodate implicit\nand explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters,\nrespectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model's input\nparameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is\nimplicitly dependent upon the outcome of virus spreading.

However, in clonal populations with a high mutational supply, the\npower of natural selection is expected to be limited. This is due to clonal\ninterference - the competition of clones carrying different beneficial\nmutations - which leads to the loss of many small effect mutations and fixation\nof large effect ones. If interference is abundant, then mechanisms for\nhorizontal transfer of genes, which allow the immediate combination of\nbeneficial alleles in a single background, are expected to evolve. However, the\nrelevance of interference in natural complex environments, such as the gut, is\npoorly known. To address this issue, we studied the invasion of beneficial\nmutations responsible for Escherichia coli's adaptation to the mouse gut and\ndemonstrate the pervasiveness of clonal interference. The observed dynamics of\nchange in frequency of beneficial mutations are consistent with soft sweeps,\nwhere a similar adaptive mutation arises repeatedly on different haplotypes\nwithout reaching fixation. The genetic basis of the adaptive mutations revealed\na striking parallelism in independently evolving populations. This was mainly\ncharacterized by the insertion of transposable elements in both coding and\nregulatory regions of a few genes. Interestingly in most populations, we\nobserved a complete phenotypic sweep without loss of genetic variation.

We engineer an experimental Prisoner's Dilemma game\nin the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that, despite losing to\ndefectors in nonexpanding conditions, cooperators increase in frequency in\nspatially expanding populations. Fluorescently labeled colonies show genetic\ndemixing of cooperators and defectors, followed by increase in cooperator\nfrequency as cooperator sectors overtake neighboring defector sectors.

Spatial expansion thus creates a\nselective force whereby cooperator-enriched demes overtake neighboring\ndefector-enriched demes in a \"survival of the fastest\".

Here, we allow mating behavior to\nrespond to local species composition and abundance in a data-driven\nmeta-community model of species co-existence. While individuals primarily\nout-cross, they also maintain some small capacity for selfing and\nhybridization. Mating choice is treated as a 'fuzzy' behavior, determined by an\ninteraction between intrinsic properties affecting mate choice and extrinsic\nproperties of the local community, primarily the density and availability of\nsympatric inter-fertile species. When mate choice is strongly limited, even low\nsurvivorship of selfed offspring (<10%) can prevent extinction of rare species.\nWith increasing mate choice, low hybridization success rates (~20%) maintain\ncommunity level diversity for substantially longer periods of time. Given the\nlow species densities and high diversity of tropical tree communities, the\nevolutionary costs of competition among sympatric congeneric species are\nnegligible because direct competition is infrequent. In diverse communities,\nmany species are chronically rare and thus vulnerable to stochastic extinction,\nwhich occurs rapidly if species are completely reproductively isolated. By\nincorporating fuzzy mating behavior into models of species co-existence, a more\nrealistic understanding of the extinction process can be developed.

The fixation probability of a novel mutant under frequency\ndependent selection is calculated, and it is used to show why $\\omega>1$ can be\nsometimes expected for single locations at equilibrium.

Here we have applied ribosome profiling - which measures\nboth global mRNA levels and their translation rates - to two species of\nSaccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the\nrelative contributions of changes in mRNA abundance and translation to\nregulatory evolution. We report that both cis and trans-acting regulatory\ndivergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35% of genes. The\nmajority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in mRNA abundance,\nsuggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory\nlevels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting\non a number of yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing\nselection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover\nmultiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between\nspecies. Our analysis reveals the under-appreciated complexity of\npost-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the\nsearch for the locus of selection into the binary categories of 'coding' vs.\n'regulatory' may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple\nregulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2013 20:58:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Artieri", "Carlo G.", ""], ["Fraser", "Hunter B.", ""]]}]
