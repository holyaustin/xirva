Early models of the biological\naspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a\nfixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have\nbeen proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are\nnot amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they\nneglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues,\nwe developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of\nevolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the\nspatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and\nquiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by\nbone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of\ninteracting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic\nregimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that\nallow for coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in\nphysiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional\nsimulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison\nbetween spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and\nsuggested a stabilizing role of space.

The goal of this research is to compare the\nbasic reproductive number of Zika in different municipalities, from an SIR\nmodel with implicit vector dynamics, based on the daily case reporting data of\nAntioquia, Colombia, the second most affected country after Brazil. Methods: An\nsimple SIR model with implicit vector dynamics was derived and used. The\napproximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each\ntime unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the\nbasic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. These\nparameters were estimated via fitting the solution of the model to the daily\nreported cumulative cases data from the regional surveillance system. Results:\nRo was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters\nabove sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were\nreported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high\npotential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in\n3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence\ninterval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of\nZika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1.

However, the modeling\nof population dynamics in biofilms from the viewpoint of social interactions,\ni.e. interplay between heterotypic strains, and the analysis of this kind using\ncontrol theory are not addressed significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntheoretically analyze the population dynamics model in microbial biofilms with\nnon-participating strains (coexisting with public goods producers and\nnon-producers) in the context of evolutionary game theory and nonlinear\ndynamics. Our analysis of the replicator dynamics model is twofold: first\nwithout the inclusion of spatial pattern, and second with the consideration of\ndegree of assortment. In the first case, Lyapunov stability analysis of the\nstable equilibrium point of the proposed replicator system determines (1,0)\n('full dominance of cooperators') as a global asymptotic stable equilibrium\nwhenever the return exceeds the metabolic cost of cooperation. Hence, the\nglobal asymptotic stable nature of (1,0) in the context of non-consideration of\nspatial pattern helps to justify mathematically the adversity in the\neradication of \"cooperative enterprise\" that is an infectious biofilm. In the\nsecond case, we found non-existence of global asymptotic stability in the\nsystem, and it unveils two additional phenomena - bistability and coexistence.\nIn this context, two inequality conditions are derived for the 'full dominance\nof cooperators' and coexistence. Therefore, the inclusion of spatial pattern in\nbiofilms with non-competing strains intends conditional dominance of pathogenic\n(with respect to the hosts) public goods producers which can be an effective\nstrategy towards the control of an infectious biofilm with the drug-dependent\nregulation of degree of segregation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:24:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Jeet", ""], ["Ranjan", "Tanvi", ""], ["Layek", "Ritwik Kumar", ""]]}, {"id": "1609.06424", "submitter": "{\\O}rnulf Borgan", "authors": "{\\O}rnulf Borgan (Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo)", "title": "Do Japanese and Italian women live longer than women in Scandinavia?", "comments": "7 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Life expectancies at birth are routinely computed from period life tables.\nSuch period life expectancies may be distorted by selection when comparing\ncountries where the living conditions improved earlier (like Norway and Sweden)\nwith countries where they improved later (like Italy and Japan).
