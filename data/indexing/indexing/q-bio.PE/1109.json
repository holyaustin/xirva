This fractured\nconceptual framework often causes particular applications to be incomplete or\nimproperly analyzed. In this paper, I present a concise introduction to the two\nkey aspects of the theory. First, all measures of fitness ultimately arise from\nthe relative comparison of the reproductive success of individuals or genotypes\nwith the average reproductive success in the population. That relative measure\ncreates a diminishing relation between reproductive success and fitness.\nDiminishing returns reduce fitness in proportion to variability in reproductive\nsuccess. The relative measurement of success also induces a frequency\ndependence that favors rare types. Second, variability in populations has a\nhierarchical structure. Variable success in different traits of an individual\naffects that individual's variation in reproduction. Correlation between\ndifferent individuals' reproduction affects variation in the aggregate success\nof particular alleles across the population. One must consider the hierarchical\nstructure of variability in relation to different consequences of temporal,\nspatial, and developmental variability. Although a complete analysis of\nvariability has many separate parts, this simple framework allows one to see\nthe structure of the whole and to place particular problems in their proper\nrelation to the general theory. The biological understanding of relative\nsuccess and the hierarchical structure of variability in populations may also\ncontribute to a deeper economic theory of returns under uncertainty.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2011 16:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5633", "submitter": "Steven Frank", "authors": "Steven A.

In a fitness landscape with multiple peaks and\nvalleys, developmental variability can smooth the landscape to provide a\ndirectly increasing path of fitness to the highest peak. Developmental\nvariability also allows initial survival of a genotype in response to novel or\nextreme environmental challenge, providing an opportunity for subsequent\nadaptation.
