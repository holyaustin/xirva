The\nlocalized phase settles above a critical resetting rate, or rate of memory use,\nand the probability density asymptotically adopts in this regime a\nnon-equilibrium steady state similar to that of the well known problem of\ndiffusion with resetting to the origin. The transition occurs because of the\npresence of a single impurity site where the resetting rate is lower than on\nother sites, and around which the walker spontaneously localizes. Near\ncriticality, the localization length diverges with a critical exponent that\nfalls in the same class as the self-consistent theory of Anderson localization\nof waves in random media.

Consistent with Gillespie's analysis, if\nthe log-fitness function is concave and allelic responses to the environment\nare not perfectly correlated, then per-capita growth rates of rare alleles are\npositive and genetic diversity is maintained in the sense of stochastic\npersistence i.e. allelic frequencies tend to stay away from zero almost-surely\nand in probability.

The third class of methods is the\nmost advantageous statistically, but relies on computationally intensive\nparticle filtering techniques that limits its applications. We propose a\nBayesian model that combines phylodynamic inference and stochastic epidemic\nmodels, and achieves computational tractability by using a linear noise\napproximation (LNA) --- a technique that allows us to approximate probability\ndensities of stochastic epidemic model trajectories. LNA opens the door for\nusing modern Markov chain Monte Carlo tools to approximate the joint posterior\ndistribution of the disease transmission parameters and of high dimensional\nvectors describing unobserved changes in the stochastic epidemic model\ncompartment sizes (e.g., numbers of infectious and susceptible individuals).
