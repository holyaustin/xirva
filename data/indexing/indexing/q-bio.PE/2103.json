To\nanswer this question, we use two large-scale datasets of individual human\nmobility to simulate disease spread. Results show that a universal relation\nbetween r and f indeed exists in the context of epidemic spread: in both of the\ndatasets, the final size and the spatial distribution of the infected\npopulation depends on the product r * f more directly than on the individual\nvalues of r and f. The important implication here is that restricting r (where\nyou can go), but not f (how frequently), could be unproductive: high frequency\ntrips to nearby locations can be as dangerous for disease spread as low\nfrequency trips to distant locations.

The relevant\nmathematical tools are: (1) Geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the stochastic\nprocess representing evolution as the stochastic increase of the number of\nspecies living on Earth over the last 3.5 billion years. This GBM is well known\nin the mathematics of finances (Black-Sholes models). (2) The probability\ndistributions known as b-lognormals, i.e. lognormals starting at a certain\npositive instant b>0 rather than at the origin. In the framework of Darwinian\nEvolution, the resulting mathematical construction was shown to be what\nevolutionary biologists call Cladistics. (3) The (Shannon) entropy of such\nb-lognormals is then seen to represent the 'degree of progress' reached by each\nliving organism or by each big set of living organisms, like historic human\ncivilizations. (4) All these results also match with SETI in that the\nstatistical Drake equation (generalization of the ordinary Drake equation to\nencompass statistics) leads just to the lognormal distribution as the\nprobability distribution for the number of extra-terrestrial civilizations\nexisting in the Galaxy. (5) The well-known 'Molecular Clock of Evolution',\nnamely the 'constant rate of Evolution at the molecular level' as shown by\nKimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, identifies with growth rate of\nthe entropy of our Evo-SETI model.

However, despite government\nrecommendations and mandates, a progressive increase in mobility was observed\nin several sites. This phenomenon is often referred to as \"quarantine fatigue\".\nMathematical models have been used for more than a century to study the\ndynamics of diseases spread. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, a large\nnumber of models have been developed to investigate different aspects of the\npandemic. The aim of the present work has been to design and explore a\nmathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 spread with quarantine fatigue. A\ndeterministic model represented by a system of differential equations, based on\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) dynamics, was developed. The model was\nexplored by means of computational simulations. The results obtained show that,\nin some scenarios, after a first prevalence peak, fatigue can cause a second\npeak. Thus, the dynamic behavior of the model suggests that fatigue may have\ncontributed to the production of the second peak of infected people observed in\ndifferent parts of the world between 2020 and early 2021. The explorations\nperformed also showed that the model is sensitive to infection rate and other\nparameters related to propagation dynamics. The developed model is relatively\nsimple and has important limitations for performing accurate predictions in the\nreal world.
