Here, we analyse the collective motion and\nthe response to visual stimuli in two morphologically different strains (TL and\nAB) of zebrafish. For both strains, we observe 10 groups of 5 and 10 zebrafish\nswimming freely in a large experimental tank with two identical attractive\nlandmarks (cylinders or disks) for one hour. We track the positions of the fish\nby an automated tracking method and compute several metrics at the group level.\nFirst, the probability of presence shows that both strains avoid free space and\nare more likely to swim in the vicinity of the walls of the tank and the\nattractive landmarks. Second, the analysis of landmarks occupancy shows that AB\nzebrafish are more present in their vicinity than TL zebrafish and that both\nstrains regularly transit from one landmark to the other with no preference on\nthe long duration. Finally, TL zebrafish show a higher cohesion than AB\nzebrafish. Thus, landmarks and duration of the repicates allow to reveal\ncollective behavioural variabilities among different strains of zebrafish.\nThese results provide a new insight into the need to take into account\nindividual variability of zebrafish strains for studying collective behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 19:33:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:27:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 10:06:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["S\u00e9guret", "Axel", ""], ["Collignon", "Bertrand", ""], ["Halloy", "Jos\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.00282", "submitter": "Ananthu James", "authors": "Ananthu James", "title": "Role of epistasis on the fixation probability of a non-mutator in an\n  adapted asexual population", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology 407 (2016) 225-237", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2016.07.006", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The mutation rate of a well adapted population is prone to reduction so as to\nhave a lower mutational load.

For example, this problem is of great importance to improve our\nunderstanding about the major transition from unicellular to multicellular form\nof life. The immediate advantage of gathering efficient individuals in an\nenergetic context is not clear. Although this process increases relatedness\namong individuals, it also increases local competition. To address this\nquestion, we propose a model of two competing metabolic strategies that makes\nexplicit reference to the resource usage. We assume the existence of an\nefficient strain, which converts resource into energy at high efficiency but\ndisplays a low rate of resource consumption, and an inefficient strain, which\nconsumes resource at a high rate with a low efficiency in converting it to\nenergy. We explore the dynamics in both well-mixed and structured populations.\nThe selection for optimised energy usage is measured by the likelihood of that\nan efficient strain can invade a population only comprised by inefficient\nstrains. It is found that the region of the parameter space at which the\nefficient strain can thrive in structured populations is always larger than\nobserved in well-mixed populations. In fact, in well-mixed populations the\nefficient strain is only evolutionarily stable in the domain whereupon there is\nno evolutionary dilemma. We also observe that small group sizes enhance the\nchance of invasion by the efficient strain in spite of increasing the\ncompetition among relatives.

Our approach combines a stochastic landscape model with\na spatially-explicit model of population dynamics. It enables us to analyze the\neffect of the landscape composition (proportion of semi-natural habitat,\nnon-treated crops, slightly treated crops and conventionally treated crops) on\nthe effectiveness of pest biocontrol. Effectiveness is measured through\nenvironmental and agronomical descriptors, measuring respectively the impact of\nthe pesticides on the environment and the average agronomic productivity of the\nwhole landscape taking into account losses caused by pests.\n  Conclusions: The effectiveness of the pesticide, the intensity of the\ntreatment and the pest intrinsic growth rate are found to be the main drivers\nof landscape productivity. The loss in productivity due to a reduced use of\npesticide can be partly compensated by biocontrol. However, the model suggests\nthat it is not possible to maintain a constant level of productivity while\nreducing the use of pesticides, even with highly efficient natural enemies.\nFragmentation of the semi-natural habitats and increased crop rotation tend to\nslightly enhance the effectiveness of biocontrol but have a marginal effect\ncompared to the predation rate by natural enemies.\n  This note was written in the framework of the ANR project PEERLESS\n\"Predictive Ecological Engineering for Landscape Ecosystem Services and\nSustainability\"(ANR-12-AGRO-0006).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Feb 2016 21:28:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Ciss", "Mamadou", ""], ["Poggi", "Sylvain", ""], ["Memmah", "Mohamed-Mahmoud", ""], ["Franck", "Pierre", ""], ["Gosme", "Marie", ""], ["Parisey", "Nicolas", ""], ["Roques", "Lionel", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.06737", "submitter": "Stefano Bennati", "authors": "Stefano Bennati", "title": "On the Role of Collective Sensing and Evolution in Group Formation", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11721-018-0156-y", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.MA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Collective sensing is an emergent phenomenon which enables individuals to\nestimate a hidden property of the environment through the observation of social\ninteractions. Previous work on collective sensing shows that gregarious\nindividuals obtain an evolutionary advantage by exploiting collective sensing\nwhen competing against solitary individuals.

It is assumed that\ngroup membership does not lessen competition on the limited resources in the\nenvironment, e.g. groups do not improve foraging efficiency. Experiments are\nrun in an agent-based evolutionary model of a foraging task, where the fitness\nof the agents depends on their foraging strategy. The foraging strategy of\nagents is determined by a neural network, which does not require explicit\nmodeling of the environment and of the interactions between agents. Experiments\ndemonstrate that gregarious behavior is not the evolutionary-fittest strategy\nif resources are abundant, thus invalidating previous findings in a specific\nregion of the parameter space. In other words, resource scarcity makes\ngregarious behavior so valuable as to make up for the increased competition\nover the few available resources. Furthermore, it is shown that a population of\nsolitary agents can evolve gregarious behavior in response to a sudden scarcity\nof resources, thus individuating a possible mechanism that leads to gregarious\nbehavior in nature.

We modelled an SI dynamics in\ntwo different scenarios: a simple theoretical food web and an empirical one.\nOur simulations in both scenarios show that the infection is more widespread\nwhen both the trophic and the contaminative interactions are considered with\nequal rates. This indicates that trophic and contaminative transmission may\nhave additive effects in real ecosystems. We also find that the ratio of\nvectors-to-host in the community (i) crucially influences the infection spread,\n(ii) regulates a percolating phase transition in the rate of parasite\ntransmission and (iii) increases the infection rate in hosts. By immunising the\nsame fractions of predator and prey populations, we show that the multiplex\ntopology is fundamental in outlining the role that each host species plays in\nparasite transmission in a given ecosystem.

As a case study, we consider pig trade in\nGermany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The\ncentral question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the\nsystem of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying\nnetwork of animal movements.\n  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years\nand is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.\nFocusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage\nof external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific\npathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any\ngeneral spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system\nusing different network models, which include varying amounts of information:\n(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,\n(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.\n  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a\ntopological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that\na static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and\npremises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our\nresults allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures\nusing centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results\nand is therefore of secondary importance.
