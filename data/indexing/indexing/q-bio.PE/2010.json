As indicated in the recent article posted\non the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a\nlot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing\ntechnique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into\ngroups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to\nreconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family\nof pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite\nprojective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices\nproposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using\nthe two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting\nextensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical\nresults show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in\nthe whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one\nshould choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The\nfamily of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according\nto the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed\npooling matrix.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 19:05:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:51:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-16", "authors_parsed": [["Lin", "Yi-Jheng", ""], ["Yu", "Che-Hao", ""], ["Liu", "Tzu-Hsuan", ""], ["Chang", "Cheng-Shang", ""], ["Chen", "Wen-Tsuen", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00300", "submitter": "Stefan T.

A UK study used economic parameters to numerically\ndemonstrate an optimal balance in the process, including keeping the infected\npopulation stationary.

We find that high-fidelity transmission evolves when (1) social and (2)\nindividual learning are inexpensive, (3) traits are complex, (4) individual\nlearning is abundant, (5) adaptive problems are difficult and (6) behaviour is\nflexible. Low-fidelity transmission differs in many respects. It not only\nevolves when (2) individual learning is costly and (4) infrequent but also\nproves more robust when (3) traits are simple and (5) adaptive problems are\neasy. If conditions favouring the evolution of high-fidelity transmission are\nstricter (3 and 5) or harder to meet (2 and 4), this could explain why social\nlearning is common, but CCE is rare.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 6 Oct 2020 02:33:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-07", "authors_parsed": [["Montrey", "Marcel", ""], ["Shultz", "Thomas R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.02478", "submitter": "Amin Ghadami", "authors": "Shiyang Chen, Amin Ghadami, Bogdan I.

But once a relevant system is found, such rapid disruption and\nrearrangement would be very likely to destroy the system before much evolution\ncould take place. In this paper we explore the possibility, using a model\ndeveloped previously, that the search process could occur under different\nenvironmental conditions than the subsequent fixation and growth of a lifelike\nchemical system. We use the example of a rapid change in temperature to\nillustrate the effect and refer to the rapid change as a `quench' borrowing\nterminology from study of the physics and chemistry of glass formation. The\nmodel study shows that interrupting a high temperature nonequilibrium state\nwith a rapid quench to lower temperatures can substantially increase the\nprobability of producing a chemical state with lifelike characteristics of\nnonequilibrium metastability, internal dynamics and exponential population\ngrowth in time. Previously published data on the length distributions of\nproteomes of prokaryotes may be consistent with such an idea and suggest a\nprebiotic high temperature `search' phase near the boiling point of water. A\nrapid change in pH could have a similar effect. We discuss possible scenarios\non early earth which might have allowed frequent quenches of the sort\nconsidered here to have occurred.

In the context of the mass concentration of\nbramblings (Fringilla montifringilla) in Sweden the winter 2019-2020, this work\nreviews the literature on this striking phenomenon. Winter roosts are found to\namount to on the order of one million birds per hectare of roost area, but the\nspread between reports is significant. Support for roosts of up to around 15\nmillion birds was found, but much larger numbers are frequently recited in the\nliterature. It is argued that these larger numbers are the result of\noverestimation or, in some cases, even completely unfounded (potentially\ntypos). While the difficulties related to the count of large numbers of birds\ncan explain this state, it is unfortunate that \"high numbers\" sometimes\ndisplace proper numbers. Since incorrect data, and its persistence, may result\nin that incorrect conclusions are drawn from new observations, this matter\ndeserves attention. As the Brambling is a well-studied species, the matter also\nraises concerns regarding numbers for mass concentrations of other species. It\nis recommended that very large numbers of birds should be recited and used with\ncare: underlying data and methods of the original sources should be\nscrutinized. Analogously, reporters of large numbers of birds are advised to\ndescribe and document counting methods. In particular, number estimates based\non flock volume and bird density should be avoided.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:05:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 24 Oct 2020 13:30:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Svensson", "Tomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.08957", "submitter": "Farzad Fatehi", "authors": "Farzad Fatehi, Richard J Bingham, Eric C Dykeman, Peter G Stockley,\n  Reidun Twarock", "title": "Comparing antiviral strategies against COVID-19 via multi-scale within\n  host modelling", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Within-host models of COVID-19 infection dynamics enable the merits of\ndifferent forms of antiviral therapy to be assessed in individual patients.

Usually, they are composed of a\nsystem of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in time. A class of such\nmodels considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased\npopulations, the SEIRD model.

In this work, we extend\nthe formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of\npartial differential equations to capture the continuous spatio-temporal\ndynamics of COVID-19. Since the virus spread is not only through diffusion, we\nintroduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who\nreturn from travel. We also add the possibility of anisotropic non-homogeneous\ndiffusion.

In simple networks, these ecologically motivated\ndynamics are used to provide new insight into the spread of adaptive mutations,\nboth with and without clonal interference. For example, the star network, which\nis known to be an amplifier of selection in evolutionary graph theory, can\ninhibit the spread of adaptive mutations when individuals can die naturally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:02:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 18 Mar 2021 16:36:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-19", "authors_parsed": [["Pattni", "Karan", ""], ["Overton", "Christopher E.", ""], ["Sharkey", "Kieran J.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16167", "submitter": "Geraldine Finlayson Dr", "authors": "Geraldine Finlayson (1, 2 and 3), Stewart Finlayson (1 and 4), Clive\n  Finlayson (1, 2, 3 and 5), Keith Bensusan (6 and 3), Rhian Guillem (6 and 3),\n  Tyson L.

A comparison of environmental features related to\nthe incidence of SARS-CoV-2 with those of its potential hosts is critical. We\nexamine the distribution of coronaviruses among bats. We analyse the\ndistribution of SARS-CoV-2 in a nine-week period following lockdown in Italy,\nSpain, and Australia. We correlate its incidence with environmental variables\nparticularly ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and humidity. We establish a\nclear negative relationship between COVID-19 and ultraviolet radiation,\nmodulated by temperature and humidity. We relate our results with data showing\nthat the bat species most vulnerable to coronavirus infection are those which\nlive in environmental conditions that are similar to those that appear to be\nmost favourable to the spread of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 ecological niche has\nbeen the product of long-term coevolution of coronaviruses with their host\nspecies. Understanding the key parameters of that niche in host species allows\nus to predict circumstances where its spread will be most favourable. Such\nconditions can be summarised under the headings of nocturnality and\nseasonality. High ultraviolet radiation, in particular, is proposed as a key\nlimiting variable. We therefore expect the risk of spread of COVID-19 to be\nhighest in winter conditions, and in low light environments. Human activities\nresembling those of highly social cave-dwelling bats (e.g. large nocturnal\ngatherings or high density indoor activities) will only serve to compound the\nproblem of COVID-19.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:19:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Finlayson", "Geraldine", "", "1, 2 and 3"], ["Finlayson", "Stewart", "", "1 and 4"], ["Finlayson", "Clive", "", "1, 2, 3 and 5"], ["Bensusan", "Keith", "", "6 and 3"], ["Guillem", "Rhian", "", "6 and 3"], ["Holmes", "Tyson L.", "", "1 and 3"], ["Giles-Guzman", "Francisco", ""], ["Carri\u00f3n", "Jos\u00e9 S.", ""], ["Belda", "Crist\u00f3bal", ""], ["Sawchuk", "Lawrence", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.16193", "submitter": "J\\\"urgen Jost", "authors": "J\\\"urgen Jost", "title": "Biological Information", "comments": "to appear in Theory in Biosciences", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s12064-020-00327-1", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE nlin.AO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In computer science, we can theoretically neatly separate transmission and\nprocessing of information, hardware and software, and programs and their\ninputs.

Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a\nsecond stage, characterized by the need for the liberation of the economy and\nrelaxation of the human psychological effects. To this end, numerous countries\ndecided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first\nprolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement\nstage on May 20, 2020. The relevant question concerns the impact on the\nCOVID-19 propagation by considering an additional degree of realism related to\nstochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In\nthis paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the\nepidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure\nthe well-posedness of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a\npositive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales, we\ndiscuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter.\nMoreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency\nof the deconfinement strategies chosen by the Moroccan authorities to help the\npolicy makers and public health administration to make suitable decisions in\nthe near future.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Oct 2020 18:45:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-12", "authors_parsed": [["Zine", "Houssine", ""], ["Boukhouima", "Adnane", ""], ["Lotfi", "El Mehdi", ""], ["Mahrouf", "Marouane", ""], ["Torres", "Delfim F.

A biological example would be the density of diffusing spores\n(propagules) and the density of a stationary fungus (parent). The parent\nproduces propagules at a certain rate, and the propagules turn into the parent\nsubstance at another rate. We model this evolution by the FKPP process with\ndelay, which reflects a finite time typically required for a new parent to\nmature before it begins to produce propagules. While the FKPP process with\nother types of delays have been considered in the past as a pure mathematical\nconstruct, in our work a delay in the FKPP model arises in a natural science\nsetting. The speed of the resulting density fronts is shown to decrease with\nincreasing delay time, and has a non-trivial dependence on the rate of\nconversion of propagules into the parent substance. Remarkably, the fronts in\nthis model are always slower than Fisher waves of the classical FKPP model. The\nlargest speed is half of the classical value, and it is achieved at zero delay\nand when the two rates are matched.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:14:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 20 Nov 2020 22:25:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Stanley", "Steffanie", ""], ["Kogan", "Oleg", ""]]}]
