To take up\nvariant forms, bacteria may express an array of receptors. The gut microbe\nBacteroides thetaiotaomicron has three different receptors to take up variants\nof vitamin B12 and 88 receptors to take up various glycans. The design of\nreceptor arrays reflects key processes that shape cellular evolution.\nCompetition may focus each species on a subset of the available nutrient\ndiversity. Some gut bacteria can take up only a narrow range of carbohydrates,\nwhereas species such as B.~thetaiotaomicron can digest many different complex\nglycans. Comparison of different nutrients, habitats, and genomes provide\nopportunity to test hypotheses about the breadth of receptor arrays. Another\nimportant process concerns fluctuations in nutrient availability. Such\nfluctuations enhance the value of cellular sensors, which gain information\nabout environmental availability and adjust receptor deployment. Bacteria often\nadjust receptor expression in response to fluctuations of particular\ncarbohydrate food sources. Some species may adjust expression of uptake\nreceptors for specific siderophores. How do cells use sensor information to\ncontrol the response to fluctuations? That question about regulatory wiring\nrelates to problems that arise in control theory and artificial intelligence.\nControl theory clarifies how to analyze environmental fluctuations in relation\nto the design of sensors and response systems. Recent advances in deep learning\nstudies of artificial intelligence focus on the architecture of regulatory\nwiring and the ways in which complex control networks represent and classify\nenvironmental states. I emphasize the similar design problems that arise in\ncellular evolution, control theory, and artificial intelligence. I connect\nthose broad concepts to testable hypotheses for bacterial uptake of B12,\nsiderophores and glycans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 01:48:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 14:53:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-10-23", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.00309", "submitter": "Uwe C.

Reporting, however, is almost always incomplete.\nThis is due to a variety of reasons, ranging from not recognizing the diseased\nto failures in the technical or administrative steps leading to the final\nofficial register in the disease notification system. The reported fraction\nvaries from 9% to 99% and is strongly associated with the disease being\nreported.\n  Methods: In this paper we propose a method to approximately estimate the full\nprevalence (and any other variable or parameter related to transmission\nintensity) of infectious diseases. The model assumes incomplete notification of\nincidence and allows the estimation of the non-notified number of infections\nand it is illustrated by the case of hepatitis C in Brazil. The method has the\nadvantage that it can be corrected iteratively by comparing its findings with\nempirical results.\n  Results: The application of the model for the case of hepatitis C in Brazil\nresulted in a prevalence of notified cases that varied between 163,902 and\n169,382 cases; a prevalence of non-notified cases that varied between 1,433,638\nand 1,446,771; and a total prevalence of infections that varied between\n1,597,540 and 1,616,153 cases.\n  Conclusions: We conclude that that the model proposed can be useful for\nestimation of the actual magnitude of endemic states of infectious diseases,\nparticularly for those where the number of notified cases is only the tip of\nthe iceberg. In addition, the method can be applied to other situations, such\nas the well known underreported incidence of criminality (for example rape),\namong others.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 18:35:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Amaku", "Marcos", ""], ["Burattini", "Marcelo Nascimento", ""], ["Chaib", "Eleazar", ""], ["Coutinho", "Francisco Antonio Bezerra", ""], ["Greenhalgh", "David", ""], ["Lopez", "Luis Fernandez", ""], ["Massad", "Eduardo", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.01015", "submitter": "Fran\\c{c}ois Bienvenu", "authors": "Fran\\c{c}ois Bienvenu, Florence D\\'ebarre and Amaury Lambert", "title": "The split-and-drift random graph, a null model for speciation", "comments": "added Proposition 2.4 and formal proofs of Proposition 2.3 and 2.6", "journal-ref": "Stochastic Processes and their Applications 129(6):2010-2048\n  (2019)", "doi": "10.1016/j.spa.2018.06.009", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR math.CO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We introduce a new random graph model motivated by biological questions\nrelating to speciation.

This barrier prevents un-managed, self-organizing,\nautocatalytic networks of molecular species from individuating into complex,\ncooperative organizations. The barrier arises because molecular species that\ncould otherwise make significant cooperative contributions to the success of an\norganization will often not be supported within the organization, and because\nside reactions and other free-riding processes will undermine cooperation. As a\nresult, the barrier seriously limits the possibility space that can be explored\nby un-managed organizations, impeding individuation, complex functionality and\nthe transition to life. The barrier can be overcome comprehensively by\nappropriate management which implements a system of evolvable constraints. The\nconstraints support beneficial co-operators and suppress free riders. In this\nway management can manipulate the chemical processes of an autocatalytic\norganization, producing novel processes that serve the interests of the\norganization as a whole and that could not arise and persist spontaneously in\nan un-managed chemical organization. Management self-organizes because it is\nable to capture some of the benefits that are produced when its management of\nan autocatalytic organization promotes beneficial cooperation. Selection\ntherefore favours the emergence of managers that take over and manage chemical\norganizations so as to overcome the cooperation barrier. The managed-metabolism\nhypothesis shows that if management is to overcome the cooperation barrier\ncomprehensively, its interventions must be digitally coded. In this way, the\nhypothesis accounts for the two-tiered structure of all living cells in which a\ndigitally-coded genetic apparatus manages an analogically-informed metabolism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 May 2017 04:18:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-06", "authors_parsed": [["Stewart", "John E.", ""]]}, {"id": "1706.03013", "submitter": "Genki Ichinose", "authors": "Genki Ichinose, Yoshiki Satotani, Hiroki Sayama", "title": "How mutation alters fitness of cooperation in networked evolutionary\n  games", "comments": "6 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cooperation is ubiquitous in every level of living organisms.

Such subpopulations can be identified by\nconsidering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all\ncases in the population occurring before the epidemic peak (Bp), the\ncorresponding proportion after the epidemic peak (Ap), to calculate the\nrelative risk for a subpopulation, RR=Bp/Ap.
