One example is Hutchinson's `paradox of the plankton'.\nThis is an instance where a large number of phytoplankton species coexist while\ncompeting for a very limited number of resources. Both experimental and\ntheoretical studies have shown that temporal fluctuations of the environment\ncan facilitate coexistence for competing species. Hutchinson conjectured that\none can get coexistence because nonequilibrium conditions would make it\npossible for different species to be favored by the environment at different\ntimes.\n  In this paper we show in various settings how a variable (stochastic)\nenvironment enables a set of competing species limited by a smaller number of\nresources or other density dependent factors to coexist. If the environmental\nfluctuations are modeled by white noise, and the per-capita growth rates of the\ncompetitors depend linearly on the resources, we prove that there is\ncompetitive exclusion. However, if either the dependence between the growth\nrates and the resources is not linear or the white noise term is nonlinear we\nshow that coexistence on fewer resources than species is possible. Even more\nsurprisingly, if the temporal environmental variation comes from switching the\nenvironment at random times between a finite number of possible states, it is\npossible for all species to coexist even if the growth rates depend linearly on\nthe resources.

This observation is\nquantified by the theory of bet-hedging, which provides a reason for the degree\nof phenotypic diversity observed even in clonal populations. The theory of\nbet-hedging in well-mixed populations is rather well developed. However, many\nspecies underwent range expansions during their evolutionary history, and the\nimportance of phenotypic diversity in such scenarios still needs to be\nunderstood. In this paper, we develop a theory of bet-hedging for populations\ncolonizing new, unknown environments that fluctuate either in space or time. In\nthis case, we find that bet-hedging is a more favorable strategy than in\nwell-mixed populations. For slow rates of variation, temporal and spatial\nfluctuations lead to different outcomes. In spatially fluctuating environments,\nbet-hedging is favored compared to temporally fluctuating environments. In the\nlimit of frequent environmental variation, no opportunity for bet-hedging\nexists, regardless of the nature of the environmental fluctuations. For the\nsame model, bet-hedging is never an advantageous strategy in the well-mixed\ncase, supporting the view that range expansions strongly promote\ndiversification. These conclusions are robust against stochasticity induced by\nfinite population sizes.

We construct\nstochastic differential equations (SDEs) for a coarse-grained variable that\ndescribes the order/consensus within a group. The first method of construction\nis based on van Kampen's system-size expansion of transition rates. The second\nmethod employs Gillespie's chemical Langevin equations. We apply these two\nmethods to two microscopic models from the literature, in which organisms\nstochastically interact and choose between two directions/choices of foraging.\nThese `binary-choice' models differ only in the types of interactions between\nindividuals, with one assuming simple pair-wise interactions, and the other\nincorporating higher-order effects. In both cases, the derived mesoscopic SDEs\nhave multiplicative, or state-dependent, noise. However, the different models\ndemonstrate the contrasting effects of noise: increasing order in the pair-wise\ninteraction model, whilst reducing order in the higher-order interaction model.\nAlthough both methods yield identical SDEs for such binary-choice, or\none-dimensional, systems, the relative tractability of the chemical Langevin\napproach is beneficial in generalizations to higher-dimensions.
