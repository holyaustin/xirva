This is addressed by von Neumann's concept of a\nself-replicating automaton (SRA). A SRA consists of a self-assembly code that\nis used in two distinct ways: (1) actively deciphered during development to\nconstruct a self-similar replicant, and (2) passively copied to the replicant\nto ensure that it can reproduce. Information that is acquired over a lifetime\nis not transmitted to offspring, whereas information that is inherited during\ncopying is transmitted. In cultural evolution there is no mechanism for\ndiscarding acquired change. Acquired change can accumulate orders of magnitude\nfaster than, and quickly overwhelm, inherited change due to differential\nreplication of variants in response to selection. This prohibits a selectionist\nbut not an evolutionary framework for culture. Recent work on the origin of\nlife suggests that early life evolved through a non-Darwinian process referred\nto as communal exchange that does not involve a self-assembly code, and that\nnatural selection emerged from this more haphazard, ancestral evolutionary\nprocess. It is proposed that communal exchange provides a more appropriate\nevolutionary framework for culture than selectionism.

In the\nemergence of order out of self-organization we find similarities between\nbiological systems, as bird flocks, and some physical systems, as ferromagnets.\nIn both cases, the tendency of individuals to align to their neighbours gives\nrise to a polarized state. There is, however, one crucial difference: the\ninteraction network within an animal group is not necessarily fixed in time, as\neach individual moves and may change its neighbours. Therefore, the dynamical\ninteraction mechanism in biological and physical system can be quite different,\nnot only due to the gross disparity in the complexity of the individual\nentities, but also because of the potential role of inter-individual motion. To\nassess the relevance of this mechanism it is necessary to gain quantitative\nexperimental information about how much individuals move with respect to each\nother within the group.

Here we formally investigate how two demographic\nfactors, group size and dispersal frequency, affect selection pressures on pro-\nand anti-social punishment. Contrary to the suggestions of previous work, we\nfind that anti-social punishment can prevent the evolution of pro-social\npunishment and cooperation under a range of group structures. Given that\nanti-social punishment has now been found in all studied extant human cultures,\nthe claims of previous models showing the co-evolution of pro-social punishment\nand cooperation in group-structured populations should be re-evaluated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 20 Jun 2012 12:35:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Aug 2012 13:09:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Powers", "Simon T.", ""], ["Taylor", "Daniel J.", ""], ["Bryson", "Joanna J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.4745", "submitter": "Shai Carmi", "authors": "Shai Carmi, Pier Francesco Palamara, Vladimir Vacic, Todd Lencz, Ariel\n  Darvasi, Itsik Pe'er", "title": "The variance of identity-by-descent sharing in the Wright-Fisher model", "comments": "Includes Supplementary Material", "journal-ref": "Genetics 193, 911--928 (2013)", "doi": "10.1534/genetics.112.147215", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Widespread sharing of long, identical-by-descent (IBD) genetic segments is a\nhallmark of populations that have experienced recent genetic drift. Detection\nof these IBD segments has recently become feasible, enabling a wide range of\napplications from phasing and imputation to demographic inference. Here, we\nstudy the distribution of IBD sharing in the Wright-Fisher model. Specifically,\nusing coalescent theory, we calculate the variance of the total sharing between\nrandom pairs of individuals. We then investigate the cohort-averaged sharing:\nthe average total sharing between one individual and the rest of the cohort. We\nfind that for large cohorts, the cohort-averaged sharing is distributed\napproximately normally. Surprisingly, the variance of this distribution does\nnot vanish even for large cohorts, implying the existence of \"hyper-sharing\"\nindividuals. The presence of such individuals has consequences for the design\nof sequencing studies, since, if they are selected for whole-genome sequencing,\na larger fraction of the cohort can be subsequently imputed. We calculate the\nexpected gain in power of imputation by IBD, and subsequently, in power to\ndetect an association, when individuals are either randomly selected or\nspecifically chosen to be the hyper-sharing individuals. Using our framework,\nwe also compute the variance of an estimator of the population size that is\nbased on the mean IBD sharing and the variance in the sharing between inbred\nsiblings. Finally, we study IBD sharing in an admixture pulse model, and show\nthat in the Ashkenazi Jewish population the admixture fraction is correlated\nwith the cohort-averaged sharing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 00:24:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Jan 2013 16:56:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 3 Mar 2013 13:26:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 12 Aug 2013 16:02:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Carmi", "Shai", ""], ["Palamara", "Pier Francesco", ""], ["Vacic", "Vladimir", ""], ["Lencz", "Todd", ""], ["Darvasi", "Ariel", ""], ["Pe'er", "Itsik", ""]]}, {"id": "1206.5453", "submitter": "Paolo Masucci", "authors": "Paolo Masucci, Sophie Arnaud-Haond, V\\'ictor M.

However, selective sweeps can also quickly\ncarry neutral mutations to observable population frequencies if they arise\nearly in a sweep and hitchhike with the adaptive allele.

Based on this result, we develop an estimator for the\nselection coefficient driving a sweep. Since this estimator utilizes the novel\nvariation arising from mutations during a sweep, it does not rely on\npreexisting variation and can also be applied to loci that lack recombination.\nCompared with standard approaches that infer selection coefficients from the\nsize of dips in genetic diversity around the adaptive site, our estimator\nrequires much shorter sequences but sampled at high population depth in order\nto capture low-frequency variants; given such data, it consistently outperforms\nstandard approaches. We investigate analytically and numerically how the\naccuracy of our estimator is affected by the decay of the sweep pattern over\ntime as a consequence of random genetic drift and discuss potential effects of\nrecombination, soft sweeps, and demography.
