Limitations in the habitat (filter 1) were reflected\nin local C. album population recruitment season length. Generally, the duration\nof seedling recruitment of both populations (local; DEN-COM) increased with\ndecreasing latitude, north-to-south. In general, compared to the local\npopulation, DEN-COM recruitment at locations north of Denmark was longer and\nsouth of Denmark was shorter, and ended sooner. Generally, the local cropping\nsystem disturbances (CSD) period increased with decreasing latitude. The total\nduration of the CSD period was over twice as long in the south as that in the\nnorth. Recruitment at each locality possessed seasonal structure (time, number)\nconsisting of 2-4 discrete seasonal cohorts. This may be an adaptive means by\nwhich C. album searches for, and exploits, recruitment opportunity just prior\nto, and after, predictable disturbances. The control of C. album seedling\nemergence is contained in the heteroblastic traits of its locally adapted\nseeds, and is stimulated by a complex interaction of light, heat, water,\nnitrate and oxygen signals inherent in the local environment.

It describes how\nspecies distribute and perform in response to environmental changes. Ecological\nprocesses and structures are highly complex and adaptive. In order to quantify\nemerging ecological patterns and investigate their hidden mechanisms, we need\nto rely on the simplicity of mathematical language. This becomes especially\napparent when dealing with scaling patterns in ecology. Indeed, nearly all of\necological patterns are scale dependent. Such scale dependence hampers our\npredictive power and creates problems in our inference. This challenge calls\nfor a clear and fundamental understanding of how and why ecological patterns\nchange across scales. As Simon Levin stated in his MacArthur Award lecture, the\nproblem of relating phenomena across scales is the central problem in ecology\nand other natural sciences. It has become clear that there is currently a drive\nin ecology and complexity science to develop new quantitative approaches that\nare suitable for analysing and forecasting patterns of ecological systems. Here\nI provide a road map for future works on synthesizing the scaling patterns in\necology, aiming (i) to collect and sort a diverse array of ecological patterns,\n(ii) to present the dominant parametric forms of how these patterns change\nacross spatial and temporal scales, (iii) to detect the processes and\nmechanisms using mathematical models, and finally (iv) to probe the physical\nmeaning of these scaling patterns. This road map is divided into three parts\nand covers three main concepts of scale in ecology: heterogeneity, hierarchy\nand size. Using scale as a thread, this road map and its following works weave\nthe kaleidoscope of ecological scaling patterns into a cohesive whole.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 8 Oct 2013 12:20:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-10-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hui", "Cang", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.2114", "submitter": "Piotr Plonski", "authors": "Piotr Plonski and Jan P.

For Bayesian divergence-time methods, the common\npractice for calibration using fossil information involves placing arbitrarily\nchosen parametric distributions on internal nodes, often disregarding most of\nthe information in the fossil record. We introduce the 'fossilized birth-death'\n(FBD) process, a model for calibrating divergence-time estimates in a Bayesian\nframework, explicitly acknowledging that extant species and fossils are part of\nthe same macroevolutionary process. Under this model, absolute node age\nestimates are calibrated by a single diversification model and arbitrary\ncalibration densities are not necessary. Moreover, the FBD model allows for\ninclusion of all available fossils. We performed analyses of simulated data and\nshow that node-age estimation under the FBD model results in robust and\naccurate estimates of species divergence times with realistic measures of\nstatistical uncertainty, overcoming major limitations of standard divergence\ntime estimation methods.

We confirm that the range of permissible recombination rates is\nsmaller in the sex benefitting from invasion and larger in the sex harmed by\ninvasion.

We further show that a novel, sexually\nantagonistic allele that is also associated with a lowered recombination rate\ncan invade more easily when present in the double heterozygote genotype.\nFinally, we find that sexual dimorphism in resident allele frequencies can\nimpact the invasion of new sexually antagonistic alleles at a second locus.

Using Monte Carlo simulations we\nanalyze two three level models of food webs: a grazing one with the basal\nspecies (i.e. primary producers) having unlimited food resources and a detrital\none in which the basal species uses detritus as a food resource. While the vast\nmajority of theoretical studies neglects detritus, from our results it follows\nthat the detrital food web is more stable than its grazing counterpart, because\nthe interactions mediated by detritus damp out fluctuations in species'\ndensities. Since the detritus model is the more complex one in terms of\ninteraction patterns, our results provide new evidence for the advocates of the\ncomplexity as one of the factors enhancing stability of ecosystems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 10:21:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 11:41:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 14 Apr 2014 08:11:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["P\u0119kalski", "Andrzej", ""], ["Szwabi\u0144ski", "Janusz", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8634", "submitter": "Bj{\\o}rn {\\O}stman", "authors": "Bj{\\o}rn {\\O}stman and Randall Lin and Christoph Adami", "title": "Trade-offs drive resource specialization and the gradual establishment\n  of ecotypes", "comments": "19 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "BMC Evol.

Among those are trade-offs\nbetween different ways an organism utilizes resources, and these trade-offs can\nconstrain the manner in which selection can optimize traits. Limited migration\namong allopatric populations and species interactions can also drive\nspeciation, but here we ask if trade-offs alone are sufficient to drive\nspeciation in the absence of other factors. We present a model to study the\neffects of trade-offs on specialization and adaptive radiation in asexual\norganisms based solely on competition for limiting resources, where trade-offs\nare stronger the greater an organism's ability to utilize resources. In this\nmodel resources are perfectly substitutable, and fitness is derived from the\nconsumption of these resources. The model contains no spatial parameters, and\nis therefore strictly sympatric. We quantify the degree of specialization by\nthe number of ecotypes formed and the niche breadth of the population, and\nobserve that these are sensitive to resource influx and trade-offs. Resource\ninflux has a strong effect on the degree of specialization, with a clear\ntransition between minimal diversification at high influx and multiple species\nevolving at low resource influx. At low resource influx the degree of\nspecialization further depends on the strength of the trade-offs, with more\necotypes evolving the stronger trade-offs are. The specialized organisms\npersist through negative frequency-dependent selection. In addition, by\nanalyzing one of the evolutionary radiations in greater detail we demonstrate\nthat a single mutation alone is not enough to establish a new ecotype, even\nthough phylogenetic reconstruction identifies that mutation as the branching\npoint. Instead, it takes a series of additional mutations to ensure the stable\ncoexistence of the new ecotype in the background of the existing ones,\nreminiscent of a recent observa\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 18:46:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Mar 2014 21:09:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-12", "authors_parsed": [["\u00d8stman", "Bj\u00f8rn", ""], ["Lin", "Randall", ""], ["Adami", "Christoph", ""]]}]
