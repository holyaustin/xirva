The classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR)\nmodel of epidemics is one such example where the scaling behavior near a\ncritical point has been studied extensively. In this system the distribution of\noutbreak sizes scales as $P(n) \\sim n^{-3/2}$ at the critical point as the\nsystem size $N$ becomes infinite. The finite-size scaling laws for the outbreak\nsize and duration are also well understood and characterized. In this work, we\nreport scaling laws for a model with SIR structure coupled with a constant\nforce of infection per susceptible, akin to a `reservoir forcing'. We find that\nthe statistics of outbreaks in this system are fundamentally different than\nthose in a simple SIR model. Instead of fixed exponents, all scaling laws\nexhibit tunable exponents parameterized by the dimensionless rate of external\nforcing. As the external driving rate approaches a critical value, the scale of\nthe average outbreak size converges to that of the maximal size, and above the\ncritical point, the scaling laws bifurcate into two regimes. Whereas a simple\nSIR process can only exhibit outbreaks of size $\\mathcal{O}(N^{1/3})$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ depending on whether the system is at or above the epidemic\nthreshold, a driven SIR process can exhibit a richer spectrum of outbreak sizes\nthat scale as $O(N^{\\xi})$ where $\\xi \\in (0,1] \\backslash \\{2/3\\}$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}((N/\\log N)^{2/3})$ at the multi-critical point.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Dec 2013 02:06:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Singh", "Sarabjeet", ""], ["Myers", "Christopher R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.0160", "submitter": "Nadav M.

Only in\nrecent years have new methods become available that allow the generation of\nlikelihoods directly from stochastic simulations. Previous applications of\nthese approximate Bayesian methods have concentrated on relatively simple\nmodels. Here, we report on the application of a simulation-based likelihood\napproximation for FORMIND, a parameter-rich individual-based model of tropical\nforest dynamics.\n  We show that approximate Bayesian inference, based on a parametric likelihood\napproximation placed in a conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler,\nperforms well in retrieving known parameter values from virtual inventory data\ngenerated by the forest model. We analyze the results of the parameter\nestimation, examine its sensitivity to the choice and aggregation of model\noutputs and observed data (summary statistics), and demonstrate the application\nof this method by fitting the FORMIND model to field data from an Ecuadorian\ntropical forest. Finally, we discuss how this approach differs from approximate\nBayesian computation (ABC), another method commonly used to generate\nsimulation-based likelihood approximations.\n  Our results demonstrate that simulation-based inference, [...]\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 16:02:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 8 May 2014 15:35:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-09", "authors_parsed": [["Hartig", "Florian", ""], ["Dislich", "Claudia", ""], ["Wiegand", "Thorsten", ""], ["Huth", "Andreas", ""]]}, {"id": "1401.8294", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Evolution of extortion in structured populations", "comments": "5 two-column pages, 4 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E", "journal-ref": "Phys.

But if players are able to adopt the strategies performing\nbetter, extortion becomes widespread and evolutionary unstable. It may\nsometimes act as a catalyst for the evolution of cooperation, and it can also\nemerge in interactions between two populations, yet it is not the evolutionary\nstable outcome. Here we revisit these results in the realm of spatial games. We\nfind that pairwise imitation and birth-death dynamics return known evolutionary\noutcomes. Myopic best response strategy updating, on the other hand, reveals\nnew counterintuitive solutions. Defectors and extortioners coarsen\nspontaneously, which allows cooperators to prevail even at prohibitively high\ntemptations to defect. Here extortion strategies play the role of a Trojan\nhorse. They may emerge among defectors by chance, and once they do, cooperators\nbecome viable as well. These results are independent of the interaction\ntopology, and they highlight the importance of coarsening, checkerboard\nordering, and best response updating in evolutionary games.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 20:55:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Szolnoki", "Attila", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""]]}]
