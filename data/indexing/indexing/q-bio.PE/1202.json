Theoretical models predict that self-incompatibility systems\nbreak down according to the intensity of inbreeding depression and number of\nS-alleles. Other studies have explored the function of asexual reproduction in\nthe maintenance of self-incompatibility. However, the population genetics of\npartially asexual, self-incompatible populations are poorly understood and\nprevious studies have failed to consider all possible effects of asexual\nreproduction or could only speculate on those effects. In this study, we\ninvestigated how partial asexuality may affect genetic diversity at the S-locus\nand fitness in small self-incompatible populations. A genetic model including\nan S-locus and a viability locus was developed to perform forward simulations\nof the evolution of populations of various sizes. Drift combined with partial\nasexuality produced a decrease in the number of alleles at the S-locus. In\naddition, an excess of heterozygotes was present in the population, causing an\nincrease in mutation load. This heterozygote excess was enhanced by the\nself-incompatibility system in small populations. In addition, in highly\nasexual populations, individuals produced asexually had some fitness advantages\nover individuals produced sexually, because sexual reproduction produces\nhomozygotes of the deleterious allele, contrary to asexual reproduction. Our\nresults suggest that future research on the function of asexuality for the\nmaintenance of self-incompatibility will need to (1) account for whole-genome\nfitness (mutation load generated by asexuality, self-incompatibility and drift)\nand (2) acknowledge that the maintenance of self-incompatibility may not be\nindependent of the maintenance of sex itself.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 21:00:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Navascu\u00e9s", "Miguel", ""], ["Stoeckel", "Solenn", ""], ["Mariette", "Stephanie", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.0024", "submitter": "Renato Silva", "authors": "Renato Aparecido Pimentel da Silva, Matheus Palhares Viana, Luciano da\n  Fontoura Costa", "title": "Predicting epidemic outbreak from individual features of the spreaders", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2012/07/P07005", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.SI q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Knowing which individuals can be more efficient in spreading a pathogen\nthroughout a determinate environment is a fundamental question in disease\ncontrol. Indeed, over the last years the spread of epidemic diseases and its\nrelationship with the topology of the involved system have been a recurrent\ntopic in complex network theory, taking into account both network models and\nreal-world data. In this paper we explore possible correlations between the\nheterogeneous spread of an epidemic disease governed by the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model, and several attributes of the\noriginating vertices, considering Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi (ER), Barab\\'asi-Albert (BA)\nand random geometric graphs (RGG), as well as a real case of study, the US Air\nTransportation Network that comprises the US 500 busiest airports along with\ninter-connections. Initially, the heterogeneity of the spreading is achieved\nconsidering the RGG networks, in which we analytically derive an expression for\nthe distribution of the spreading rates among the established contacts, by\nassuming that such rates decay exponentially with the distance that separates\nthe individuals. Such distribution is also considered for the ER and BA models,\nwhere we observe topological effects on the correlations. In the case of the\nairport network, the spreading rates are empirically defined, assumed to be\ndirectly proportional to the seat availability. Among both the theoretical and\nthe real networks considered, we observe a high correlation between the total\nepidemic prevalence and the degree, as well as the strength and the\naccessibility of the epidemic sources.

Although the IBM approach has been quite insightful, the\ncapability to follow each individual usually comes at the expense of analytical\ntractability, which limits the generality of the statements that can be made.\nFor the specific case of spatial structure in populations of sessile (and\nidentical) organisms, space-time point processes with local regulation seem to\ncover the middle ground between analytical tractability and a higher degree of\nbiological realism. Continuum approximations of these stochastic processes\ndistill their fundamental properties, but they often result in infinite\nhierarchies of moment equations. We use the principle of constrained maximum\nentropy to derive a closure relationship for one such hierarchy truncated at\nsecond order using normalization and the product densities of first and second\norders as constraints. The resulting `maxent' closure is similar to the\nKirkwood superposition approximation, but it is complemented with previously\nunknown correction terms that depend on on the area for which third order\ncorrelations are irreducible. This region also serves as a validation check,\nsince it can only be found if the assumptions of the closure are met.\nComparisons between simulations of the point process, alternative heuristic\nclosures, and the maxent closure show significant improvements in the ability\nof the maxent closure to predict equilibrium values for mildly aggregated\nspatial patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 27 Feb 2012 23:40:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-29", "authors_parsed": [["Raghib", "Michael", ""], ["Hill", "Nicholas A.", ""], ["Dieckmann", "Ulf", ""]]}, {"id": "1202.6230", "submitter": "Ganna Rozhnova", "authors": "G.
