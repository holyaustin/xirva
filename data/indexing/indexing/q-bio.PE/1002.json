Mathematically this\ndivergence translates in a loss of additivity of the actual distances between\ntaxa. In distance-based reconstruction methods, two properties of additive\ndistances were extensively exploited as antagonist criteria to drive phylogeny\nreconstruction: on the one hand a local property of quartets, i.e., sets of\nfour taxa in a tree, the four-points condition; on the other hand a recently\nproposed formula that allows to write the tree length as a function of the\ndistances between taxa, the Pauplin's formula.

We propose, in particular, a\nnew general class of distance-based Stochastic Local Search algorithms, which\nreduces in a limit case to the minimization of the Pauplin's length.

The dormant organism is protected against the\npoisonous environment. The result is to increase the survival probability of\nthe entire population by introducing a type of zero reproductive fitness. This\nis possible, because the reservoir of dormant individuals act as a buffer that\ncan cushion fatal fluctuations in the number of births and deaths which without\nthe dormant population would have driven the entire population to extinction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2010 16:39:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Alarcon", "Tomas", ""], ["Jensen", "Henrik Jeldtoft", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.5008", "submitter": "Michael Bowler Ph D", "authors": "Michael G.

The proper\napplication of the principles of statistical physics to the problem of species\nabundance distributions (SADs) has enabled us to identify the fundamental\necological principles responsible for the near universal features observed.\nThese principles are (i) a limit on the number of individuals in an ecological\nguild and (ii) per capita birth and death rates. We thus unify the neutral\ntheory of Hubbell [1], the master equation approach of Volkov et al [2, 3] and\na recent attempt at deploying statistical mechanics to deal with this problem,\nthe idiosyncratic [extreme niche] theory of Pueyo et al [4]; we have identified\nthe true origin of the prior in [4]. We also find in our results clear\nindications that niches must be very flexible and that temporal fluctuations on\nall sorts of scales are of considerable importance in community structure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 15:33:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 9 May 2011 12:15:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Bowler", "Michael G.", ""], ["Kelly", "Colleen K.", ""]]}]
