We investigate this problem using the SIR model for the epidemic\ndynamics, for which reduction of the epidemic peak $I_P$ can be achieved only\nat the price of increasing the time $t_P$ of its occurrence and its entire\ntime-span $t_E$. By means of a time reparametrization we linearize the\nequations for the SIR dynamics.

Individuals' social\nbehaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability\ndistributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is\ngiven for the basic SI (\"susceptible-infective\") network contagion model, which\nfocusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main\nresult is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of\nthe system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves\nonly one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network\nmodels, including \"removed\" (R) and \"exposed\" (E) classes, are formulated.\nThese models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for\nthe SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of\ndifferent kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social\ndistancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an\nalgorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform.

Using our model, we have calculated country-specific expected time to\nextinction (TTE) and CCS that would essentially determine the ideal number of\nlockdown days required and size of quarantined population. Findings: With the\ngiven country-wise rates of death, recovery and other parameters, we have\nidentified that, if at a place the total number of susceptible population drops\nbelow CCS, infection will cease to exist after a period of TTE days, unless it\nis introduced from outside. But the disease will almost die out much sooner. We\nhave calculated the country-specific estimate of the ideal number of lockdown\ndays.

In this\npaper, we model the spread of the novel coronavirus using a causal model. We\nfind that, with continued lockdown measures, the United States can, according\nto this model, limit the total number of infections to ~1.35 million and the\ntotal number of deaths to ~72 thousand. A 60 day lockdown can save countless\nlives.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Apr 2020 08:41:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-08", "authors_parsed": [["Amla", "Keshav", ""], ["Amla", "Tarun", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.03251", "submitter": "Steffen Eikenberry", "authors": "Steffen E.

We propose two types of case-control studies that can be carried out\njointly in test-settings for symptomatic persons. The first, the test-negative\ncase-control design (TND) is the easiest to implement; it only demands\ncollecting information about potential risk factors for COVID-19 from the\ntested symptomatic persons. The second, standard case-control studies with\npopulation controls, requires the collection of data on one or more population\ncontrols for each person who is tested in the test facilities, so that\ntest-positives and test-negatives can each be compared with population\ncontrols. The TND will detect differences in risk factors between symptomatic\npersons who have COVID-19 (test-positives) and those who have other respiratory\ninfections (test-negatives). However, risk factors with effect sizes of equal\nmagnitude for both COVID-19 and other respiratory infections will not be\nidentified by the TND.

As usage decreases there is a novel \"contact tracing\" phase transition\nto an epidemic phase. We present and study a simple branching-process model for\nCOVID-19 and show that digital immunity is possible regardless of the\nproportion of non-symptomatic transmission.

In the absence of a safe and effective\nvaccine or antiviral, strategies for mitigating the burden of the pandemic are\nfocused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing,\ncontact-tracing, quarantine, isolation and the use of face-masks in public. We\ndevelop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of\nthese mitigation strategies.

This study shows that early\ntermination of strict social-distancing could trigger a devastating second wave\nwith burden similar to that projected before the onset of strict\nsocial-distance. The use of efficacious face-masks (efficacy greater than 70%)\ncould lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents\nof New York state use such masks consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at\nleast 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks,\nsuch as cloth masks (of efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant\nreduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to\nelimination).

Our approach is motivated\nby the current COVID-19 pandemic. The main hypothesis is the existence of two\npopulations of susceptible persons, one which obeys confinement and for which\nthe infection rate does not exceed 1, and a population which, being non\nconfined for various imperatives, can be substantially more infective. The\nmodel, initially formulated as a differential system, is discretised following\na specific procedure, the discrete system serving as an integrator for the\ndifferential one. Our model is calibrated so as to correspond to what is\nobserved in the COVID-19 epidemic.\n  Several conclusions can be reached, despite the very simple structure of our\nmodel. First, it is not possible to pinpoint the genesis of the epidemic by\njust analysing data from when the epidemic is in full swing. It may well turn\nout that the epidemic has reached a sizeable part of the world months before it\nbecame noticeable. Concerning the confinement scenarios, a universal feature of\nall our simulations is that relaxing the lockdown constraints leads to a\nrekindling of the epidemic. Thus we sought the conditions for the second\nepidemic peak to be lower than the first one. This is possible in all the\nscenarios considered (abrupt, progressive or stepwise exit) but typically a\nprogressive exit can start earlier than an abrupt one. However, by the time the\nprogressive exit is complete, the overall confinement times are not too\ndifferent. From our results, the most promising strategy is that of a stepwise\nexit. And in fact its implementation could be quite feasible, with the major\npart of the population (minus the fragile groups) exiting simultaneously but\nobeying rigorous distancing constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 20 Apr 2020 14:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Nakamura", "G.", ""], ["Grammaticos", "B.", ""], ["Badoual", "M.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.09404", "submitter": "Andrea Pugliese", "authors": "Andrea Pugliese and Sara Sottile", "title": "Inferring the COVID-19 infection curve in Italy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Aim of this manuscript is to show a simple method to infer the time-course of\nnew COVID-19 infections (the most important information in order to establish\nthe effect of containment strategies) from available aggregated data, such as\nnumber of deaths and hospitalizations.

This study\naimed to determine whether alternative testing strategies based on sample\npooling can increase the speed and throughput of screening for SARS-CoV-2.\n  Methods: A mathematical modelling approach was chosen to simulate six\ndifferent testing strategies based on key input parameters (infection rate,\ntest characteristics, population size, testing capacity etc.). The situations\nin five countries (US, DE, UK, IT and SG) currently experiencing COVID-19\noutbreaks were simulated to reflect a broad variety of population sizes and\ntesting capacities. The primary study outcome measurements that were finalised\nprior to any data collection were time and number of tests required; number of\ncases identified; and number of false positives.\n  Findings: The performance of all tested methods depends on the input\nparameters, i.e. the specific circumstances of a screening campaign. To screen\none tenth of each country's population at an infection rate of 1% - e.g. when\nprioritising frontline medical staff and public workers -, realistic optimised\ntesting strategies enable such a campaign to be completed in ca. 29 days in the\nUS, 71 in the UK, 25 in Singapore, 17 in Italy and 10 in Germany (ca. eight\ntimes faster compared to individual testing). When infection rates are\nconsiderably lower, or when employing an optimal, yet logistically more complex\npooling method, the gains are more pronounced.

Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the\nmortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and\nhospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And\ninfectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper.\nBy applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical\nsolutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and\nwith the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23\nJanuary to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction\ndays.

As in any compartmental model,\nthe goal of this article is to provide qualitative understanding rather than\nexact quantitative predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 13:48:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Oliveira", "Gon\u00e7alo", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14787", "submitter": "Biman Bagchi -", "authors": "Saumyak Mukherjee, Sayantan Mondal and Biman Bagchi", "title": "Dynamical Theory and Cellular Automata Simulations of Pandemic Spread:\n  Understanding Different Temporal Patterns of Infections", "comments": "11 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Here we propose and implement a generalized mathematical model to find the\ntime evolution of population in infectious diseases and apply the model to\nstudy the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Our model at the core is a non-local\ngeneralization of the widely used Kermack-McKendrick(KM) model where the\nsusceptible(S) population evolves into two other categories, namely\ninfectives(I) and removed(R). This is the well-known SIR model in which we\nfurther divide both S and I into high and low risk categories. We first\nformulate a set of non-local dynamical equations for the time evolution of\ndistinct population distributions under this categorization in an attempt to\ndescribe the general scenario of infectious disease progression. We then solve\nthe non-linear coupled differential equations-(i) numerically by the method of\npropagation, and (ii) a more flexible and versatile cellular automata (CA)\nsimulation which provides a coarse-grained description of the generalized\nnon-local model. In order to account for multiple factors such as role of\nspreaders before containment, we introduce a time dependent rate which appears\nto be essential to explain the sudden spikes before the plateau observed in\nmany cases (for example like China). We demonstrate how this generalized\napproach allows us to handle the effects of (i) time-dependence of the\nrate-constants of spread, (ii) different population density, (iii) the age\nratio, (iv) quarantine, (v) lockdown, and (vi) social distancing. Our study\nallows us to make certain predictions regarding the nature of spread with\nrespect to several external parameters, treated as control variables. Analysis\nof the model clearly shows that due to the strong heterogeneity in the epidemic\nprocess originating from the distribution of initial infectives, the theory\nmust be local in character but at the same time connect to a global\nperspective.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 14:02:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mukherjee", "Saumyak", ""], ["Mondal", "Sayantan", ""], ["Bagchi", "Biman", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14838", "submitter": "Dimitar Atanasov", "authors": "Nikolay M.

The\nubiquitous Kuramoto models rely on an {\\em a priori} fixed connectivity pattern\nfacilitates mutual communication and influence between oscillators. In\nbiological synchronizable systems, like the mammalian suprachaismatic nucleus,\nenabling communication comes at a cost -- the organism expends energy creating\nand maintaining the system -- linking their development to evolutionary\nselection. Here, we introduce and analyze a new evolutionary game theoretic\nframework modeling the behavior and evolution of systems of coupled\noscillators. Each oscillator in our model is characterized by a pair of dynamic\nbehavioral traits: an oscillatory phase and whether they connect and\ncommunicate to other oscillators or not. Evolution of the system occurs along\nthese dimensions, allowing oscillators to change their phases and/or their\ncommunication strategies. We measure success of mutations by comparing the\nbenefit of phase synchronization to the organism balanced against the cost of\ncreating and maintaining connections between the oscillators. Despite such a\nsimple setup, this system exhibits a wealth of nontrivial behaviors, mimicking\ndifferent classical games -- the Prisoner's Dilemma, the snowdrift game, and\ncoordination games -- as the landscape of the oscillators changes over time.\nDespite such complexity, we find a surprisingly simple characterization of\nsynchronization through connectivity and communication: if the benefit of\nsynchronization $B(0)$ is greater than twice the cost $c$, $B(0) > 2c$, the\norganism will evolve towards complete communication and phase synchronization.\nTaken together, our model demonstrates possible evolutionary constraints on\nboth the existence of a synchronized oscillatory system and its overall\nconnectivity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2020 15:37:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Tripp", "Elizabeth A.", ""], ["Fu", "Feng", ""], ["Pauls", "Scott D.", ""]]}, {"id": "2004.14920", "submitter": "Cesar Castilho", "authors": "Marcilio Ferreira dos Santos and Cesar Castilho", "title": "Deterministic Critical Community Size For The SIR System and Viral\n  Strain Selection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.DS physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper the concept of Critical Community Size (CCS) for the\ndeterministic SIR model is introduced and its consequences for the disease\ndynamics are stressed.
