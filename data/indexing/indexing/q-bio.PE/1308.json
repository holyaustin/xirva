In addition to posing computational challenges, such\nlarge sample sizes call for carefully re-examining the theoretical foundation\nunderlying commonly-used analytical tools. Here, we study the accuracy of the\ncoalescent, a central model for studying the ancestry of a sample of\nindividuals. The coalescent arises as a limit of a large class of random mating\nmodels and it is an accurate approximation to the original model provided that\nthe population size is sufficiently larger than the sample size. We develop a\nmethod for performing exact computation in the discrete-time Wright-Fisher\n(DTWF) model and compare several key genealogical quantities of interest with\nthe coalescent predictions. For realistic demographic scenarios, we find that\nthere are a significant number of multiple- and simultaneous-merger events\nunder the DTWF model, which are absent in the coalescent by construction.\nFurthermore, for large sample sizes, there are noticeable differences in the\nexpected number of rare variants between the coalescent and the DTWF model. To\nbalance the tradeoff between accuracy and computational efficiency, we propose\na hybrid algorithm that utilizes the DTWF model for the recent past and the\ncoalescent for the more distant past. Our results demonstrate that the hybrid\nmethod with only a handful of generations of the DTWF model leads to a\nfrequency spectrum that is quite close to the prediction of the full DTWF\nmodel.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 04:26:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bhaskar", "Anand", ""], ["Clark", "Andrew G.", ""], ["Song", "Yun S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.0170", "submitter": "Reto Burri", "authors": "Marta Promerov\\'a, Reto Burri, Luca Fumagalli", "title": "PCR-based isolation of multigene families: Lessons from the avian MHC\n  class IIB", "comments": "24 pages, 2 Tables, 2 Figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1111/1755-0998.12234", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The amount of sequence data available today highly facilitates the access to\ngenes from many gene families.

We address this challenge by using adaptive\ndynamics theory and individual-based simulations to compare community\nstabilization and evolutionary stability of species that coexist by relative\nnonlinearity. In our analysis, evolution operates on the species'\ndensity-compensation strategies, and we consider a trade-off between population\ngrowth rates at high and low resource availability. We confirm previous\nfindings that, irrespective of the particular model of density dependence,\nthere are many combinations of overcompensating and undercompensating\ndensity-compensation strategies that allow stable coexistence by relative\nnonlinearity. However, our analysis also shows that most of these strategy\ncombinations are not evolutionarily stable and will be outcompeted by an\nintermediate density-compensation strategy. Only very specific trade-offs lead\nto evolutionarily stable coexistence by relative nonlinearity. As we find no\nreason why these particular trade-offs should be common in nature, we conclude\nthat the sympatric evolution and evolutionary stability of relative\nnonlinearity, while possible in principle, seems rather unlikely.

The probabilities of motion state transitions, as well as the\nrandom walk parameters, depend strongly on distance to an aphid's nearest\nneighbor.

It is unclear, however, whether\ncancer stem cells originate from normal stem cells or from dedifferentiated\nprogenitor cells. To address this, we mathematically modeled the effect of\ndedifferentiation on carcinogenesis. We considered a hybrid\nstochastic-deterministic model of mutation accumulation in both stem cells and\nprogenitors, including dedifferentiation of progenitor cells to a stem\ncell-like state. We performed exact computer simulations of the emergence of\ntumor subpopulations with two mutations, and we derived semi-analytical\nestimates for the waiting time distribution to fixation. Our results suggest\nthat dedifferentiation may play an important role in carcinogenesis, depending\non how stem cell homeostasis is maintained. If the stem cell population size is\nheld strictly constant (due to all divisions being asymmetric), we found that\ndedifferentiation acts like a positive selective force in the stem cell\npopulation and thus speeds carcinogenesis. If the stem cell population size is\nallowed to vary stochastically with density-dependent reproduction rates\n(allowing both symmetric and asymmetric divisions), we found that\ndedifferentiation beyond a critical threshold leads to exponential growth of\nthe stem cell population. Thus, dedifferentiation may play a crucial role, the\ncommon modeling assumption of constant stem cell population size may not be\nadequate, and further progress in understanding carcinogenesis demands a more\ndetailed mechanistic understanding of stem cell homeostasis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 17:50:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Jilkine", "Alexandra", ""], ["Gutenkunst", "Ryan N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6830", "submitter": "Golan Bel", "authors": "Golan Bel and Yosef Ashkenazy", "title": "The effects of psammophilous plants on sand dune dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1002/2014JF003170", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph nlin.CD q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Psammophilous plants are special plants that flourish in sand moving\nenvironments.

Our model shows that under suitable precipitation rates and wind\npower, the dynamics of the different cover types is in accordance with the\ncommon view that dunes are initially stabilized by psammophilous plants that\nreduce sand activity, thus enhancing the growth of regular vegetation that\neventually dominates the cover of the dunes and determines their activity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Aug 2013 19:45:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Bel", "Golan", ""], ["Ashkenazy", "Yosef", ""]]}]
