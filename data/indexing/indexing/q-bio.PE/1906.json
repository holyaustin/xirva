We show that local\nasymptotic stability of exclusion by electroactive bacteria is not guaranteed,\neven in a simplified version of the model.

Early models made the simplifying assumption\nthat the substitution process is homogeneous over time and across sites in the\nmolecular sequence alignment. While standard practice adopts extensions that\naccommodate heterogeneity of substitution rates across sites, heterogeneity in\nthe process over time in a site-specific manner remains frequently overlooked.\nThis is problematic, as evolutionary processes that act at the molecular level\nare highly variable, subjecting different sites to different selective\nconstraints over time, impacting their substitution behaviour. We propose\nincorporating time variability through Markov-modulated models (MMMs) that\nallow the substitution process (including relative character exchange rates as\nwell as the overall substitution rate) that models the evolution at an\nindividual site to vary across lineages. We implement a general MMM framework\nin BEAST, a popular Bayesian phylogenetic inference software package, allowing\nresearchers to compose a wide range of MMMs through flexible XML specification.\nUsing examples from bacterial, viral and plastid genome evolution, we show that\nMMMs impact phylogenetic tree estimation and can substantially improve model\nfit compared to standard substitution models. Through simulations, we show that\nmarginal likelihood estimation accurately identifies the generative model and\ndoes not systematically prefer the more parameter-rich MMMs. In order to\nmitigate the increased computational demands associated with MMMs, our\nimplementation exploits recently developed updates to BEAGLE, a\nhigh-performance computational library for phylogenetic inference.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Jun 2019 13:46:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-13", "authors_parsed": [["Baele", "Guy", ""], ["Gill", "Mandev S.", ""], ["Lemey", "Philippe", ""], ["Suchard", "Marc A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.05471", "submitter": "Masahiko Ueda", "authors": "Masahiko Ueda", "title": "Absolute negative mobility in evolution", "comments": "13 pages, 13 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

This article proposes a more general\nanswer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern\nremains the same after transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in\nphysics. For example, general relativity emphasizes the need for the equations\ndescribing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of\nreference. By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, we show\nthat the log series pattern dominates when the consequences of processes acting\non abundance are invariant to the addition or multiplication of abundance by a\nconstant. The lognormal pattern dominates when the processes acting on net\nspecies growth rate obey rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the\nsumming up of the individual component processes. Recognizing how these\ninvariances connect pattern to process leads to a synthesis of previous\napproaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more fundamental maximum\nentropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides\na simple derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at\nthe metacommunity scale and a clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local\ncommunity scale. The invariance expressions are easy to understand because they\nuniquely describe the basic underlying components that shape pattern.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Jun 2019 12:07:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Aug 2019 07:21:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-21", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""], ["Bascompte", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.07117", "submitter": "Yvonne Krumbeck", "authors": "Yvonne Krumbeck, George W.

We use an empirical network of sexual contacts\namong female sex workers (FSWs) and clients to simulate the spread of HIV and\ngonorrhea. We then investigate the effect of PrEP adoption and adherence, on\nboth HIV and gonorrhea prevalence. We also study the effect of a potential\nincrease in condomless acts due to lowered risk perception with respect of the\nno-PrEP scenario (risk compensation). We find that when HIV is the only disease\ncirculating, PrEP is effective in reducing HIV prevalence, even with high risk\ncompensation. Instead, the complex interplay between the two diseases shows\nthat different levels of risk compensation require different intervention\nstrategies. Finally, we find that providing PrEP only to the most active FSWs\nis less effective than uniform PrEP adoption. Our work shows that the effects\nemerging from the complex interactions between these diseases and the available\nprophylactic measures need to be accounted for, to devise effective\nintervention strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2019 11:56:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 2 Jul 2019 17:28:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Bernini", "Alba", ""], ["Blouzard", "Elodie", ""], ["Bracci", "Alberto", ""], ["Casanova", "Pau", ""], ["Iacopini", "Iacopo", ""], ["Steinegger", "Benjamin", ""], ["Teixeira", "Andreia Sofia", ""], ["Antonioni", "Alberto", ""], ["Valdano", "Eugenio", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.09903", "submitter": "Andrey Koch", "authors": "Andrey O.
