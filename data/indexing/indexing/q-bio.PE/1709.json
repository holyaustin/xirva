A variety of\ngraph structures, graph dynamics, and behaviours of replicators have been\nexplored. These models have primarily been studied in the framework of\nfacilitation of cooperation, and much previous research has shed light on this\nfield of study. However, there has been little attention devoted to truncation\nselection as most models employ proportional selection (such as in the\nreplicator equation) or `imitate the best.' Here we systematically explore\ntruncation selection on periodic square lattices, where replicators below a\nfitness threshold are culled and the reproduction probabilities are equal for\nall survivors. We employ two variations of this method: independent truncation,\nwhere the threshold is fixed; and dependent truncation, which is a\ngeneralization of `imitate the best.' Further, we explore the effects of\ndiffusion in our networks in the following orders of operation:\ncontest-diffusion-offspring (CDO), and diffusion-contest-offspring (DCO). CDO\nand DCO frequently facilitate and diminish cooperation, respectively. For\nindependent truncation, we find three regimes determined by the fitness\nthreshold: cooperation decreases as we raise the threshold; polymorphisms and\nextinction can occur; and the entire population goes extinct. Further, we show\nhow an intermediate sucker's payoff maximizes cooperation in the DCO\nindependent truncation model. We find that dependent truncation affects games\ndifferently; lower levels reduce cooperation for the Hawk Dove game and\nincrease it for the Stag Hunt, and higher levels produce the opposite effects.\nWe compare these truncation methods to proportional selection, and show that\nthey can facilitate cooperation. We conclude that truncation selection can\nimpact the prevalence of cooperation in complex ways, and therefore merit\nfurther study.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 20:41:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:25:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-06-29", "authors_parsed": [["Morsky", "Bryce", ""], ["Bauch", "Chris T.", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.00164", "submitter": "Cole Lyman", "authors": "Cole A.

We illustrate the use of these algorithms in a spatially explicit\nindividual-based model of speciation.

To reach this result, I use an\noriginal method to study the limiting dynamical system, analyzing first the\nsystem without migration and adding migration with a perturbation method.\nFinally, I study how the time before reproductive isolation is influenced by\nthe parameters of migration and of mating preferences, highlighting that large\nmigration rates tend to favor types with weak mating preferences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 14:53:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 6 May 2018 10:05:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-08", "authors_parsed": [["Leman", "Helene", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.06461", "submitter": "Nuno Crokidakis", "authors": "Marcelo A.

Our objective was to study how disease risk perception can\ninfluence opinions about vaccination and therefore the spreading of the\ndisease. Differently from previous works we have considered continuous\nopinions. The epidemic spreading is governed by a SIS-like model with an extra\nvaccinated state. In our model individuals vaccinate with a probability\nproportional to their opinions. The opinions change due to peer influence in\npairwise interactions. The epidemic feedback to the opinion dynamics acts as an\nexternal field increasing the vaccination probability. We performed Monte Carlo\nsimulations in fully-connected populations. Interestingly we observed the\nemergence of a first-order phase transition, besides the usual active-absorbing\nphase transition presented in the SIS model. Our simulations also show that\nwith a certain combination of parameters, an increment in the initial fraction\nof the population that is pro-vaccine has a twofold effect: it can lead to\nsmaller epidemic outbreaks in the short term, but it also contributes to the\nsurvival of the chain of infections in the long term.

At the\nsame time, local adaptation to environmental conditions creates a geographic\nmosaic of evolutionary forces, where the combined drivers of selection and gene\nflow interact. Although the dispersal of individuals from donor to recipient\npopulations provides connections within the metapopulation, promoting\ndemographic and evolutionary rescue, it may also introduce maladapted\nindividuals into habitats host to different environmental conditions,\npotentially lowering the fitness of the recipient population. Here we explore a\nmodel of the eco-evolutionary dynamics between two populations connected by\ndispersal, where the productivity of each is defined by a trait complex that is\nsubject to local selection. Although general in nature, our model is inspired\nby salmon metapopulations, where dispersal between populations is defined in\nterms of the straying rate, which has been shown to be density-dependent. The\nresults of our model reveal that increased straying between evolving\npopulations leads to alternative stable states, which has large and nonlinear\neffects on two measures of metapopulation robustness: the portfolio effect and\nthe time to recovery following an induced disturbance. We show that\nintermediate levels of straying result in large gains in robustness, and that\nincreased habitat heterogeneity promotes robustness when straying rates are\nlow, and erodes robustness when straying rates are high. Finally, we show that\ndensity-dependent straying promotes robustness, particularly when the aggregate\nbiomass is low and straying is correspondingly high, which has important\nramifications for the conservation of salmon metapopulations facing both\nnatural and anthropogenic disturbances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Sep 2017 21:01:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-25", "authors_parsed": [["Yeakel", "Justin D.", ""], ["Gibert", "Jean P.", ""], ["Westley", "Peter A.

The model describes\nresource competition (for both soil and light resources) in annual communities\nand incorporates two fundamental aspects: light asymmetry (higher light\nacquisition per unit biomass for larger individuals) and growth allometry\n(negative dependency of relative growth rate on plant biomass). Results show\nthat both factors are critical in determining patterns of seed mass variation.\nIn general, growth allometry increases the reproductive success of small-seeded\nspecies while light asymmetry increases the reproductive success of\nlarge-seeded species. Increasing availability of soil resources increases light\ncompetition, thereby increasing the reproductive success of large-seeded\nspecies and ultimately the community (weighted) mean seed mass. An unexpected\nprediction of the model is that maximum variation in community seed mass (a\nmeasure of functional diversity) occurs under intermediate levels of soil\nresources. Extensions of the model incorporating size-dependent seed survival\nand disturbance also show patterns consistent with empirical observations.\nThese overall results suggest that the mechanisms captured by the model are\nimportant in determining patterns of species and functional diversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Sep 2017 08:51:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Nov 2017 07:13:04 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 9 Jul 2018 09:06:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-10", "authors_parsed": [["DeMalach", "Niv", ""], ["Kadmon", "Ronen", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.09911", "submitter": "Ozgur Aydogmus", "authors": "Ozgur Aydogmus", "title": "Phase Transitions in a Logistic Metapopulation Model with Nonlocal\n  Interactions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1007/s11538-017-0373-3", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.DS", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The presence of one or more species at some spatial locations but not others\nis a central matter in ecology. This phenomenon is related to ecological\npattern formation. Nonlocal interactions can be considered as one of the\nmechanisms causing such a phenomenon. We propose a single-species, continuous\ntime metapopulation model taking nonlocal interactions into account. Discrete\nprobability kernels are used to model these interactions in a patchy\nenvironment. A linear stability analysis of the model shows that solutions to\nthis equation exhibit pattern formation if the dispersal rate of the species is\nsufficiently small and the discrete interaction kernel satisfies certain\nconditions. We numerically observe that traveling and stationary wave type\npatterns arise near critical dispersal rate. We use weakly nonlinear analysis\nto better understand the behavior of formed patterns. We show that observed\npatterns arise through both supercritical and subcritical bifurcations from\nspatially homogeneous steady state. Moreover, we observe that as the dispersal\nrate decreases, amplitude of the patterns increases. For discontinuous\ntransitions to instability, we also show that there exists a threshold for the\namplitude of the initial condition, above which pattern formation is observed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Sep 2017 12:15:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-29", "authors_parsed": [["Aydogmus", "Ozgur", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10043", "submitter": "Oliver Sutton", "authors": "Andrea Cangiani, Emmanuil H.

In this work, we demonstrate some\nnew types of wave propagation and pattern formation in a classical three\nspecies cyclic competition model with spatial diffusion, which have been so far\nmissed in the literature. These new patterns are characterised by a high\nregularity in space, but are different from patterns previously known to exist\nin reaction-diffusion models, and may have important applications in improving\nour understanding of biological pattern formation and invasion theory. Finding\nthese new patterns is made technically possible by using an automatic adaptive\nfinite element method driven by a novel a posteriori error estimate which is\nproven to provide a reliable bound for the error of the numerical method.

The\nduality implies that the fractions can be equalized by tit-for-tat players,\nalthough unconditional cooperation is still dominated by defection.\nFurthermore, we find that mutation among the strategies breaks the exact\nduality in such a way that cooperation is more favored than defection, as long\nas the cost-to-benefit ratio of cooperation is small.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 05:50:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Baek", "Seung Ki", ""], ["Yi", "Su Do", ""], ["Jeong", "Hyeong-Chai", ""]]}, {"id": "1709.10353", "submitter": "Shikha Jain", "authors": "Sachin Kumar, Shikha Jain", "title": "Assessing the Effects of Treatment in HIV-TB Co-infection Model", "comments": "26 pages", "journal-ref": "Eur.
