This study explores\nthree main questions: What are the regions of Colombia where malaria is\nepidemic? What are the regions and populations in Colombia where malaria is\nendemic? What associations exist between epidemic outbreaks between regions in\nColombia? \\textit{Plasmodium falciparum} is most prevalent in the Pacific\nCoast, some regions of the Amazon Basin, and some regions of the Magdalena\nBasin. \\textit{Plasmodium vivax} is the most prevalent parasite in Colombia,\nparticularly in the Northern Amazon Basin, the Caribbean, and municipalities of\nSucre, Antioquia and Cordoba. Malaria has been reported to be most common among\n15-45 year old men. We find that the age-class suffering high risk of malaria\ninfection ranges from 20 to 30 with an acute peak at 25 years of age. Second,\nthis pattern was not found to be generalizable across Colombian populations,\nIndigenous and Afrocolombian populations experience endemic malaria (with\nhousehold transmission). Third, clusters of epidemic malaria for\n\\textit{Plasmodium vivax} were detected across Southern Colombia including the\nAmazon Basin and the Southern Pacific region. \\textit{Plasmodium falciparum},\nwas is epidemic in 13 of the 1,123 municipalities (1.2\\%).

However, the effectiveness of punishment is\nchallenged by second-order freeriding and antisocial punishment. The latter\nimplies that non-cooperators punish cooperators, while the former implies\nunwillingness to shoulder the cost of punishment. Here we extend the theory of\ncooperation in the spatial public goods game by considering four competing\nstrategies, which are traditional cooperators and defectors, as well as\ncooperators who punish defectors and defectors who punish cooperators. We show\nthat if the synergistic effects are high enough to sustain cooperation based on\nnetwork reciprocity alone, antisocial punishment does not deter public\ncooperation. Conversely, if synergistic effects are low and punishment is\nactively needed to sustain cooperation, antisocial punishment does act\ndetrimental, but only if the cost-to-fine ratio is low. If the costs are\nrelatively high, cooperation again dominates as a result of spatial pattern\nformation. Counterintuitively, defectors who do not punish cooperators, and are\nthus effectively second-order freeriding on antisocial punishment, form an\nactive layer around punishing cooperators, which protects them against\ndefectors that punish cooperators. A stable three-strategy phase that is\nsustained by the spontaneous emergence of cyclic dominance is also possible via\nthe same route. The microscopic mechanism behind the reported evolutionary\noutcomes can be explained by the comparison of invasion rates that determine\nthe stability of subsystem solutions.

We consider an epidemic model that is\nnetwork based and non-Markovian, containing classic Kermack-McKendrick,\npairwise, message passing, and spatial models as special cases. For this model,\nwe prove a monotonic relationship between the variability of the infectious\nperiod (with fixed mean) and the probability that the infection will reach any\ngiven subset of the population by any given time. For certain families of\ndistributions, this result implies that epidemic severity is decreasing with\nrespect to the variance of the infectious period. The striking importance of\nthis relationship is demonstrated numerically. We then prove, with a fixed\nbasic reproductive ratio (R0), a monotonic relationship between the variability\nof the posterior transmission probability (which is a function of the\ninfectious period) and the probability that the infection will reach any given\nsubset of the population by any given time. Thus again, even when R0 is fixed,\nvariability of the infectious period tends to dampen the epidemic. Numerical\nresults illustrate this but indicate the relationship is weaker. We then show\nhow our results apply to message passing, pairwise, and Kermack-McKendrick\nepidemic models, even when they are not exactly consistent with the stochastic\ndynamics.

In\nthis process, agents of a two-type population (i.e. mutants and residents) are\nassociated with the vertices of a graph. Initially, only one vertex chosen\nuniformly at random is a mutant, with fitness $r > 0$, while all other\nindividuals are residents, with fitness $1$. In every step, an individual is\nchosen with probability proportional to its fitness, and its state (mutant or\nresident) is passed on to a neighbor which is chosen uniformly at random. In\nthis paper, we introduce and study a generalization of the model of Lieberman\net al. by assuming that different types of individuals perceive the population\nthrough different graphs, namely $G_R(V,E_R)$ for residents and $G_M(V,E_M)$\nfor mutants. In this model, we study the fixation probability, i.e. the\nprobability that eventually only mutants remain in the population, for various\npairs of graphs.
