For\nexample, viruses infect cells, where they express their own proteins and\nreplicate. In this process, the host cell boundary limits the diffusion of the\nviral protein products, thereby ensuring that phenotypic compounds, such as\nproteins, promote the replication of the genes that encoded them. This role of\nmaintaining spatial co-localization, also called genotype-phenotype linkage, is\na critical function of compartments in natural selection. In most cases\nhowever, individual replicating elements do not distribute systematically among\nthe hosts, but are randomly partitioned. Depending on the replicator-to-host\nratio, more than one variant may thus occupy some compartments, blurring the\ngenotype-phenotype linkage and affecting the effectiveness of natural\nselection. We derive selection equations for a variety of such random multiple\noccupancy situations, in particular considering the effect of replicator\npopulation polymorphism and internal replication dynamics. We conclude that the\ndeleterious effect of random multiple occupancy on selection is relatively\nbenign, and may even completely vanish is some specific cases. In addition,\ngiven that higher mean occupancy allows larger populations to be channeled\nthrough the selection process, and thus provide a better exploration of\nphenotypic diversity, we show that it may represent a valid strategy in both\nnatural and technological cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 12 Nov 2017 20:36:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 May 2019 22:43:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zadorin", "Anton S.", ""], ["Rondelez", "Yannick", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.04393", "submitter": "Unjong Yu", "authors": "Jeong-Ok Choi and Unjong Yu", "title": "Fixation probability on clique-based graphs", "comments": "9 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.physa.2017.11.131", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The fixation probability of a mutant in the evolutionary dynamics of Moran\nprocess is calculated by the Monte-Carlo method on a few families of\nclique-based graphs.

Environmental changes, in response to which genetic diversity in a\npopulation provides a fitness advantage, are likely to have occurred at these\nintermediate time scales. Our results indicate that the ability of the standard\ncode to explore a large fraction of the space of functional sequence variants\narises from a balance between robustness and flexibility and is largely\nindependent of the property of the standard code to minimize the phenotypic\neffects of mutations. We propose that selection to explore a large fraction of\nthe functional sequence space while minimizing the phenotypic effects of\nmutations contributed towards the emergence of the standard code as the\nuniversal genetic code.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Nov 2017 19:29:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Tripathi", "Shubham", ""], ["Deem", "Michael W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.09424", "submitter": "Jose Fontanari", "authors": "Jos\\'e F.

In\nhigh-recombining sequence, the targets of selection are individual genetic\nloci; under low recombination, selection collectively acts on large,\ngenetically linked genomic segments. Selection under linkage can induce clonal\ninterference, a specific mode of evolution by competition of genetic clades\nwithin a population. This mode is well known in asexually evolving microbes,\nbut has not been traced systematically in an obligate sexual organism. Here we\nshow that the Drosophila genome is partitioned into two modes of evolution: a\nlocal interference regime with limited effects of genetic linkage, and an\ninterference condensate with clonal competition. We map these modes by\ndifferences in mutation frequency spectra, and we show that the transition\nbetween them occurs at a threshold recombination rate that is predictable from\ngenomic summary statistics. We find the interference condensate in segments of\nlow-recombining sequence that are located primarily in chromosomal regions\nflanking the centromeres and cover about 20% of the Drosophila genome.\nCondensate regions have characteristics of asexual evolution that impact gene\nfunction: the efficacy of selection and the speed of evolution are lower and\nthe genetic load is higher than in regions of local interference.
