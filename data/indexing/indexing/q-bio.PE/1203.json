Our first result is\nstructural and shows that, at any time during the evolution, as the population\nsize tends to infinity, the distribution of genomes predicted by our model\nconverges to that predicted by the quasispecies model. This justifies the\ncontinued use of the quasispecies model to derive guidelines for intervention.\nWhile the stationary state in the quasispecies model is readily obtained, due\nto the explosion of the state space in our model, exact computations are\nprohibitive. Our second set of results are computational in nature and address\nthis issue. We derive conditions on the parameters of evolution under which our\nstochastic model mixes rapidly. Further, for a class of widely used fitness\nlandscapes we give a fast deterministic algorithm which computes the stationary\ndistribution of our model.

Moreover, this\nframework admits the inclusion of mutations between different types, provided\nthat mutation rates, $\\mu$, are not too small compared to the inverse\npopulation size 1/N. This ensures that all types are almost always represented\nin the population and that the occasional extinction of one type does not\nresult in an extended absence of that type. For $\\mu N\\ll1$ this limits the use\nof SDE's, but in this case there are well established alternative\napproximations based on time scale separation.

The key parameter\ngoverning the strength of genetic interactions is the number $K$ of interaction\npartners of each of the $L$ sites in the genotype sequence. In general,\naccessibility increases with increasing genotype dimensionality $L$ and\ndecreases with increasing number of interactions $K$.

These TMRCAs have special\ndemographic implications because mtDNA is transmitted only from mother to\nchild, and NRY from father to son. Therefore, mtDNA reflects female history,\nand NRY, male history. To investigate what caused the two-to-one female-male\nTMRCA ratio in humans, we develop a forward-looking agent-based model (ABM)\nwith overlapping generations and individual life cycles. We implement two main\nmating systems: polygynandry and polygyny with different degrees in between. In\neach mating system, the male population can be either homogeneous or\nheterogeneous. In the latter case, some males are `alphas' and others are\n`betas', which reflects the extent to which they are favored by female mates. A\nheterogeneous male population implies a competition among males with the\npurpose of signaling as alphas. The introduction of a heterogeneous male\npopulation is found to reduce by a factor 2 the probability of finding equal\nfemale and male TMRCAs and shifts the distribution of the TMRCA ratio to higher\nvalues. We find that high male-male competition is necessary to reproduce a\nTMRCA ratio of 2: less than half the males can be alphas and betas can have at\nmost half the fitness of alphas. In addition, in the modes that maximize the\nprobability of having a TMRCA ratio between 1.5 and 2.5, the present generation\nhas 1.4 times as many female as male ancestors.

Here we show that relaxing\nthis assumption by allowing players to adapt their sanctioning efforts in\ndependence on the success of cooperation can explain both, the spontaneous\nemergence of punishment, as well as its ability to deter defectors and those\nunwilling to punish them with globally negligible investments. By means of\nphase diagrams and the analysis of emerging spatial patterns, we demonstrate\nthat adaptive punishment promotes public cooperation either through the\ninvigoration of spatial reciprocity, the prevention of the emergence of cyclic\ndominance, or through the provision of competitive advantages to those that\nsanction antisocial behavior.
