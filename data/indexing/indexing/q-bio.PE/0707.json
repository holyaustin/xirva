Recently developed pyrophosphate based sequencing\ntechnologies (pyrosequencing) can be used for quantifying this diversity by\nultra-deep sequencing of virus samples. We present computational methods for\nthe analysis of such sequence data and apply these techniques to pyrosequencing\ndata obtained from HIV populations within patients harboring drug resistant\nvirus strains. Our main result is the estimation of the population structure of\nthe sample from the pyrosequencing reads. This inference is based on a\nstatistical approach to error correction, followed by a combinatorial algorithm\nfor constructing a minimal set of haplotypes that explain the data. Using this\nset of explaining haplotypes, we apply a statistical model to infer the\nfrequencies of the haplotypes in the population via an EM algorithm. We\ndemonstrate that pyrosequencing reads allow for effective population\nreconstruction by extensive simulations and by comparison to 165 sequences\nobtained directly from clonal sequencing of four independent, diverse HIV\npopulations. Thus, pyrosequencing can be used for cost-effective estimation of\nthe structure of virus populations, promising new insights into viral\nevolutionary dynamics and disease control strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Jul 2007 15:36:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 Jan 2008 19:11:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Eriksson", "Nicholas", ""], ["Pachter", "Lior", ""], ["Mitsuya", "Yumi", ""], ["Rhee", "Soo-Yon", ""], ["Wang", "Chunlin", ""], ["Gharizadeh", "Baback", ""], ["Ronaghi", "Mostafa", ""], ["Shafer", "Robert W.", ""], ["Beerenwinkel", "Niko", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.0329", "submitter": "Mareike Fischer", "authors": "Mareike Fischer, Mike Steel", "title": "Expected Anomalies in the Fossil Record", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Fischer, M. and Steel, M.

Desai and Fisher perform an elaborate\nstochastic calculation of the mean time $\\tau$ until a new class of mutants has\nbeen established, and interpret $1/\\tau$ as the speed of adaptation. As they\nnote, however, their calculations are valid only for moderate speeds. This\nlimitation arises from their method to determine $\\tau$: Desai and Fisher\nback-extrapolate the value of $\\tau$ from the best-fit class' exponential\ngrowth at infinite time. This approach is not valid when the population adapts\nrapidly, because in this case the best-fit class grows non-exponentially during\nthe relevant time interval. Here, we substantially extend Desai and Fisher's\nanalysis of the stochastic edge. We show that we can apply Desai and Fisher's\nmethod to high speeds by either exponentially back-extrapolating from finite\ntime or using a non-exponential back-extrapolation. Our results are compatible\nwith predictions made using a different analytical approach (Rouzine et al.\n2003, 2007), and agree well with numerical simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2007 23:31:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 18 Dec 2007 23:22:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Brunet", "Eric", ""], ["Rouzine", "Igor M.", ""], ["Wilke", "Claus O.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.3469", "submitter": "Claus O.

We\nderive improved methods to model the highest-fitness class (the stochastic\nedge) for both Muller's ratchet and adaptive evolution, and calculate analytic\ncorrection terms that compensate for inaccuracies which arise when treating\ndiscrete fitness classes as a continuum. We show that traveling wave theory\nmakes excellent predictions for the rate of mutation accumulation in the case\nof Muller's ratchet, and makes good predictions for the speed of adaptation in\na very broad parameter range.

Recent high-throughput genomic studies of cancer cells have\nshown that the mutational landscape of cancer is complex and that individual\ncancers may evolve through mutations in as many as 20 different\ncancer-associated genes. We use data published by Sjoblom et al. (2006) to\ndevelop a new mathematical model for the somatic evolution of colorectal\ncancers. We employ the Wright-Fisher process for exploring the basic parameters\nof this evolutionary process and derive an analytical approximation for the\nexpected waiting time to the cancer phenotype. Our results highlight the\nrelative importance of selection over both the size of the cell population at\nrisk and the mutation rate. The model predicts that the observed genetic\ndiversity of cancer genomes can arise under a normal mutation rate if the\naverage selective advantage per mutation is on the order of 1%. Increased\nmutation rates due to genetic instability would allow even smaller selective\nadvantages during tumorigenesis. The complexity of cancer progression thus can\nbe understood as the result of multiple sequential mutations, each of which has\na relatively small but positive effect on net cell growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jul 2007 15:39:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-10", "authors_parsed": [["Beerenwinkel", "Niko", ""], ["Antal", "Tibor", ""], ["Dingli", "David", ""], ["Traulsen", "Arne", ""], ["Kinzler", "Kenneth W.", ""], ["Velculescu", "Victor E.", ""], ["Vogelstein", "Bert", ""], ["Nowak", "Martin A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0707.4533", "submitter": "Nicholas Guttenberg", "authors": "Nicholas Guttenberg and Nigel Goldenfeld", "title": "Cascade of Complexity in Evolving Predator-Prey Dynamics", "comments": "5 pages, 3 figures; added comments on system size scaling and\n  turbulence analogy, added error estimates of data collapse parameters.\n  Slightly enhanced from the version which will appear in PRL", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.058102", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": null, "abstract": "  We simulate an individual-based model that represents both the phenotype and\ngenome of digital organisms with predator-prey interactions.
