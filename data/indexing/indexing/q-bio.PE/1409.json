This issue is compounded by a severe lack of\nnew antibiotics reaching the market. The significant rise in clinical\nresistance to antibiotics is especially problematic in nosocomial infections,\nwhere already vulnerable patients may fail to respond to treatment, causing\neven greater health concern. A recent focus has been on the development of\nanti-virulence drugs as a second line of defence in the treatment of\nantibiotic-resistant infections. This treatment, which weakens bacteria by\nreducing their virulence rather than killing them, should allow infections to\nbe cleared through the body's natural defence mechanisms. In this way there\nshould be little to no selective pressure exerted on the organism and, as such,\na predominantly resistant population would be unlikely to emerge. However, much\ncontroversy surrounds this approach with many believing it would not be\npowerful enough to clear existing infections, restricting its potential\napplication to prophylaxis. We have developed a mathematical model that\nprovides a theoretical framework to reveal the circumstances under which\nanti-virulence drugs may or may not be successful. We demonstrate that by\nharnessing and combining the advantages of antibiotics with those provided by\nanti-virulence drugs, given infection-specific parameters, it is possible to\nidentify treatment strategies that would efficiently clear bacterial\ninfections, while preventing the emergence of resistant subpopulations.

The later an escape mutation emerges, the slower it outgrows its\ncompetition, i. e. the escape rate is lower. This pattern could indicate that\nthe strength of the CD8+ cell responses is waning, or that later viral escape\nmutants carry a larger fitness cost. In this paper, we investigate whether the\npattern of decreasing escape rate could also be caused by genetic interference\namong different escape strains. To this end, we developed a mathematical\nmulti-epitope model of HIV dynamics, which incorporates stochastic effects,\nrecombination and mutation. We used cumulative linkage disequilibrium measures\nto quantify the amount of interference. We found that nearly synchronous,\nsimilarly strong immune responses in two-locus systems enhance the generation\nof genetic interference. This effect, combined with densely spaced sampling\ntimes at the beginning of infection, leads to decreasing successive escape rate\nestimates, even when there were no selection differences among alleles. These\npredictions are supported by experimental data from one HIV-infected patient.\nThus, interference could explain why later escapes are slower. Considering\nescape mutations in isolation, neglecting their genetic linkage, conceals the\nunderlying haplotype dynamics and can affect the estimation of the selective\npressure exerted by CD8+ cells. In systems in which multiple escape mutations\nappear, the occurrence of interference dynamics should be assessed by measuring\nthe linkage between different escape mutations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Sep 2014 06:53:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Garcia", "Victor", ""], ["Regoes", "Roland", ""]]}, {"id": "1409.7839", "submitter": "Elizabeth Jerison", "authors": "Elizabeth R.

High clustering coefficient indicates efficient local information\ndistribution and high characteristic path length suggests reduced global\nintegration. Second, the total wiring length is smaller than for the\nalternative configurations with similar modularity. This is due to lower\ndispersion of connections, which means each neuron in C. elegans connectome or\neach region of interest (ROI) in human connectome reaches fewer ganglia or\ncortical areas, respectively.
