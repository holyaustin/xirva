Extinction typically\noccurs via one of two scenarios depending on whether the absorbing state n=0 is\na repelling (scenario A) or attracting (scenario B) point of the deterministic\nrate equation. In scenario A the metastable stochastic population resides in\nthe vicinity of an attracting fixed point next to the repelling point n=0. In\nscenario B there is an intermediate repelling point n=n_1 between the\nattracting point n=0 and another attracting point n=n_2 in the vicinity of\nwhich the metastable population resides. The crux of the theory is WKB method\nwhich assumes that the typical population size in the metastable state is\nlarge. Starting from the master equation, we calculate the quasi-stationary\nprobability distribution of the population sizes and the (exponentially long)\nmean time to extinction for each of the two scenarios. When necessary, the WKB\napproximation is complemented (i) by a recursive solution of the\nquasi-stationary master equation at small n and (ii) by the van Kampen\nsystem-size expansion, valid near the fixed points of the deterministic rate\nequation. The theory yields both entropic barriers to extinction and\npre-exponential factors, and holds for a general set of multi-step processes\nwhen detailed balance is broken. The results simplify considerably for\nsingle-step processes and near the characteristic bifurcations of scenarios A\nand B.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2009 06:22:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2009 12:40:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2009 12:01:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Assaf", "Michael", ""], ["Meerson", "Baruch", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.0335", "submitter": "Ganna Rozhnova", "authors": "Ganna Rozhnova, Ana Nunes", "title": "Population dynamics on random networks: simulations and analytical\n  models", "comments": "8 pages, 5 figures; we have expanded and rewritten the introduction,\n  slightly modified the abstract and the text in other sections; also, several\n  new references have been added in the revised manuscript (Refs.\n  [17-25,30,35]);", "journal-ref": "Eur.

Some generalizations based on more complicated \"dose-response\"\ncurves were proposed. Violations of this law in natural and experimental\necosystems were also reported. We study models of adaptation in ensembles of\nsimilar organisms under load of environmental factors and prove that violation\nof Liebig's law follows from adaptation effects. If the fitness of an organism\nin a fixed environment satisfies the Law of the Minimum then adaptation\nequalizes the pressure of essential factors and therefore acts against the\nLiebig's law. This is the the Law of the Minimum paradox: if for a randomly\nchosen pair \"organism-environment\" the Law of the Minimum typically holds,\nthen, in a well-adapted system, we have to expect violations of this law.\n  For the opposite interaction of factors (a synergistic system of factors\nwhich amplify each other) adaptation leads from factor equivalence to\nlimitations by a smaller number of factors.\n  For analysis of adaptation we develop a system of models based on Selye's\nidea of the universal adaptation resource (adaptation energy). These models\npredict that under the load of an environmental factor a population separates\ninto two groups (phases): a less correlated, well adapted group and a highly\ncorrelated group with a larger variance of attributes, which experiences\nproblems with adaptation.

This tree space provides a\npowerful tool for studying and comparing phylogenetic trees, both in exhibiting\na natural distance measure and in providing a Euclidean-like structure for\nsolving optimization problems on trees. An important open problem is to find a\npolynomial time algorithm for finding geodesics in tree space. This paper gives\nsuch an algorithm, which starts with a simple initial path and moves through a\nseries of successively shorter paths until the geodesic is attained.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 23 Jul 2009 15:39:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 5 Nov 2009 01:14:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Owen", "Megan", ""], ["Provan", "J.

We demonstrate that fluctuations can change this conclusion and can\nlead to dominance by the fast species or to coexistence, depending on\nparameters.

If this assumption breaks down, then the cluster\napproximation must be carried out beyond the level of pairs. We construct an\nuncorrelated triplet approximation that captures the behavior of the system in\na region of parameter space where the pair approximation fails to give a good\nquantitative or even qualitative agreement. For these parameter values, the\npower spectrum of the fluctuations in finite systems can be computed\nanalytically from the master equation of the corresponding stochastic process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Jul 2009 11:49:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Nov 2009 22:31:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Rozhnova", "Ganna", ""], ["Nunes", "Ana", ""]]}, {"id": "0907.4935", "submitter": "Simone Bianco", "authors": "Simone Bianco, Leah B.
