From\na physics point of view, it is interesting to study conditions under which a\ncoordination or cooperation of interacting entities will occur, be it spins,\nparticles, bacteria, animals, or humans. Here, we analyze the case, where the\nentities are heterogeneous, particularly the case of two populations with\nconflicting interactions and two possible states. For such systems, explicit\nmathematical formulas will be determined for the stationary solutions and the\nassociated eigenvalues, which determine their stability. In this way, four\ndifferent types of system dynamics can be classified, and the various kinds of\nphase transitions between them will be discussed. While these results are\ninteresting from a physics point of view, they are also relevant for social,\neconomic, and biological systems, as they allow one to understand conditions\nfor (1) the breakdown of cooperation, (2) the coexistence of different\nbehaviors (\"subcultures\"), (2) the evolution of commonly shared behaviors\n(\"norms\"), and (4) the occurrence of polarization or conflict.

He collected\ncomparative words lists of various languages during his voyages aboard the\nAstrolabe from 1826 to1829 and, in his work about the geographical division of\nthe Pacific, he proposed a method to measure the degree of relation among\nlanguages. The method used by modern glottochronology, developed by Morris\nSwadesh in the 1950s (Swadesh 1952), measures distances from the percentage of\nshared cognates, which are words with a common historical origin. Recently, we\nproposed a new automated method which uses normalized Levenshtein distance\namong words with the same meaning and averages on the words contained in a\nlist. Another classical problem in glottochronology is the study of the\nstability of words corresponding to different meanings. Words, in fact, evolve\nbecause of lexical changes, borrowings and replacement at a rate which is not\nthe same for all of them. The speed of lexical evolution is different for\ndifferent meanings and it is probably related to the frequency of use of the\nassociated words (Pagel et al. 2007). This problem is tackled here by an\nautomated methodology only based on normalized Levenshtein distance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2009 12:47:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 5 Dec 2009 17:08:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Petroni", "Filippo", ""], ["Serva", "Maurizio", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.3441", "submitter": "Mike Steel Prof.", "authors": "Beata Faller and Mike Steel", "title": "Trait-dependent extinction leads to greater expected biodiversity loss", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use a classical combinatorial inequality to establish a Markov inequality\nfor multivariate binary Markov processes on trees.

To apply this paradigm to\nany object, one must fix two things: a representation language, in which\nstrings of symbols from some alphabet describe, or stand for the objects being\nconsidered; and a means of determining when two such descriptions refer to the\nsame object. With these two things set, the information content of an object\ncan be computed in principle from the number of equivalent descriptions\ndescribing a particular object.\n  The previously proposed representation language had the deficiency that the\nfully connected and empty networks were the most complex for a given number of\nnodes. A variation of this measure, called zcomplexity, applied a compression\nalgorithm to the resulting bitstring representation, to solve this problem.\nUnfortunately, zcomplexity proved too computationally expensive to be\npractical.\n  In this paper, I propose a new representation language that encodes the\nnumber of links along with the number of nodes and a representation of the\nlinklist.

Most studies in collective\nanimal behaviour have aimed to understand how a globally ordered state may\nemerge from simple behavioural rules. Less effort has been devoted to\nunderstanding the origin of collective response, namely the way the group as a\nwhole reacts to its environment. Yet collective response is the adaptive key to\nsurvivor, especially when strong predatory pressure is present. Here we argue\nthat collective response in animal groups is achieved through scale-free\nbehavioural correlations. By reconstructing the three-dimensional position and\nvelocity of individual birds in large flocks of starlings, we measured to what\nextent the velocity fluctuations of different birds are correlated to each\nother. We found that the range of such spatial correlation does not have a\nconstant value, but it scales with the linear size of the flock. This result\nindicates that behavioural correlations are scale-free: the change in the\nbehavioural state of one animal affects and is affected by that of all other\nanimals in the group, no matter how large the group is. Scale-free correlations\nextend maximally the effective perception range of the individuals, thus\ncompensating for the short-range nature of the direct inter-individual\ninteraction and enhancing global response to perturbations. Our results suggest\nthat flocks behave as critical systems, poised to respond maximally to\nenvironmental perturbations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Nov 2009 13:00:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-10-10", "authors_parsed": [["Cavagna", "Andrea", ""], ["Cimarelli", "Alessio", ""], ["Giardina", "Irene", ""], ["Parisi", "Giorgio", ""], ["Santagati", "Raffaele", ""], ["Stefanini", "Fabio", ""], ["Viale", "Massimiliano", ""]]}, {"id": "0911.5366", "submitter": "Petr Sulc", "authors": "P.
