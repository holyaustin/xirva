The main idea is the characterisation of\nsymbiotic relations of coexisting species through their mutual influence on\ntheir respective carrying capacities, taking into account that this influence\ncan be quite strong and requires a nonlinear functional framework. We\ndistinguish three variants of mutual influence, representing the main types of\nrelations between species: (i) passive symbiosis, when the mutual carrying\ncapacities are influenced by other species without their direct interactions;\n(ii) active symbiosis, when the carrying capacities are transformed by\ninteracting species; and (iii) mixed symbiosis, when the carrying capacity of\none species is influenced by direct interactions, while that of the other\nspecies is not. The approach allows us to describe all kinds of symbiosis,\nmutualism, commensalism, and parasitism within a unified scheme. The case of\ntwo symbiotic species is analysed in detail, demonstrating several dynamical\nregimes of coexistence, unbounded growth of both populations, growth of one and\nelimination of the other population, convergence to evolutionary stable states,\nand everlasting population oscillations. The change of the dynamical regimes\noccurs by varying the system parameters characterising the destruction or\ncreation of the mutual carrying capacities. The regime changes are associated\nwith several dynamical system bifurcations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 09:32:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-22", "authors_parsed": [["Yukalov", "V.

Unfortunately, entropy-based diversity indices, or diversity\nindices for short, suffer from three problems. First, when computing the\ndiversity for samples withdrawn from communities with different structures,\ndiversity indices can easily yield non-comparable and hard to interpret\nresults. Second, diversity indices impose weighting schemes on the species\ndistributions that unnecessarily emphasize low abundant rare species, or\nerroneously identified ones. Third, diversity indices do not allow for\ncomparing distributions against each other, which is necessary when a community\nhas a well-known species' distribution.\n  In this paper we propose a new general methodology based on information\ntheoretic principles to quantify the species diversity of a community. Our\nmethodology, comprised of two steps, naturally overcomes the previous mentioned\nproblems, and yields comparable and easy to interpret diversity values.

It also implies a faculty to adapt to new selective pressures that\nis consistent with observations. Besides, the model illustrates how several\nindependent functional modules may emerge within a same protein structure,\ndepending on the nature of past environmental fluctuations.

In our global model, windows of increased immigration\nmap to the seasonal timing of epidemic spread, while windows of increased\nemigration map to epidemic decline.

In contrast, for proteins with both functional binding\nand deleterious misfolding, evolution may be highly predictable at the level of\nbiophysical traits: adaptive paths are tightly constrained to first gain extra\nfolding stability and then partially lose it as the new binding function is\ndeveloped.

Recent works have revealed a new set of \"zero-determinant (ZD)\"\nstrategies, which is an important advance in repeated games. A ZD strategy\nplayer can exert a unilaterally control on two players' payoffs. In particular\nhe can deterministically set the opponent's payoff, or enforce an unfair linear\nrelationship between the players' payoffs, thereby always seizing an\nadvantageous share of payoffs. One of the limitations of the original ZD\nstrategy, however, is that it does not capture the notion of robustness when\nthe game is subjected to stochastic errors. In this paper, we propose a general\nmodel of ZD strategies for noisy repeated games, and find that ZD strategies\nhave high robustness against errors. We further derive the pinning strategy\nunder noise, by which the ZD strategy player coercively set the opponent's\nexpected payoff to his desired level, although his payoff control ability\ndeclines with the increase of noise strength. Due to the uncertainty caused by\nnoise, the ZD strategy player cannot secure his payoff to be higher than the\nopponent's, which implies strong extortions do not exist even under low noise.\nWhile we show that the ZD strategy player can still establish a novel kind of\nextortions, named weak extortions, where any increase of his own payoff always\nexceeds that of the opponent's by a fixed percentage, and the conditions under\nwhich the weak extortions can be realized are more stringent as the noise\nbecomes stronger.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 22 Aug 2014 06:02:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Feb 2015 10:35:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 May 2015 02:30:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hao", "Dong", ""], ["Rong", "Zhihai", ""], ["Zhou", "Tao", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.5461", "submitter": "Eyal Elyashiv Dr.", "authors": "Eyal Elyashiv, Shmuel Sattath, Tina T.

Quantifying the effects of 'linked selection' on levels of genetic\ndiversity is key to making reliable inference about demography, building a null\nmodel in scans for targets of adaptation, and learning about the dynamics of\nnatural selection. Here, we introduce the first method that jointly infers\nparameters of distinct modes of linked selection, notably background selection\nand selective sweeps, from genome-wide diversity data, functional annotations\nand genetic maps. The central idea is to calculate the probability that a\nneutral site is polymorphic given local annotations, substitution patterns, and\nrecombination rates. Information is then combined across sites and samples\nusing composite likelihood in order to estimate genome-wide parameters of\ndistinct modes of selection. In addition to parameter estimation, this approach\nyields a map of the expected neutral diversity levels along the genome. To\nillustrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to genome-wide resequencing\ndata from 125 lines in Drosophila melanogaster and reliably predict diversity\nlevels at the 1Mb scale. Our results corroborate estimates of a high fraction\nof beneficial substitutions in proteins and untranslated regions (UTR). They\nallow us to distinguish between the contribution of sweeps and other modes of\nselection around amino acid substitutions and to uncover evidence for pervasive\nsweeps in untranslated regions (UTRs). Our inference further suggests a\nsubstantial effect of linked selection from non-classic sweeps.

The ability to withstand salt as an\nestablished plant may require different mechanisms and plant traits than those\nneeded to germinate in salty soils. Seeds establishing themselves in high salt\ncontent may respond differently depending on the light conditions and seed\ngerminability at the time of salty water imbibition. S. faberi seed (and S.\nviridis and S. pumila) plants were discovered thriving along the seacoasts of\nSouthern Japan. These plants possess the ability to after-ripen, germinate,\nemerge and establish themselves, grow and reproduce in the salty soils and\nsalt-laden atmospheres present in these windy habitats. The objectives of this\npaper are to determine the effect of salt (NaCl) in water imbibed by S. faberi\nseed during after-ripening and germination, as well temperature and light.\nObservations made also provide insights on the possible relationship between\nsalt and drought tolerance. Seed germination of all phenotypes inhibited by two\npercent or more of NaCl. The effects of lesser amounts of NaCl on each of the\nthree phenotypes was highly dependent on the specific temperature and light\nconditions. The three test phenotypes provided a good range to detect responses\nto salinity, allowing the observation of both stimulatory and inhibitory\nresponses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 17:30:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Dekker", "J.", ""], ["Gilbert", "J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1408.6258", "submitter": "Carolina Brito", "authors": "Mendeli H.

We demonstrate that the\nstructural stability of the system is inversely associated with the level of\ncompetition and the level of heterogeneity in the distribution of resources.\nImportantly, we show that the qualitative behavior of the observed global\nsocioeconomic system is highly sensitive to changes in the distribution of\nresources.
