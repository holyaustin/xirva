We analyze statistical properties of\nrandomly generated genomes both on the sequence- and network level, and show\nthat this model correctly predicts the frequency of genes in genomes as found\nin experimental data. Using an evolutionary algorithm based on stabilizing\nselection for a phenotype, we show that robustness against single base\nmutations, as well as against random changes in initial network states that\nmimic stochastic fluctuations in environmental conditions, can emerge in\nparallel. Evolved genomes exhibit characteristic patterns on both sequence and\nnetwork level.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 01:05:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rohlf", "Thimo", ""], ["Winkler", "Chris", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4804", "submitter": "Tamar Friedlander", "authors": "Tamar Friedlander and Naama Brenner", "title": "From cellular properties to population asymptotics in the Population\n  Balance Equation", "comments": "Exact solution of Eq. 9 is added", "journal-ref": "PRL 101, 018104 (2008)", "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.018104", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Proliferating cell populations at steady state growth often exhibit broad\nprotein distributions with exponential tails. The sources of this variation and\nits universality are of much theoretical interest. Here we address the problem\nby asymptotic analysis of the Population Balance Equation. We show that the\nsteady state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein\nproduction and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under\ngeneral conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters\nconsistent with experiment. We discuss the conditions for this effect to be\ndominant over other sources of variation and the relation to experiments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Apr 2008 12:06:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Jun 2008 13:32:47 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 24 Jul 2008 10:03:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Friedlander", "Tamar", ""], ["Brenner", "Naama", ""]]}]
