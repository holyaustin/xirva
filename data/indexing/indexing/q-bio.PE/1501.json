Application of these methods to 3D representations\nof the skullcap (calvaria) of 13 diverse skulls in the genus Homo, ranging from\nHomo erectus (ergaster) at about 1.6 mya, all the way forward to modern humans,\nyields a remarkably clear phylogenetic tree. Various evolutionary hypotheses\nare tested. Results of these tests include rejection of the monophyly of Homo\nheidelbergensis, the Multi-Regional hypothesis, and the hypothesis that the\nunusual 12,000 year old (12kya) Iwo Eleru skull represents a modern human.\nRather, by quantitative phylogenetic analyses the latter is seen to be an old\n(200-400kya) lineage that probably represents a novel African species, Homo\niwoelerueensis. It diverged after the lineage leading to Neanderthals, and may\nhave been driven to extinction in the last 10kya by modern humans, Homo\nsapiens, another African species of Homo that appeared about 100kya. Another\nenigmatic skull, Qafzeh 6 from the Middle East about 90kya, appears to be a\nhybrid of two thirds near, but not, anatomically modern human and one third of\nan archaic lineage diverging close to classic European Neanderthals. Overall,\nthe tree clearly implies an accelerating rate of skullcap shape change, and by\nextension, change of the underlying brain, over the last 400kya in Africa. This\nacceleration may have extended right up to the origin of modern humans. Methods\nof distance-based evolutionary tree inference are refined and extended, with\nparticular attention to diagnosing the model and achieving a better fit. This\nincludes power transformations of the input data which favor root Procrustes\ndistances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 21:05:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-05", "authors_parsed": [["Waddell", "Peter J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1501.00246", "submitter": "Waipot Ngamsaad", "authors": "Waipot Ngamsaad and Suthep Suantai", "title": "Mechanically-driven spreading of bacterial populations", "comments": "16 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication in Communications in\n  Nonlinear Science and Numerical Simulation", "journal-ref": "Commun.

Predicting space use patterns of animals from their interactions with the\nenvironment is fundamental for understanding the effect of habitat changes on\necosystem functioning. Recent attempts to address this problem have sought to\nunify resource selection analysis, where animal space use is derived from\navailable habitat quality, and mechanistic movement models, where detailed\nmovement processes of an animal are used to predict its emergent utilization\ndistribution. Such models bias the animal's movement towards patches that are\neasily available and resource-rich, and the result is a predicted probability\ndensity at a given position being a function of the habitat quality at that\nposition. However, in reality, the probability that an animal will use a patch\nof the terrain tends to be a function of the resource quality in both that\npatch and the surrounding habitat. 2. We propose a mechanistic model where this\nnon-local effect of resources naturally emerges from the local movement\nprocesses, by taking into account the relative utility of both the habitat\nwhere the animal currently resides and that of where it is moving. We give\nstatistical techniques to parametrize the model from location data and\ndemonstrate application of these techniques to GPS data of caribou in\nNewfoundland. 3. Steady-state animal probability distributions arising from the\nmodel have complex patterns that cannot be expressed simply as a function of\nthe local quality of the habitat. In particular, large areas of good habitat\nare used more intensively than smaller patches of equal quality habitat,\nwhereas isolated patches are used less frequently. 4.
