We consider two forms of genome organization. In one case, we assume\nthat the genome consists of two multi-gene chromosomes, while in the second\ncase we assume that each gene defines a separate chromosome. If the organism\nhas $ l $ homologous pairs that lack a functional copy of the given gene, then\nthe fitness of the organism is $ \\kappa_l $. The $ \\kappa_l $ are assumed to be\nmonotonically decreasing, so that $ \\kappa_0 = 1 > \\kappa_1 > \\kappa_2 > ... >\n\\kappa_{\\infty} = 0 $. For nearly all of the reproduction strategies we\nconsider, we find, in the limit of large $ N $, that the mean fitness at\nmutation-selection balance is $ \\max\\{2 e^{-\\mu} - 1, 0\\} $, where $ N $ is the\nnumber of genes in the haploid set of the genome, $ \\epsilon $ is the\nprobability that a given DNA template strand of a given gene produces a mutated\ndaughter during replication, and $ \\mu = N \\epsilon $. The only exception is\nthe sexual reproduction pathway for the multi-chromosomed genome. Assuming a\nmultiplicative fitness landscape where $ \\kappa_l = \\alpha^{l} $ for $ \\alpha\n\\in (0, 1) $, this strategy is found to have a mean fitness that exceeds the\nmean fitness of all of the other strategies. Furthermore, while the other\nreproduction strategies experience a total loss of viability due to the steady\naccumulation of deleterious mutations once $ \\mu $ exceeds $ \\ln 2 $, no such\ntransition occurs in the sexual pathway.

We are motivated by the problem of constructing sets\nof trees which must fit into a recombination, hybridization, or similar\nnetwork. Rather than first finding a set of trees which are optimal according\nto a phylogenetic criterion (e.g. likelihood or parsimony) and then attempting\nto fit them into a network, constNJ estimates the trees while enforcing\nspecified rSPR distance constraints. The primary input for constNJ is a\ncollection of distance matrices derived from sequence blocks which are assumed\nto have evolved in a tree-like manner, such as blocks of an alignment which do\nnot contain any recombination breakpoints. The other input is a set of rSPR\nconstraints for any set of pairs of trees. ConstNJ is consistent and a strict\ngeneralization of the neighbor-joining algorithm; it uses the new notion of\n\"maximum agreement partitions\" to assure that the resulting trees satisfy the\ngiven rSPR distance constraints.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Jan 2009 15:46:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Jan 2009 19:41:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-30", "authors_parsed": [["Matsen", "Frederick A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0901.1657", "submitter": "Thu-Hien To", "authors": "Thu-Hien To and Michel Habib", "title": "Level-k Phylogenetic Network can be Constructed from a Dense Triplet Set\n  in Polynomial Time", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Given a dense triplet set $\\mathcal{T}$, there arise two interesting\nquestions: Does there exists any phylogenetic network consistent with\n$\\mathcal{T}$?
