The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual\ninformation shared between replicators and their environment. In the absence of\nsuccessfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete,\nleading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges.\nOften, the replicators that initiate the transition are not those that are\nultimately selected.

It is now possible to sequence these BCRs in high throughput;\nanalysis of these sequences is bringing new insight into how antibodies\ndevelop, in particular for broadly-neutralizing antibodies against HIV and\ninfluenza. A fundamental step in such sequence analysis is to annotate each\nbase as coming from a specific one of the V, D, or J genes, or from an\nN-addition (a.k.a. non-templated insertion). Previous work has used simple\nparametric distributions to model transitions from state to state in a hidden\nMarkov model (HMM) of VDJ recombination, and assumed that mutations occur via\nthe same process across sites. However, codon frame and other effects have been\nobserved to violate these parametric assumptions for such coding sequences,\nsuggesting that a non-parametric approach to modeling the recombination process\ncould be useful. In our paper, we find that indeed large modern data sets\nsuggest a model using parameter-rich per-allele categorical distributions for\nHMM transition probabilities and per-allele-per-position mutation\nprobabilities, and that using such a model for inference leads to significantly\nimproved results. We present an accurate and efficient BCR sequence annotation\nsoftware package using a novel HMM \"factorization\" strategy. This package,\ncalled partis (https://github.com/psathyrella/partis/), is built on a new\ngeneral-purpose HMM compiler that can perform efficient inference given a\nsimple text description of an HMM.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 21:16:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2015 19:14:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Ralph", "Duncan K.", ""], ["Matsen", "Frederick A.", "IV"]]}, {"id": "1503.04572", "submitter": "J.H. van Hateren", "authors": "J.H. van Hateren", "title": "Extensive fitness and human cooperation", "comments": "Removed minor typo in axis Fig. 2a; 18 pages, 5 figures; in press", "journal-ref": "Theory in Biosciences 134, 127-142 (2015)", "doi": "10.1007/s12064-015-0214-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evolution depends on the fitness of organisms, the expected rate of\nreproducing.

The combined effect is\nknown as inclusive fitness. Here it is argued that a further elaboration of\nfitness has evolved, particularly in humans. It is called extensive fitness and\nit incorporates producing organisms that are merely similar in phenotype. The\nevolvability of this mechanism is illustrated by computations on a simple model\ncombining heredity and behaviour. Phenotypes are driven into the direction of\nhigh fitness through a mechanism that involves an internal estimate of fitness,\nimplicitly made within the organism itself. This mechanism has recently been\nconjectured to be responsible for producing agency and goals. In the model,\ninclusive and extensive fitness are both implemented by letting fitness\nincrease nonlinearly with the size of subpopulations of similar heredity (for\nthe indirect part of inclusive fitness) and of similar phenotype (for the\nphenotypic part of extensive fitness). Populations implementing extensive\nfitness outcompete populations implementing mere inclusive fitness. This occurs\nbecause groups with similar phenotype tend to be larger than groups with\nsimilar heredity, and fitness increases more when groups are larger. Extensive\nfitness has two components, a direct component where individuals compete in\ninducing others to become like them and an indirect component where individuals\ncooperate and help others who are already similar to them.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 09:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 20 Jul 2015 06:29:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 13:21:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 12:36:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-17", "authors_parsed": [["van Hateren", "J.

We developed methods to integrate\navailable field data to understand mortality in wild Anopheles gambiae, the\nmost import vector of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

Methods The EMOD model of malaria\ntransmission was calibrated to prevalence, incidence, asexual parasite density,\ngametocyte density, infection duration, and infectiousness data from 9 study\nsites. The infectious reservoir was characterized by diagnostic detection limit\nand age group over a range of transmission intensities with and without case\nmanagement and vector control. Mass screen-and-treat drug campaigns were tested\nfor likelihood of achieving elimination. Results The composition of the\ninfectious reservoir by diagnostic threshold is similar over a range of\ntransmission intensities, and higher intensity settings are biased toward\ninfections in children. Recent ramp-ups in case management and use of\ninsecticide-treated bednets reduce the infectious reservoir and shift the\ncomposition toward submicroscopic infections. Mass campaigns with antimalarial\ndrugs are highly effective at interrupting transmission if deployed shortly\nafter ITN campaigns. Conclusions Low density infections comprise a substantial\nportion of the infectious reservoir. Proper timing of vector control, seasonal\nvariation in transmission intensity, and mass drug campaigns allows lingering\npopulation immunity to help drive a region toward elimination.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 17:58:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gerardin", "Jaline", ""], ["Ouedraogo", "Andre Lin", ""], ["McCarthy", "Kevin A.", ""], ["Kouyate", "Bocar", ""], ["Eckhoff", "Philip A.", ""], ["Wenger", "Edward A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1503.09149", "submitter": "Jaline Gerardin", "authors": "Jaline Gerardin, Philip Eckhoff, Edward A.

Modelling mass antimalarial campaigns\ncan elucidate how to most effectively deploy drug-based interventions and\nquantitatively compare the effects of cure, prophylaxis, and\ntransmission-blocking in suppressing parasite prevalence. A previously\nestablished agent-based model that includes innate and adaptive immunity was\nused to simulate malaria infections and transmission. Pharmacokinetics of\nartemether, lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin, piperaquine, and primaquine were\nmodelled with a double-exponential distribution-elimination model including\nweight-dependent parameters and age-dependent dosing. Drug killing of asexual\nparasites and gametocytes was calibrated to clinical data. Mass distribution of\nACTs and primaquine was simulated with seasonal mosquito dynamics at a range of\ntransmission intensities. A single mass campaign with antimalarial drugs is\ninsufficient to permanently reduce malaria prevalence when transmission is\nhigh. Current diagnostics are insufficiently sensitive to accurately identify\nasymptomatic infections, and mass-screen-and-treat campaigns are much less\nefficacious than mass drug administrations. Improving campaign coverage leads\nto decreased prevalence one month after the end of the campaign, while\nincreasing compliance lengthens the duration of protection against reinfection.\nUse of a long-lasting prophylactic as part of a mass drug administration\nregimen confers the most benefit under conditions of high transmission and\nmoderately high coverage. Addition of primaquine can reduce prevalence but\nexerts its largest effect when coupled with a long-lasting prophylactic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 18:09:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Gerardin", "Jaline", ""], ["Eckhoff", "Philip", ""], ["Wenger", "Edward A.", ""]]}]
