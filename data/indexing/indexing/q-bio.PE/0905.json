Yet, defection is often favorable for the selfish individual, and\nsocial dilemmas arise. Selection by individuals' fitness, usually the basic\ndriving force of evolution, quickly eliminates cooperators. However, evolution\nis also governed by fluctuations that can be of greater importance than fitness\ndifferences, and can render evolution effectively neutral. Here, we investigate\nthe effects of selection versus fluctuations in social dilemmas. By studying\nthe mean extinction times of cooperators and defectors, a variable sensitive to\nfluctuations, we are able to identify and quantify an emerging 'edge of neutral\nevolution' that delineates regimes of neutral and Darwinian evolution. Our\nresults reveal that cooperation is significantly maintained in the neutral\nregimes. In contrast, the classical predictions of evolutionary game theory,\nwhere defectors beat cooperators, are recovered in the Darwinian regimes. Our\nstudies demonstrate that fluctuations can provide a surprisingly simple way to\npartly resolve social dilemmas. Our methods are generally applicable to\nestimate the role of random drift in evolutionary dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2009 09:24:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 26 Sep 2009 09:32:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-26", "authors_parsed": [["Cremer", "Jonas", ""], ["Reichenbach", "Tobias", ""], ["Frey", "Erwin", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.0869", "submitter": "Carlos P.

In part, this difficulty is due to our poor understanding of the in\nvivo efficacy of CD8$^+$T cells. Using a recently developed experimental method\nof in vivo cytotoxicity we investigated quantitative aspects of killing of\npeptide-pulsed targets by effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, specific to three\nepitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the mouse spleen. By\nanalyzing data on killing of targets with varying number of epitope-specific\neffector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, we find that killing of targets by\neffectors follows the law of mass-action, that is the death rate of\npeptide-pulsed targets is proportional to the frequency of CTLs in the spleen.\nIn contrast, killing of targets by memory CD8$^+$T cells does not follow the\nmass action law because the death rate of targets saturates at high frequencies\nof memory CD8$^+$T cells. For both effector and memory cells, we also find no\nsupport for a killing term that includes the decrease of the death rate of\ntargets with increasing target cell density. Importantly, we find that at low\nCD8$^+$T cell frequencies, effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells on the per capita\nbasis are equally efficient at killing peptide-pulsed targets.

Why some viruses establish\nchronic infections while other do not is poorly understood. One possibility is\nthat the host's immune response is impaired during chronic infections and is\nunable to clear the virus from the host. In this report we use a recently\nproposed framework to estimate the per capita killing efficacy of CD8$^+$ T\ncells, specific for the MT389 epitope of polyoma virus (PyV), which establishes\na chronic infection in mice. Surprisingly, the estimated per cell killing\nefficacy of MT389-specific effector CD8$^+$ T cells during the acute phase of\nthe infection was very similar to the previously estimated efficacy of effector\nCD8$^+$ T cells specific to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus\n(LCMV-Armstrong), which is cleared from the host. We also find that during the\nchronic phase of the infection the killing efficacy of PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T\ncells was only half of that of cells in the acute phase. This decrease in the\nkilling efficacy is again surprisingly similar to the change in the killing\nefficacy of LCMV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells from the peak of the response to the\nmemory phase. Interestingly, we also find that PyV-specific CD8$^+$ T cells in\nthe chronic phase of the infection require lower doses of antigen to kill a\ntarget cell. In summary, we find little support for the hypothesis that\npersistence of infections is caused by inability of the host to mount an\nefficient immune response, and that even in the presence of an efficient\nCD8$^+$ T cell response, some viruses can still establish a persistent\ninfection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 12 May 2009 17:34:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ganusov", "Vitaly V.", ""], ["Lukacher", "Aron E.", ""], ["Byers", "Anthony M.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.2174", "submitter": "Joel Miller", "authors": "Joel Miller, Bahman Davoudi, Rafael Meza, Anja Slim, Babak Pourbohloul", "title": "Epidemics with general generation interval distributions", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the spread of susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) infectious\ndiseases where an individual's infectiousness and probability of recovery\ndepend on his/her \"age\" of infection.

However,\nstatistical consistency of such model-based inference requires that the model\nparameters be identifiable from the joint distribution they entail, and this\nissue has not been addressed.\n  Here we prove that parameters for several such models, with finite state\nspaces of arbitrary size, are identifiable, provided the tree has at least 8\nleaves. If the tree topology is already known, then 7 leaves suffice for\nidentifiability of the numerical parameters. The method of proof involves first\ninferring a full distribution of both parsimony-informative and non-informative\npattern joint probabilities from the parsimony-informative ones, using\nphylogenetic invariants. The failure of identifiability of the tree parameter\nfor 4-taxon trees is also investigated.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 May 2009 00:41:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Dec 2009 20:54:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-12-20", "authors_parsed": [["Allman", "Elizabeth S.", ""], ["Holder", "Mark T.", ""], ["Rhodes", "John A.", ""]]}]
