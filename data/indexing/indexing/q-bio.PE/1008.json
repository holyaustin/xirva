We model the population dynamics in a \"refuge\" as a Markov\nprocess which involves births and deaths on discrete lattice sites and random\nmigrations between neighboring sites. In extinction scenario I the zero\npopulation size is a repelling fixed point of the on-site deterministic\ndynamics. In extinction scenario II the zero population size is an attracting\nfixed point, corresponding to what is known in ecology as Allee effect.\nAssuming a large population size, we develop WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin)\napproximation to the master equation. The resulting Hamilton's equations encode\nthe most probable path of the population toward extinction and the mean time to\nextinction. In the fast-migration limit these equations coincide, up to a\ncanonical transformation, with those obtained, in a different way, by Elgart\nand Kamenev (2004). We classify possible regimes of population extinction with\nand without an Allee effect and for different types of refuge and solve several\nexamples analytically and numerically. For a very strong Allee effect the\nextinction problem can be mapped into the over-damped limit of theory of\nhomogeneous nucleation due to Langer (1969). In this regime, and for very long\nsystems, we predict an optimal refuge size that maximizes the mean time to\nextinction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Aug 2010 11:32:37 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Nov 2010 09:44:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 28 Dec 2010 15:45:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 3 Jan 2011 08:56:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Meerson", "Baruch", ""], ["Sasorov", "Pavel V.", ""]]}]
