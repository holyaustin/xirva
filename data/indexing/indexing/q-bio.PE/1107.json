Although larval\nechinoderms are bilaterally symmetric, the adult body seems to abandon the\nlarval body plan and to develop independently a new structure with different\nsymmetries. The prevalent pentamer structure, the asymmetry of Loven's rule and\nthe variable location of the periproct and madrepore present enormous\ndifficulties in homologizing structures across the major clades, despite the\nexcellent fossil record. This irregularity in body forms seems to place\nechinoderms outside the other deuterostomes. Here I propose that the\npredominant five-ray structure is derived from a hexamer structure that is\ngrounded directly in the structure of the bilaterally symmetric larva. This\nhypothesis implies that the adult echinoderm body can be derived directly from\nthe larval bilateral symmetry and thus firmly ranks even the adult echinoderms\namong the bilaterians. In order to test the hypothesis rigorously, a model is\ndeveloped in which one ray is missing between rays IV-V (Loven's schema) or\nrays C-D (Carpenter's schema). The model is used to make predictions, which are\ntested and verified for the process of metamorphosis and for the morphology of\nrecent and fossil forms. The theory provides fundamental insight into the\nM-plane and the Ubisch', Loven's and Carpenter's planes and generalizes them\nfor all echinoderms.

However, a classical\napplication of these techniques to distances computed between samples can lack\ntransparency because there is no ready interpretation of the axes of classical\nPCA plots, and it is difficult to assign any clear intuitive meaning to either\nthe internal nodes or the edge lengths of trees produced by distance-based\nhierarchical clustering methods such as UPGMA. We show that more interesting\nand interpretable results are produced by two new methods that leverage the\nspecial structure of phylogenetic placement data. Edge principal components\nanalysis enables the detection of important differences between samples that\ncontain closely related taxa. Each principal component axis is simply a\ncollection of signed weights on the edges of the phylogenetic tree, and these\nweights are easily visualized by a suitable thickening and coloring of the\nedges. Squash clustering outputs a (rooted) clustering tree in which each\ninternal node corresponds to an appropriate \"average\" of the original samples\nat the leaves below the node. Moreover, the length of an edge is a suitably\ndefined distance between the averaged samples associated with the two incident\nnodes, rather than the less interpretable average of distances produced by\nUPGMA. We present these methods and illustrate their use with data from the\nmicrobiome of the human vagina.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jul 2011 23:39:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Matsen", "Frederick A.", ""], ["Evans", "Steven N.", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5192", "submitter": "Ingo Lohmar", "authors": "Ingo Lohmar and Baruch Meerson", "title": "Switching between phenotypes and population extinction", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures.

Analytical results are obtained both in the\nbiologically relevant regime when the switching is rare compared with the birth\nand death processes, and in the opposite regime of frequent switching.

Due to\nstrongly enhanced genetic drift at the advancing frontier, neutral and weakly\ndeleterious mutations can reach large frequencies in the newly colonized\nregions, as if they were surfing the front of the range expansion. These\nfindings raise the question of how frequently beneficial mutations successfully\nsurf at shifting range margins, thereby promoting adaptation towards a\nrange-expansion phenotype. Here, we use individual-based simulations to study\nthe surfing statistics of recurrent beneficial mutations on wave-like range\nexpansions in linear habitats. We show that the rate of surfing depends on two\nstrongly antagonistic factors, the probability of surfing given the spatial\nlocation of a novel mutation and the rate of occurrence of mutations at that\nlocation. The surfing probability strongly increases towards the tip of the\nwave. Novel mutations are unlikely to surf unless they enjoy a spatial head\nstart compared to the bulk of the population. The needed head start is shown to\nbe proportional to the inverse fitness of the mutant type, and only weakly\ndependent on the carrying capacity. The second factor is the mutation\noccurrence which strongly decreases towards the tip of the wave. Thus, most\nsuccessful mutations arise at an intermediate position in the front of the\nwave. We present an analytic theory for the tradeoff between these factors that\nallows to predict how frequently substitutions by beneficial mutations occur at\ninvasion fronts. We find that small amounts of genetic drift increase the\nfixation rate of beneficial mutations at the advancing front, and thus could be\nimportant for adaptation during species invasions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 11:03:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 3 Aug 2011 14:44:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 14 Feb 2012 06:49:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Lehe", "Remi", ""], ["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""], ["Peliti", "Luca", ""]]}]
