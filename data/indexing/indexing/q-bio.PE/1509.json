While selective targeting of hotspots of\ntransmission has been proposed as a strategy for malaria control, such\ntargeting has not been tested in the context of malaria elimination. Using\nhousehold locations, demographics, and prevalence data from a survey of four\nhealth facility catchment areas in southern Zambia and an agent-based model of\nmalaria transmission and immunity acquisition, a transmission intensity was fit\nto each household based on neighborhood age-dependent malaria prevalence. A set\nof individual infection trajectories was constructed for every household in\neach catchment area, accounting for heterogeneous exposure and immunity.\nVarious campaign strategies (mass drug administration, mass screen and treat,\nfocal mass drug administration, snowball reactive case detection, pooled\nsampling, and a hypothetical serological diagnostic) were simulated and\nevaluated for performance at finding infections, minimizing overtreatment,\nreducing clinical case counts, and interrupting transmission. For malaria\ncontrol, presumptive treatment leads to substantial overtreatment without\nadditional morbidity reduction under all but the highest transmission\nconditions. Selective targeting of hotspots with drug campaigns is an\nineffective tool for elimination due to limited sensitivity of available field\ndiagnostics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 15:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gerardin", "Jaline", ""], ["Bever", "Caitlin A.", ""], ["Hamainza", "Busiku", ""], ["Miller", "John M.", ""], ["Eckhoff", "Philip A.", ""], ["Wenger", "Edward A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.00801", "submitter": "Samuel Scarpino", "authors": "Samuel V.

This broader description\nof the nature of social dynamics allows to compare the evolution of cooperation\namong kin and non-kin, intra- and inter-specific cooperation, co-evolution, the\nemergence of symbioses, of social synergies, and the emergence of division of\nlabor. EIFT promotes interdisciplinary cross fertilization of ideas by allowing\nto describe the role for division of labor in the emergence of social\nsynergies, providing an integrated framework for the study of both, biological\nevolution of social behavior and economic market dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 12:18:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 19:26:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Jaffe", "Klaus", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.02824", "submitter": "Mitchell Newberry", "authors": "Mitchell G Newberry, Daniel B Ennis, Van M Savage", "title": "Testing Foundations of Biological Scaling Theory Using Automated\n  Measurements of Vascular Networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "PLoS Comput Biol 11(8): e1004455", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004455", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.TO q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Scientists have long sought to understand how vascular networks supply blood\nand oxygen to cells throughout the body.

Compared to classical\nreaction-diffusion models, this framework allows us to more realistically\ndescribe the situation where movement of individuals occurs on a faster time\nscale than the demographic (population) time scale, and we cannot determine\npopulation growth based on local density. However, most of the results reported\nso far for such systems have only been verified numerically and for a\nparticular choice of model functions, which obviously casts doubts about these\nfindings. In this paper, we analyse a class of integro-differential\npredator-prey models with a highly mobile predator in a heterogeneous\nenvironment, and we reveal the main factors stabilizing such systems. In\nparticular, we explore an ecologically relevant case of interactions in a\nhighly eutrophic environment, where the prey carrying capacity can be formally\nset to 'infinity'. We investigate two main scenarios: (i) the spatial gradient\nof the growth rate is due to abiotic factors only, and (ii) the local growth\nrate depends on the global density distribution across the environment (e.g.\ndue to non-local self-shading). For an arbitrary spatial gradient of the prey\ngrowth rate, we analytically investigate the possibility of the predator-prey\nequilibrium in such systems and we explore the conditions of stability of this\nequilibrium. In particular, we demonstrate that for a Holling type I (linear)\nfunctional response, the predator can stabilize the system at low prey density\neven for an 'unlimited' carrying capacity. We conclude that the interplay\nbetween spatial heterogeneity in the prey growth and fast displacement of the\npredator across the habitat works as an efficient stabilizing mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 15:20:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-03-06", "authors_parsed": [["Farkas", "Jozsef Z.", ""], ["Morozov", "Andrew Yu", ""], ["Arashkevich", "E.

Numerical simulations are carried out to\nhighlight the effects of residence times on disease prevalence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 19:15:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 14 Mar 2017 22:15:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bichara", "Derdei", ""], ["Castillo-Chavez", "Carlos", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.08924", "submitter": "Anshul Choudhary", "authors": "Anshul Choudhary, Sudeshna Sinha", "title": "Balance of interactions determines optimal survival in multi-species\n  communities", "comments": "19 Pages(single column), 9 Figures, Submitted", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0145278", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a multi-species community modelled as a complex network of\npopulations, where the links are given by a random asymmetric matrix J, with\nfraction 1-C of zero entries, where C reflects the over-all connectivity of the\nsystem. The non-zero elements of J are drawn from a gaussian distribution with\nmean 'mu' and standard deviation . The signs of the elements J reflect the\nnature of density-dependent interactions, such as predatory-prey, mutualism or\ncompetition, and their magnitudes reflect the strength of the interaction. In\nthis study we try to uncover the broad features of the interspecies\ninteractions that determine the global robustness of this network, as indicated\nby the average number of active nodes (i.e. non-extinct species) in the\nnetwork, and the total population, reflecting the biomass yield. We find that\nthe network transitions from a completely extinct system to one where all nodes\nare active, as the mean interaction strength goes from negative to positive. We\nalso find that the total population, displays distinct non-monotonic scaling\nbehaviour with respect to the product 'mu'C, implying that survival is\ndependent not merely on the number of links, but rather on the combination of\nthe sparseness of the connectivity matrix and the net interaction strength.\nMoreover, the total population levels are optimal when the network has\nintermediate net positive connection strengths. At the local level we observe\nmarked qualitative changes in dynamical patterns, ranging from anti-phase\nclusters of period 2 cycles and chaotic bands, to fixed points, under the\nvariation of mean 'mu' of the interaction strengths. Lastly, we propose an\neffective low dimensional map to capture the behavior of the entire network,\nand this provides a broad understanding of the interplay of the local dynamical\npatterns and the global robustness trends in the network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 12:22:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Choudhary", "Anshul", ""], ["Sinha", "Sudeshna", ""]]}, {"id": "1509.09285", "submitter": "Mallenahalli Naresh Kumar Prof. Dr.", "authors": "C.
