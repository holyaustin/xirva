The competitive exclusion principle states that the number of\ncoexisting species is limited by the number of resources, or by the species'\nsimilarity in resource use. Natural systems such as the extreme diversity of\nunicellular life in the oceans provide counter examples. It is known that\nmathematical models incorporating population fluctuations can lead to\nviolations of the exclusion principle. Here we use simple eco-evolutionary\nmodels to show that a certain type of population dynamics, boom-bust dynamics,\ncan allow for the evolution of much larger amounts of diversity than would be\nexpected with stable equilibrium dynamics. Boom-bust dynamics are characterized\nby long periods of almost exponential growth (boom) and a subsequent population\ncrash due to competition (bust). When such ecological dynamics are incorporated\ninto an evolutionary model that allows for adaptive diversification in\ncontinuous phenotype spaces, desynchronization of the boom-bust cycles of\ncoexisting species can lead to the maintenance of high levels of diversity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Nov 2020 19:41:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Doebeli", "Michael", ""], ["Jaque", "Eduardo Cancino", ""], ["Ispolatov", "Iaroslav", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.00072", "submitter": "Jay Lennon", "authors": "Jay T.

This study quantifies the\nconsequences of global warming on the risk of epidemics of viruses transmitted\nby the Aedes Albopictus mosquito in metropolitan France. This mosquito, which\nis a vector for the Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika viruses, among others, arrived\nin mainland France in 2004 and has since spread throughout the country. Thanks\nto the association previously established between the probability of the\npresence of the mosquito and the average temperature combined with a\nmathematical model, the probability of an epidemic and the number of people who\ncould be infected and die during a season in each department are estimated. If\nthere is a high degree of heterogeneity in metropolitan France, nearly 2,000\ndeaths per year could be expected by 2040.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 13 Nov 2020 15:05:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Drif", "Yannick", "", "IRD"], ["Roche", "Benjamin", "", "IRD"], ["Valade", "Pierre", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.06556", "submitter": "Julie Rowlett", "authors": "Susanne Menden-Deuer and Julie Rowlett", "title": "Many ways to stay in the game: Individual variability maintains high\n  biodiversity in planktonic micro-organisms", "comments": "This is a preliminary version of the manuscript published in Journal\n  of the Royal Society Interfaces and freely available online!", "journal-ref": "J.

Seasonal forcing is predominantly modelled as a sine\nwave but the transition between seasons is often more sudden. Some studies\nmentioned the robustness of their results to the shape of the forcing signal,\nwithout detailed analyses. Therefore, whether and how the shape of seasonal\nforcing affects the dynamics of coupled dynamical systems remains unclear,\nwhile abrupt seasonal transitions are widespread in ecological systems. To\nprovide some answers, we conduct a numerical analysis of the dynamical response\nof predator--prey communities to the shape of the forcing signal by exploring\nthe joint effect of two features of seasonal forcing: the magnitude of the\nsignal, which is classically the only one studied, and the shape of the signal,\nabrupt or sinusoidal. We consider both linear and saturating functional\nresponses, and focus on seasonal forcing of the predator's discovery rate,\nwhich fluctuates with changing environmental conditions and prey's ability to\nescape predation. Our numerical results highlight that a more abrupt seasonal\nforcing mostly alters the magnitude of population fluctuations and triggers\nperiod--doubling bifurcations, as well as the emergence of chaos, at lower\nforcing strength than for sine waves. Controlling the variance of the forcing\nsignal mitigates this trend but does not fully suppress it, which suggests that\nthe variance is not the only feature of the shape of seasonal forcing that acts\non community dynamics. Although theoretical studies may predict correctly the\nsequence of bifurcations using sine waves as a representation of seasonality,\nthere is a rationale for applied studies to implement as realistic seasonal\nforcing as possible to make precise predictions of community dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:58:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-15", "authors_parsed": [["Sauve", "Alix M.

In this paper\nwe present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and\nforecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data,\nreported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care\noccupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering\ntechnique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases,\ncritical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and\nSeptember-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model\nhospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the\nrecorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the\nHealth Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were\nconstant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the\nreproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase\nagain from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over\nSummer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to\nprovide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very\ngood for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the\npandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers\nin September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the\nepidemic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 22 Dec 2020 22:27:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wells", "Jonathan", ""], ["Robertson", "Chris", ""], ["Marmara", "Vincent", ""], ["Yeung", "Alan", ""], ["Kleczkowski", "Adam", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.12400", "submitter": "Derrick VanGennep", "authors": "Chen Shen, Derrick Van Gennep, Alexander F.

While the former is determined by the immunity of an\nindividual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to\nthe infection. We model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a\ngeneralized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the\nsusceptibility and infectivity distributions to understand their combined\neffects, which appear to remain inadequately addressed till date. We consider\nthe coupling between $\\sigma_{inh}$ and $\\iota_{ext}$ through a new Critical\nInfection Parameter (CIP) ($\\gamma_c$). We find that the neglect of these\ndistributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation of the\namount of infection in a population, which leads to incorrect (higher)\nestimates of the infections required to achieve the herd immunity threshold.\nAdditionally, we include the effects of seeding of infection in a population by\nlong-range migration. We solve the resulting master equations by performing\nKinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our\nsimulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic.\nThe latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of\nsusceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly\ndifferent from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these\nadditional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating\nsystem where the disease cluster survives by migrating from region to region.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2020 06:04:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mukherjee", "Saumyak", ""], ["Mondal", "Sayantan", ""], ["Bagchi", "Biman", ""]]}, {"id": "2012.15155", "submitter": "Josef Tkadlec", "authors": "Jakub Svoboda, Josef Tkadlec, Andreas Pavlogiannis, Krishnendu\n  Chatterjee, Martin A.
