The result of this contest is an arrested\nnonequilibrium phase separation in which dense droplets or rings become\nseparated by less dense regions, with a characteristic steady-state length\nscale. Cell division mainly occurs in the dilute regions and cell death in the\ndense ones, with a continuous flux between these sustained by the diffusivity\ngradient.

Unfortunately, tRNA genes in Metazoan mitochondria\nhave proved to be problematic because they often vary in number (genes missing\nor duplicated) and also in the secondary structure of the transcribed tRNAs (T\nor D arms missing). I have performed a series of comparative analyses of the\ntRNA genes of a broad range of Metazoan mitogenomes in order to address this\nissue. I conclude that no single computer program is necessarily capable of\nfinding all of the tRNA genes in any given mitogenome, and that use of both the\nARWEN and DOGMA programs is sometimes necessary because they produce\ncomplementary false negatives. There are apparently a very large number of\nerroneous annotations in the databased mitogenome sequences, including missed\ngenes, wrongly annotated locations, false complements, and inconsistent\ncriteria for assigning the 5' and 3' boundaries; and I have listed many of\nthese. The extent of overlap between genes is often greatly exaggerated due to\ninconsistent annotations, although notable overlaps involving tRNAs are\napparently real. Finally, three novel hypotheses were examined and found to\nhave support from the comparative analyses: (1) some organisms have mitogenomic\nlocations that simultaneously code for multiple tRNAs; (2) some organisms have\nmitogenomic locations that simultaneously code for tRNAs and proteins (but not\nrRNAs); and (3) one group of nematodes has several genes that code for tRNAs\nlacking both the D and T arms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Jan 2010 14:33:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 3 Feb 2012 13:46:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-06", "authors_parsed": [["Morrison", "David A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1001.3826", "submitter": "Gustav Delius", "authors": "Samik Datta, Gustav W.
