We examined whether there is\nless selection against exonization of transposed elements in duplicated genes\nthan in single-copy genes. Results: Genome-wide analysis of exonization of\ntransposed elements revealed a higher rate of exonization within duplicated\ngenes relative to single-copy genes. The gene for TIF-IA, an RNA polymerase I\ntranscription initiation factor, underwent a humanoid-specific triplication,\nall three copies of the gene are active transcriptionally, although only one\ncopy retains the ability to generate the TIF-IA protein. Prior to TIF-IA\ntriplication, an Alu element was inserted into the first intron. In one of the\nnon-protein coding copies, this Alu is exonized. We identified a single point\nmutation leading to exonization in one of the gene duplicates. When this\nmutation was introduced into the TIF-IA coding copy, exonization was activated\nand the level of the protein-coding mRNA was reduced substantially. A very low\nlevel of exonization was detected in normal human cells. However, this\nexonization was abundant in most leukemia cell lines evaluated, although the\ngenomic sequence is unchanged in these cancerous cells compared to normal\ncells. Conclusion: The definition of the Alu element within the TIF-IA gene as\nan exon is restricted to certain types of cancers; the element is not exonized\nin normal human cells. These results further our understanding of the delicate\ninterplay between gene duplication and alternative splicing and of the\nmolecular evolutionary mechanisms leading to genetic innovations. This implies\nthe existence of purifying selection against exonization in single copy genes,\nwith duplicate genes free from such constrains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Nov 2008 10:45:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-11-24", "authors_parsed": [["Amit", "Maayan", ""], ["Sela", "Noa", ""], ["Keren", "Hadas", ""], ["Melamed", "Zeev", ""], ["Muler", "Inna", ""], ["Shomron", "Noam", ""], ["Izraeli", "Shai", ""], ["Ast", "Gil", ""]]}, {"id": "0811.3508", "submitter": "Noa Sela", "authors": "Noa Sela, Adi Stern, Wojciech Makalowski, Tal Pupko, Gil Ast", "title": "Transduplication resulted in the incorporation of two protein-coding\n  sequences into the Turmoil-1 transposable element of C. elegans", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Biology Direct 2008, 3:41", "doi": "10.1186/1745-6150-3-41", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transposable elements may acquire unrelated gene fragments into their\nsequences in a process called transduplication.
