T-cell receptor diversity,\nor the extent of pathogen-derived antigen responsiveness of the T-cell pool, is\nknown to diminish with age, but inherent experimental difficulties preclude\naccurate analysis on the full organismal level. In this paper, we formulate a\nmechanistic mathematical model of T-cell population dynamics on the\nimmunoclonal subpopulation level, which provides quantitative estimates of\ndiversity. We define different estimates for diversity that depend on the\nindividual number of cells in a specific immunoclone.

An analytical expression, which defines a function\nof the quotient $\\alpha$ between the transmission and recovery rates, is\nobtained to approximate this threshold. We then performed different analyses\nbased on intensive stochastic simulations and found that this expression is\nalso a good estimate for a similar threshold value of $p$ obtained in the\nstochastic model. The dynamics of the average number of infected individuals\nand the average size of outbreaks show a behavior across the threshold that is\nwell described by the deterministic approximation. The distributions of the\noutbreak sizes at the threshold present common features for all the cases\nconsidered corresponding to different values of $\\alpha>1$. These features are\notherwise already known to hold for the standard stochastic SIR model at its\nthreshold, $\\alpha=1$: (i) the probability of having an outbreak of size $n$\ngoes asymptotically as $n^{-3/2}$ for an infinite system, (ii) the maximal size\nof an outbreak scales as $N^{2/3}$ for a finite system of size $N$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 23 Jan 2019 19:54:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2019 02:43:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 16 Oct 2019 11:46:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Fabricius", "Gabriel", ""], ["Maltz", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.08229", "submitter": "Sidney Redner", "authors": "Deepak Bhat, Jordi Pi\\~nero, S.

The main production system in this area is sheep farming, which due\nto wrong historical management has led to desertification of the habitat, with\nimpact on both native wildlife and livestock. Particularly the largest native\nherbivore, the guanaco, has reflected in their numbers this alteration induced\nin the environment. We analyze a mathematical model that captures the main\ncharacteristics of the interaction between sheep and guanaco: the hierarchical\ncompetition and the advantage granted by humans to the herds, and also\nincorporates a dynamic for the habitat. Using the metapopulation formalism, the\ntrophic web of two herbivores is extended over a patchy landscape that\nconsiders two characteristic times for the dynamics of the resource. Our study\nstresses the dependence of the metapopulations dynamics on the recovery time of\nthe resource. These results are backed up by a deterministic mean field model\nwhich shares some similarities with the stochastic and spatially extended one.\nWe find different regimes depending on the parameters considered: coexistence\nof both species, survival of a single species and extinction of the other, and\nextinction of both. Remarkably, in some regions of parameters space we detect\nthe presence of periodical spatio-temporal patterns, with persistent\noscillations of constant amplitude. Based on these results, we perform a\ncharacterization of the observed scenarios in order to gain insight about the\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2019 12:55:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["C.", "Y.
