Home quarantine\nis the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to\nestimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into\nseven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and\nofficially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model\nis given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the\ntransmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend\nof the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role\nin controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The\ncontrol reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and\ndiscussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is\nin decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human\ntransmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may\nbecome a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease\nis still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the\nvirus and the meteorological conditions.

The related theoretical and numerical\nanalysis of the most fit model indicate that (a) the survival of honeybee\ncolonies requires a large queen egg-laying rate and smaller values of the other\nlife history parameter values in addition to proper initial condition; (b) both\nbrood and adult bee populations are increasing with respect to the increase in\nthe {egg-laying rate} and the decreasing in other parameter values; and (c)\nseasonality may promote/suppress the survival of the honeybee colony.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Mar 2020 03:34:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-24", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Jun", ""], ["Messan", "Komi", ""], ["Messan", "Marisabel Rodriguez", ""], ["DeGrandi-Hoffman", "Gloria", ""], ["Bai", "Dingyong", ""], ["Kang", "Yun", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.09800", "submitter": "Momiao Xiong", "authors": "Zixin Hu, Qiyang Ge, Shudi Li, Eric Boerwincle, Li Jin, and Momiao\n  Xiong", "title": "Forecasting and evaluating intervention of Covid-19 in the World", "comments": "28 pages, 5 figures and 5 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with\n  arXiv:2002.07112", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  When the Covid-19 pandemic enters dangerous new phase, whether and when to\ntake aggressive public health interventions to slow down the spread of\nCOVID-19.

Recent work on the spread of interacting\ncontagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can\nhave counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one\nof these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of\nawareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered,\ncliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the\nawareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing\nits transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to\nbe infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the\nawareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected\nindividual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to\nthe disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network\nclustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to\nsustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This\ncounter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that\nrandom networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts.\nTo further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on\na two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary\ninfections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net\neffect of clustering and co-infection varies.

We present a new procedure, the Purified by Unified Resampling of\nInfected Multitudes, in short Purim, able to untangle any massive candidate\nsample with inexpensive screening, through the cross-correlated analysis of the\njoint speciments. This procedure can reveal and detect most negative patients\nand in most cases discover the identity of the few positives already in the\nfirst or few secondary tests. We investigate the the two-dimensional\ncorrelation case in function of the infection probability. The\nmulti-dimensional topology, the scaled Purim procedure are also considered.\nExtensive Purim tests may measure and weight the degree of epidemic: their\noutcome may identify focal regions in the early stages. Assuming hundreds or\nthousand subjects, the saving both in time and in cost will be remarkable.\nPurim may be able to filter scheduled flights, scholar acceptance, popular\ninternational event participants. The optimal extension of Purim outcome is\ngrowing as the inverse of the epidemia expansion.

They are applied to study the\nspreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the\ncumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally\naccepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However\n$N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not\ndetected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time\nseries of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the\ninfectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which\nincludes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic\nindividuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The\nsolution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$\ncoming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit\nreference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$\ntakes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which\npermits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The\nmodel is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an\nexponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more\nrecent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is\nreliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the\ntotal infected population.

This may have consequences and shed light in the efficiency of\npolicies once the phenomenon is over.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Mar 2020 16:18:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2020 16:15:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 6 Apr 2020 09:43:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 22 Apr 2020 10:57:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Barmparis", "G.
