Functionally\nsimilar proteins can differ substantially in their robustness to mutations and\ncapacity to evolve new functions, but it has remained unclear whether any of\nthese differences might be due to evolutionary selection for these properties.\n  RESULTS: Here we use laboratory experiments to demonstrate that evolution\nfavors protein mutational robustness if the evolving population is sufficiently\nlarge. We neutrally evolve cytochrome P450 proteins under identical selection\npressures and mutation rates in populations of different sizes, and show that\nproteins from the larger and thus more polymorphic population tend towards\nhigher mutational robustness. Proteins from the larger population also evolve\ngreater stability, a biophysical property that is known to enhance both\nmutational robustness and evolvability. The excess mutational robustness and\nstability is well described by existing mathematical theories, and can be\nquantitatively related to the way that the proteins occupy their neutral\nnetwork.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Our work is the first experimental demonstration of the general\ntendency of evolution to favor mutational robustness and protein stability in\nhighly polymorphic populations. We suggest that this phenomenon may contribute\nto the mutational robustness and evolvability of viruses and bacteria that\nexist in large populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Apr 2007 19:42:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Bloom", "Jesse D.", ""], ["Lu", "Zhongyi", ""], ["Chen", "David", ""], ["Raval", "Alpan", ""], ["Venturelli", "Ophelia S.", ""], ["Arnold", "Frances H.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.1912", "submitter": "Adrian Melott", "authors": "L.C.

Moreover, this is facilitated by local\ncomponents that have low structural complexity, but high generality. In effect,\nthe finitary process soup spontaneously evolves a selection pressure that\nfavors such components. In light of the finitary process soup's generality,\nthese results suggest a fundamental law of hierarchical systems: global\ncomplexity requires local simplicity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2007 02:47:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Gornerup", "Olof", ""], ["Crutchfield", "James P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3808", "submitter": "Jakob Enemark", "authors": "Jakob Enemark and Kim Sneppen", "title": "On Gene Duplication Models for Evolving Regulatory Networks", "comments": "14 pages, 7 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/2007/11/P11007", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.OT", "license": null, "abstract": "  Background: Duplication of genes is important for evolution of molecular\nnetworks. Many authors have therefore considered gene duplication as a driving\nforce in shaping the topology of molecular networks. In particular it has been\nnoted that growth via duplication would act as an implicit way of preferential\nattachment, and thereby provide the observed broad degree distributions of\nmolecular networks.\n  Results: We extend current models of gene duplication and rewiring by\nincluding directions and the fact that molecular networks are not a result of\nunidirectional growth. We introduce upstream sites and downstream shapes to\nquantify potential links during duplication and rewiring. We find that this in\nitself generates the observed scaling of transcription factors for genome sites\nin procaryotes. The dynamical model can generate a scale-free degree\ndistribution, p(k)&prop; 1/k^&gamma;, with exponent &gamma;=1 in the\nnon-growing case, and with &gamma;>1 when the network is growing.\n  Conclusions: We find that duplication of genes followed by substantial\nrecombination of upstream regions could generate main features of genetic\nregulatory networks. Our steady state degree distribution is however to broad\nto be consistent with data, thereby suggesting that selective pruning acts as a\nmain additional constraint on duplicated genes. Our analysis shows that gene\nduplication can only be a main cause for the observed broad degree\ndistributions, if there is also substantial recombinations between upstream\nregions of genes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 28 Apr 2007 16:16:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 Jul 2007 10:06:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Enemark", "Jakob", ""], ["Sneppen", "Kim", ""]]}, {"id": "0704.3826", "submitter": "Mark Ya.
