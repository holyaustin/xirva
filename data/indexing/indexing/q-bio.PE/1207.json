In our\nperspective, a proper quantitative understanding of these genes is required to\njustify or nullify whether a given sequence is a Human X or Y chromosomal gene.\nIn this paper, some of the X and Y chromosomal genes have been quantified in\ngenomic and proteomic level through Fractal Geometric and Mathematical\nMorphometric analysis. Using the proposed quantitative model, one can easily\nmake probable justification or deterministic nullification whether a given\nsequence of nucleotides is a probable Human X or Y chromosomal gene or not,\nwithout seeking any biological experiment. Of course, a further biological\nexperiment is essential to validate it as the probable Human X or Y chromosomal\ngene homologue. This study would enable Biologists to understand these genes in\nmore quantitative manner instead of their qualitative features.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 04:20:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 04:13:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hassan", "Sk.

Ingroup favoritism is\nanother aspect of human cooperation, whereby individuals help members in their\nown group more often than those in other groups. Ingroup favoritism is a puzzle\nfor the theory of cooperation because it is not easily evolutionarily stable.\nIn the context of indirect reciprocity, ingroup favoritism has been shown to be\na consequence of employing a double standard when assigning reputations to\ningroup and outgroup members; e.g., helping an ingroup member is regarded as\ngood, whereas the same action toward an outgroup member is regarded as bad. We\nanalyze a model of indirect reciprocity in which information sharing is\nconducted groupwise. In our model, individuals play social dilemma games within\nand across groups, and the information about their reputations is shared within\neach group. We show that evolutionarily stable ingroup favoritism emerges even\nif all the players use the same reputation assignment rule regardless of group\n(i.e., a single standard). Two reputation assignment rules called simple\nstanding and stern judging yield ingroup favoritism. Stern judging induces much\nstronger ingroup favoritism than does simple standing. Simple standing and\nstern judging are evolutionarily stable against each other when groups\nemploying different assignment rules compete and the number of groups is\nsufficiently large. In addition, we analytically show as a limiting case that\nhomogeneous populations of reciprocators that use reputations are unstable when\nindividuals independently infer reputations of individuals, which is consistent\nwith previously reported numerical results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2012 11:38:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 18 Nov 2012 11:42:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Nakamura", "Mitsuhiro", ""], ["Masuda", "Naoki", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.5684", "submitter": "Richard A Neher", "authors": "Vitaly V.

HIV infection elicits a vigorous immune response\nstarting about 2-3 weeks post infection that can lower the amount of virus in\nthe body, but which cannot eradicate the virus. How HIV establishes a chronic\ninfection in the face of a strong immune response remains poorly understood. It\nhas been shown that HIV is able to rapidly change its proteins via mutation to\nevade recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Typically,\nan HIV-infected patient will generate 4-12 CTL responses specific for parts of\nviral proteins called epitopes. Such CTL responses lead to strong selective\npressure to change the viral sequences encoding these epitopes so as to avoid\nCTL recognition. Here we review experimental data on HIV evolution in response\nto CTL pressure, mathematical models developed to explain this evolution, and\nhighlight problems associated with the data and previous modeling efforts. We\nshow that estimates of the strength of the epitope-specific CTL response depend\non the method used to fit models to experimental data and on the assumptions\nmade regarding how mutants are generated during infection. We illustrate that\nallowing CTL responses to decay over time may improve the fit to experimental\ndata and provides higher estimates of the killing efficacy of HIV-specific\nCTLs. We also propose a novel method for simultaneously estimating the killing\nefficacy of multiple CTL populations specific for different epitopes of HIV\nusing stochastic simulations. Lastly, we show that current estimates of the\nefficacy at which HIV-specific CTLs clear virus-infected cells can be improved\nby more frequent sampling of viral sequences and by combining data on sequence\nevolution with experimentally measured CTL dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Jul 2012 13:11:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-05", "authors_parsed": [["Ganusov", "Vitaly V.", ""], ["Neher", "Richard A.", ""], ["Perelson", "Alan S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.6090", "submitter": "Steven Kelk", "authors": "Teresa Piovesan and Steven Kelk", "title": "A simple fixed parameter tractable algorithm for computing the\n  hybridization number of two (not necessarily binary) trees", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM math.CO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Here we present a new fixed parameter tractable algorithm to compute the\nhybridization number r of two rooted, not necessarily binary phylogenetic trees\non taxon set X in time (6^r.r!).poly(n)$, where n=|X|.

Furthermore, A and B voters can\nbecome (susceptible) centrists C with a rate 1. The resulting competition\nbetween commitment and persuasion is studied in the mean field limit and for a\nfinite population on a complete graph. At mean field level, there is a\ncontinuous transition from a coexistence phase when\nzeta<Delta_c=delta_A/(1+delta_A) to a phase where centrism prevails when zeta>=\nDelta_c. In a finite population of size N, demographic fluctuations lead to\ncentrism consensus and the dynamics is characterized by the mean consensus time\ntau. Because of the competition between commitment and persuasion, here\nconsensus is reached much slower (zeta<Delta_c) or faster (zeta>=Delta_c) than\nin the absence of zealots (when tau\\simN).

The dynamics\nis thus characterized by a metastable state where the most persuasive voters\nand centrists coexist when delta_A>delta_B, whereas all species coexist when\ndelta_A=delta_B.

As a tool for\ndistinguishing complex microbial communities, ARISA closely approximates the\nresults obtained from DNA sequencing at a fraction of the cost; however ARISA\nfails to reproduce the sequencing results perfectly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 17:56:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-31", "authors_parsed": [["Reid", "Robert W.", ""], ["Spencer", "Melanie D.", ""], ["Hamp", "Timothy J.", ""], ["Fodor", "Anthony A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1207.7034", "submitter": "Steven Kelk", "authors": "Steven Kelk and Celine Scornavacca", "title": "Towards the fixed parameter tractability of constructing minimal\n  phylogenetic networks from arbitrary sets of nonbinary trees", "comments": "have fixed a number of small typo's etc", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.CC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It has remained an open question for some time whether, given a set of not\nnecessarily binary (i.e. \"nonbinary\") trees T on a set of taxa X, it is\npossible to determine in time f(r).poly(m) whether there exists a phylogenetic\nnetwork that displays all the trees in T, where r refers to the reticulation\nnumber of the network and m=|X|+|T|. Here we show that this holds if one or\nboth of the following conditions holds: (1) |T| is bounded by a function of r;\n(2) the maximum degree of the nodes in T is bounded by a function of r. These\nsufficient conditions absorb and significantly extend known special cases,\nnamely when all the trees in T are binary, or T contains exactly two nonbinary\ntrees. We believe this result is an important step towards settling the issue\nfor an arbitrarily large and complex set of nonbinary trees. For completeness\nwe show that the problem is certainly solveable in polynomial time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Jul 2012 18:41:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Aug 2012 16:08:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kelk", "Steven", ""], ["Scornavacca", "Celine", ""]]}]
