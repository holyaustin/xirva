The shape and structure of the group is the effect\nof simple interaction rules among individuals: each animal deploys itself\ndepending on the position of a limited number of close group mates. The\nproposed model is shown to produce clustered formations, as well as lines and\nV-like formations. The key factors which trigger the onset of different\npatterns are argued to be the relative strength of attraction and repulsion\nforces and, most important, the anisotropy in their application.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Mar 2009 12:05:06 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2009 21:23:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 8 Oct 2009 15:46:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2009 13:07:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Tue, 26 Jan 2010 13:33:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-18", "authors_parsed": [["Cristiani", "Emiliano", ""], ["Frasca", "Paolo", ""], ["Piccoli", "Benedetto", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4254", "submitter": "Dongwoo Sheen", "authors": "Shaban Aly, Imbunm Kim, Dongwoo Sheen", "title": "Turing Instability for a Ratio-Dependent Predator-Prey Model with\n  Diffusion", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Applied Mathematics and Computation 217 (17), 2011, 7265-7281", "doi": "10.1016/j.amc.2011.02.018", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS math.CA q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ratio-dependent predator-prey models have been increasingly favored by field\necologists where predator-prey interactions have to be taken into account the\nprocess of predation search. In this paper we study the conditions of the\nexistence and stability properties of the equilibrium solutions in a\nreaction-diffusion model in which predator mortality is neither a constant nor\nan unbounded function, but it is increasing with the predator abundance. We\nshow that analytically at a certain critical value a diffusion driven (Turing\ntype) instability occurs, i.e. the stationary solution stays stable with\nrespect to the kinetic system (the system without diffusion). We also show that\nthe stationary solution becomes unstable with respect to the system with\ndiffusion and that Turing bifurcation takes place: a spatially non-homogenous\n(non-constant) solution (structure or pattern) arises. A numerical scheme that\npreserve the positivity of the numerical solutions and the boundedness of prey\nsolution will be presented. Numerical examples are also included.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Mar 2009 08:27:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-03-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aly", "Shaban", ""], ["Kim", "Imbunm", ""], ["Sheen", "Dongwoo", ""]]}, {"id": "0903.4603", "submitter": "Emory F.
