This leads to one of the\nfundamental problems of conservation ecology: how should we harvest a\npopulation so that economic gain is maximized, while also ensuring that the\nspecies is safe from extinction? We study an ecosystem of interacting species\nthat are influenced by random environmental fluctuations. At any point in time,\nwe can either harvest or seed (repopulate) species. Harvesting brings an\neconomic gain while seeding incurs a cost. The problem is to find the optimal\nharvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from\nharvesting minus the cost one has to pay for the seeding of various species. We\nconsider what happens when one, or both, of the seeding and harvesting rates\nare bounded. The focus of this paper is the analysis of these three novel\nsettings: bounded seeding and infinite harvesting, bounded seeding and bounded\nharvesting, and infinite seeding and bounded harvesting.\n  We prove analytical results and develop numerical approximation methods. By\nimplementing these approximations, we are able to gain qualitative information\nabout how to best harvest and seed species. We are able to show that in the\nsingle species setting there are thresholds $0<L_1<L_2<\\infty$ such that: 1) if\nthe population size is `low', so that it lies in $(0, L_1]$, there is seeding\nusing the maximal seeding rate; 2) if the population size `moderate', so that\nit lies in $(L_1,L_2)$, there is no harvesting or seeding; 3) if the population\nsize is `high', so that it lies in the interval $[L_2, \\infty)$, there is\nharvesting using the maximal harvesting rate. Once we have a system with at\nleast two species, numerical experiments show that constant threshold\nstrategies are not optimal anymore.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 2 Nov 2019 15:21:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Hening", "Alexandru", ""], ["Tran", "Ky", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.00755", "submitter": "Fernando Racimo", "authors": "Fernando Racimo, Martin Sikora, Hannes Schroeder, Carles Lalueza-Fox", "title": "Beyond broad strokes: sociocultural insights from the study of ancient\n  genomes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The amount of sequence data obtained from ancient samples has dramatically\nexpanded in the last decade, and so have the types of questions that can now be\naddressed using ancient DNA.

We further demonstrate that if\nthe period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial\npopulation goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not\nrescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is\neradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations.\nRescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if\nthey appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment.

We tested a suite of\ntraditionally-used and new biodiversity measures on simulated ecosystems\nagainst a range of different scenarios of population decline, invasion and\nhabitat loss. We found that the response of biodiversity measures was generally\nstronger in larger, more heterogeneous habitats than in smaller or homogeneous\nhabitats. We were also able to detect signals of increasing homogenisation in\nclimate change scenarios, which contradicted the signal of increased\nheterogeneity and distinctiveness through habitat loss.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2019 16:24:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-28", "authors_parsed": [["Harris", "Claire L.", ""], ["Cobbold", "Christina A.", ""], ["Brummitt", "Neil", ""], ["Reeve", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.12494", "submitter": "Conrad Burden", "authors": "Claus Vogl, Lynette C.

Due to the lack of theoretical\nfoundations, most of the studies that considered how the evolution of\ntransportation networks impacts the population growth are based on regression\nanalysis in order to identify relevant variables. The recent availability of\nlarge amounts of data allows us to envision the construction of new approaches\nfor understanding this coupling between transport and population growth. Here,\nwe use a detailed dataset for about 36000 municipalities in France from 1968\nuntil now. In the case of large urban areas such as Paris, we show that growth\nrate statistical variations decay in time and display a trend towards\nhomogeneization where local aspects are less relevant. We also show that growth\nrate differences due to accessibility are very small and can mostly be observed\nfor cities that experienced very large accessibility variations. This suggests\nthat the relevant variable for explaining growth rate variations is not the\naccessibility but its temporal variation. We propose a model that integrates\nthe stochastic internal variation of the municipalitie's population and an\ninter-urban migration term that we show to be proportional to the accessibility\nvariation and has a limited time duration. This model provides a simple\ntheoretical framework that allows to go beyond econometric studies and sheds a\nnew light on the impact of transportation modes on city growth.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Nov 2019 12:52:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Volpati", "Valerio", ""], ["Barthelemy", "Marc", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.13002", "submitter": "Shaoli Wang", "authors": "Shaoli Wang, Xiyan Bai, Fei Xu", "title": "Bistability in a SIRS model with general nonmonotone and saturated\n  incidence rate", "comments": "8 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we consider a SIRS model with general nonmonotone and\nsaturated incidence rate and perform stability and bifurcation analysis.

The biggest contributor to both circulatory and respiratory\ninfluenza-associated deaths was influenza A/H3N2, followed by influenza B and\nA/H1N1. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17\nthrough the 2018/19 seasons (when levels of influenza vaccination were\nsignificantly higher), the volume of influenza-associated mortality declined by\nabout 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory deaths.\n  Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality\nburden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction\nobserved following the major increase in vaccination coverage.
