This paper presents a method for calculating the time\nevolution of the habitats' population size distribution from a general\nstochastic dynamic within each habitat, using a deterministic approximation\nwhich becomes exact for an infinite number of habitats. Fragmented populations\nare usually thought to be characterized by a separation of time scale between,\non the one hand, colonization and extinction of habitats and, on the other\nhand, the local population dynamics within each habitat. The analysis in this\npaper suggests an alternative view: the effective population dynamic stems from\na law of large numbers, where stochastic fluctuations in population size of\nsingle habitats are buffered through the dispersal pool so that the global\npopulation dynamic remains approximately smooth. For illustration, the\ndeterministic approximation is compared to simulations of a stochastic model\nwith density dependent local recruitment and mortality.

In the present\npaper we discuss some such purposes for which a \\emph{stochastic} model is\npreferable to a \\emph{deterministic} counterpart. The two main examples\nillustrate the importance of allowing the infectious and latent periods to be\nrandom when focus lies on the \\emph{probability} of a large epidemic outbreak\nand/or on the initial \\emph{speed}, or growth rate, of the epidemic. A\nconsequence of the latter is that estimation of the basic reproduction number\n$R_0$ is sensitive to assumptions about the distributions of the infectious and\nlatent periods when using the data from the early stages of an outbreak, which\nwe illustrate with data from the SARS outbreak. Some further examples are also\ndiscussed as are some practical consequences related to these stochastic\naspects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2008 10:50:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Britton", "Tom", ""], ["Lindenstrand", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3523", "submitter": "Diego Garlaschelli", "authors": "Tancredi Caruso, Diego Garlaschelli, Roberto Bargagli, Peter Convey", "title": "Testing metabolic scaling theory using intraspecific allometries in\n  Antarctic microarthropods", "comments": "Submitted to Oikos (Nordic Ecological Society and Blackwell\n  Publishing Ltd.)", "journal-ref": "Oikos 119, 935-945 (2010)", "doi": "10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.17915.x", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Quantitative scaling relationships among body mass, temperature and metabolic\nrate of organisms are still controversial, while resolution may be further\ncomplicated through the use of different and possibly inappropriate approaches\nto statistical analysis. We propose the application of a modelling strategy\nbased on Akaike's information criteria and non-linear model fitting (nlm).\nAccordingly, we collated and modelled available data at intraspecific level on\nthe individual standard metabolic rate of Antarctic microarthropods as a\nfunction of body mass (M), temperature (T), species identity (S) and high rank\ntaxa to which species belong (G) and tested predictions from Metabolic Scaling\nTheory. We also performed allometric analysis based on logarithmic\ntransformations (lm). Conclusions from lm and nlm approaches were different.\nBest-supported models from lm incorporated T, M and S. The estimates of the\nallometric scaling exponent b linking body mass and metabolic rate indicated no\ninterspecific difference and resulted in a value of 0.696 +/- 0.105 (mean +/-\n95% CI). In contrast, the four best-supported nlm models suggested that both\nthe scaling exponent and activation energy significantly vary across the high\nrank taxa to which species belong, with mean values of b ranging from about 0.6\nto 0.8. We therefore reached two conclusions: 1) published analyses of\narthropod metabolism based on logarithmic data may be biased by data\ntransformation; 2) non-linear models applied to Antarctic microarthropod\nmetabolic rate suggest that intraspecific scaling of standard metabolic rate in\nAntarctic microarthropods is highly variable and can be characterised by\nscaling exponents that greatly vary within taxa, which may have biased previous\ninterspecific comparisons that neglected intraspecific variability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 18 Dec 2008 13:07:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 16 Sep 2009 12:52:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-10-18", "authors_parsed": [["Caruso", "Tancredi", ""], ["Garlaschelli", "Diego", ""], ["Bargagli", "Roberto", ""], ["Convey", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.3840", "submitter": "Simone Bianco", "authors": "Simone Bianco, Leah B.
