This division of labour between the cells in the aggregate occurs\nspontaneously at the regulatory level due to mechanisms present in unicellular\nancestors and does not require any genetic pre-disposition for a particular\nrole in the aggregate or any orchestrated cooperative behaviour of aggregate\ncells. Mathematically, aggregation implies an increase in the dimensionality of\nphenotype space that generates a fitness landscape with new fitness maxima, and\nin which the unicellular states of optimized metabolism become fitness saddle\npoints. Evolution of multicellularity is modeled as evolution of a hereditary\nparameter, the propensity of cells to stick together, which determines the\nfraction of time a cell spends in the aggregate form. Stickiness can increase\nevolutionarily due to the fitness advantage generated by the division of labour\nbetween cells in an aggregate.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 Nov 2011 00:16:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ispolatov", "Iaroslav", ""], ["Ackermann", "Martin", ""], ["Doebeli", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1111.4643", "submitter": "Marcus Aguiar de", "authors": "Elizabeth M.

While widely used in population\nbiology, genetics and ecology, statistical inference of the instantaneous\nparticle birth and death rates remains largely limited to restrictive linear\nBDPs in which per-particle birth and death rates are constant. Researchers\noften observe the number of particles at discrete times, necessitating data\naugmentation procedures such as expectation-maximization (EM) to find maximum\nlikelihood estimates. The E-step in the EM algorithm is available in\nclosed-form for some linear BDPs, but otherwise previous work has resorted to\napproximation or simulation. Remarkably, the E-step conditional expectations\ncan also be expressed as convolutions of computable transition probabilities\nfor any general BDP with arbitrary rates. This important observation, along\nwith a convenient continued fraction representation of the Laplace transforms\nof the transition probabilities, allows novel and efficient computation of the\nconditional expectations for all BDPs, eliminating the need for approximation\nor costly simulation. We use this insight to derive EM algorithms that yield\nmaximum likelihood estimation for general BDPs characterized by various rate\nmodels, including generalized linear models. We show that our Laplace\nconvolution technique outperforms competing methods when available and\ndemonstrate a technique to accelerate EM algorithm convergence.
