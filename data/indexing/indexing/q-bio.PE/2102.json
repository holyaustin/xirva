A\nfurther suggestion came from the interpretation of the Hubbert curve in terms\nof a specific Lotka Volterra (LV) equation.

Mathematical population dynamics has a history of\nabout two centuries. The first principle and model of population dynamics can\nbe regarded the exponential law of Malthus. In the XIX century, the Malthusian\ndemographic model was first refined to include mortality rate by Gompertz. In\nthe early XIX century the model was further refined by Verhulst by introducing\nthe standard logistic function. The previous models only concern the population\nof a single species. In the early XX century, the American demographer Lotka\nand the Italian mathematician Volterra proposed a pair of state equations which\ndescribe the population dynamics of two competing species, the predator and the\nprey. This paper is concerned with the single and two-species fundamental\nequations: the logistic and LV equation. The paper starts with the generalized\nlogistic equation whose free response is derived together with equilibrium\npoints and stability properties. The parameter estimation of the logistic\nfunction is applied to the raw data of the US crude oil production. The paper\nproceeds with the Lotka Volterra equation of the competition between two\nspecies, with the goal of applying it to resource exploitation.

With a limited number of daily COVID19 tests performed in\nevery country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential effect\nof each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in\nmanaging the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce\nCOVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that\nevaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied to a region and\nprovides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should\nbe. The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a\ngeographical region by simulating the average number of new infections caused\nby an infected person considering the effect of external factors, such as\nenvironmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation\nmeasures.\n  Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the\npolicy-makers need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days\nto prevent demand from quickly exceeding existing hospital capacity. Relaxing\nthe mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both the daily capacity\nneed for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average\nof 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike\nexisting models, the COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the\ndaily number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due to COVID-19.

In particular, given conditions for which one or more speciation\nevents within an ecosystem occur, our aim is to develop the modeling and\nsimulation tools necessary to handle such events. The model we employ can be\nconsidered as an extension of the classical Lotka-Volterra model, where in\naddition to the species abundance, the model also governs the evolution of the\nspecies mean traits and species trait covariances, and in this sense\ngeneralizes the purely ecological Lotka-Volterra model to an eco-evolutionary\nmodel. Although the model thus allows for evolving species, by construction, it\nis not able to handle speciation events due to a breakdown of the underlying\nassumptions on which the model is derived (i.e., unambiguous identification of\ndistinct species in the fitness landscape). Thus, the fundamental problem to\novercome regarding speciation is that the unit of species is too coarse to\ncapture the fine-scale dynamics of a speciation event. Our strategy is twofold;\nmonitoring the species in the system and detecting speciation in advance, and,\nsplitting the diverging `parent'-species into new `child'-species. Since the\nproblem at hand is related to that of separate scales, it is convenient to have\naccess to a fine-scale description of the same eco-evolutionary system. For\nthis, we employ a trait-specific population density model governing the\ndynamics of the abundance density as a function of evolutionary traits.

The analysis is focused on the disease\noutbreak, where the reproduction number $R=\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} $ is greater\nthan one. As methodology, we use both numerical and analytical approaches. The\nanalysis relies on the stationary distribution for Birth and Death Markov\nprocess. The numerical approach creates sample path simulations into order show\nthe infected size dynamics, and the relationship between infected size and $R$.\nAs $M$ becomes large, some stable statistical characteristics of the infected\nsize distribution can be deduced. And the infected size is shown analytically\nto follow a normal distribution with mean $(1-\\frac{1}{R}) M$ and Variance\n$\\frac{M}{R} $.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:37:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-01", "authors_parsed": [["Nzokem", "A.

To this end, we consider a\nreplicator map that models Darwinian selection mechanism in unstructured\ninfinite-sized population whose individuals reproduce asexually forming\nnon-overlapping generations. This is one of the simplest evolutionary game\ndynamic that exhibits periodic solutions giving way to chaotic solutions (as\nparameters related to reproductive fitness change) and also obeys the folk\ntheorems connecting fixed point solutions with Nash equilibrium. Interestingly,\nwe find that a modified Darwinian fitness -- termed heterogeneity payoff -- in\nthe corresponding population game must be put forward as (conventional) fitness\ntimes the probability that two arbitrarily chosen individuals of the population\nadopt two different strategies. The evolutionary dynamics proceeds as if the\nindividuals optimize the heterogeneity payoff to reach an evolutionarily stable\norbit, should it exist. We rigorously prove that a locally asymptotically\nstable period orbit must be heterogeneity stable orbit -- a generalization of\nevolutionarily stable state.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 17 Feb 2021 14:06:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Mukhopadhyay", "Archan", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Sagar", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11045", "submitter": "Jennifer Crodelle", "authors": "Joshua M.

To address\nthis, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading under\npathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter the\nprojection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - the\nmutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initially\nnon-pandemic (R0 < 1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a critical\nmutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemic\nand the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogen\nprevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other\nhand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and,\nonce again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observe\na broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen will\neventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination,\nwhich creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towards\nvaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns must\nbe accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise of\na resistant mutant strain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 05:18:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 29 Mar 2021 09:36:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Xiyun", ""], ["Ruan", "Zhongyuan", ""], ["Zheng", "Muhua", ""], ["Zhou", "Jie", ""], ["Boccaletti", "Stefano", ""], ["Barzel", "Baruch", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.11071", "submitter": "Fernando Saldana PhD", "authors": "Hugo Flores-Arguedas, Jos\\'e Ariel Camacho-Guti\\'errez, Fernando\n  Salda\\~na", "title": "Estimating the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions and\n  vaccination on the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in Mexico: a\n  mathematical approach", "comments": "19 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Non-pharmaceutical interventions have been critical in the fight against the\nCOVID-19 pandemic.

Our current ability to predict and analyse the\njoint effects of multiple stressors is insufficient to make the prospective\nrisk assessment of chemicals more ecologically relevant because we lack a full\nunderstanding of how organisms respond to stress factors alone and in\ncombination. Here, we describe a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) based\nbioenergetics model that predicts the potential effects of single or multiple\nnatural and chemical stressors on life history traits. We demonstrate the\nplausibility of the model using a meta-analysis of 128 existing studies on\nfreshwater invertebrates. We then validate our model by comparing its\npredictions for a combination of three stressors (i.e. chemical, temperature,\nand food availability) with new, independent experimental data on life history\ntraits in the daphnid Ceriodaphnia dubia. We found that the model predictions\nare in agreement with observed growth curves and reproductive traits. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first time that the combined effects of\nthree stress factors on life history traits observed in laboratory studies have\nbeen predicted successfully in invertebrates. We suggest that a re-analysis of\nexisting studies on multiple stressors within the modelling framework outlined\nhere will provide a robust null model for identifying stressor interactions,\nand expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will arise\nfrom these new analyses.

A common task is to\ninfer the underlying tree structure given only observations of the terminal\nnodes. Many algorithms for tree recovery are computationally intensive, which\nlimits their applicability to trees of moderate size. For large trees, a common\napproach, termed divide-and-conquer, is to recover the tree structure in two\nsteps. First, recover the structure separately for multiple randomly selected\nsubsets of the terminal nodes. Second, merge the resulting subtrees to form a\nfull tree. Here, we develop Spectral Top-Down Recovery (STDR), a\ndivide-and-conquer approach for inference of large latent tree models. Unlike\nprevious methods, STDR's partitioning step is non-random. Instead, it is based\non the Fiedler vector of a suitable Laplacian matrix related to the observed\nnodes. We prove that under certain conditions this partitioning is consistent\nwith the tree structure. This, in turn leads to a significantly simpler merging\nprocedure of the small subtrees. We prove that STDR is statistically\nconsistent, and bound the number of samples required to accurately recover the\ntree with high probability. Using simulated data from several common tree\nmodels in phylogenetics, we demonstrate that STDR has a significant advantage\nin terms of runtime, with improved or similar accuracy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 02:47:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Aizenbud", "Yariv", ""], ["Jaffe", "Ariel", ""], ["Wang", "Meng", ""], ["Hu", "Amber", ""], ["Amsel", "Noah", ""], ["Nadler", "Boaz", ""], ["Chang", "Joseph T.", ""], ["Kluger", "Yuval", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13469", "submitter": "Abhishek Singh", "authors": "Abhishek Narain Singh", "title": "The unmasking of Mitochondrial Adam and Structural Variants larger than\n  point mutations as stronger candidates for traits, disease phenotype and sex\n  determination", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN cs.DC q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Structural Variations, SVs, in a genome can be linked to a\ndisease or characteristic phenotype.

Method:\nStructural variations, SVs, with size 1 base-pair to 1000s of base-pairs with\ntheir precise breakpoints and single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs, were\ndetermined for members of a family. The genome was assembled using optimal\nmetrics of ABySS and SOAPdenovo assembly tools using paired-end DNA sequence.\nResults: An interesting discovery was the mitochondrial DNA could have paternal\nleakage of inheritance or that the mutations could be high from maternal\ninheritance. It is also discovered that the mitochondrial DNA is less prone to\nSVs re-arrangements than SNPs, which propose better standards for determining\nancestry and divergence between races and species over a long-time frame. Sex\ndetermination of an individual is found to be strongly confirmed using calls of\nnucleotide bases of SVs to the Y chromosome, more strongly determined than\nSNPs.

Such a model, in non-integer power of time, namely $t^m$\nup to constants, enables representing at each day, with a good precision, the\ntotality of the contaminated individuals. Despite being enriched with knowledge\nthrough an internal structure based on a geometric sequence \"with variable\nratio\", the model (in its non-integer representation) has only three\nparameters, among which the non-integer power, $m$, that determines on its own,\naccording to its value, an aggravation or an improvement of the viral\nspreading. Its simplicity comes from the power-law, $t^m$, which simply\nexpresses the singular dynamics of the operator of non-integer differentiation\nor integration, of high parametric compactness, that governs diffusion\nphenomena and, as shown in this paper, the spreading phenomena by\ncontamination. The proposed model is indeed validated with the official data of\nMinistry of Health on the COVID-19 spreading. Used in prediction, it well\nenables justifying the choice of a lockdown, without which the spreading would\nhave highly worsened. The comparison of this model in $t^m$ with two known\nmodels having the same number of parameters, well shows that its\nrepresentativity of the real data is better or more general. Finally, in a more\nfundamental context and particularly in terms of complexity and simplicity, a\nself-filtering action enables showing the compatibility between the\n\\emph{internal complexity} that the internal structure and its stochastic\nbehavior present, and the \\emph{global simplicity} that the model in $t^m$\noffers in a deterministic manner: it is true that the non-integer power of a\npower-law is well a marker of complexity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Feb 2021 09:22:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Oustaloup", "Alain", ""], ["Levron", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Victor", "St\u00e9phane", ""], ["Dugard", "Luc", ""]]}, {"id": "2102.13600", "submitter": "Benjamin F.

However, high incidence rates and rapidly spreading\nSARS-CoV-2 variants are concerning. In combination with acute supply deficits\nin Europe in early 2021, the question arises of whether stretching the vaccine,\nfor instance by delaying the second dose, can make a significant contribution\nto preventing deaths, despite associated risks such as lower vaccine efficacy,\nthe potential emergence of escape mutants, enhancement, waning immunity,\nreduced social acceptance of off-label vaccination, and liability shifts. A\nquantitative epidemiological assessment of risks and benefits of non-standard\nvaccination protocols remains elusive. To clarify the situation and to provide\na quantitative epidemiological foundation we develop a stochastic\nepidemiological model that integrates specific vaccine rollout protocols into a\nrisk-group structured infectious disease dynamical model. Using the situation\nand conditions in Germany as a reference system, we show that delaying the\nsecond vaccine dose is expected to prevent deaths in the four to five digit\nrange, should the incidence resurge. We show that this considerable public\nhealth benefit relies on the fact that both mRNA vaccines provide substantial\nprotection against severe COVID-19 and death beginning 12 to 14 days after the\nfirst dose. The benefits of protocol change are attenuated should vaccine\ncompliance decrease substantially. To quantify the impact of protocol change on\nvaccination adherence we performed a large-scale online survey. We find that,\nin Germany, changing vaccination protocols may lead to small reductions in\nvaccination intention. In sum, we therefore expect the benefits of a strategy\nchange to remain substantial and stable.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:16:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-01", "authors_parsed": [["Maier", "Benjamin F.", ""], ["Burdinski", "Angelique", ""], ["Rose", "Annika H.", ""], ["Schlosser", "Frank", ""], ["Hinrichs", "David", ""], ["Betsch", "Cornelia", ""], ["Korn", "Lars", ""], ["Sprengholz", "Philipp", ""], ["Meyer-Hermann", "Michael", ""], ["Mitra", "Tanmay", ""], ["Lauterbach", "Karl", ""], ["Brockmann", "Dirk", ""]]}]
