As the\ninteraction between these enemies and the pest is complex and the production of\nnatural enemies potentially expensive, it is not surprising that both the\nefficacy and economic viability of biological pest control are debated. Here,\nwe investigate the performance of very simple control strategies. In\nparticular, we show how Pareto-efficient one-off or periodic release\nstrategies, that optimally trade off between efficacy and economic viability,\ncan be devised and used to enable high efficacy at small economic costs. We\ndemonstrate our method on a pest-pathogen-crop model with a tunable immigration\nrate of pests. By analyzing this model, we demonstrate that simple\nPareto-efficient one-off and periodic release strategies are efficacious and\nsimultaneously have profits that are close to the theoretical maximum obtained\nby strategies optimizing only the profit. When the immigration rate of pests is\nlow to intermediate, one-off control strategies are sufficient, and when the\nimmigration of pests is high, periodic release strategies are preferable. The\nmethods presented here can be extended to more complex scenarios and be used to\nidentify promising biological pest control strategies in many circumstances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 11:42:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 15:43:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 19:30:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Lundstr\u00f6m", "Niklas L.

In both models reproduction occurs in bursts, sampled from an\narbitrary distribution. In the extinction problem, we show that bursty\nreproduction broadens the quasi-stationary distribution of population sizes in\nthe metastable state, which results in an exponential decrease of the mean time\nto extinction. In the survival problem, bursty reproduction yields an\nexponential increase in survival probability of the population.

While\nboth approaches have been valued for their intrinsic mathematical interest, it\nis not clear how they relate to each other, and to what extent they can be used\nas practical tools for inference of phylogenetic trees.\n  In this paper, by focusing on the special case of binary sequence data and\nquartets of taxa, we are able to view these two different polynomial-based\napproaches within a common framework. To motivate the discussion, we present\nthree desirable statistical properties that we argue any phylogenetic method\nshould satisfy: (1) sensible behaviour under reordering of input sequences; (2)\nstability as the taxa evolve independently according to a Markov process; and\n(3) ability to detect if the conditions of a continuous-time process are\nviolated. Motivated by these statistical properties, we develop and explore\nseveral new phylogenetic inference methods.

In order to understand the effect of such\ncorrelation on epidemic spreading, we consider as well the corresponding\nuncorrected but still heterogeneous infection rate scenario as a reference,\nwhere the original correlated infection rates in our CSIS model are shuffled\nand reallocated to the links of the same network topology.

For continuous time models in which individuals disperse\nthroughout their lifetime, it has been shown that a balanced dispersal\nstrategy, which results in an ideal free distribution, is evolutionary stable\nin spatially varying but temporally constant environments. Many species,\nhowever, primarily disperse prior to reproduction (natal dispersal) and less\ncommonly between reproductive events (breeding dispersal). As demographic and\ndispersal terms combine in a multiplicative way for models of natal dispersal,\nrather than the additive way for the previously studied models, we develop new\nmathematical methods to study the evolution of natal dispersal for\ncontinuous-time and discrete-time models.

Because of\nqualitatively different bifurcation features for $m=1$ and $m\\geq2$, we derive\nindependently the expressions of $\\mathcal {S}$ as a function of the rescaled\ninfection rate $\\lambda/\\mu$. For the weak infection, $\\mathcal {S}$ scales to\nthe distance to the bifurcation with an exponent $2$ for $m=1$ and $3/2$ for\n$m\\geq2$. Finally, a rare-event simulation method is used to validate the\ntheory.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 02:53:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 05:06:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 22 Oct 2016 03:52:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 08:05:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-08", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Hanshuang", ""], ["Huang", "Feng", ""], ["Zhang", "Haifeng", ""], ["Li", "Guofeng", ""]]}, {"id": "1608.08932", "submitter": "Mauro Mobilia", "authors": "Mauro Mobilia, Alastair M.

Within our individual-based metapopulation formulation, the\npopulation composition changes due to cyclic dominance (dominance-removal and\ndominance-replacement), mutations, and pair-exchange of neighboring\nindividuals. Here, we study the influence of mobility on the emerging patterns\nand investigate when the pair-exchange rate is responsible for spiral waves to\nbecome elusive in stochastic lattice simulations. In particular, we show that\nthe spiral waves predicted by the system's deterministic partial equations are\nfound in lattice simulations only within a finite range of the mobility rate.\nWe also report that in the absence of mutations and dominance-replacement, the\nresulting spiraling patterns are subject to convective instability and\nfar-field breakup at low mobility rate.

To help reduce their impact,\nmathematical models of disease transmission have been studied to help\nunderstand disease dynamics and inform prevention strategies. Vaccination - one\nof the most important preventive measures of modern times - is of great\ninterest both theoretically and empirically. And in contrast to traditional\napproaches, recent research increasingly explores the pivotal implications of\nindividual behavior and heterogeneous contact patterns in populations. Our\nreport reviews the developmental arc of theoretical epidemiology with emphasis\non vaccination, as it led from classical models assuming homogeneously mixing\n(mean-field) populations and ignoring human behavior, to recent models that\naccount for behavioral feedback and/or population spatial/social structure.\nMany of the methods used originated in statistical physics, such as lattice and\nnetwork models, and their associated analytical frameworks. Similarly, the\nfeedback loop between vaccinating behavior and disease propagation forms a\ncoupled nonlinear system with analogs in physics. We also review the new\nparadigm of digital epidemiology, wherein sources of digital data such as\nonline social media are mined for high-resolution information on\nepidemiologically relevant individual behavior. Armed with the tools and\nconcepts of statistical physics, and further assisted by new sources of digital\ndata, models that capture nonlinear interactions between behavior and disease\ndynamics offer a novel way of modeling real-world phenomena, and can help\nimprove health outcomes. We conclude the review by discussing open problems in\nthe field and promising directions for future research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 19:36:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 17:08:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 14:15:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhen", ""], ["Bauch", "Chris T.", ""], ["Bhattacharyya", "Samit", ""], ["d'Onofrio", "Alberto", ""], ["Manfredi", "Piero", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""], ["Perra", "Nicola", ""], ["Salath\u00e9", "Marcel", ""], ["Zhao", "Dawei", ""]]}]
