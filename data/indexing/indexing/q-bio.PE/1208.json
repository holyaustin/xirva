Generalization of this measure to three genomes is known as the\nmedian score (while a resulting genome is called median genome). In contrast to\nthe rearrangement distance between two genomes which can be computed in linear\ntime, computing the median score for three genomes is NP-hard. This inspires a\nquest for simpler and faster approximations for the median score, the most\nnatural of which appears to be the halved sum of pairwise distances which in\nfact represents a lower bound for the median score.\n  In this work, we study relationship and interplay of pairwise distances\nbetween three genomes and their median score under the model of\nDouble-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) rearrangements. Most remarkably we show that while a\nrearrangement may change the sum of pairwise distances by at most 2 (and thus\nchange the lower bound by at most 1), even the most \"powerful\" rearrangements\nin this respect that increase the lower bound by 1 (by moving one genome\nfarther away from each of the other two genomes), which we call strong, do not\nnecessarily affect the median score. This observation implies that the two\nmeasures are not as well-correlated as one's intuition may suggest.\n  We further prove that the median score attains the lower bound exactly on the\ntriples of genomes that can be obtained from a single genome with strong\nrearrangements. While the sum of pairwise distances with the factor 2/3\nrepresents an upper bound for the median score, its tightness remains unclear.\nNonetheless, we show that the difference of the median score and its lower\nbound is not bounded by a constant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Aug 2012 08:20:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 22 Oct 2012 21:54:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Aganezov,", "Sergey", "Jr."], ["Alekseyev", "Max A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.0247", "submitter": "Henry Arellano", "authors": "Henry Arellano-P., J.

In principle, individual selection could act on such parameters so\nas to strengthen the force of between-group selection and hence increase\ncooperation and individual fitness, as illustrated in our previous work.\nHowever, such a process cannot operate in parameter regions where group\nselection effects are totally absent, since there would be no selective\ngradient to follow. One key parameter, which when increased often rapidly\ncauses group selection effects to tend to zero, is initial group size, for when\ngroups are formed randomly then even moderately sized groups lack significant\nvariance in their composition. However, the consequent restriction of any group\nselection effect to small sized groups is derived from models that assume\nselfish types will competitively exclude their more cooperative counterparts at\nwithin-group equilibrium. In such cases, diversity in the migrant pool can tend\nto zero and accordingly variance in group composition cannot be generated.

In this study we assessed patterns of genome-wide\nintrogression based on 39,029 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 189\nindividuals from nine sympatric maize-mexicana populations and reference\nallopatric populations. While portions of the maize and mexicana genomes were\nparticularly resistant to introgression (notably near known\ncross-incompatibility and domestication loci), we detected widespread evidence\nfor introgression in both directions of gene flow. Through further\ncharacterization of these regions and preliminary growth chamber experiments,\nwe found evidence suggestive of the incorporation of adaptive mexicana alleles\ninto maize during its expansion to the highlands of central Mexico. In\ncontrast, very little evidence was found for adaptive introgression from maize\nto mexicana. The methods we have applied here can be replicated widely, and\nsuch analyses have the potential to greatly informing our understanding of\nevolution through introgressive hybridization.

For the $SIR$ dynamics, the basic reproductive ratio $R_0$ is\ncomputed, and we show that (i) for both network models $R_{0}$ is maximised if\nall weights are equal, and (ii) when the two models are equally matched, the\nnetworks with a random weight distribution give rise to a higher $R_0$ value.\nThe models are also used to explore the agreement between the pairwise and\nsimulation models for different parameter combinations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2012 22:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-22", "authors_parsed": [["Rattana", "Prapanporn", ""], ["Blyuss", "Konstantin B.", ""], ["Eames", "Ken T.

These few driver alterations reside in a cancer\ngenome alongside tens of thousands of other mutations that are widely believed\nto have no role in cancer and termed passengers. Many passengers, however, fall\nwithin protein coding genes and other functional elements and can possibly have\ndeleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate a potential of mildly\ndeleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic\nprogression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer\nprogression with the analysis of cancer sequencing data. In our simulations,\nindividual cells stochastically divide, acquire advantageous driver and\ndeleterious passenger mutations, or die. Surprisingly, despite selection\nagainst them, passengers accumulate and largely evade selection during\nprogression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers\nalters the course of progression leading to several phenomena observed in\noncology that cannot be explained by a traditional driver-centric view. We\ntested predictions of the model using cancer genomic data. We find that many\npassenger mutations are likely to be damaging and that, in agreement with the\nmodel, they have largely evaded purifying selection. Finally, we used our model\nto explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either 1)\nincreasing the mutation rate; or 2) exacerbating their deleterious effects.\nWhile both approaches lead to cancer regression, the later leads to less\nfrequent relapse. Our results suggest a new framework for understanding cancer\nprogression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2012 03:29:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["McFarland", "Christopher D", ""], ["Kryukov", "Gregory V", ""], ["Sunyaev", "Shamil", ""], ["Mirny", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "1208.6497", "submitter": "Christel Kamp", "authors": "Christel Kamp, Mathieu Moslonka-Lefebvre, Samuel Alizon", "title": "Predicting epidemics on weighted networks", "comments": "20 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The contact structure between hosts has a critical influence on disease\nspread.

One of\nthe reasons why models usually ignore heterogeneity in transmission is that we\ncurrently lack tools to analyze weighted networks, such that most studies rely\non numerical simulations. Here, we present a novel framework to estimate key\nepidemiological variables, such as the rate of early epidemic expansion and the\nbasic reproductive ratio, from joint probability distributions of number of\npartners (contacts) and number of interaction events through which contacts are\nweighted. This framework also allows for a derivation of the full time course\nof epidemic prevalence and contact behaviour which is validated using numerical\nsimulations.

One approach to\ndealing with differing sample depth for a given diversity statistic is to\nrarefy, which means to take a random subset of a given size of the original\nsample. Exact analytical formulae for the mean and variance of species richness\nunder rarefaction have existed for some time but no such solution exists for\nPD. We have derived exact formulae for the mean and variance of PD under\nrarefaction. We show that these formulae are correct by comparing exact\nsolution mean and variance to that calculated by repeated random (Monte Carlo)\nsubsampling of a dataset of stem counts of woody shrubs of Toohey Forest,\nQueensland, Australia. We also demonstrate the application of the method using\ntwo examples: identifying hotspots of mammalian diversity in Australasian\necoregions, and characterising the human vaginal microbiome. There is a very\nhigh degree of correspondence between the analytical and random subsampling\nmethods for calculating mean and variance of PD under rarefaction, although the\nMonte Carlo method requires a large number of random draws to converge on the\nexact solution for the variance. Rarefaction of mammalian PD of ecoregions in\nAustralasia to a common standard of 25 species reveals very different rank\norderings of ecoregions, indicating quite different hotspots of diversity than\nthose obtained for unrarefied PD. The application of these methods to the\nvaginal microbiome shows that a classical score used to quantify bacterial\nvaginosis is correlated with the shape of the rarefaction curve. The analytical\nformulae for the mean and variance of PD under rarefaction are both exact and\nmore efficient than repeated subsampling. Rarefaction of PD allows for many\napplications where comparisons of samples of different depth is required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2012 17:07:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Feb 2013 01:52:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Nipperess", "David A.", ""], ["Matsen", "Frederick A.", "IV"]]}]
