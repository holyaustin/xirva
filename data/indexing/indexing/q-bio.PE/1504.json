That is, first virus particles diffuse randomly\noutside of host cells, then the virus genome enters the target host cell, and\nonly then do intracellular dynamics and regulation of virus and host cell fate\nunfold. Intracellular dynamics may lead to the death of the host cell and\nrelease of viruses, to the elimination of the virus genome through cellular\ndefense mechanisms, or the integration of the virus genome with the host as a\nchromosomal or extra-chromosomal element. Here we revisit this canonical view,\ninspired by recent experimental findings of Bautista and colleagues (mBio,\n2015) in which the majority of target host cells can be induced into a dormant\nstate when exposed to either active or de-activated viruses, even when viruses\nare present at low relative titer. We propose that both the qualitative\nphenomena and the quantitative time-scales of dormancy induction can be\nreconciled given the hypothesis that cellular physiology can be altered by\ncontact on the surface of host cells rather than strictly by infection. We\ndevelop a biophysical model of contact-mediated dynamics involving virus\nparticles and target cells. We show how in this model virus particles can\ncatalyze - extracellularly - cellular transformations amongst many cells, even\nif they ultimately infect only one (or none). We discuss implications of the\npresent biophysical model relevant to the study of virus-microbe interactions\nmore generally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 16:35:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-02", "authors_parsed": [["Gulbudak", "Hayriye", ""], ["Weitz", "Joshua S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.00304", "submitter": "Christopher Whidden", "authors": "Chris Whidden and Frederick A.

Phylogenetic trees and such\nmoves naturally form the vertices and edges of a graph, such that tree search\nalgorithms perform a (potentially stochastic) traversal of this SPR graph.\nDespite the centrality of such graphs in phylogenetic inference, rather little\nis known about their large-scale properties. In this paper we learn about the\nrooted-tree version of the graph, known as the rSPR graph, by calculating the\nRicci-Ollivier curvature for pairs of vertices in the rSPR graph with respect\nto two simple random walks on the rSPR graph. By proving theorems and direct\ncalculation with novel algorithms, we find a remarkable diversity of different\ncurvatures on the rSPR graph for pairs of vertices separated by the same\ndistance. We confirm using simulation that degree and curvature have the\nexpected impact on mean access time distributions, demonstrating relevance of\nthese curvature results to stochastic tree search. This indicates significant\nstructure of the rSPR graph beyond that which was previously understood in\nterms of pairwise distances and vertex degrees; a greater understanding of\ncurvature could ultimately lead to improved strategies for tree search.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Apr 2015 17:24:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Apr 2015 19:09:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 23:52:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-05", "authors_parsed": [["Whidden", "Chris", ""], ["Matsen", "Frederick A.", "IV"]]}, {"id": "1504.00372", "submitter": "Artem Novozhilov", "authors": "Artem S.

Specifically, we find that in the stationary state,\nthere are individuals that play the same strategy in all layers (coherent), and\nothers that don't (incoherent).

For example, a drug company may\nwish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their\ncost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing,\nyet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single,\nhigh-performing solution.

In our setup, obligatory vaccination seems to not be so crucial (for\nnone of realistic scenarios increase of cancer cases is possible) for public\nhealth, as in most countries in European Union. However, screening practice\ncould be verified in terms of efficiency, when cost benefit calculation would\nbe done. We propose more optimal screening guidelines (with prevention cost 5\n-10k EUR per QALY), which could provide saving perspective in 10-15 year in\nrange 150-300k EUR yearly. Targeted vaccination could be also consider, because\ncosts are similar to high frequencies screening schema with the same cancer\ncases projection. However, some positive side effects of vaccination as\nreduction of pathogen circulation in society, will cause decrease of other\npathologies related to HPV like genital warts and other cancer.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Apr 2015 10:54:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-22", "authors_parsed": [["Jarynowski", "Andrzej", ""]]}, {"id": "1504.05706", "submitter": "Joseba Dalmau", "authors": "Rapha\\\"el Cerf and Joseba Dalmau", "title": "Quasispecies on class-dependent fitness landscapes", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.CA", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study Eigen's quasispecies model in the asymptotic regime where the length\nof the genotypes goes to infinity and the mutation probability goes to 0.
