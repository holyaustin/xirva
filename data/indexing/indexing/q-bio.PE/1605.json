First, by reformulating a result of control\ntheory, we explain that harmonic external perturbations reflect the spectral\nsensitivity of the Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium, with respect to constant\nchanges of its coefficients. However, for this equivalence to hold, imaginary\nchanges of the Jacobian's coefficients have to be allowed. The connection with\ndynamical stability is thus lost for real dynamical systems.

This\nnon-accidental mutation is non-Lamarckian yet useful for evolution, and is due\nto evolved and continually evolving mutational mechanisms operating in the germ\ncells. However, this theory has left a fundamental problem open: If mutational\nmechanisms are not Lamarckian---if they are not \"aware\" of the environment and\nthe macroscale phenotype---then how could heritable novelty be due to anything\nother than accidental mutation? This paper aims to address this question by\narguing the following. Mutational mechanisms can be broadly construed as\nenacting local simplification operations on the DNA in germ cells, along with\ngene duplication. The joint action of these mutational operations and natural\nselection provides simplification under performance pressure. This joint action\ncreates from preexisting biological interactions new elements that have the\ninherent capacity to come together into unexpected useful interactions with\nother such elements, thus explaining nature's tendency for cooption. Novelty\nthus arises not from a local genetic accident but from gradual network-level\nevolution. Many empirical observations are explained from this perspective,\nfrom cooption and gene fusion at the molecular level, to the evolution of\nbehavior and instinct at the organismal level. Finally, the nature of\nmutational mechanisms and the need to study them in detail are described, and a\nconnection is drawn between evolution and learning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2016 13:44:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 24 May 2016 11:20:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Livnat", "Adi", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.03555", "submitter": "Robert Wilkinson mr", "authors": "Robert R.

On the other side, recent technological advances in Genetics\ngive us the opportunity to approach the study of pedigrees from a new\nperspective, examining alive people and simultaneously collating the historical\ninformation of their ancestors. In this paper, a complete matrilineal genealogy\nwas reconstructed from nowadays \"white\" Costa Ricans to their ancestors in the\nearly Colonial society (XVI century). It was compared the correlation between\nethnic affiliations deduced from historical records with the genetic\ninheritance from maternal lineages. The MtDNA lineage observed corresponds to a\nNative American ancestry. These results show that some Amerindian gene flow\ninto the Spanish group must have occurred since the first generation of\nColonial society, a finding that contrasts with the prevailing ideas that the\nSpanish elite avoided the intermarriage with other ethnic groups. Examples like\nthis one confirm that miscegenation began early in Costa Rica. So, those who\nconsidered themselves \"Spaniards\" in the late colonial era, were actually\nbiologically mestizos. It is widely accepted, that the general Costa Rican\npopulation is the result of an admixture process between Europeans, Amerindians\nand Africans.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 20 May 2016 04:00:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Morera-Brenes", "Bernal", ""], ["Villegas-Palma", "Ramon", ""], ["Melendez-Obando", "Mauricio", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.06255", "submitter": "Johannes M\\\"uller", "authors": "Bendix Koopmann, Johannes M\\\"uller, Aur\\'elien Tellier, Daniel\n  \\v{Z}ivkovi\\'c", "title": "Fisher-Wright model with deterministic seed bank and selection", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1016/j.tpb.2016.11.005", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Seed banks are a common characteristics to many plant species, which allow\nstorage of genetic diversity in the soil as dormant seeds for various periods\nof time.

We examined the effects of uncertainty in model structure in\nepidemic cholera, testing a range of models based on known features of cholera\nepidemiology.

We evaluated model distinguishability based on\ndata fit, and whether parameter values and forecasts can accurately be inferred\nfrom incidence data. In general, all models were able to successfully fit to\nall data sets, even if misspecified.

Based on principles from\ninformation theory, we have previously developed a new population genetic\nmodel, and applying it in simulations, we have recently hypothesized that all\nspecies maintain the maximum genomic complexity that is required by their niche\nand allowed by their mutation rate and selection intensity. Applying this idea\nto the complexity overhead of recombination maintenance, its costs must be more\nthan compensated by an additional capacity for complexity in recombining\npopulations. Here, we show a simple mechanism, where recombination helps to\nmaintain larger biases of alleles frequencies in a population, so the\nadvantageous alleles can have increased frequency. This allows recombining\npopulations to maintain higher fitness and phenotypic efficiency in comparison\nwith asexual populations with the same parameters. Random mating alone already\nsignificantly increases the ability to maintain genomic and phenotypic\ncomplexity. Sexual selection provides additional capacity for this complexity.\nThe model can be considered as a unifying synthesis of previous hypotheses\nabout the roles of recombination in Muller's ratchet, mutation purging and Red\nQueen dynamics, because the introduction of recombination both increases\npopulation frequencies of beneficial alleles and decreases detrimental ones.
