Our aim is to\nstudy the effect of an epidemic control policy on the uncertain model in a\ncontrol-theoretic framework. We begin by providing the closed-form solutions of\nstates in the modified SIRD-based model such as infected cases, susceptible\ncases, recovered cases, and deceased cases.

In\nparticular during the first and second waves of infections in spring and\nautumn/winter 2020, there has been a pronounced shift in the age distribution\nof confirmed cases towards older age groups, resulting in larger effective IFR\nestimates. The temporary increase in effective IFR during the first wave is\nestimated to be smaller but still remains when adjusting for age- and\ntime-dependent dark figures. A comparison of effective IFRs with observed CFRs\nindicates that a substantial fraction of the time-dependent variability in\nobserved mortality can be explained by changes in the age distribution of\ninfections.

In this paper, we show two independent ways of generalizing this\nmodel, the first one if the vaccine isn't discovered or ready to use and the\nnext one, if the vaccine is discovered and ready to use. In the first part, we\nhave pointed out a major over-simplification, i.e., assumption of variation of\nthe time derivatives of the variables with the linear or quadratic powers of\nthe individual variables and introduce two new parameters to incorporate\nfurther nonlinearity in the number of infected people in the model. As a result\nof this, we show how this additional nonlinearity, in the newly introduced\nparameters, can bring a significant shift in the peak time of infection, i.e.,\nthe time at which the infected population reaches maximum. We show that in\nspecial cases, even we can get a transition from epidemic to a non-epidemic\nstage of a particular infectious disease. We further study one such special\ncase and treat it as a problem of phase transition.

Upon contact with a promoter (contagious individual), a\nnaive (susceptible) person can either become promoter himself or become\n$\\textit{weakened}$, hence more vulnerable. Weakened individuals become\ncontagious when they experience a second contact with members of the promoter\ngroup.

We cover the probability of establishment of an\nepidemic as a function of the distribution of secondary infections, the\nexpectation of epidemic size as a function of time, and the convergence to a\ndeterministic exponential regime. Stochasticity systematically accelerates the\ninitial growth of an epidemic, because epidemics that do not get extinct have\nfaster initial growth on average.

In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late\nspring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew\nthroughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of\nthe effective reproduction numbers ${\\cal R}(t)$ for each country by\nintegrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based\non the estimated ${\\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.\nThe result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries\nrespond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we\nextend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$\nof new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social\nresponse is on the form $d_t{\\cal R}=-\\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold\nfor response. The response rate $\\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or\nabove this threshold, on three parameters $\\nu_1,\\;\\nu_2,\\,\\nu_3,$, and on $t$.\nWhen $X<X^*$, $\\nu= \\nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when\nthe incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\\nu=\\nu_2\\exp{(-\\nu_3t)}$, models the\nimpact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\\nu_3$\nrepresents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time\npasses. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19\nepidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters\n$\\nu_1,\\,\\nu_2,\\,\\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\\cal R}_0$, for\ndifferent countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social\nresponses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave\nin Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during\nthe summer, but rather the general fatigue to interventions developing in the\nfall.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Nov 2020 11:59:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Rypdal", "Kristoffer", ""], ["Bianchi", "Filippo Maria", ""], ["Rypdal", "Martin", ""]]}, {"id": "2011.12400", "submitter": "Adeel Razi", "authors": "Karl J.

There is, however, no consensus on\nthe origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather\nthan from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type or\nothers based on complex networks describe well the exponential spread of the\ndisease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless,\nunderstanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing\neffective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave\npattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework, which is\nguided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show\nthat the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation\nsymmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching\na time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves\nis a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time\nscale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model\nfeaturing complex fixed points. Our results demonstrate that the key to control\nthe arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in\nbetween waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting\nthe virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or\ndelay the arrival of the next wave.

It is based on the assumption that\ncomplex traits or characters can only be gained once and lost once in the\ncourse of evolution. Here, we consider a generalization of this model, namely\nDollo parsimony, that allows for multiple character losses. More precisely, we\ntake a combinatorial perspective on the notion of Dollo-$k$ characters, i.e.\ntraits that are gained at most once and lost precisely $k$ times throughout\nevolution. We first introduce an algorithm based on the notion of spanning\nsubtrees for finding a Dollo-$k$ labeling for a given character and a given\ntree in linear time. We then compare persistent characters (consisting of the\nunion of Dollo-0 and Dollo-1 characters) and general Dollo-$k$ characters.\nWhile it is known that there is a strong connection between Fitch parsimony and\npersistent characters, we show that Dollo parsimony and Fitch parsimony are in\ngeneral very different. Moreover, while it is known that there is a direct\nrelationship between the number of persistent characters and the Sackin index\nof a tree, a popular index of tree balance, we show that this relationship does\nnot generalize to Dollo-$k$ characters. In fact, determining the number of\nDollo-$k$ characters for a given tree is much more involved than counting\npersistent characters, and we end this manuscript by introducing a recursive\napproach for the former.

We consider an SIR\nmodel on a network and follow the disease dynamics, modeling the phases of\nquarantine by changing the node degree distribution.
