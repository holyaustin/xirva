Development involves temporal sequences\nof cell states controlled by hierarchies of regulatory structures.

Evolution, by contrast entails\ngenotypic change through the acquisition/loss of genes and changes in the\nnetwork topology of interactions among genes. It involves the emergence of new,\nenvironmentally selected phenotypes over the lifetimes of many individuals.\nHere we present a model of regulatory network evolution that accounts for both\ntimescales. We extend the framework of Boolean models of gene regulatory\nnetworks (GRN)-currently only applicable to describing development to include\nevolutionary processes. As opposed to one-to-one maps to specific attractors,\nwe identify the phenotypes of the cells as the relevant macrostates of the GRN.\nA phenotype may now correspond to multiple attractors, and its formal\ndefinition no longer requires a fixed size for the genotype. This opens the\npossibility for a quantitative study of the phenotypic change of a genotype,\nwhich is itself changing over evolutionary timescales. We show how the\nrealization of specific phenotypes can be controlled by gene duplication events\n(used here as an archetypal evolutionary event able to change the genotype),\nand how successive events of gene duplication lead to new regulatory structures\nvia selection.

Models simulating community dynamics\novercome the technical challenges of conducting species removal experiments in\nthe field. However, to date, available soil food web models do not adequately\nrepresent the organic matter processing chain which is key for soil dynamics.\nHere, we present a new model of soil food web dynamics accounting for\nallometric scaling of metabolic rate, ontogeny of organic matter, and explicit\nrepresentation of nitrogen and carbon flows. We use this model to investigate\nwhat traits are best predictors of species effects on community productivity\nand on nutrient cycling. To do so, we removed 161 tropho-species (groups of\nfunctionally identical species) one at a time from 48 forest soil food webs,\nand simulated their dynamics until equilibrium. Simulations revealed that\ncombinations of traits better determine removal effects than single ones. The\nsmallest species are the most competitive ones, but carnivores of various body\nmasses presenting the highest connectivity and resource similarity could be key\nstone species in the regulation of competitive forces. Despite this, most\nremovals had low effects, suggesting functional redundancy provides a high\nresistance of soil food webs to single tropho-species extinction. We also\nhighlight for the first time that food web structure and soil fertility can\ndrastically change species effects in an unpredictable way. Moreover, the\nexclusion of detritus and stoichiometric constraints in past studies lead to\nunderestimations of indirect effects and retroactions. While additional work is\nneeded to incorporate complementarity between detritivores, it is essential to\ntake into account these mechanisms in models in order to improve the\nunderstanding of soil food web functioning.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 10 Sep 2018 22:11:40 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 11 Feb 2019 19:01:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-13", "authors_parsed": [["Laigle", "Idaline", ""], ["Aubin", "Isabelle", ""], ["Gravel", "Dominique", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.03732", "submitter": "Jos\\'e Manuel Aburto", "authors": "Adam Lenart, Jos\\'e Manuel Aburto, Anders Stockmarr, James W.

In this work we assume that both strategy\nlearning methods are present and compete for space within the framework of a\ncoevolutionary model. Our results reveal that the presence of payoff-driven\nstrategy learning method becomes exclusive for high succer's payoff and/or high\ntemptation values that represent a snowdrift game dilemma situation. In\ngeneral, however, the competition of the mentioned strategy learning methods\ncould be useful to enlarge the parameter space where only cooperators prevail.\nThis success of cooperation is based on the enforced coordination of cooperator\nplayers which reveals the benefit of the latter strategy. Interestingly, the\npayoff-based and the conformity-based cooperator players can form an effective\nalliance against defectors that can also extend the parameter space of full\ncooperator solution in the stag-hunt game region. Our work highlights that the\ncoevolution of strategies and individual features such as learning method can\nprovide novel type of pattern formation mechanism that cannot be observed in a\nstatic model, hence remains hidden in traditional models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 13 Sep 2018 17:40:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-14", "authors_parsed": [["Szolnoki", "Attila", ""], ["Chen", "Xiaojie", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.05621", "submitter": "Ludmil Zikatanov", "authors": "Katherine Y.

While ordinary differential equations are widely used for\ntheir simplicity, they incorporate an exponential distribution for time spent\nexposed or infectious. This allows for a high probability of unrealistically\nshort exposed and infectious time periods. We propose that caution must be\ntaken when applying intervention methods to basic models in order to avoid\ninaccurate predictions. Delay differential equations, which use a delta\ndistribution for exposed and infectious periods, can provide better realism but\nare more difficult to use and analyze. We introduce a multi-infected\ncompartment model to interpolate between an ODE model with exponential\ndistributions and a DDE model with delta distributions in order to investigate\nthe effect these distributions have on the dynamics of the system when an\nintervention method is also included. Using steady state stability and\nbifurcation analysis, this paper considers when simpler infectious disease\nmodels can be used versus when more realistic time periods must be\nincorporated. We find that the placement of control measures on subpopulations\nand the length of the time delay impacts the accuracy of the simpler models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2018 16:24:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Bingham", "Adrienna", ""], ["Shaw", "Leah B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1809.11030", "submitter": "Andrea De Martino", "authors": "Andrea De Martino, Thomas Gueudr\\'e, Mattia Miotto", "title": "Exploration-exploitation tradeoffs dictate the optimal distributions of\n  phenotypes for populations subject to fitness fluctuations", "comments": "13 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.
