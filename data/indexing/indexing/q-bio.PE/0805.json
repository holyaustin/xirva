In this\nwork, we explore evolutionary, spatial PD systems consisting of two types of\nagents, each with a certain update (reproduction, learning) rule.

We show that in a well-mixed\npopulation the evolutionary outcome is always full defection.

We address this question using a microscopic, protein-level,\nsequence-based model of humoral immune response with explicitly defined\ninteractions between Immunoglobulins, host and pathogen proteins. Potent\nImmunoglobulins are discovered in this model via clonal selection and affinity\nmaturation. Possible outcomes of an infection (extinction of cells, survival\nwith complete elimination of viruses, or persistent infection) crucially depend\non mutation rates of viral and Immunoglobulin proteins. The model predicts that\nthere is an optimal Somatic Hypermutation (SHM) rate close to experimentally\nobserved 10-3 per nucleotide per replication. Further, we developed an\nanalytical theory which explains the physical reason for an optimal SHM program\nas a compromise between deleterious effects of random mutations on nascent\nmaturing Immunoglobulins (adversity) and the need to generate diverse pool of\nmutated antibodies from which highly potent ones can be drawn (diversity). The\ntheory explains such effects as dependence of B cell fate on affinity for an\nincoming antigen, ceiling in affinity of mature antibodies, Germinal Center\nsizes and maturation times. The theory reveals the molecular factors which\ndetermine the efficiency of affinity maturation, providing insight into\nvariability of immune response to cytopathic (direct response by germline\nantibodies) and poorly cytopathic viruses (crucial role of SHM in response).\nThese results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of microscopic\nsequence-based models of immune system, where population dynamics of evolving\nImmunoglobulins is explicitly tied to their molecular properties.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 25 May 2008 17:26:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-27", "authors_parsed": [["Heo", "Muyoung", ""], ["Zeldovich", "Konstantin B.", ""], ["Shakhnovich", "Eugene I.", ""]]}, {"id": "0805.3851", "submitter": "James P.
