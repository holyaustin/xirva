From these rules, the net rate of change for each species\ncan be derived. The modeling schema can therefore be understood as both an\nepistemic and practical heuristic for modeling, serving both as an\norganizational framework for the model building process and as a mechanism for\nderiving ODEs.

While\nselection is certainly responsible for the spread and maintenance of complex\nphenotypes, this does not automatically imply that strong selection enhances\nthe chance for the emergence of novel traits, that is, the origination of\ncomplexity. Population size is one parameter that alters the relative\nimportance of adaptive and non-adaptive processes: as population size\ndecreases, selection weakens and genetic drift grows in importance. Because of\nthis relationship, many theories invoke a role for population size in the\nevolution of complexity. Such theories are difficult to test empirically\nbecause of the time required for the evolution of complexity in biological\npopulations. Here, we used digital experimental evolution to test whether large\nor small asexual populations tend to evolve greater complexity. We find that\nboth small and large---but not intermediate-sized---populations are favored to\nevolve larger genomes, which provides the opportunity for subsequent increases\nin phenotypic complexity. However, small and large populations followed\ndifferent evolutionary paths towards these novel traits. Small populations\nevolved larger genomes by fixing slightly deleterious insertions, while large\npopulations fixed rare beneficial insertions that increased genome size. These\nresults demonstrate that genetic drift can lead to the evolution of complexity\nin small populations and that purifying selection is not powerful enough to\nprevent the evolution of complexity in large populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 13:36:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-17", "authors_parsed": [["LaBar", "Thomas", ""], ["Adami", "Christoph", ""]]}, {"id": "1604.06300", "submitter": "Serge Sheremet'ev", "authors": "Serge Sheremet'ev, Xenia Chebotareva", "title": "Current and Cretaceous-Cenozoic diversification of Angiosperms", "comments": "51 pp with 18 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cretaceous-Cenozoic history of angiosperms led to the a certain character of\nthe distribution of taxa of different levels (the number of species and genera\nin families, species/genera ratio in families, the number of species in the\ngenera).
