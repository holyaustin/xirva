The recent growth in the number of\nhybridization network reconstruction algorithms has led to an increasing\ninterest in the definition of metrics for their comparison that can be used to\nassess the accuracy or robustness of these methods. In this paper we establish\nsome basic results that make it possible the generalization to tree-child time\nconsistent (TCTC) hybridization networks of some of the oldest known metrics\nfor phylogenetic trees: those based on the comparison of the vectors of path\nlengths between leaves. More specifically, we associate to each hybridization\nnetwork a suitably defined vector of `splitted' path lengths between its\nleaves, and we prove that if two TCTC hybridization networks have the same such\nvectors, then they must be isomorphic. Thus, comparing these vectors by means\nof a metric for real-valued vectors defines a metric for TCTC hybridization\nnetworks. We also consider the case of fully resolved hybridization networks,\nwhere we prove that simpler, `non-splitted' vectors can be used.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jul 2008 09:13:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-07-06", "authors_parsed": [["Cardona", "Gabriel", ""], ["Llabres", "Merce", ""], ["Rossello", "Francesc", ""], ["Valiente", "Gabriel", ""]]}, {"id": "0807.0122", "submitter": "Tobias Reichenbach", "authors": "Tobias Reichenbach and Erwin Frey", "title": "Instability of spatial patterns and its ambiguous impact on species\n  diversity", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures and supplementary information.
