R{\\'e}sum{\\'e}. The aim\nof this article is to propose on the one hand a brief history of modeling\nstarting from the works of Fibonacci, Robert Malthus, Pierre Francis Verhulst\nand then Vito Volterra and, on the other hand, to present the main hypotheses\nof the very famous but very little known predator-prey model elaborated in the\n1920s by Volterra in order to solve a problem posed by his son-in-law, Umberto\nD'Ancona. It is thus shown that, contrary to a widely-held notion, Volterra's\nmodel is realistic and his seminal work laid the groundwork for modern\npopulation dynamics and mathematical ecology, including seasonality, migration,\npollution and more. 1. A short history of modeling 1.1. The Malthusian model.\nIf the rst scientic view of population growth seems to be that of Leonardo\nFibonacci [2], also called Leonardo of Pisa, whose famous sequence of numbers\nwas presented in his Liber abaci (1202) as a solution to a population growth\nproblem, the modern foundations of population dynamics clearly date from Thomas\nRobert Malthus [20]. Considering an ideal population consisting of a single\nhomogeneous animal species, that is, neglecting the variations in age, size and\nany periodicity for birth or mortality, and which lives alone in an invariable\nenvironment or coexists with other species without any direct or indirect\ninuence, he founded in 1798, with his celebrated claim Population, when\nunchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio, the paradigm of exponential\ngrowth. This consists in assuming that the increase of the number N (t) of\nindividuals of this population, during a short interval of time, is\nproportional to N (t). This translates to the following dierential equation :\n(1) dN (t) dt = $\\epsilon$N (t) where $\\epsilon$ is a constant factor of\nproportionality that represents the growth coe-cient or growth rate. By\nintegrating (1) we obtain the law of exponential growth or law of Malthusian\ngrowth (see Fig. 1).

While details of update rules can have\nsignificant impacts on the evolutionary outcomes and many variations in\nimitation-led updates are thus studied, however, few variations exist in\naspiration-led updates. We introduce an aspiration-led update mechanism\n(\"Satisfied-Defect, Unsatisfied-Cooperate\") that is psychologically intuitive\nand can yield a behavior richer than the conventional aspiration-led update\ndoes in Prisoner's Dilemma games. Using analytical and numerical methods, we\nstudy and link the stochastic dynamics of it in well-mixed finite populations\nand the deterministic dynamics of infinite populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Aug 2018 11:16:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2018 16:41:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 9 Nov 2018 17:46:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 14 Nov 2018 15:09:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2018 11:15:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Lim", "Ik Soo", ""], ["Wittek", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10591", "submitter": "Jessica Liebig", "authors": "Jessica Liebig, Cassie Jansen, Dean Paini, Lauren Gardner, Raja Jurdak", "title": "A global model for predicting the arrival of imported dengue infections", "comments": "32 pages, 20 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0225193", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.SI physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  With approximately half of the world's population at risk of contracting\ndengue, this mosquito-borne disease is of global concern. International\ntravellers significantly contribute to dengue's rapid and large-scale spread by\nimporting the disease from endemic into non-endemic countries. To prevent\nfuture outbreaks and dengue from establishing in non-endemic countries,\nknowledge about the arrival time and location of infected travellers is\ncrucial. We propose a network model that predicts the monthly number of\ndengue-infected air passengers arriving at any given airport. We consider\ninternational air travel volumes to construct weighted networks, representing\npassenger flows between airports. We further calculate the probability of\npassengers, who travel through the international air transport network, being\ninfected with dengue. The probability of being infected depends on the\ndestination, duration and timing of travel. Our findings shed light onto dengue\nimportation routes and reveal country-specific reporting rates that have been\nuntil now largely unknown. This paper provides important new knowledge about\nthe spreading dynamics of dengue that is highly beneficial for public health\nauthorities to strategically allocate the often limited resources to more\nefficiently prevent the spread of dengue.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Aug 2018 04:03:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 14 Dec 2018 04:08:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:24:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Liebig", "Jessica", ""], ["Jansen", "Cassie", ""], ["Paini", "Dean", ""], ["Gardner", "Lauren", ""], ["Jurdak", "Raja", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.10809", "submitter": "Johannes Wirtz", "authors": "Johannes Wirtz and Thomas Wiehe", "title": "The Evolving Moran Genealogy", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the evolution of the population genealogy in the classic neutral\nMoran Model of finite size and in discrete time.
