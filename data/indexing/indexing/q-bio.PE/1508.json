This deceptively simple question has important consequences\nfor ecosystems, because systems with alternative stable states can undergo\ndramatic regime shifts. The probability, frequency, duration, and dynamics of\nthese shifts will all depend on the relative stability of the stable states.\nUnfortunately, the concept of stability in ecology has suffered from\nsubstantial confusion and this is particularly problematic for systems where\nstochastic perturbations can cause shifts between coexisting alternative stable\nstates. A useful way to visualize stable states in stochastic systems is with a\nball-in-cup diagram, in which the state of the system is represented as the\nposition of a ball rolling on a surface, and the random perturbations can push\nthe ball from one basin of attraction to another. The surface is determined by\na potential function, which provides a natural stability metric. However,\nsystems amenable to this representation, called gradient systems, are quite\nrare. As a result, the potential function is not widely used and other\napproaches based on linear stability analysis have become standard. Linear\nstability analysis is designed for local analysis of deterministic systems and,\nas we show, can produce a highly misleading picture of how the system will\nbehave under continual, stochastic perturbations. In this paper, we show how\nthe potential function can be generalized so that it can be applied broadly,\nemploying a concept from stochastic analysis called the quasi-potential.

There are two questions regarding\nbipedalism: i) why were the earliest hominins partially bipedal? and ii) why\ndid hominins become increasingly bipedal over time and replace their less\nbipedal ancestors? To answer these questions, the prominent theories in the\nfield, such as the savanna-based theory, the postural feeding hypotheses, and\nthe provisioning model, are collectively examined. Because biological evolution\nis an example of trial and error and not a simple causation, there may be\nmultiple answers to the evolution of bipedalism. The postural feeding\nhypothesis (reaching for food/balancing) provides an explanation for the\npartial bipedalism of the earliest hominins. The savannah-based theory\ndescribes how the largely bipedal hominins that started to settle on the ground\nbecame increasingly bipedal. The provisioning model (food-gathering/monogamy)\nexplains questions arising after the postural feeding hypothesis and before the\nsavannah theory in an evolutionary timeline. Indeed, there are no straight\nlines between the theories, and multiple forces could have pushed the evolution\nof bipedalism at different points. Finally, this manuscript states that the\narboreal hominins that possessed ambiguous traits of bipedalism were eliminated\nthrough choice and selection. Using the biological analogy of the okapi and\ngiraffe, I explain how one of the branches (Homo) became increasingly bipedal\nwhile the other (Pan) adapted to locomotion for forest life by narrowing the\nanatomical/biological focus in evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 9 Aug 2015 08:43:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 17 Oct 2015 16:48:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-10-20", "authors_parsed": [["Ko", "Kwang Hyun", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.02906", "submitter": "Tom Nye", "authors": "Tom M.

However, a challenge that has been overlooked is that, as a\ndisease becomes more prevalent, it can limit the availability of the capital\nneeded to effectively treat those who have fallen ill. Here we use a simple\nmathematical model to gain insight into the dynamics of an epidemic when the\nrecovery of sick individuals depends on the availability of healing resources\nthat are generated by the healthy population. We find that epidemics spiral out\nof control into \"explosive\" spread if the cost of recovery is above a critical\ncost. This can occur even when the disease would die out without the resource\nconstraint. The onset of explosive epidemics is very sudden, exhibiting a\ndiscontinuous transition under very general assumptions. We find analytical\nexpressions for the critical cost and the size of the explosive jump in\ninfection levels in terms of the parameters that characterize the spreading\nprocess. Our model and results apply beyond epidemics to contagion dynamics\nthat self-induce constraints on recovery, thereby amplifying the spreading\nprocess.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 09:00:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-17", "authors_parsed": [["B\u00f6ttcher", "Lucas", ""], ["Woolley-Meza", "Olivia", ""], ["Ara\u00fajo", "Nuno A.

Baboons then take excursions outside of\nthe park to raid crops for food, conflicting with the human population. We\nmodel the interactions of mesopredators (baboons), apex predators and shared\nprey in the park to analyze how four components affect the proportion of time\nthat mesopredators choose to crop-raid: 1) the presence of apex predators; 2)\nnutritional quality of the crops; 3) mesopredator \"shyness\" about leaving the\npark; and 4) human hunting of mesopredators. We predict that the presence of\napex predators in the park is the most effective method for controlling\nmesopredator abundance, and hence significantly reduces their impact on crops.\nHuman hunting of mesopredators is less effective as it only occurs during\ncrop-raiding excursions. Furthermore, making crops less attractive, for\ninstance by planting crops further from the park boundary or farming less\nnutritional crops, can reduce the amount of time mesopredators crop-raid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 21:27:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-04-12", "authors_parsed": [["Taylor", "Rachel A.", ""], ["Ryan", "Sadie J.", ""], ["Brashares", "Justin S.", ""], ["Johnson", "Leah R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06672", "submitter": "John Rhodes", "authors": "James H.

Recent work showed that when selective\nenvironments vary in a systematic manner, it is possible that development can\nconstrain the phenotypic space in regions that are evolutionarily more\nadvantageous. Yet, the underlying mechanism that enables the spontaneous\nemergence of such adaptive developmental constraints is poorly understood. How\ncan natural selection, given its myopic and conservative nature, favour\ndevelopmental organisations that facilitate adaptive evolution in future\npreviously unseen environments? Such capacity suggests a form of\n\\textit{foresight} facilitated by the ability of evolution to accumulate and\nexploit information not only about the particular phenotypes selected in the\npast, but regularities in the environment that are also relevant to future\nenvironments. Here we argue that the ability of evolution to discover such\nregularities is analogous to the ability of learning systems to generalise from\npast experience. Conversely, the canalisation of evolved developmental\nprocesses to past selective environments and failure of natural selection to\nenhance evolvability in future selective environments is directly analogous to\nthe problem of over-fitting and failure to generalise in machine learning. We\nshow that this analogy arises from an underlying mechanistic equivalence by\nshowing that conditions corresponding to those that alleviate over-fitting in\nmachine learning enhance the evolution of generalised developmental\norganisations under natural selection. This equivalence provides access to a\nwell-developed theoretical framework that enables us to characterise the\nconditions where natural selection will find general rather than particular\nsolutions to environmental conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 13:37:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-28", "authors_parsed": [["Kouvaris", "Kostas", ""], ["Clune", "Jeff", ""], ["Kounios", "Louis", ""], ["Brede", "Markus", ""], ["Watson", "Richard A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07378", "submitter": "Dolph Schluter", "authors": "Dolph Schluter", "title": "Speciation, ecological opportunity, and latitude", "comments": "Based on a presidential address at the 2013 evolution conference of\n  the American Society of Naturalists in Snowbird, Utah", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Evolutionary hypotheses to explain the greater numbers of species in the\ntropics than the temperate zone include greater age and area, higher\ntemperature and metabolic rates, and greater ecological opportunity. These\nideas make contrasting predictions about the relationship between speciation\nprocesses and latitude, which I elaborate and evaluate. Available data suggest\nthat per capita speciation rates are currently highest in the temperate zone,\nand that diversification rates (speciation minus extinction) are similar\nbetween latitudes. In contrast, clades whose oldest analyzed dates precede the\nEocene thermal maximum, when the extent of the tropics was much greater than\ntoday, tend to show highest speciation and diversification rates in the\ntropics. These findings are consistent with age and area, which is alone among\nhypotheses in predicting a time trend. Higher recent speciation rates in the\ntemperate zone than the tropics suggest an additional response to high\necological opportunity associated with low species diversity. These broad\npatterns are compelling but provide limited insights into underlying\nmechanisms, arguing that studies of speciation processes along the latitudinal\ngradient will be vital. Using threespine stickleback in depauperate northern\nlakes as an example, I show how high ecological opportunity can lead to rapid\nspeciation. The results support a role for ecological opportunity in\nspeciation, but its importance in the evolution of the latitudinal gradient\nremains uncertain. I conclude that per-capita evolutionary rates are no longer\nhigher in the tropics than the temperate zone. Nevertheless, the vast numbers\nof species that have already accumulated in the tropics ensure that total rate\nof species production remains highest there. Thus, tropical evolutionary\nmomentum helps to perpetuate the steep latitudinal biodiversity gradient.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2015 23:52:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 15:06:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Schluter", "Dolph", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.07616", "submitter": "Stephen Pankavich", "authors": "Stephen Pankavich and Deborah Shutt", "title": "An in-host model of HIV incorporating latent infection and viral\n  mutation", "comments": "10 pages, 7 figures, Proceedings of AIMS Conference on Differential\n  Equations and Dynamical Systems (2015)", "journal-ref": "Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications, AIMS\n  Proceedings, 2015 pp. 913-922", "doi": "10.3934/proc.2015.0913", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We construct a seven-component model of the in-host dynamics of the Human\nImmunodeficiency Virus Type-1 (i.e, HIV) that accounts for latent infection and\nthe propensity of viral mutation.
