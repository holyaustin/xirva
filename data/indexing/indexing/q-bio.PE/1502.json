By\n~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred\nthroughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this\ntime were descended not only from the preceding eastern European\nhunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry. Western and\nEastern Europe came into contact ~4,500 years ago, as the Late Neolithic Corded\nWare people from Germany traced ~3/4 of their ancestry to the Yamnaya,\ndocumenting a massive migration into the heartland of Europe from its eastern\nperiphery. This steppe ancestry persisted in all sampled central Europeans\nuntil at least ~3,000 years ago, and is ubiquitous in present-day Europeans.\nThese results provide support for the theory of a steppe origin of at least\nsome of the Indo-European languages of Europe.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Feb 2015 05:25:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-19", "authors_parsed": [["Haak", "Wolfgang", ""], ["Lazaridis", "Iosif", ""], ["Patterson", "Nick", ""], ["Rohland", "Nadin", ""], ["Mallick", "Swapan", ""], ["Llamas", "Bastien", ""], ["Brandt", "Guido", ""], ["Nordenfelt", "Susanne", ""], ["Harney", "Eadaoin", ""], ["Stewardson", "Kristin", ""], ["Fu", "Qiaomei", ""], ["Mittnik", "Alissa", ""], ["B\u00e1nffy", "Eszter", ""], ["Economou", "Christos", ""], ["Francken", "Michael", ""], ["Friederich", "Susanne", ""], ["Pena", "Rafael Garrido", ""], ["Hallgren", "Fredrik", ""], ["Khartanovich", "Valery", ""], ["Khokhlov", "Aleksandr", ""], ["Kunst", "Michael", ""], ["Kuznetsov", "Pavel", ""], ["Meller", "Harald", ""], ["Mochalov", "Oleg", ""], ["Moiseyev", "Vayacheslav", ""], ["Nicklisch", "Nicole", ""], ["Pichler", "Sandra L.", ""], ["Risch", "Roberto", ""], ["Guerra", "Manuel A.

Based on the\nanalysis of age-dependent changes in gene-expression and metabolic profiles in\nDrosophila melanogaster, we explicitly show that the underlying GRNs are nearly\ncritical and inherently unstable. This instability manifests itself as aging in\nthe form of distortion of gene expression and metabolic profiles with age, and\ncauses the characteristic increase in mortality rate with age as described by a\nform of the Gompertz law. In addition, we explain late-life mortality\ndeceleration observed at very late ages for large populations. We show that\naging contains a stochastic component, related to accumulation of regulatory\nerrors in transcription/translation/metabolic pathways due to imperfection of\nsignaling cascades in the network and of responses to environmental factors. We\nalso establish that there is a strong deterministic component, suggesting\ngenetic control.

However, a general theory\nof trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g., species\nthat differ in size) and gradients (e.g., temperature), has yet to be\nformulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory\nprovides the basis for such a theory it does not explicitly account for\ndifferences traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal\ntemperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling\napproaches into a framework that we term Trait Drivers Theory or TDT. It shows\nthat the shape and dynamics of trait distributions can be uniquely linked to\nfundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to\nfuture drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several\ntheoretical studies, recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic\ngradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences\necosystem productivity across an elevational gradient and a 140-year long\necological experiment. We argue that our general TDT provides a baseline for\n(i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness\nin terms of the shape of trait distributions; and (ii) integrating how specific\ntraits, including body size, and functional diversity scale up to influence the\ndynamics of species assemblages across climatic gradients and how shifts in\nfunctional composition influences ecosystem functioning. Further, it offers a\nnovel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness\nbased approaches in order to build a more predictive functional biogeography to\nshow how assemblages of species have and will respond to climate change.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 21:09:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Enquist", "Brian J.", ""], ["Norberg", "Jon", ""], ["Bonser", "Stephen P.", ""], ["Violle", "Cyrille", ""], ["Webb", "Colleen T.", ""], ["Henderson", "Amanda", ""], ["Sloat", "Lindsey L.", ""], ["Savage", "Van M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.06880", "submitter": "Gabor Vattay", "authors": "Gabor Vattay, Dennis Salahub, Istvan Csabai, Ali Nassimi and Stuart A.\n  Kaufmann", "title": "Quantum Criticality at the Origin of Life", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "2015 J.
