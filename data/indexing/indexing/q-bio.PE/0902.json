It can have immediate\nimplications for many dynamical properties, such as robustness and plasticity.\nBased on recent work here I give a nontechnical brief review of this powerful\nquantitative concept in biology. This concept was initially proposed by S\nWright 70 years ago, re-introduced by one of the founders of molecular biology\nand by others in different biological contexts. It was apparently forgotten by\nmainstream modern biologists for many years. Currently, this concept has found\nits increasingly important role in the development of systems biology and the\nmodeling of bionetwork dynamics, from phage lambda genetic switch to endogenous\nnetwork of cancer genesis and progression. It is an ideal quantify to describe\nthe robustness and stability of bionetworks. I will first introduce five\nlandmark proposals in biology on this concept, to demonstrate the important\ncommon thread in its theoretical biology development. Then I will discuss a few\nrecent results, focusing on the work showing the logical consistency of\nadaptive landscape. From the perspective of a working scientist and of what\nneeded for a dynamical theory when confronting empirical data, the adaptive\nlandscape is useful both metaphorically and quantitatively and has captured an\nessential aspect of biological dynamical processes.

Spray cycles are scheduled at intervals two days short of the\nfirst interlarval period and halted once the last of the female flies that\noriginated from pre-spray-deposited pupae have been sprayed twice. The effect\nof temperature on the aerial spraying of tsetse, through its reproductive cycle\nand general population dynamics, is of particular interest, given that cooler\nweather is preferred for the settling of insecticidal droplets. Spray efficacy\nis found to come at a price due to the greater number of cycles necessitated by\ncooler weather. The extra cost is argued to be worth while. Pupae, still in the\nground at the end of spraying, are identified as the main threat to a\nsuccessful operation. They are slightly more vulnerable at the low temperature\nextreme of tsetse habitat (16 $^\\circ$C), when the cumulative, natural pupal\nmortality is high.

The result is valid for any\nbranching process with a finite number of types; the only assumption required\nis that of independent individual evolutions. The problem under consideration\nis motivated by applications in the area of cell biology. Specifically, the\nreported limiting results are of advantage in cell kinetics studies where the\nrelative frequencies but not the absolute cell counts are accessible to\nmeasurement. Relevant statistical applications are discussed in the context of\nasymptotic maximum likelihood inference for multitype branching processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Feb 2009 09:12:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Yakovlev", "Andrei Y.", ""], ["Yanev", "Nikolay M.", ""]]}]
