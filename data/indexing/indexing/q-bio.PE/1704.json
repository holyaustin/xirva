A typical example is the evolution of mating systems in plant\nspecies. In this work, we present a probabilistic modeling framework for binary\ntrait, random species trees, in which the number of species and their traits\nare represented by a two-type, continuous time Markov branching process. We\ndevelop our model by considering the impact of mating systems on dN/dS, the\nratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions. A methodology is introduced\nwhich enables us to match model parameters with parameter estimates from\nphylogenetic tree data. The properties obtained from the model are applied to\noutcrossing and selfing species trees in the Geraniaceae and Solanaceae family.\nThis allows us to investigate not only the branching tree rates, but also the\nmutation rates and the intensity of selection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 15:54:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-04", "authors_parsed": [["Tahir", "Daniah", ""], ["Gl\u00e9min", "Sylvain", ""], ["Lascoux", "Martin", ""], ["Kaj", "Ingemar", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.00301", "submitter": "Nadav M.

We show that enhanced public cooperation emerges only\nwhen a significant edge overlap is combined with at least one layer being able\nto sustain some cooperation by means of a sufficiently high synergy factor. In\nthe absence of either of these conditions, the evolution of cooperation in\nmultiplex networks is determined by the bounds of traditional network\nreciprocity with no enhanced resilience. These results caution against overly\noptimistic predictions that the presence of multiple social domains may in\nitself promote cooperation, and they help us better understand the complexity\nbehind prosocial behavior in layered social systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 20:54:30 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 09:27:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 11:50:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-13", "authors_parsed": [["Battiston", "Federico", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""], ["Latora", "Vito", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04553", "submitter": "Hugh Trenchard Mr.", "authors": "Hugh Trenchard, Carlton Brett, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Trilobite \"pelotons\": Possible hydrodynamic drag effects between leading\n  and following trilobites in trilobite queues", "comments": "27 pages, 7 figures, 1 table; accepted for publication in\n  Palaeontology", "journal-ref": "Palaeontology 60, 557-569 (2017)", "doi": "10.1111/pala.12301", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Energy saving mechanisms in nature allow following organisms to expend less\nenergy than leaders.

To interpret these findings, we\nneed to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population\ngenetics processes-notably, by mutation, natural selection and genetic drift.\nBecause many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and\ngenetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model\nthe genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing\nselection in a multi-dimensional trait space. We solve the model for the\nphenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust,\nclosed form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our\nresults provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it\nvaries among traits. They also predict that the distribution of variances\ncontributed by loci identified in GWAS is well approximated by a simple\nfunctional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution\nto genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test\nthis prediction against the results of GWAS for height and BMI and find that it\nfits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of\npleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to\nexplain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than\nsimilarly-sized GWAS for BMI, and to predict the increase in explained\nheritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of\nEuropean populations, in which these GWAS were performed, we further find that\nmost of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose\nduring the out of Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around\n$s=10^{-3}$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 20:22:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 7 Dec 2017 18:12:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-29", "authors_parsed": [["Simons", "Yuval B.", ""], ["Bullaughey", "Kevin", ""], ["Hudson", "Richard R.", ""], ["Sella", "Guy", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.06831", "submitter": "Shubhanshu Shekhar", "authors": "Shubhanshu Shekhar, Sebastien Roch and Siavash Mirarab", "title": "Species tree estimation using ASTRAL: how many genes are enough?", "comments": "22 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for oral presentation at RECOMB 2017;\n  Under review at IEEE TCBB", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/TCBB.2017.2757930", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.CE math.PR math.ST stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Species tree reconstruction from genomic data is increasingly performed using\nmethods that account for sources of gene tree discordance such as incomplete\nlineage sorting.

Operationally, health workers\nand surveillance teams treated cases, collected genetic samples, and tracked\ncase contacts. Despite the substantial progress in analyzing and modeling EBOV\nepidemiological data, a complete characterization of the spatiotemporal spread\nof Ebola cases remains a challenge. In this work, we offer a novel perspective\non the EBOV epidemic that utilizes virus genome sequences to inform\npopulation-level, spatial models. Calibrated to phylogenetic linkages, these\ndynamic spatial models provide unique insight into the disease mobility of EBOV\nin Sierra Leone. Further, we developed a model selection framework that\nidentifies important epidemiological variables influencing the spatiotemporal\npropagation of EBOV. Consistent with other investigations, our results show\nthat the spread of EBOV during the beginning and middle portions of the\nepidemic strongly depended on the size of and distance between populations. Our\nanalysis also revealed a substantial decline in the dependence on population\nsize at the end of the epidemic, coinciding with the large-scale intervention\ncampaign: Operation Western Area Surge. More generally, we believe this\nframework, pairing molecular diagnostics with dynamic models, has the potential\nto be a powerful forecasting tool along with offering operationally-relevant\nguidance for surveillance and sampling strategies during an epidemic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 19:02:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-13", "authors_parsed": [["Gustafson", "Kyle B.", ""], ["Proctor", "Joshua L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08098", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Matjaz Perc", "title": "High-performance parallel computing in the classroom using the public\n  goods game as an example", "comments": "7 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in European\n  Journal of Physics [supplementary material available at\n  http://github.com/matjazperc/pgg]", "journal-ref": "Eur.

Monte Carlo methods\nform a particularly important class of numerical methods for solving problems\nin statistical physics. Although these methods are simple in principle, their\nproper use requires a good command of statistical mechanics, as well as\nconsiderable computational resources. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate\nhow the usage of widely accessible graphics cards on personal computers can\nelevate the computing power in Monte Carlo simulations by orders of magnitude,\nthus allowing live classroom demonstration of phenomena that would otherwise be\nout of reach. As an example, we use the public goods game on a square lattice\nwhere two strategies compete for common resources in a social dilemma\nsituation. We show that the second-order phase transition to an absorbing phase\nin the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class, and we\ncompare the time needed to arrive at this result by means of the main processor\nand by means of a suitable graphics card. Parallel computing on graphics\nprocessing units has been developed actively during the last decade, to the\npoint where today the learning curve for entry is anything but steep for those\nfamiliar with programming. The subject is thus ripe for inclusion in graduate\nand advanced undergraduate curricula, and we hope that this paper will\nfacilitate this process in the realm of physics education. To that end, we\nprovide a documented source code for an easy reproduction of presented results\nand for further development of Monte Carlo simulations of similar systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Apr 2017 15:28:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Perc", "Matjaz", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.08583", "submitter": "Roberto Alamino", "authors": "Roberto C.
