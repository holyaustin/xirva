The (collective) optimal strategy involves a singular\narc, which has some resource saving feature and may, on the long-term, lead to\nan equilibrium. However, it is susceptible to invasion by a greedy mutant which\nfree-rides on this resource saving strategy. Therefore, the \"optimal\" strategy\nis not evolutionarily stable. We thus look for an evolutionarily stable\nstrategy, using the first ESS condition (\"Nash-Wardrop condition\").

Is the punishment inevitably a selfish behaviour\nor an altruistic behaviour? The motivations behind punishment are still an\nenigma.

The sign of these rates allows us to separate regions in the\nspace of parameters where the end state is either a single community or a\ncomplex set containing more than one community. We have also built up\nanalytical approximations to the time evolution of species abundances that\nallow us to determine, with high accuracy, the sequence of extinctions that an\ninvasion may cause. Finally we apply this analysis to obtain the communities in\nthe end states.

This model is based on the construction of\nan assembly graph containing all viable configurations of the community, and\nthe definition of a Markov chain whose transitions are the transformations of\ncommunities by new species invasions. In the present paper we provide an\nexhaustive numerical analysis of the model, describing the average time to the\nrecurrent state, the statistics of avalanches, and the dependence of the\nresults on the amount of available resource. Our results are based on the fact\nthat the Markov chain provides an asymptotic probability distribution for the\nrecurrent states, which can be used to obtain averages of observables as well\nas the time variation of these magnitudes during succession, in an exact\nmanner. Since the absorption times into the recurrent set are found to be\ncomparable to the size of the system, the end state is quickly reached (in\nunits of the invasion time). Thus, the final ecosystem can be regarded as a\nfluctuating complex system where species are continually replaced by newcomers\nwithout ever leaving the set of recurrent patterns. The assembly graph is\ndominated by pathways in which most invasions are accepted, triggering small\nextinction avalanches. Through the assembly process, communities become less\nresilient (e.g., have a higher return time to equilibrium) but become more\nrobust in terms of resistance against new invasions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Jun 2010 10:43:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 22 Sep 2010 11:50:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-02-18", "authors_parsed": [["Capitan", "Jose A.", ""], ["Cuesta", "Jose A.", ""], ["Bascompte", "Jordi", ""]]}, {"id": "1006.5737", "submitter": "Ganna Rozhnova", "authors": "Ganna Rozhnova and Ana Nunes", "title": "Stochastic effects in a seasonally forced epidemic model", "comments": "13 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Phys.
