A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found\nadequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,\nhowever, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model\nfor describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly\ncomplex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to\nexplore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring\nby females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females\nin the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the\nproportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the\nTrivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment\nstrategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the\ntwo strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily\ndecreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed\nmales attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,\nthe TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of\nthe TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological\ncondition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not\nlarge, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the\ndifference increases. However, beyond a critical value of the difference, the\nTW strategy is found to be less and less likely to succeed as the difference\nbecomes larger.
