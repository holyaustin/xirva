The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among\nrandom mutations is an essential component of every evolutionary model and a\nmathematical portrait of robustness. Recent experiments on five viral species\nall revealed a characteristic bimodal shaped DFE, featuring peaks at neutrality\nand lethality. However, the phenotypic causes underlying observed fitness\neffects are still unknown, and presumably thought to vary unpredictably from\none mutation to another. By combining population genetics simulations with a\nsimple biophysical protein folding model, we show that protein thermodynamic\nstability accounts for a large fraction of observed mutational effects. We\nassume that moderately destabilizing mutations inflict a fitness penalty\nproportional to the reduction in folded protein, which depends continuously on\nfolding free energy (\\Delta G). Most mutations in our model affect fitness by\naltering \\Delta G, while, based on simple estimates, \\approx10% abolish\nactivity and are unconditionally lethal. Mutations pushing \\Delta G>0 are also\nconsidered lethal. Contrary to neutral network theory, we find that, in\nmutation/selection/drift steady-state, high mutation rates (m) lead to less\nstable proteins and a more dispersed DFE, i.e. less mutational robustness.\nSmall population size (N) also decreases stability and robustness. In our\nmodel, a continuum of non-lethal mutations reduces fitness by \\approx2% on\naverage, while \\approx10-35% of mutations are lethal, depending on N and m.\nCompensatory mutations are common in small populations with high mutation\nrates.

Best understood is neutral genetic variation at a single\nlocus, but additional insights can be gained by investigating genetic variation\nat multiple loci. The corresponding patterns of variation reflect linkage\ndisequilibrium and provide information about the underlying multi-locus gene\ngenealogies. The statistical properties of two-locus genealogies have been\nintensively studied for populations of constant census size, as well as for\nsimple demographic histories such as exponential population growth, and single\nbottlenecks.

To understand the interactive effects of environmental\nstochasticity, spatial heterogeneity, and dispersal on population growth, we\nstudy the following model for population abundances in $n$ patches: the\nconditional law of $X_{t+dt}$ given $X_t=x$ is such that when $dt$ is small the\nconditional mean of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ is approximately $[x^i\\mu_i+\\sum_j(x^j\nD_{ji}-x^i D_{ij})]dt$, where $X_t^i$ and $\\mu_i$ are the abundance and per\ncapita growth rate in the $i$-th patch respectivly, and $D_{ij}$ is the\ndispersal rate from the $i$-th to the $j$-th patch, and the conditional\ncovariance of $X_{t+dt}^i-X_t^i$ and $X_{t+dt}^j-X_t^j$ is approximately $x^i\nx^j \\sigma_{ij}dt$. We show for such a spatially extended population that if\n$S_t=(X_t^1+...+X_t^n)$ is the total population abundance, then $Y_t=X_t/S_t$,\nthe vector of patch proportions, converges in law to a random vector $Y_\\infty$\nas $t\\to\\infty$, and the stochastic growth rate $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty}t^{-1}\\log\nS_t$ equals the space-time average per-capita growth rate\n$\\sum_i\\mu_i\\E[Y_\\infty^i]$ experienced by the population minus half of the\nspace-time average temporal variation $\\E[\\sum_{i,j}\\sigma_{ij}Y_\\infty^i\nY_\\infty^j]$ experienced by the population. We derive analytic results for the\nlaw of $Y_\\infty$, find which choice of the dispersal mechanism $D$ produces an\noptimal stochastic growth rate for a freely dispersing population, and\ninvestigate the effect on the stochastic growth rate of constraints on\ndispersal rates. Our results provide fundamental insights into \"ideal free\"\nmovement in the face of uncertainty, the persistence of coupled sink\npopulations, the evolution of dispersal rates, and the single large or several\nsmall (SLOSS) debate in conservation biology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 11 May 2011 19:18:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 2 Feb 2012 05:50:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-16", "authors_parsed": [["Evans", "Steven N.", ""], ["Ralph", "Peter L.", ""], ["Schreiber", "Sebastian J.", ""], ["Sen", "Arnab", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.2803", "submitter": "Todd Young", "authors": "Bastien Fernandez and Todd R.

Despite their fundamental role in complex\nsystems, traveling waves remain elusive because they are often dominated by\nrare fluctuations in the wave tip, which have defied any rigorous analysis so\nfar. Here, we show that by adjusting nonlinear model details, noisy traveling\nwaves can be solved exactly. The moment equations of these tuned models are\nclosed and have a simple analytical structure resembling the deterministic\napproximation supplemented by a nonlocal cutoff term. The peculiar form of the\ncutoff shapes the noisy edge of traveling waves and is critical for the correct\nprediction of the wave speed and its fluctuations. Our approach is illustrated\nand benchmarked using the example of fitness waves arising in simple models of\nmicrobial evolution, which are highly sensitive to number fluctuations. We\ndemonstrate explicitly how these models can be tuned to account for finite\npopulation sizes and determine how quickly populations adapt as a function of\npopulation size and mutation rates. More generally, our method is shown to\napply to a broad class of models, in which number fluctuations are generated by\nbranching processes. Because of this versatility, the method of model tuning\nmay serve as a promising route toward unraveling universal properties of\ncomplex discrete particle systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 May 2011 15:17:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.5874", "submitter": "David McAvity", "authors": "David McAvity, Tristen Bristow, Eric Bunker, Alex Dreyer", "title": "Perception without Self-Matching in Conditional Tag Based Cooperation", "comments": "12 pages, 10 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology 333 (2013)", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider a model for the evolution of cooperation in a population where\nindividuals may have one of a number of different heritable and distinguishable\nmarkers or tags. Individuals interact with each of their neighbours on a square\nlattice by either cooperating by donating some benefit at a cost to themselves\nor defecting by doing nothing. The decision to cooperate or defect is\ncontingent on each individual's perception of its interacting partner's tag.\nUnlike in other tag-based models individuals do not compare their own tag to\nthat of their interaction partner. That is, there is no {\\em self-matching}.\nWhen perception is perfect the cooperation rate is substantially higher than in\nthe usual spatial prisoner's dilemma game when the cost of cooperation is high.\nThe enhancement in cooperation is positively correlated with the number of\ndifferent tags. The more diverse a population is the more cooperative it\nbecomes. When individuals start with an inability to perceive tags the\npopulation evolves to a state where individuals gain at least partial\nperception. With some reproduction mechanisms perfect perception evolves, but\nwith others the ability to perceive tags is imperfect. We find that perception\nof tags evolves to lower levels when the cost of cooperation is higher.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 May 2011 06:26:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 31 May 2011 04:07:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 9 Feb 2014 23:53:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["McAvity", "David", ""], ["Bristow", "Tristen", ""], ["Bunker", "Eric", ""], ["Dreyer", "Alex", ""]]}, {"id": "1105.6069", "submitter": "Armando G.
