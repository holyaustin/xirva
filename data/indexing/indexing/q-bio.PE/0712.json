We show that\nto achieve a criterion mean growth rate over an ensemble of conditions, the\ninternal variables must carry a minimum number of bits of information about\nthose conditions. Evolutionary competition thus can select for cellular\nmechanisms that are more efficient in an abstract, information theoretic sense.\nEstimates based on recent experiments suggest that the minimum information\nrequired for reasonable growth rates is close to the maximum information that\ncan be conveyed through biologically realistic regulatory mechanisms. These\nideas are applicable most directly to unicellular organisms, but there are\nanalogies to problems in higher organisms, and we suggest new experiments for\nboth cases.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Dec 2007 18:08:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Taylor", "Samuel F.", ""], ["Tishby", "Naftali", ""], ["Bialek", "William", ""]]}]
