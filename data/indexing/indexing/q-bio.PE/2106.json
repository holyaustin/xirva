Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these\nmodels contain only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and\ny terms. It has long been noticed that the basic reproduction number R has a\nvery simple formula (3.3) in terms of the matrices which define the model, and\nan explicit first integral formula (3.8) is also available. These results can\nbe traced back at least to [ABvdD+07] and [Fen07], respectively, and may be\nviewed as the \"basic laws of SIR-type epidemics\"; however many papers continue\nto reprove them in particular instances (by the next-generation matrix method\nor by direct computations, which are unnecessary). This motivated us to redraw\nthe attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of\nrelated formulas for (x, y, z) models. We propose to rebaptize the class to\nwhich they apply as matrix SIR epidemic models, abbreviated as SYR, to\nemphasize the similarity to the classic SIR case. For the case of one\nsusceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple\nprobabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time\nhas been replaced by a PH-type distribution. We note that to each SIR-PH model,\none may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies \"classic SIR\nrelations\", see (3.8). In the case of several susceptible classes, this\ngeneralizes to (5.10); in a future paper, we will show that (3.8), (5.10) may\nbe used to obtain approximate control policies which compare well with the\noptimal control of the original model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Jun 2021 11:06:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-02", "authors_parsed": [["Avram", "Florin", ""], ["Adenane", "Rim", ""], ["Ketcheson", "David I.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.00959", "submitter": "Pascal Klamser", "authors": "Pascal P.

A common, simplifying assumption of such collective movement\nmodels, is the consideration of individual agents moving with a constant speed.\nIn this work we critically re-asses this assumption underlying a vast majority\nof collective movement models. First, we show the omnipresent speed variability\nobserved in different species of live fish and artificial agents (RoboFish).\nBased on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia and rotational\nfriction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of\nindividuals on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We\ninvestigate how the interplay of variable speed and speed-dependent turning\naffects self-organized collective behavior by implementing an agent-based model\nwhich accounts for both effects. We show, that besides average speed, the\nindividual speed variability may have a dramatic impact on the emergent\ncollective dynamics, as two groups differing only in their speed variability,\nand being otherwise identical in all other behavioral parameters, can be in two\nfundamentally different stationary states. We find that the local coupling\nbetween group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the\norder-disorder transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in\npolarization with group size for groups of individuals with variable speed, and\na sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical group size (N=4 for\nVoronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all to\na distributed spatial interaction network.

We have accumulating pieces of evidence that\norganisms can transmit its information to the next generation via epigenetic\nstates or memes. Also, such idea is important for engineering applications.

While these seasonal trends are established in influenza and human\ncoronaviruses, the mechanisms driving the variation remain poorly understood\nand thus difficult to extend to similar viruses like SARS-CoV-2. In this study,\nwe use the Quadrature-based model of Respiratory Aerosol and Droplets (QuaRAD)\nto explore the sensitivity of airborne transmission to the seasonal variation\nin indoor relative humidity across the wide range of relevant conditions, using\nSARS-CoV-2 as an example. Relative humidity impacts the evaporation rate and\nequilibrium size of airborne particles, which in turn may impact particle\nremoval rates and virion viability. Across a large ensemble of scenarios, we\nfound that the dry indoor conditions typical of the winter season lead to\nslower inactivation than in the more humid summer season; in poorly ventilated\nspaces, this reduction in inactivation rates increases the concentration of\nactive virions, but this effect was important when the susceptible person was\nfarther than 2 m downwind of the infectious person. On the other hand, changes\nin particle settling velocity with relative humidity did not significantly\naffect the removal or travel distance of virus-laden scenarios.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 28 Jun 2021 21:10:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Robey", "Alison", ""], ["Fierce", "Laura", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15381", "submitter": "Spencer Thomas", "authors": "Spencer A.

Finally,\nwe introduce a double logistic model to describe the dynamic proportion of\nCOVID-19 deaths occurring in each setting.

Although high seroprevalence could\nhave been expected to trigger herd immunity and prevent further waves in the\nstate, we have observed persistent levels of infection after the first wave and\neventually the emergence of a second viral strain just before an augmented\nsecond wave. Our experiments suggest that the persistent levels of infection\nafter the first wave may be due to reinfection, whereas the higher peak at the\nsecond wave can be explained by the emergence of the second variant and a low\nlevel of cross-immunity between the original and the second variant. Finally,\nthe proposed model provides insights into the effect of reinfection and\ncross-immunity on the long-term spread of an unmitigated epidemic.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:30:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Arruda", "Edilson F.", ""], ["Pastore", "Dayse H.", ""], ["Dias", "Claudia M.", ""], ["Ourique", "Fabricio O.", ""]]}, {"id": "2106.15988", "submitter": "Stratis Tsirtsis", "authors": "Stratis Tsirtsis, Abir De, Lars Lorch, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez", "title": "Group Testing under Superspreading Dynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.LG q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Testing is recommended for all close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 patients.\nHowever, existing group testing methods are oblivious to the circumstances of\ncontagion provided by contact tracing.
