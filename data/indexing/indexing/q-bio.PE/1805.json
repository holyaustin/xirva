However, these kind of strategies usually do\nnot consider that medical institutes may have limited vaccine resources\navailable. In this manuscript, we explore the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered\n(SIR) model with local dynamic vaccination, and considering limited vaccines.\nIn this model, susceptibles in contact with an infected individual, are\nvaccinated -with probability $\\omega$- and then get infected -with probability\n$\\beta$. However, when the fraction of immunized individuals reaches a\nthreshold $V_L$, the vaccination stops, after which only the infection is\npossible. In the steady state, besides the critical points $\\beta_c$ and\n$\\omega_c$ that separate a non-epidemic from an epidemic phase, we find for a\nrange of $V_L$ another transition points, $\\beta^*>\\beta_c$ and\n$\\omega^*<\\omega_c$, which correspond to a novel discontinuous phase\ntransition. This critical value separates a phase where the amount of vaccines\nis sufficient, from a phase where the disease is strong enough to exhaust all\nthe vaccination units. For a disease with fixed $\\beta$, the vaccination\nprobability $\\omega$ can be controlled in order to drastically reduce the\nnumber of infected individuals, using efficiently the available vaccines.\n  Furthermore, the temporal evolution of the system close to $\\beta^*$ or\n$\\omega^*$, shows that after a peak of infection the system enters into a\nquasi-stationary state, with only a few infected cases. But if there are no\nmore vaccines, these few infected individuals could originate a second\noutbreak, represented by a second peak of infection. This state of apparent\ncalm, could be dangerous since it may lead to misleading conclusions and to an\nabandon of the strategies to control the disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 3 May 2018 22:51:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 28 May 2018 23:29:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 21 Aug 2018 15:56:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-22", "authors_parsed": [["Di Muro", "M.

In this paper, we investigate several problems\nthat arise in the context of computing the SNPR-distance. For a phylogenetic\ntree $T$ and a phylogenetic network $N$, we show how this distance can be\ncomputed by considering the set of trees that are embedded in $N$ and then use\nthis result to characterise the SNPR-distance between $T$ and $N$ in terms of\nagreement forests. Furthermore, we analyse properties of shortest\nSNPR-sequences between two phylogenetic networks $N$ and $N'$, and answer the\nquestion whether or not any of the classes of tree-child, reticulation-visible,\nor tree-based networks isometrically embeds into the class of all phylogenetic\nnetworks under SNPR.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 20 May 2018 23:25:28 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 5 Apr 2019 23:20:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Klawitter", "Jonathan", ""], ["Linz", "Simone", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.08046", "submitter": "Valerio Capraro", "authors": "Valerio Capraro", "title": "Women are slightly more cooperative than men (in one-shot Prisoner's\n  dilemma games played online)", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Differences between men and women have intrigued generations of social\nscientists, who have found that the two sexes behave differently in settings\nrequiring competition, risk taking, altruism, honesty, as well as many others.\nYet, little is known about whether there are gender differences in cooperative\nbehavior.

The interaction of predator and prey is described by the\nVariable Territory (VT) model with Allee effects in an Ordinary Differential\nEquation (ODE) framework. Climate influence is modeled in this ODE framework as\nan exogenous driver which affects the prey growth rate. Mathematically, this\nexogenous driver is a function of time, the climate function, that describes\nhow favorable is the climate, on a scale from $-1$ to $+1$. Climate change has\na number of effects; in this work, we focus on changes in climate variability,\nin particular, a decrease in the switching rate between good years and bad.\nWith regard to the predator-prey populations, we focus on the conditions that\nlead to extinction. We developed a high performance software tool to allow the\nsystematic exploration of a wide range of climate scenarios at a high level of\ndetail. Our results show that the predator-prey system is sensitive to the\nrapid drop in growth rate that accompanies a switch from good growth years to\nbad growth years. The amplitude of this negative variation as well as its\nduration are key factors, but more importantly, it is the moment when this\nnegative change occurs during the predator-prey cycle that is critical for the\nsurvival of the species.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 05:46:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Gretchko", "Sylvain", ""], ["Marley", "Jessa", ""], ["Tyson", "Rebecca C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.11834", "submitter": "C\\'edric Sueur", "authors": "Marie Pele, Jean-Louis Deneubourg, Cedric Sueur", "title": "Decision-making processes underlying pedestrian behaviours at signalised\n  crossings: Part 2.

This study sought\nto identify the cognitive mechanisms underlying decision-making by pedestrians\nwho follow another person across the road at the green or at the red light in\ntwo different countries (France and Japan). We used agent-based modelling to\nsimulate the road-crossing behaviours of pedestrians. This study showed that\nmodelling is a reliable means to test different hypotheses and find the exact\nprocesses underlying decision-making when crossing the road. We found that two\nprocesses suffice to simulate pedestrian behaviours. Importantly, the study\nrevealed differences between the two nationalities and between sexes in the\ndecision to follow and cross at the green and at the red light. Japanese\npedestrians are particularly attentive to the number of already departed\npedestrians and the number of waiting pedestrians at the red light, whilst\ntheir French counterparts only consider the number of pedestrians that have\nalready stepped off the kerb, thus showing the strong conformism of Japanese\npeople. Finally, the simulations are revealed to be similar to observations,\nnot only for the departure latencies but also for the number of crossing\npedestrians and the rates of illegal crossings. The conclusion suggests new\nsolutions for safety in transportation research.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 May 2018 07:22:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-31", "authors_parsed": [["Pele", "Marie", ""], ["Deneubourg", "Jean-Louis", ""], ["Sueur", "Cedric", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.12400", "submitter": "Anthea Monod", "authors": "Anthea Monod, Bo Lin, Ruriko Yoshida, and Qiwen Kang", "title": "Tropical Geometry of Phylogenetic Tree Space: A Statistical Perspective", "comments": "28 pages, 5 figures, 1 table", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.MG math.CO math.ST q-bio.PE stat.TH", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Phylogenetic trees are the fundamental mathematical representation of\nevolutionary processes in biology.

By analyzing a generalized consumer\nresource model that explicitly includes cross-feeding, stochastic colonization,\nand thermodynamics, we show that complex microbial communities generically\nexhibit a transition as a function of available energy fluxes from a\n\"resource-limited\" regime where community structure and stability is shaped by\nenergetic and metabolic considerations to a diverse regime where the dominant\nforce shaping microbial communities is the overlap between species' consumption\npreferences. These two regimes have distinct species abundance patterns,\ndifferent functional profiles, and respond differently to environmental\nperturbations.
