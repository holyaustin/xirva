The mechanisms of inheritance are not, however, unconstrained, since\nthey are themselves subject to natural selection. We introduce a general,\nanalytically solvable mathematical model to compare the adaptive value of\ndifferent schemes of inheritance.

However, these methods have typically\nbeen evaluated using different population dynamics models and in the context of\nvery different concepts of stability, which makes it difficult to compare their\nrelative efficiencies. Moreover, since the dynamics of populations are\ndependent on the life-history of the species and its environment, it is\nconceivable that the stabilizing effects of control methods would also be\naffected by such factors, a complication that has typically not been\ninvestigated. In this study we compare six different control methods with\nrespect to their efficiency at inducing a common level of enhancement (50%\nincrease) for two kinds of stability (constancy and persistence) under four\ndifferent life history/ environment combinations. Since these methods have been\nanalytically studied elsewhere, we focus on an intuitive understanding of\nrealistic simulations incorporating noise, extinction probability and lattice\neffect. We show that for these six methods, even when the magnitude of\nstabilization attained is the same, other aspects of the dynamics like\npopulation size distribution can be very different. Consequently, correlated\naspects of stability, like the amount of persistence for a given degree of\nconstancy stability (and vice versa) or the corresponding effective population\nsize (a measure of resistance to genetic drift) vary widely among the methods.\nMoreover, the number of organisms needed to be added or removed to attain\nsimilar levels of stabilization also varies for these methods, a fact that has\neconomic implications. Finally, we compare the relative efficiency of these\nmethods through a composite index of various stability related measures. We\nfind that restocking to a constant lower threshold seems to be the optimal\nmethod under most conditions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 07:01:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tung", "Sudipta", ""], ["Mishra", "Abhishek", ""], ["Dey", "Sutirth", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.0556", "submitter": "Sandeep Venkataram", "authors": "Sandeep Venkataram, Diamantis Sellis and Dmitri A Petrov", "title": "Ploidy and the Predictability of Evolution in Fishers Geometric Model", "comments": "Withdrawn.

As with protein coding genes, sex biased microRNAs are associated\nwith the reproductive function.

MicroRNAs with sex-biased expression do not preferentially target\nsex-biased gene transcripts.

We\nalso study the outbreak sizes of the infection, and show that the outbreak\nsizes are small if $\\lambda \\in(0,1/2]$, exhibit a power-law behavior for\n$1/2<\\lambda<1$, and are pandemic for $\\lambda\\geq 1$. Our method relies on\ndifferent couplings: we first couple the dynamics with two independent Yule\nprocesses by using an Athreya-Karlin embedding, and then we couple the Yule\nprocesses with Poisson processes thanks to Kendall's representation of Yule\nprocesses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 18:11:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 16:15:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 3 Oct 2014 09:01:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-19", "authors_parsed": [["Kortchemski", "Igor", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.5983", "submitter": "Behrouz Touri", "authors": "Michael J.

Whether and what aspects of such acquired traits may be\ntransmittable across generations remains unclear. Using prolonged olfactory\ntraining and subsequent two-forced choice testing in Drosophila melanogaster,\nit is observed that certain aspects of learned behavior were transmitted from\nparents to offspring. Offspring of parents exposed to distinct odors during\nboth aversive and appetitive conditioning displayed a heightened sensitivity to\nthose same odors. The conditioned responses associated with those odors,\nhowever, were not transmitted to the offspring as they displayed a constitutive\npreference to the parent-exposed stimuli irrespective of whether they were\nassociated with aversive or appetitive training. Moreover, the degree to which\nthe offspring preferred the conditioned stimuli markedly varied from\nodor-to-odor. These findings suggest that heightened sensitivities to certain\nsalient stimuli in the environment, but not their associated conditioned\nbehaviors, may be transmittable from parents to offspring.

The treatment and prevention\nof metastatic cancer remains an extremely challenging problem. This work\nintroduces a novel biologically motivated objective function to the radiation\noptimization community that takes into account metastatic risk instead of the\nstatus of the primary tumor. In this work, we consider the problem of\ndeveloping fractionated irradiation schedules that minimize production of\nmetastatic cancer cells while keeping normal tissue damage below an acceptable\nlevel. A dynamic programming framework is utilized to determine the optimal\nfractionation scheme. We evaluated our approach on a breast cancer case using\nthe heart and the lung as organs-at-risk (OAR). For small tumor $\\alpha/\\beta$\nvalues, hypo-fractionated schedules were optimal, which is consistent with\nstandard models. However, for relatively larger $\\alpha/\\beta$ values, we found\nthe type of schedule depended on various parameters such as the time when\nmetastatic risk was evaluated, the $\\alpha/\\beta$ values of the OARs, and the\nnormal tissue sparing factors. Interestingly, in contrast to standard models,\nhypo-fractionated and semi-hypo-fractionated schedules (large initial doses\nwith doses tapering off with time) were suggested even with large tumor\n$\\alpha$/$\\beta$ values. Numerical results indicate potential for significant\nreduction in metastatic risk.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 20:54:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 04:44:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 06:30:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-18", "authors_parsed": [["Badri", "Hamidreza", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "Jagdish", ""], ["Leder", "Kevin", ""]]}, {"id": "1312.7653", "submitter": "Anastasia Kalinina", "authors": "Sergey Pirogov, Aleksandre Rybko, Anastasia Kalinina, Mikhail Gelfand", "title": "Recombination processes and non-linear Markov chains", "comments": "modified Intro", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.PR q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Bacteria are known to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene\ntransfer.

In addition to the well-known\nsplits/introgressions involving Neanderthal genes into out-of- Africa people,\nor Denisovan genes into Oceanians, a further series of archaic splits and\nhypotheses proposed in Waddell et al. (2011) are considered in detail. These\ninclude signals of Denisovans with something markedly more archaic and possibly\nsomething more archaic into Papuans as well. These are compared and contrasted\nwith some well-advertised introgressions such as Denisovan genes across East\nAsia, archaic genes into San or non-tree mixing between Oceanians, East Asians\nand Europeans. The general result is that these less appreciated and surprising\narchaic splits have just as much or more support in genome sequence data.\nFurther, evaluation confirms the hypothesis that archaic genes are much rarer\non modern X chromosomes, and may even be near totally absent, suggesting strong\nselection against their introgression. Modeling of relative split weights\nallows an inference of the proportion of the genome the Denisovan seems to have\ngotten from an older archaic, and the best estimate is around 2%. Using a mix\nof quantitative and qualitative morphological data and novel phylogenetic\nmethods, robust support is found for multiple distinct middle Pleistocene\nlineages. Of these, fossil hominids such as SH5, Petralona, and Dali, in\nparticular, look like prime candidates for contributing pre-Neanderthal/Modern\narchaic genes to Denisovans, while the Jinniu-Shan fossil looks like the best\ncandidate for a close relative of the Denisovan. That the Papuans might have\nreceived some truly archaic genes appears a good possibility and they might\neven be from Homo erectus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 15:53:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-31", "authors_parsed": [["Waddell", "Peter J.", ""]]}]
