If the sites are reinterpreted as age\nclasses, the same model may apply to a single population with age-dependent\nmortality and reproduction.\n  We consider the case where the off-diagonal elements are small, representing\na situation where there is little migration or, alternatively, where a\ndeterministic life-history has been slightly disrupted, for example by\nintroducing a rare delay in development. We examine the asymptotic behaviour of\nthe long-term growth rate. We show that when the highest growth rate is\nattained at two different sites in the absence of migration (which is always\nthe case when modelling a single age-structured population) the increase in\nstochastic growth rate due to a migration rate $\\epsilon$ is like $(\\log\n\\epsilon^{-1})^{-1}$ as $\\epsilon\\downarrow 0$, under fairly generic\nconditions. When there is a single site with the highest growth rate the\nbehavior is more delicate, depending on the tails of the growth rates.

The public goods game (PGG) is a\nparadigm for exploring cooperative behavior. In PGG, the total resulting payoff\nis divided equally among all participants. This feature still leads to the\ndominance of defection without substantially magnifying the public good by a\nmultiplying factor. Much effort has been made to explain the evolution of\ncooperative strategies, including a recent model in which only a portion of the\ntotal benefit is shared by all the players through introducing a new strategy\nnamed persistent cooperation. A persistent cooperator is a contributor who is\nwilling to pay a second cost to retrieve the remaining portion of the payoff\ncontributed by themselves. In a previous study, this model was analyzed in the\nframework of well-mixed populations. This paper focuses on discussing the\npersistent cooperation in lattice-structured populations. The evolutionary\ndynamics of the structured populations consisting of three types of competing\nplayers (pure cooperators, defectors and persistent cooperators) are revealed\nby theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In particular, the\napproximate expressions of fixation probabilities for strategies are derived on\none-dimensional lattices. The phase diagrams of stationary states, the\nevolution of frequencies and spatial patterns for strategies are illustrated on\nboth one-dimensional and square lattices by simulations. Our results are\nconsistent with the general observation that, at least in most situations, a\nstructured population facilitates the evolution of cooperation.

In the strict clock case, the method consists in using\nthe one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test to directly test if the phylogeny\nis clock-like, in other words, if it follows a Poisson law. The ECD is computed\nfrom the discretized branch lengths and the parameter $\\lambda$ of the expected\nPoisson distribution is calculated as the average branch length over the\nensemble of trees. To compensate for the auto-correlation in the ensemble of\ntrees and pseudo-replication we take advantage of thinning and effective sample\nsize, two features provided by Bayesian inference MCMC samplers. Finally, it is\nobserved that tree topologies with very long or very short branches lead to\nPoisson mixtures and in this case we propose the use of the two-sample KS test\nwith samples from two continuous branch length distributions, one obtained from\nan ensemble of clock-constrained trees and the other from an ensemble of\nunconstrained trees. Moreover, in this second form the test can also be applied\nto test for relaxed clock models. The use of a statistically equivalent\nensemble of phylogenies to obtain the branch lengths ECD, instead of one\nconsensus tree, yields considerable reduction of the effects of small sample\nsize and provides again of power.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 21 May 2015 20:36:26 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 26 Dec 2016 12:43:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 7 Nov 2017 16:20:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 21 Nov 2017 19:32:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-09", "authors_parsed": [["Antoneli", "Fernando", ""], ["Marcon", "Fernando", ""], ["Lopes", "Luciano R.", ""], ["Briones", "Marcelo R.

This is why phylogenetic networks, which can display such events, are\nbecoming of more and more interest in phylogenetic research.
