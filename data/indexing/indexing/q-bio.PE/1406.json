These good\nactions may not maximise the actor's payoff, but they maximise the other's\npayoff.

Indeed, experiments typically show that humans are heterogeneous:\nsome may help others, while others may not. With the aim of favouring the\nemergence of 'successful cultures', a number of studies has recently\ninvestigated what mechanisms promote the evolution of a particular good action.\nBut still little is known about if and how good actions can spread from person\nto person. For instance, does being recipient of an altruistic act increase\nyour probability of being cooperative with others? Plato's quote, 'Good actions\ngive strength to ourselves and inspire good actions in others', suggests that\nis possible. We have conducted an experiment on Amazon Mechanical Turk to test\nthis mechanism using economic games. We have measured willingness to be\ncooperative through a standard Prisoner's dilemma and willingness to act\naltruistically using a binary Dictator game.

I show that all sources of prediction bias\ncontribute to generating false negatives (i.e., discounting the chance of a\npandemic when it is looming or has already started). Nevertheless, the\nstatistical difficulties can be overcome by improved data gathering and use of\nknown techniques that decrease bias. One peculiarity of the SS epidemic is that\nthe prediction can sometimes be made long before the actual pandemic onset,\ngenerating lead time to alert the medical community and the public. Thus\nmodeling is useful to overcome a false sense of security arising from the long\n\"kindling times\" characteristic of SS epidemics and certain\npolitical/psychological factors, as well as improve the public health response.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 19:47:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wick", "W.
