Does that mean that natural selection is about\ninformation or entropy? Or do natural selection, information and entropy arise\nas interpretations of a common underlying abstraction? The Price equation\nsuggests the latter. The Price equation achieves its abstract generality by\npartitioning change into two terms. The first term naturally associates with\nthe direct forces that cause change. The second term naturally associates with\nthe changing frame of reference. In the Price equation's canonical form, total\nchange remains zero because the conservation of total probability requires that\nall probabilities invariantly sum to one.

When the interaction unit is replicated on a\ndirected linear lattice, noise gets amplified via a self-consistent process\nwhich we trace back to the degenerate spectrum of the embedding support. The\nsame phenomenon holds when the system is bound to explore a quasi degenerate\nnetwork. In this case, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator, which governs\nspecies diffusion, accumulate over a limited portion of the complex plane. The\nlarger the network, the more pronounced the amplification. Beyond a critical\nnetwork size, a system deemed deterministically stable, hence resilient, may\nturn unstable, yielding seemingly regular patterns in the concentration amount.\nNon-normality and quasi-degenerate networks may therefore amplify the inherent\nstochasticity, and so contribute to altering the perception of resilience, as\nquantified via conventional deterministic methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 14 Apr 2019 16:57:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Nicoletti", "Sara", ""], ["Fanelli", "Duccio", ""], ["Zagli", "Niccol\u00f2", ""], ["Asllani", "Malbor", ""], ["Battistelli", "Giorgio", ""], ["Carletti", "Timoteo", ""], ["Chisci", "Luigi", ""], ["Innocenti", "Giacomo", ""], ["Livi", "Roberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.09847", "submitter": "Gideon Bradburd", "authors": "Gideon S.

However, fluctuating-environment models\noften only produce a dozen of coexisting species at best. Here, we investigate\nhow to create richer communities in fluctuating environments, using an\nempirically parameterized model. Building on the forced Lotka-Volterra model of\nScranton and Vasseur (Theor Ecol 9(3):353-363, 2016), inspired by phytoplankton\ncommunities, we have investigated the effect of two coexistence mechanisms,\nnamely the storage effect and higher intra- than interspecific competition\nstrengths (i.e., strong self-regulation). We tuned the intra/inter competition\nratio based on empirical analyses, in which self-regulation dominates\ninterspecific interactions. Although a strong self-regulation maintained more\nspecies (50%) than the storage effect (25%), we show that none of the two\ncoexistence mechanisms considered could ensure the coexistence of all species\nalone. Realistic seasonal environments only aggravated that picture, as they\ndecreased persistence relative to a random environment. However, strong\nself-regulation and the storage effect combined superadditively so that all\nspecies could persist with both mechanisms at work. Our results suggest that\ncombining different coexistence mechanisms into community models might be more\nfruitful than trying to find which mechanism best explains diversity.

Human history\ncan be regarded as a sequence of long periods of cultural stasis punctuated by\nparadigm shifts that transform culture upside-down over the turn of a few\ngenerations. We propose here a population dynamics model devised to analyse\nparadigm shifts. In this model individuals are defined by a vector of cultural\ntraits that can change mainly through imitation of other individuals' traits.\nThe novelty of the model is that cultural traits may interact reinforcing or\nhindering each other. Imitation is then biased by the 'cultural fitness'\nlandscape thus defined. Our main result is that abrupt paradigm shifts occur,\nas a response to weak changes in the landscape, only when cultural traits do\ninteract---whereas adaptation is smooth if there is no interaction. Borrowing\nthe genetic term, this interaction is called 'cultural epistasis'. The result\nis robust to the way that epistasis is implemented, to whether imitation is\nbiased by homophily, or to changes in other model parameters. Finally, a\nrelevant consequence of this dynamics is the irreversible nature of paradigm\nshifts: the old paradigm cannot be restored even if the external changes are\nundone. Our model puts the phenomenon of paradigm shifts in cultural evolution\nin the same category as catastrophic shifts in ecology or phase transitions in\nphysics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 22:06:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-04", "authors_parsed": [["Pascual", "Ignacio", ""], ["Aguirre", "Jacobo", ""], ["Manrubia", "Susanna", ""], ["Cuesta", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""]]}]
