For theoretical\nmodels of disease spreading, on the other hand, quantities characterizing the\noutbreak converge to deterministic functions of time. Our goal in this paper is\nto shed some light on this apparent discrepancy. We measure the diversity of\n(and, thus, the predictability of) outbreak sizes and extinction times as\nfunctions of time given different scenarios of the amount of information\navailable. Under the assumption of perfect information -- i.e., knowing the\nstate of each individual with respect to the disease -- the predictability\ndecreases exponentially, or faster, with time. The decay is slowest for\nintermediate values of the per-contact transmission probability. With a weaker\nassumption on the information available, assuming that we know only the\nfraction of currently infectious, recovered, or susceptible individuals, the\npredictability also decreases exponentially most of the time. There are,\nhowever, some peculiar regions in this scenario where the predictability\ndecreases. In other words, to predict its final size with a given accuracy, we\nwould need increasingly more information about the outbreak.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 04:55:20 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 5 May 2015 12:34:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Holme", "Petter", ""], ["Takaguchi", "Taro", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.5026", "submitter": "Marco Formentin", "authors": "Andrea Giometto, Marco Formentin, Andrea Rinaldo, Joel E.

Two experimental bioassays were\nconducted in March and July 2008 to investigate the importance of biofilm input\nfor the pelagic Microbial and Viral Loops.

The kinetics of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNF), bacteria and viruses\nwere assessed together with bacterial and viral genomic fingerprints, bacterial\nenzymatic activities and viral life strategies. The experimental design allowed\nus to evaluate the effect of BC modulated by those of benthic size-fractionated\nmicroorganisms (virus+bacteria, +HNF). BC presented (1) in March, a positive\neffect on viruses and bacteria weakened by pelagic HNF. Benthic microorganisms\nconsolidated this negative effect and sustained the viral production together\nwith a relatively diverse and uneven bacterial assemblage structure; (2) in\nJuly, no direct impact on viruses but a positive effect on bacteria modulated\nby HNF, which indirectly enhanced viral multiplication. Both effects were\nintensified by benthic microorganisms and bacterial assemblage structure became\nmore even. HNF indirectly profited from BC more in March than in July.

The basic idea of ABC is to empirically\napproximate the model likelihood by using intensive realizations of model runs.\nDue to computing time limitations, ABC has thus been mainly applied to models\nthat are relatively quick to simulate. We here aim at briefly introducing the\nfield of statistical emulation of computer code outputs and to demonstrate its\npotential for ABC applications. Emulation consists in replacing the costly to\nsimulate model by another (quick to simulate) statistical model called emulator\nor meta-model. This emulator is fitted to a small number of outputs of the\noriginal model, and is subsequently used as a surrogate during the inference\nprocedure. In this contribution, we first detail the principles of model\nemulation, with a special reference to the ABC context in which the description\nof the stochasticity of model realizations is as important as the description\nof the trends linking model parameters and outputs. We then compare several\nemulation strategies in an ABC context, using as case study a stochastic\necological model of community dynamics. We finally describe a novel\nemulation-based sequential ABC algorithm which is shown to decrease computing\ntime by a factor of two on the studied example, compared to previous sequential\nABC algorithms. Routines to perform emulation-based ABC were made available\nwithin the R package EasyABC.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 08:18:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-25", "authors_parsed": [["Jabot", "Franck", ""], ["Lagarrigues", "Guillaume", ""], ["Courbaud", "Beno\u00eet", ""], ["Dumoulin", "Nicolas", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8081", "submitter": "Carl Boettiger", "authors": "Carl Boettiger, Marc Mangel, Stephan Munch", "title": "Avoiding tipping points in fisheries management through Gaussian Process\n  Dynamic Programming", "comments": "2015 Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1098/rspb-2014-1631", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Model uncertainty and limited data are fundamental challenges to robust\nmanagement of human intervention in a natural system. These challenges are\nacutely highlighted by concerns that many ecological systems may contain\ntipping points, such as Allee population sizes. Before a collapse, we do not\nknow where the tipping points lie, if they exist at all. Hence, we know neither\na complete model of the system dynamics nor do we have access to data in some\nlarge region of state-space where such a tipping point might exist. We\nillustrate how a Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) approach using a Gaussian\nProcess (GP) prior provides a flexible representation of this inherent\nuncertainty. We embed GPs in a Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) framework\nin order to make robust management predictions with both model uncertainty and\nlimited data. We use simulations to evaluate this approach as compared with the\nstandard approach of using model selection to choose from a set of candidate\nmodels. We find that model selection erroneously favors models without tipping\npoints -- leading to harvest policies that guarantee extinction. The GPDP\nperforms nearly as well as the true model and significantly outperforms\nstandard approaches. We illustrate this using examples of simulated\nsingle-species dynamics, where the standard model selection approach should be\nmost effective, and find that it still fails to account for uncertainty\nappropriately and leads to population crashes, while management based on the\nGPDP does not, since it does not underestimate the uncertainty outside of the\nobserved data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 27 Dec 2014 21:08:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boettiger", "Carl", ""], ["Mangel", "Marc", ""], ["Munch", "Stephan", ""]]}, {"id": "1412.8654", "submitter": "William Bialek", "authors": "Michele Castellana, William Bialek, Andrea Cavagna, and Irene Giardina", "title": "Entropic forces in a non-equilibrium system: Flocks of birds", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

The strength of this force depends strongly on the\nnature of the interactions among birds: if birds are coupled to a fixed number\nof neighbors, the entropic forces are weak, while if they couple to all other\nbirds within a fixed distance, the entropic forces are sufficient to tear a\nflock apart.
