Generalizing recent findings of cyclically competing three- and\nfour-species models, we cast these equations in an appealingly simple form. As\na result, many general properties of such systems are readily discovered, e.g.,\nthe major difference between even and odd $S$ cases. Further, we find the\ncriteria for the existence of (subspaces of) fixed points and collective\nvariables which evolve trivially (exponentially or invariant). These apparently\ndistinct aspects can be traced to the null space associated with the\ninteraction matrix, $p_m^\\ell $. Related to the left- and right-\nzero-eigenvectors, these appear to be \"dual\" facets of the dynamics.

The focal point of\nthis work is whether log-Poisson and Poisson statistics both are possible under\ndifferent external conditions. To this end, a model is introduced where\ninteracting ants move in a stochastic fashion from one site to a neighboring\nsite on a finite 2D lattice. The probability of each move is determined by the\nensuing changes of a utility function which is a sum of pairwise interactions\nbetween ants, weighted by distance. Depending on how the interactions are\ndefined and on a control parameter dubbed 'degree of stochasticity' (DS), the\ndynamics either quickly converges to a stationary state, where movements are a\nstandard Poisson process, or may enter a non-stationary regime, where exits can\nbe described as suggested by Richardson et al.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Jan 2011 16:01:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 6 May 2011 11:59:50 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-17", "authors_parsed": [["Sibani", "Paolo", ""], ["Christiansen", "Simon", ""]]}, {"id": "1101.1556", "submitter": "Simon DeDeo", "authors": "Simon DeDeo, David C.

The evolution of virulence\nin viral populations is, however, poorly understood. Based on the experimental\nobservation of an RNA virus clone in cell culture diversifying into two\nsubpopulations of different virulence, we study the dynamics of heterogeneous\nvirus populations and the evolution of virulence. We introduce a\ncompetition-colonization trade-off into standard mathematical models of\nintra-host viral infection. Colonizers are fast spreading, virulent strains,\nwhereas competitors are less virulent variants that are more successful within\ncoinfected cells. We observe biphasic dynamics of the population: Early in the\ninfection the population is dominated by colonizers, which later will be\noutcompeted by competitors. The simulations suggest the existence of a steady\nstate where few low-virulence variants coexist. This equilibrium implies\ncollective virulence attenuation in the population, in contrast to previous\nmodels predicting development of the population towards increased virulence.\nNevertheless, the attenuation effect disappears if we include a highly\nsimplified immune response in our models. Thus, the competition-colonization\ntrade-off indicates a role for virulence in the modulation of the viral\npopulation diversity.
