We modeled EVD transmission using a branching\nprocess with gradually quenching transmission estimated from past EVD\noutbreaks, with outbreak trajectories conditioned on agreement with the course\nof the current outbreak, and with multiple levels of vaccination coverage. We\nused an autoregression for short-term projections, a regression model for final\nsizes, and a simple Gott's law rule as an ensemble of forecasts. Short-term\nmodel projections were validated against actual case counts. During validation\nof short-term projections, models consistently scored higher on shorter-term\nforecasts.

In the last few years, therefore,\ntree-based phylogenetic networks, which are defined by a spanning tree called a\nsubdivision tree, have attracted attention of theoretical biologists. However,\nthe application of such networks is still not easy, due to many problems whose\ntime complexities are not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a\ngeneral framework for solving those various old or new problems from a coherent\nperspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual problem or\ndeveloping an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure\ntheorem that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary\nphylogenetic network N into maximal zig-zag trails that are uniquely\ndetermined, and use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees of N in the\nform of a direct product, in a way reminiscent of the structure theorem for\nfinitely generated Abelian groups. From the main results, we derive a series of\nlinear time and linear time delay algorithms for the following problems: given\na rooted binary phylogenetic network N, 1) determine whether or not N has a\nsubdivision tree and find one if there exists any; 2) measure the deviation of\nN from being tree-based; 3) compute the number of subdivision trees of N; 4)\nlist all subdivision trees of N; and 5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or\nminimize a prescribed objective function.

One\nparticularly important aspect is whether or not competitors also interact.\nPopulation structures naturally affect sampling such that in a microscopic\ninterpretation of the replicator dynamics in well-mixed populations competing\nindividuals do not interact but do interact in structured populations. In\nsocial dilemmas interactions with competitors invariably inhibit cooperation\nwhile limited local interactions in structured populations support cooperation\nby reducing exploitation through cluster formation. These antagonistic effects\nof population structures on cooperation affect interpretations and the\nconclusions depend on the details of the comparison. For example, in the\nSnowdrift game, spatial structure may inhibit cooperation when compared to the\nreplicator dynamics. However, modifying the replicator dynamics to include\ninteractions between competitors lowers the equilibrium frequency of\ncooperators, which changes the conclusions and space is invariably beneficial,\njust as in the Prisoner's Dilemma. These conclusions are confirmed by\ncomparisons with random matching models, which mimic population structures but\nrandomly reshuffle individuals to inhibit spatial correlations. Finally, the\ndifferences in the dynamics with and without interactions among competing\nindividuals underlies the differences between death-birth and birth-death\nupdating in the spatial Moran process: death-birth supports cooperation because\ncompetitors tend not to interact whereas they tend to do for birth-death\nupdating and hence cooperators provide direct support to competitors to their\nown detriment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 18 Nov 2018 01:41:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-11-20", "authors_parsed": [["Hauert", "Christoph", ""], ["Mi\u0229kisz", "Jacek", ""]]}, {"id": "1811.07408", "submitter": "Liane Gabora", "authors": "Liane Gabora", "title": "Why Cognitive Science is Needed for a Viable Theoretical Framework for\n  Cultural Evolution", "comments": "7 pages (10 point font); 1 table;", "journal-ref": "Forthcoming in Proceedings of the 41st Annual Meeting of the\n  Cognitive Science Society.

Many studies based on\nevolutionary game theory have tried to solve the puzzle and figure out the\nreason why cooperation exists and how it emerges. Network reciprocity is one of\nthe mechanisms to promote cooperation, where nodes refer to individuals and\nlinks refer to social relationships. The spatial arrangement of mutant\nindividuals, which refers to the clustering of mutants, plays a key role in\nnetwork reciprocity. Besides, many other mechanisms supporting cooperation\nsuggest that the clustering of mutants plays an important role in the expansion\nof mutants. However, the clustering of mutants and the game dynamics are\ntypically coupled. It is still unclear how the clustering of mutants alone\nalters the evolutionary dynamics. To this end, we employ a minimal model with\nfrequency independent fitness on a circle. It disentangles the clustering of\nmutants from game dynamics. The distance between two mutants on the circle is\nadopted as a natural indicator for the clustering of mutants or assortment. We\nfind that the assortment is an amplifier of the selection for the connected\nmutants compared with the separated ones. Nevertheless, as mutants are\nseparated, the more dispersed mutants are, the greater the chance of invasion\nis. It gives rise to the non-monotonic effect of clustering, which is\ncounterintuitive.

First, the origin of Homo-specific\nculture over two MYA was made possible by the onset of a finer-grained\nassociative memory that allowed episodes to be encoded in greater detail. This\nin turn meant more overlap amongst the distributed representations of these\nepisodes, such that they could more readily evoke one another through\nself-triggered recall (STR). STR enabled representational redescription, the\nchaining of thoughts and actions, and the capacity for a stream of thought.\nSecond, fully cognitive modernity following the appearance of anatomical\nmodernity after 200,000 BP, was made possible by the onset of contextual focus\n(CF): the ability to shift between an explicit convergent mode conducive to\nlogic and refinement of ideas, and an implicit divergent mode conducive to\nfree-association, viewing situations from radically new perspectives, concept\ncombination, analogical thinking, and insight. This paved the way for an\nintegrated, creative internal network of understandings, and behavioral\nmodernity. We discuss feasible neural mechanisms for this two-stage proposal,\nand outline how STR and CF differ from other proposals. We provide\ncomputational evidence for the proposal obtained with an agent-based model of\ncultural evolution in which agents invent ideas for actions and imitate the\nfittest of their neighbors' actions. Mean fitness and diversity of actions\nacross the artificial society increased with STR, and even more so with CF, but\nCF was only effective if STR was already in place.
