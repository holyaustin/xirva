As the disease will likely remain a\nthreat for years to come, an understanding of the precise influences of human\ndemographics and settlement, as well as the dynamic factors of climate,\nsusceptible depletion, and intervention, on the spread of localized epidemics\nwill be vital for mounting an effective response. We consider the entire set of\nlocal epidemics in the United States; a broad selection of demographic,\npopulation density, and climate factors; and local mobility data, tracking\nsocial distancing interventions, to determine the key factors driving the\nspread and containment of the virus. Assuming first a linear model for the rate\nof exponential growth (or decay) in cases/mortality, we find that\npopulation-weighted density, humidity, and median age dominate the dynamics of\ngrowth and decline, once interventions are accounted for. A focus on distinct\nmetropolitan areas suggests that some locales benefited from the timing of a\nnearly simultaneous nationwide shutdown, and/or the regional climate conditions\nin mid-March; while others suffered significant outbreaks prior to\nintervention. Using a first-principles model of the infection spread, we then\ndevelop predictions for the impact of the relaxation of social distancing and\nlocal climate conditions. A few regions, where a significant fraction of the\npopulation was infected, show evidence that the epidemic has partially resolved\nvia depletion of the susceptible population (i.e., \"herd immunity\"), while most\nregions in the United States remain overwhelmingly susceptible. These results\nwill be important for optimal management of intervention strategies, which can\nbe facilitated using our online dashboard.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Jul 2020 00:19:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Afshordi", "Niayesh", "", "U-Waterloo/Perimeter"], ["Holder", "Benjamin", "", "GVSU/U-Waterloo"], ["Bahrami", "Mohammad", "", "Wolfram Research"], ["Lichtblau", "Daniel", "", "Wolfram Research"]]}, {"id": "2007.00268", "submitter": "Angeline Pendergrass", "authors": "Angeline G.

The pathogenicity and virulence of\nasymptomatic COVID-19 remain mysterious.

Many ``structured models'' capture aspects of the contact\nstructure through an underlying network or a mixing matrix. An important\nobservation in such models, is that once a fraction $1-1/\\mathcal{R}_0$ has\nbeen infected, the residual susceptible population can no longer sustain an\nepidemic. A recent observation of some structured models is that this threshold\ncan be crossed with a smaller fraction of infected individuals, because the\ndisease acts like a targeted vaccine, preferentially immunizing higher-risk\nindividuals who play a greater role in transmission. Therefore, a limited\n``first wave'' may leave behind a residual population that cannot support a\nsecond wave once interventions are lifted. In this paper, we systematically\nanalyse a number of mean-field models for networks and other structured\npopulations to address issues relevant to the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular,\nwe consider herd-immunity under several scenarios. We confirm that, in networks\nwith high degree heterogeneity, the first wave confers herd-immunity with\nsignificantly fewer infections than equivalent models with lower degree\nheterogeneity. However, if modelling the intervention as a change in the\ncontact network, then this effect might become more subtle. Indeed, modifying\nthe structure can shield highly connected nodes from becoming infected during\nthe first wave and make the second wave more substantial. We confirm this\nfinding by using an age-structured compartmental model parameterised with real\ndata and comparing lockdown periods implemented either as a global scaling of\nthe mixing matrix or age-specific structural changes. We find that results\nregarding herd immunity levels are strongly dependent on the model, the\nduration of lockdown and how lockdown is implemented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 11:26:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-15", "authors_parsed": [["Di Lauro", "Francesco", ""], ["Berthouze", "Luc", ""], ["Dorey", "Matthew D.", ""], ["Miller", "Joel C.", ""], ["Kiss", "Istv\u00e1n Z.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.07154", "submitter": "Hagai B.

However, these models\ncan not efficiently characterize and quantify new emergent extinctions in a\nlarge population appearing due to environmental forcing. To address this issue\nwe develop a stochastic physics-inspired approach to analyze how environmental\nforcing influences the severity of species extinctions in such models.

Also, we precisely characterize the magnitude of the fluctuations\nassociated with the size and duration of the outbreak in critical SIR dynamics\nwith non-trivial initial conditions. Far from heard immunity, fluctuations are\nmuch larger than average values, thus indicating that predictions of plateauing\ntime series may be particularly challenging.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2020 18:09:02 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2020 16:27:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-17", "authors_parsed": [["Radicchi", "Filippo", ""], ["Bianconi", "Ginestra", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15114", "submitter": "Zhe Xu", "authors": "Zhe Xu, Bo Wu and Ufuk Topcu", "title": "Control Strategies for COVID-19 Epidemic with Vaccination, Shield\n  Immunity and Quarantine: A Metric Temporal Logic Approach", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0247660", "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.SY cs.SY math.OC q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Ever since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, various public health\ncontrol strategies have been proposed and tested against the coronavirus\nSARS-CoV-2.
