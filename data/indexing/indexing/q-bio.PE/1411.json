Diversity measures applied to crops usually have been\nlimited to the assessment of genome polymorphism at the DNA level.\nOccasionally, selected morphological features are recorded and the content of\nkey chemical constituents determined, but unbiased and comprehensive chemical\nphenotypes have not been included systematically in diversity surveys. Our\nobjective in this study was to assess metabolic diversity in sesame by\nnontargeted metabolic profiling and elucidate the relationship between\nmetabolic and genome diversity in this crop. Results: Ten sesame accessions\nwere selected that represent most of the genome diversity of sesame grown in\nIndia, Western Asia, Sudan and Venezuela based on previous AFLP studies.\nEthanolic seed extracts were separated by HPLC, metabolites were ionized by\npositive and negative electrospray and ions were detected with an ion trap mass\nspectrometer in full-scan mode for m/z from 50 to 1000. Genome diversity was\ndetermined by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) using eight primer\npair combinations. The relationship between biodiversity at the genome and at\nthe metabolome levels was assessed by correlation analysis and multivariate\nstatistics. Conclusion: Patterns of diversity at the genomic and metabolic\nlevels differed, indicating that selection played a significant role in the\nevolution of metabolic diversity in sesame. This result implies that when used\nfor the selection of genotypes in breeding and conservation, diversity\nassessment based on neutral DNA markers should be complemented with metabolic\nprofiles.

Over time these changes can result in an imperfect\ntracking of taxonomic perspectives through the re-/use of Code-compliant or\ninformal names. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce a novel approach\nfor aligning taxonomies through the interaction of human experts and logic\nreasoners. We explore the performance of this approach with the Perelleschus\nuse case of Franz & Cardona-Duque (2013).

An Open Source reasoning toolkit is\nused to analyze 13 paired Perelleschus taxonomy alignments under heterogeneous\nconstraints and interpretations. The reasoning workflow optimizes the logical\nconsistency and expressiveness of the input and infers the set of maximally\ninformative relations among the entailed taxonomic concepts. The latter are\nthen used to produce merge visualizations that represent all congruent and\nnon-congruent taxonomic elements among the aligned input trees. In this small\nuse case with 6-53 input concepts per alignment, the information gained through\nthe reasoning process is on average one order of magnitude greater than in the\ninput.

The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone,\nand Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local\nepidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more\nEVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an\nexponential. Conclusions: The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD\noutbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes,\nsuccess of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as\na high level of clustering. Quantifying the contribution of each of these\nfactors could help refine estimates of final epidemic size and the relative\nimpact of different mitigation efforts in current and future EVD outbreaks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 20:42:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 17:57:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 15:37:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-28", "authors_parsed": [["Chowell", "Gerardo", ""], ["Viboud", "C\u00e9cile", ""], ["Hyman", "James M.", ""], ["Simonsen", "Lone", ""]]}]
