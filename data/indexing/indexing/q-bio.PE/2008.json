Many of these models are based upon statistical\ntechniques and are good at assessing the current state and making short-term\npredictions; however, as they do not model interactions between stocks, they\nlack predictive power on longer timescales. Additionally, there are mechanistic\nmulti-species models that represent key biological processes and consider\ninteractions between stocks such as predation and competition for resources.\nDue to the complexity of these models, they are difficult to fit to data, and\nso many mechanistic multi-species models depend upon single-species models\nwhere they exist, or ad hoc assumptions when they don't, for parameters such as\nannual fishing mortality. In this paper we demonstrate that by taking a\nstate-space approach, many of the uncertain parameters can be treated\ndynamically, allowing us to fit, with quantifiable uncertainty, mechanistic\nmulti-species models directly to data. We demonstrate this by fitting uncertain\nparameters, including annual fishing mortality, of a size-based multi-species\nmodel of the Celtic Sea, for species with and without single-species\nstock-assessments. Consequently, errors in the single-species models no longer\npropagate through the multi-species model and underlying assumptions are more\ntransparent.

Various epidemiological and deep learning models have been\ndeveloped to predict the COVID-19 outbreak, but all have limitations that\naffect the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Our method aims at\naddressing these limitations and making earlier and more accurate pandemic\noutbreak predictions by (1) using patients' EHR data from different counties\nand states that encode local disease status and medical resource utilization\ncondition; (2) considering demographic similarity and geographical proximity\nbetween locations; and (3) integrating pandemic transmission dynamics into deep\nlearning models. Materials and Methods: We proposed a spatio-temporal attention\nnetwork (STAN) for pandemic prediction. It uses an attention-based graph\nconvolutional network to capture geographical and temporal trends and predict\nthe number of cases for a fixed number of days into the future. We also\ndesigned a physical law-based loss term for enhancing long-term prediction.\nSTAN was tested using both massive real-world patient data and open source\nCOVID-19 statistics provided by Johns Hopkins university across all U.S.\ncounties. Results: STAN outperforms epidemiological modeling methods such as\nSIR and SEIR and deep learning models on both long-term and short-term\npredictions, achieving up to 87% lower mean squared error compared to the best\nbaseline prediction model.

One difficulty in\nderiving these quantities is that they must be computed on a model-by-model\nbasis, since it is typically impractical to obtain general reproduction number\nexpressions applicable to a family of related models, especially if these are\nof different dimensions. For example, this is typically the case for SIR-type\ninfectious disease models derived using the linear chain trick (LCT). Here we\nshow how to find general reproduction number expressions for such models\nfamilies (which vary in their number of state variables) using the next\ngeneration operator approach in conjunction with the generalized linear chain\ntrick (GLCT). We further show how the GLCT enables modelers to draw insights\nfrom these results by leveraging theory and intuition from continuous time\nMarkov chains (CTMCs) and their absorption time distributions (i.e., phase-type\nprobability distributions). To do this, we first review the GLCT and other\nconnections between mean-field ODE model assumptions, CTMCs, and phase-type\ndistributions. We then apply this technique to find reproduction numbers for\ntwo sets of models: a family of generalized SEIRS models of arbitrary finite\ndimension, and a generalized family of finite dimensional predator-prey\n(Rosenzweig-MacArthur type) models.

The most convenient\nexplanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic\nreproduction number, $r_{\\rm 0}$; and there certainly are arguments for this.\nOther factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to\nreconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes\nsimilar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two,\ndifferent, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of\ninfection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second\nis that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population.\nWhile it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception\nof an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two\nphenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any\nmeasure, be insignificant. It also remains an inescapable fact that the early\npeak in infections coincided with a fairly profound change in $r_{\\rm 0}$; in\nall the contemplated scenarios of data-deficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:46:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 08:26:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Childs", "S.

We aim to find out what sustainable border control options for\ndifferent entities (e.g., countries, states) exist during the reopening phases,\ngiven their own choice of domestic control measures and new technologies such\nas contact tracing. We propose a SUIHR model, which represents an extension to\nthe discrete time SIR models. The model focuses on studying the spreading of\nvirus predominantly by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. Imported risk\nand (1-tier) contact tracing are both built into the model. Under plausible\nparameter assumptions, we seek sustainable border control policies, in\ncombination with sufficient internal measures, which allow entities to confine\nthe virus without the need to revert back to more restrictive life styles or to\nrely on herd immunity. When the base reproduction number of COVID-19 exceeds\n2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the\nspreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically,\nand resumes \"normal\", very strict pre-departure screening and test and\nisolation upon arrival combined with effective contact tracing can only delay\nanother outbreak by 6 months. However, if the total net imported cases are\nnon-increasing, and the entity employs a confining domestic control policy,\nthen the total new cases can be contained even without border control.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:07:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 15:07:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 4 Feb 2021 11:29:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-05", "authors_parsed": [["Zhu", "Zhen", ""], ["Weber", "Enzo", ""], ["Strohsal", "Till", ""], ["Serhan", "Duaa", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13602", "submitter": "Pablo Villegas G\\'ongora", "authors": "P.

Much effort has been made in the past\ndecades to collect extensive and detailed information about the spatial\ndistribution of tropical rainforests, as demonstrated, e.g., in the 50 ha\ntropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. These kind of plots have\nbeen crucial to shed light on diverse qualitative features, emerging both at\nthe single-species or the community level, like the spatial aggregation or\nclustering at short scales. Here, we build on the progress made in the study of\nthe density correlation functions applied to biological systems, focusing on\nthe importance of accurately defining the borders of the set of trees, and\nremoving the induced biases. We also pinpoint the importance of combining the\nstudy of correlations with the scale dependence of fluctuations in density,\nwhich are linked to the well known empirical Taylor's power law. Density\ncorrelations and fluctuations, in conjunction, provide an unique opportunity to\ninterpret the behaviors and possibly to allow comparisons between data and\nmodels. We also study such quantities in models of spatial patterns and, in\nparticular, we find that a spatially explicit neutral model generates patterns\nwith many qualitative features in common with the empirical ones.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 13:48:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 2 Dec 2020 16:51:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Villegas", "P.", ""], ["Cavagna", "A.", ""], ["Cencini", "M.", ""], ["Fort", "H.", ""], ["Grigera", "T.
