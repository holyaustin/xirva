This contribution addresses a number of related puzzles of human\nbehavior with an evolutionary game theoretical approach as it has been\nsuccessfully used to explain the behavior of other biological species many\ntimes, from bacteria to vertebrates. Our agent-based model distinguishes\nindividuals applying four different behavioral strategies: non-cooperative\nindividuals (\"defectors\"), cooperative individuals abstaining from punishment\nefforts (called \"cooperators\" or \"second-order free-riders\"), cooperators who\npunish non-cooperative behavior (\"moralists\"), and defectors, who punish other\ndefectors despite being non-cooperative themselves (\"immoralists\"). By\nconsidering spatial interactions with neighboring individuals, our model\nreveals several interesting effects: First, moralists can fully eliminate\ncooperators. This spreading of punishing behavior requires a segregation of\nbehavioral strategies and solves the \"second-order free-rider problem\". Second,\nthe system behavior changes its character significantly even after very long\ntimes (\"who laughs last laughs best effect\"). Third, the presence of a number\nof defectors can largely accelerate the victory of moralists over non-punishing\ncooperators. Forth, in order to succeed, moralists may profit from immoralists\nin a way that appears like an \"unholy collaboration\". Our findings suggest that\nthe consideration of punishment strategies allows to understand the\nestablishment and spreading of \"moral behavior\" by means of game-theoretical\nconcepts. This demonstrates that quantitative biological modeling approaches\nare powerful even in domains that have been addressed with non-mathematical\nconcepts so far.

Additional studies using ensembles of\nrandom fitness landscapes show that the results achieved for a particular\nchoice of three-locus landscape parameters are robust and also persist as the\nnumber of loci increases.\n  Conclusions: Our study indicates that an advantage for small populations is\nlikely whenever the fitness landscape contains local maxima. The advantage\nappears at intermediate time scales, which are long enough for trapping at\nlocal fitness maxima to have occurred but too short for peak escape by the\ncreation of multiple mutants.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Mar 2010 17:07:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 23 Feb 2011 04:45:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Kavita", ""], ["Krug", "Joachim", ""], ["Park", "Su-Chan", ""]]}, {"id": "1003.5673", "submitter": "Mark Newman", "authors": "Brian Karrer, M.

It also can inform the user of the positional uncertainty\nfor query sequences by calculating expected distance between placement\nlocations, which is crucial in the estimation of uncertainty with a\nwell-sampled reference tree. The software provides visualizations using branch\nthickness and color to represent number of placements and their uncertainty. A\nsimulation study using reads generated from 631 COG alignments shows a high\nlevel of accuracy for phylogenetic placement over a wide range of alignment\ndiversity, and the power of edge uncertainty estimates to measure placement\nconfidence.

Our proofs use that the leading term of the maximum\nlikelihood function of a tree T is the maximum parsimony score, which is the\nsize of the minimum cut in T needed to realize single edge cuts of the\ngenerating tree. Our main contribution is a combinatorial proof that in our\nsimplified setting, SPR moves are guaranteed to converge quickly to the maximum\nparsimony tree.
