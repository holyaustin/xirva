The models assume organisms\nwhose genomes consist of two chromosomes, where each chromosome is assumed to\nbe functional if it is equal to some master sequence $ \\sigma_0 $, and\nnon-functional otherwise. The first-order growth rate constant, or fitness, of\nan organism, is determined by whether it has zero, one, or two functional\nchromosomes in its genome. For a population replicating asexually, a given cell\nreplicates both of its chromosomes, and splits its genetic material evenly\nbetween the two cells. For a population replicating sexually, a given cell\nfirst divides into two haploids, which enter a haploid pool, fuse into\ndiploids, and then divide via the normal mitotic process. Haploid fusion is\nmodeled as a second-order rate process. When the cost for sex is small, as\nmeasured by the ratio of the characteristic haploid fusion time to the\ncharacteristic growth time, we find that sexual replication with random haploid\nfusion leads to a greater mean fitness for the population than a purely asexual\nstrategy. However, independently of the cost for sex, we find that sexual\nreplication with a selective mating strategy leads to a higher mean fitness\nthan the random mating strategy. This result is based on the assumption that a\nselective mating strategy does not have any additional time or energy costs\nover the random mating strategy, an assumption that is discussed in the paper.\nThe results of this paper are consistent with previous studies suggesting that\nsex is favored at intermediate mutation rates, for slowly replicating\norganisms, and at high population densities.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Sep 2007 09:52:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Tannenbaum", "Emmanuel", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.1750", "submitter": "Steven N.

As a consequence, the population can suffer an irreversible\naccumulation of deleterious mutations, a phenomenon known as Muller's ratchet.\nWe formulate discrete and continuous time versions of Muller's ratchet.\nInspired by Haigh's (1978) analysis of a dynamical system which arises in the\nlimit of large populations, we identify the parameter gamma =\nN*lambda/(Ns*log(N*lambda)) as most important for the speed of accumulation of\ndeleterious mutations. Here N is population size, s is the selection\ncoefficient and lambda is the deleterious mutation rate. For large parts of the\nparameter range, measuring time in units of size N, deleterious mutations\naccumulate according to a power law in N*lambda with exponent gamma if\ngamma>0.5. For gamma<0.5 mutations cannot accumulate. We obtain diffusion\napproximations for three different parameter regimes, depending on the speed of\nthe ratchet. Our approximations shed new light on analyses of Stephan et al.\n(1993) and Gordo & Charlesworth (2000). The heuristics leading to the\napproximations are supported by simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 18 Sep 2007 09:00:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Etheridge", "A.", ""], ["Pfaffelhuber", "P.", ""], ["Wakolbinger", "A.", ""]]}, {"id": "0709.2890", "submitter": "Nicholas Eriksson", "authors": "Nicholas Eriksson", "title": "Using invariants for phylogenetic tree construction", "comments": "19 pages, 7 figures.
