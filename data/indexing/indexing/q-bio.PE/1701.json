Using stochastic simulations, we study the fates of individual\nresistance mutations and quantify the trade-off between the killing of\nwild-type cells and the rise of resistance mutations: shallow gradients and\nconvection into the antibiotic region promote wild-type death, at the cost of\nincreasing the establishment probability of resistance mutations. We can\nexplain these observed trends by modeling the adaptation process as a branching\nrandom walk. Our analysis reveals that the trade-off between death and\nadaptation depends on the relative length scales of the spatial drug gradient\nand random dispersal, and the strength of convection.

Individuals\nwithin these populations may differ in age, size, or geographic location and\nthereby structure these populations. Here, I study structured population models\naccounting for positive density-dependence and environmental stochasticity i.e.\nrandom fluctuations in the demographic rates of the population. Under an\naccessibility assumption (roughly, stochastic fluctuations can lead to\npopulations getting small and large), these models are shown to exhibit a\ndynamical trichotomy: (i) for all initial conditions, the population goes\nasymptotically extinct with probability one, (ii) for all positive initial\nconditions, the population persists and asymptotically exhibits unbounded\ngrowth, and (iii) for all positive initial conditions, there is a positive\nprobability of asymptotic extinction and a complementary positive probability\nof unbounded growth. The main results are illustrated with applications to\nspatially structured populations with an Allee effect and age-structured\npopulations experiencing mate limitation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 22:21:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-12", "authors_parsed": [["Schreiber", "Sebastian J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08982", "submitter": "Leo van Iersel", "authors": "Leo van Iersel and Vincent Moulton", "title": "Leaf-reconstructibility of phylogenetic networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  An important problem in evolutionary biology is to reconstruct the\nevolutionary history of a set $X$ of species. This history is often represented\nas a phylogenetic network, that is, a connected graph with leaves labelled by\nelements in $X$ (for example, an evolutionary tree), which is usually also\nbinary, i.e. all vertices have degree 1 or 3. A common approach used in\nphylogenetics to build a phylogenetic network on $X$ involves constructing it\nfrom networks on subsets of $X$. Here we consider the question of which\n(unrooted) phylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible, i.e. which networks\ncan be uniquely reconstructed from the set of networks obtained from it by\ndeleting a single leaf (its $X$-deck). This problem is closely related to the\n(in)famous reconstruction conjecture in graph theory but, as we shall show,\npresents distinct challenges. We show that some large classes of phylogenetic\nnetworks are reconstructible from their $X$-deck. This includes phylogenetic\ntrees, binary networks containing at least one non-trivial cut-edge, and binary\nlevel-4 networks (the level of a network measures how far it is from being a\ntree). We also show that for fixed $k$, almost all binary level-$k$\nphylogenetic networks are leaf-reconstructible. As an application of our\nresults, we show that a level-3 network $N$ can be reconstructed from its\nquarnets, that is, 4-leaved networks that are induced by $N$ in a certain\nrecursive fashion. Our results lead to several interesting open problems which\nwe discuss, including the conjecture that all phylogenetic networks with at\nleast five leaves are leaf-reconstructible.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 10:42:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["van Iersel", "Leo", ""], ["Moulton", "Vincent", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.08995", "submitter": "Leo van Iersel", "authors": "Leo van Iersel, Vincent Moulton, Eveline de Swart and Taoyang Wu", "title": "Binets: fundamental building blocks for phylogenetic networks", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cs.DS math.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Phylogenetic networks are a generalization of evolutionary trees that are\nused by biologists to represent the evolution of organisms which have undergone\nreticulate evolution. Essentially, a phylogenetic network is a directed acyclic\ngraph having a unique root in which the leaves are labelled by a given set of\nspecies. Recently, some approaches have been developed to construct\nphylogenetic networks from collections of networks on 2- and 3-leaved networks,\nwhich are known as binets and trinets, respectively. Here we study in more\ndepth properties of collections of binets, one of the simplest possible types\nof networks into which a phylogenetic network can be decomposed. More\nspecifically, we show that if a collection of level-1 binets is compatible with\nsome binary network, then it is also compatible with a binary level-1 network.\nOur proofs are based on useful structural results concerning lowest stable\nancestors in networks. In addition, we show that, although the binets do not\ndetermine the topology of the network, they do determine the number of\nreticulations in the network, which is one of its most important parameters. We\nalso consider algorithmic questions concerning binets. We show that deciding\nwhether an arbitrary set of binets is compatible with some network is at least\nas hard as the well-known Graph Isomorphism problem. However, if we restrict to\nlevel-1 binets, it is possible to decide in polynomial time whether there\nexists a binary network that displays all the binets. We also show that to find\na network that displays a maximum number of the binets is NP-hard, but that\nthere exists a simple polynomial-time 1/3-approximation algorithm for this\nproblem. It is hoped that these results will eventually assist in the\ndevelopment of new methods for constructing phylogenetic networks from\ncollections of smaller networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 11:18:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-01", "authors_parsed": [["van Iersel", "Leo", ""], ["Moulton", "Vincent", ""], ["de Swart", "Eveline", ""], ["Wu", "Taoyang", ""]]}, {"id": "1701.09157", "submitter": "Delfim F.

Contrary to\nsome beliefs, related to the fact that agglomerations of individuals increase\nproportionally to the disease spread, analysis of the model shows that the\nexistence of semi-closed communities are beneficial for the TB control from a\nglobal viewpoint. The model and techniques proposed are applied to a case-study\nwith concrete parameters, which model the situation of Angola (A) and Portugal\n(B), in order to show its relevance and meaningfulness. Simulations show that\nvariations of the transmission coefficient on the origin country has a big\ninfluence on the number of infected (and infectious) individuals on the\ncommunity and the host country. Moreover, there is an optimal ratio for the\ndistribution of individuals in (C) versus (G), which minimizes the reproduction\nnumber $R_0$. Such value does not give the minimal total number of infected\nindividuals in all (B), since such is attained when the community (G) is\ncompletely isolated (theoretical scenario). Sensitivity analysis and curve\nfitting on $R_0$ and on EDSs are pursuit in order to understand the TB effects\nin the global statistics, by measuring the variability of the relevant\nparameters. We also show that the TB transmission rate $\\beta$ does not act\nlinearly on $R_0$, as is common in compartment models where system feedback or\ngroup interactions do not occur. Further, we find the most important parameters\nfor the increase of each EDS.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:06:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-25", "authors_parsed": [["Rocha", "Eugenio M.", ""], ["Silva", "Cristiana J.", ""], ["Torres", "Delfim F.
