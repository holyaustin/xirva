The mathematical analysis\nunderlying their computation assumes that occurrences of words under interest\ndo not overlap. We relax here this assumption by use of an automata approach.\nIn an alphabet of size 4 like the DNA alphabet, most words have no or a low\nautocorrelation; therefore, globally, our results confirm those of Behrens and\nVingron. The outcome is quite different when considering highly autocorrelated\nk-mers; in this case, the autocorrelation pushes down the probability of\noccurrence of these k-mers at generation 1 and, consequently, increases the\nwaiting time for apparition of these k-mers up to 40%. An analysis of existing\nTF binding sites unveils a significant proportion of k-mers exhibiting\nautocorrelation. Thus, our computations based on automata greatly improve the\naccuracy of predicting waiting times for the emergence of TF binding sites to\nappear during DNA evolution. We do the computation in the Bernoulli or M0\nmodel; computations in the M1 model, a Markov model of order 1, are more costly\nin terms of time and memory but should produce similar results. While Behrens\nand Vingron considered specifically promoters of length 1000, we extend the\nresults to promoters of any size; we exhibit the property that the probability\nthat a k-mer occurs at generation time 1 while being absent at time 0 behaves\nlinearly with respect to the length of the promoter, which induces a hyperbolic\nbehaviour of the waiting time of any k-mer with respect to the length of the\npromoter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2011 10:03:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-02", "authors_parsed": [["Behrens", "S.", ""], ["Nicaud", "C.", ""], ["Nicodeme", "P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.0651", "submitter": "Gilles Guillot", "authors": "Gilles Guillot and Fran\\c{c}ois Rousset", "title": "Dismantling the Mantel tests", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The simple and partial Mantel tests are routinely used in many areas of\nevolutionary biology to assess the significance of the association between two\nor more matrices of distances relative to the same pairs of individuals or\ndemes.

We suggest a new approach, using\nthe number of patches in the population as a large parameter. This approach\ndoes not require that the number of individuals per patch is large, neither is\nit necessary to assume a time-scale separation between local population\ndynamics and migration. Our approach makes it possible to accurately describe\nthe dynamics of metapopulations consisting of many small patches. We focus on\nmetapopulations on the brink of extinction. We estimate the time to extinction\nand describe the most likely path to extinction. We find that the logarithm of\nthe time to extinction is proportional to the product of two vectors, a vector\ncharacterising the distribution of patch population sizes in the quasi-steady\nstate, and a vector -- related to Fisher's reproduction vector -- that\nquantifies the sensitivity of the quasi-steady state distribution to\ndemographic fluctuations. We compare our analytical results to stochastic\nsimulations of the model, and discuss the range of validity of the analytical\nexpressions. By identifying fast and slow degrees of freedom in the\nmetapopulation dynamics, we show that the dynamics of large metapopulations\nclose to extinction is approximately described by a deterministic equation\noriginally proposed by Levins (1969). We were able to compute the rates in\nLevins' equation in terms of the parameters of our stochastic, individual-based\nmodel. It turns out, however, that the interpretation of the dynamical variable\ndepends strongly on the intrinsic growth rate and carrying capacity of the\npatches. Only when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are large does the\nslow variable correspond to the number of patches, as envisaged by Levins.

Organisms use a variety of mechanisms to protect themselves\nagainst perturbations. For example, repair mechanisms fix damage, feedback\nloops keep homeostatic systems at their setpoints, and biochemical filters\ndistinguish signal from noise. Such buffering mechanisms are often discussed in\nterms of robustness, which may be measured by reduced sensitivity of\nperformance to perturbations. Methodology/Principal Findings. I use a\nmathematical model to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of robustness in order\nto understand aspects of organismal design by natural selection. I focus on two\ncharacters: one character performs an adaptive task; the other character\nbuffers the performance of the first character against perturbations. Increased\nperturbations favor enhanced buffering and robustness, which in turn decreases\nsensitivity and reduces the intensity of natural selection on the adaptive\ncharacter. Reduced selective pressure on the adaptive character often leads to\na less costly, lower performance trait. Conclusions/Significance. The paradox\nof robustness arises from evolutionary dynamics: enhanced robustness causes an\nevolutionary reduction in the adaptive performance of the target character,\nleading to a degree of maladaptation compared to what could be achieved by\nnatural selection in the absence of robustness mechanisms. Over evolutionary\ntime, buffering traits may become layered on top of each other, while the\nunderlying adaptive traits become replaced by cheaper, lower performance\ncomponents. The paradox of robustness has widespread implications for\nunderstanding organismal design.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 13 Dec 2011 16:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Frank", "Steven A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.3025", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Group-size effects on the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public\n  goods game", "comments": "4 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Paradoxically, field studies have\ndocumented numerous populations under long periods of stabilizing selection and\nevolutionary stasis that have rapidly evolved under changed environmental\nconditions.

Here, I develop two general aspects of the public\ngoods problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation\nin individual resources favors selfish individuals to vary their allocation to\npublic goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute their excess\nresources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with fewer resources\ncontribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish behavior causes\nindividuals to stratify into upper classes that contribute greatly to public\nbenefit and social cohesion and to lower classes that contribute little to the\npublic good. Second, if group success absolutely requires production of the\npublic good, then the pressure favoring production is relatively high. By\ncontrast, if group success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure\nfavoring production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that\nthe role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of public goods\nproblems sometimes fail to emphasize this point sufficiently.

The essence of sociality arises from the tension\nbetween selfish gains against neighbors and the associated loss that\nselfishness imposes by degrading the efficiency of the group. Without some\nforce to modulate selfishness, the natural tendencies of self interest\ntypically degrade group performance to the detriment of all. This is the\ntragedy of the commons. Kin selection provides the most widely discussed way in\nwhich the tragedy is overcome in biology. Kin selection arises from behavioral\nassociations within groups caused either by genetical kinship or by other\nprocesses that correlate the behaviors of group members. Here, I emphasize\ndemography as a second factor that may also modulate the tragedy of the commons\nand favor cooperative integration of groups. Each act of selfishness or\ncooperation in a group often influences group survival and fecundity over many\nsubsequent generations. For example, a cooperative act early in the growth\ncycle of a colony may enhance the future size and survival of the colony. This\ntime-dependent benefit can greatly increase the degree of cooperation favored\nby natural selection, providing another way in which to overcome the tragedy of\nthe commons and enhance the integration of group behavior.

We equip players with the\nparticle swarm optimization technique, and find that it may lead to highly\ncooperative states even if the temptations to defect are strong. The concept of\nparticle swarm optimization was originally introduced within a simple model of\nsocial dynamics that can describe the formation of a swarm, i.e., analogous to\na swarm of bees searching for a food source. Essentially, particle swarm\noptimization foresees changes in the velocity profile of each player, such that\nthe best locations are targeted and eventually occupied. In our case, each\nplayer keeps track of the highest payoff attained within a local topological\nneighborhood and its individual highest payoff. Thus, players make use of their\nown memory that keeps score of the most profitable strategy in previous\nactions, as well as use of the knowledge gained by the swarm as a whole, to\nfind the best available strategy for themselves and the society. Following\nextensive simulations of this setup, we find a significant increase in the\nlevel of cooperation for a wide range of parameters, and also a full resolution\nof the prisoner's dilemma. We also demonstrate extreme efficiency of the\noptimization algorithm when dealing with environments that strongly favor the\nproliferation of defection, which in turn suggests that swarming could be an\nimportant phenomenon by means of which cooperation can be sustained even under\nhighly unfavorable conditions. We thus present an alternative way of\nunderstanding the evolution of cooperative behavior and its ubiquitous presence\nin nature, and we hope that this study will be inspirational for future efforts\naimed in this direction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 20:43:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-30", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Jianlei", ""], ["Zhang", "Chunyan", ""], ["Chu", "Tianguang", ""], ["Perc", "Matjaz", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.6421", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Chunyan Zhang, Jianlei Zhang, Guangming Xie, Long Wang, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Evolution of interactions and cooperation in the spatial prisoner's\n  dilemma game", "comments": "14 pages, 6 figures; accepted for publication in PLoS ONE", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 6 (2011) e26724", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0026724", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.stat-mech q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game\nwhere players are allowed to establish new interactions with others.
