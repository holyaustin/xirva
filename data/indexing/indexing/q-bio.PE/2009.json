However, exactly how the\nsensory ability influences fitness is a topic of active research, while the\nnecessity of a time delay between when unreliable environmental cues are sensed\nand when organisms can mount a response has yet to be explored at any length.\nAccounting for this delay in phenotype response in models of population growth,\nwe find that a critical error probability can exist under certain environmental\nconditions: an organism with a sensory system with any error probability less\nthan the critical value can achieve the same long-term growth rate as an\norganism with a perfect sensing system. We also observe a trade off between the\nevolutionary value of sensory information and robustness to error, mediated by\nthe rate at which the phenotype distribution relaxes to steady-state. The\nexistence of the critical error probability could have several important\nevolutionary consequences, primarily that sensory systems operating at the\nnon-zero critical error probability may be evolutionarily optimal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:52:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:59:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Moffett", "Alexander S.", ""], ["Wallbridge", "Nigel", ""], ["Plummer", "Carrol", ""], ["Eckford", "Andrew W.", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00143", "submitter": "Ivan Ezeigbo", "authors": "Ivan Ezeigbo", "title": "When Costly Punishment Becomes Evolutionarily Beneficial", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Cooperation in evolutionary biology means paying a cost, c, to enjoy\nbenefits, b. A defector is one who does not pay any cost but enjoys the\nbenefits of cooperators. Human societies, especially, have evolved a strategy\nto discourage defection, punishment. Costly punishment is a type of punishment\nwhere an agent in a biological network or some cooperative scheme pays a cost\nto ensure another agent incurs some cost. A previous study shows how parameters\nlike diversity in neighbors across games, density of connectivity, and costly\npunishment influence the evolution of cooperation in non-regular networks. In\nthis study, evolution in regular networks due to the influence of costly\npunishment is also considered, specifically spatial lattices. This study\ncompares observations between non-regular and regular networks as these\nparameters change and brings a clearer understanding of interactions that occur\nin these networks. The models, results and analysis bring a new understanding\nto game theory and punishment. The results show that costly punishment never\narises as a sole evolutionary strategy. However, in evolutionary games where\ncostly punishers could evolve more favorable strategies, the initial presence\nof costly punishers would bring about high average payoffs in all types of\nregular networks and heterogeneous networks. In regular networks, every node\nhas the same degree, k. Although punishment is conventionally thought to be\nanti-progressive, in the presence of diversity in neighbors, it magnifies the\npayoff of a group for all heterogeneous networks. In regular networks however,\ndiversity in neighbors is not required for costly punishment to boost average\npayoff. This suggests an answer to the question on why costly punishment has\nbeen favored by natural selection, which is particularly obvious in human\npopulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:19:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ezeigbo", "Ivan", ""]]}, {"id": "2009.00228", "submitter": "Tom Chou", "authors": "Renaud Dessalles and Tom Chou", "title": "Population dynamics and control with imposed interbirth refractory\n  periods", "comments": "13 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  We consider age-structured models with an imposed refractory period between\nbirths.
