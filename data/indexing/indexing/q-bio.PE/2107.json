Currently, over 70% of species are threatened, endangered or\nextinct. To characterize the genetic response to these recent selective\npressures, we collected population genetic data for one successful bivalve\nspecies, Megalonaias nervosa. We identify megabase sized regions that are\nnearly monomorphic across the population, a signal of strong, recent selection\nreshaping genetic diversity. These signatures of selection encompass a total of\n73Mb, greater response to selection than is commonly seen in population genetic\nmodels. We observe 102 duplicate genes with high dN/dS on terminal branches\namong regions with sweeps, suggesting that gene duplication is a causative\nmechanism of recent adaptation in M. nervosa. Genes in sweeps reflect\nfunctional classes known to be important for Unionid survival, including\nanticoagulation genes important for fish host parasitization, detox genes,\nmitochondria management, and shell formation. We identify selective sweeps in\nregions with no known functional impacts, suggesting mechanisms of adaptation\nthat deserve greater attention in future work on species survival. In contrast,\npolymorphic transposable element insertions appear to be detrimental and\nunderrepresented among regions with sweeps. TE site frequency spectra are\nskewed toward singleton variants, and TEs among regions with sweeps are present\nonly at low frequency. Our work suggests that duplicate genes are an essential\nsource of genetic novelty that has helped this successful species succeed in\nenvironments where others have struggled.

Can imitation evolve in the absence of cultural transmission?\n  We investigate a model in which imitation is unbundled from cultural\ntransmission: an organism's adult phenotype is plastically altered by its\njuvenile experiences of genetically determined juvenile traits within its\ncohort, and the only information transmitted between generations is genetic.\nTransmission of phenotypic information between generations is precluded by the\npopulation being semelparous with discrete, non-overlapping generations.\n  We find that during a period of directional selection towards a phenotypic\noptimum, natural selection favors modifiers which cause an organism to bias its\nplastic phenotype in the direction opposite to the mean phenotype of the\npopulation. As the population approaches the phenotypic optimum and shifts into\nstabilizing selection, selection on the modifier reverses and favors strong\nimitation of the population mean. Imitation can become so strong that it\nresults in \"genotype-phenotype disengagement\" Gonzalez et al. (2017) or even\n\"hyper-imitation\" -- where the adult phenotype overshoots the mean phenotype.\nHyper-imitation produces an evolutionary pathology, where the phenotype is\ndriven away from the optimum, resulting in a drop in mean fitness, and the\ncollapse of imitation. Repeated cycles of hyper-imitation and its collapse are\nobserved. Genetic constraints on hyper-imitation will prevent these cycles. In\na model of purifying selection for an extreme phenotype, selection for\nanti-imitation continues even at a mutation-selection balance.

We assume that the\nimmune system follows a strategy that maximizes the long-term immune coverage\nand minimizes the short-term metabolic costs associated with affinity\nmaturation. This strategy is defined as an optimal decision process on a finite\ndimensional phenotypic space, where a pre-existing population of naive cells is\nsequentially challenged with a neutrally evolving strain. We unveil a trade-off\nbetween immune protection against future strains and the necessary\nreorganization of the repertoire. This plasticity of the repertoire drives the\nemergence of distinct regimes for the size and diversity of the memory pool,\ndepending on the density of naive cells and on the mutation rate of the strain.\nThe model predicts power-law distributions of clonotype sizes observed in data,\nand rationalizes antigenic imprinting as a strategy to minimize metabolic costs\nwhile keeping good immune protection against future strains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Jul 2021 11:45:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Chard\u00e8s", "Victor", ""], ["Vergassola", "Massimo", ""], ["Walczak", "Aleksandra M.", ""], ["Mora", "Thierry", ""]]}, {"id": "2107.12180", "submitter": "Mattia Zanella", "authors": "G.

The local and\nglobal stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is well established.\nAnalytically it is found that there is a forward bifurcation between the DFE\nand an endemic equilibrium using central manifold theory.

Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,\nburn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving\nenvironments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other\nanimals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in\nexercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases\nin daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals\nexhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating\nsome of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by\ndecreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy\ncompensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But\nthe processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy\ncompensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how\nenergy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant\nexercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates\nconflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level\nactivity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body\ncomposition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity\nare not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it?
