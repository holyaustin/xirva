The former is typically regarded as the capacity of a community to\nreturn to an original equilibrium state after a perturbation in species\nabundances, and is usually linked to the strength of interspecific\ninteractions. The latter is the capacity to sustain positive abundances on all\nits constituent species, and is linked to both interspecific interactions and\nspecies demographic characteristics. Over the last 40 years, theoretical\nresearch in ecology has emphasized the search for conditions leading to the\ndynamical stability of ecological communities, while the conditions leading to\nfeasibility have been overlooked. However, thus far, we have no evidence of\nwhether species interactions are more conditioned by the community's need to be\nstable or feasible. Here, we introduce novel quantitative methods and use\nempirical data to investigate the consequences of species interactions on the\ndynamical stability and feasibility of mutualistic communities. First, we\ndemonstrate that the more nested the species interactions in a community are,\nthe lower the mutualistic strength that the community can tolerate without\nlosing dynamical stability. Second, we show that high feasibility in a\ncommunity can be reached either with high mutualistic strength or with highly\nnested species interactions. Third, we find that during the assembly process of\na seasonal pollinator community located at The Zackenberg Research Station (NE\nGreenland), a high feasibility is reached through the nested species\ninteractions established between newcomer and resident species.

To understand the effect of such campaign, we studied\nthe incidence of dengue in four municipalities of the mentioned state, namely\nManzanillo, Armeria, Tecoman and Ixtlahuacan.

In particular the\nfossilized birth-death tree prior and the Lewis-Mk model of discrete\nmorphological evolution allow for the estimation of both divergence times and\nphylogenetic relationships between fossil and extant taxa. We exploit this\nstatistical framework to investigate the internal consistency of these models\nby producing phylogenetic estimates of the age of each fossil in turn, within\ntwo rich and well-characterized data sets of fossil and extant species\n(penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of fossil ages is\ngenerally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the true age and median\nrelative error in the two data sets of 5.7% and 13.2% respectively. The median\nrelative standard error (RSD) was 9.2% and 7.2% respectively, suggesting good\nprecision, although with some outliers. In fact in the two data sets we analyze\nthe phylogenetic estimates of fossil age is on average < 2 My from the midpoint\nage of the geological strata from which it was excavated. The high level of\ninternal consistency found in our analyses suggests that the Bayesian\nstatistical model employed is an adequate fit for both the geological and\nmorphological data, and provides evidence from real data that the framework\nused can accurately model the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded\nfrom fossil and extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse\napplications beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are\ntemporally unconstrained, testing of the \"morphological clock\", and for\nuncovering potential model misspecification and/or data errors when\ncontroversial phylogenetic hypotheses are obtained based on combined divergence\ndating analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 16:55:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 3 May 2016 05:28:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-04", "authors_parsed": [["Drummond", "Alexei J.", ""], ["Stadler", "Tanja", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.07606", "submitter": "Narges Montazeri Shahtori", "authors": "Narges Montazeri Shahtori, Caterina Scoglio, Arash Pourhabib, Faryad\n  Darabi Sahneh", "title": "Sequential Monte Carlo Filtering Estimation of Ebola Progression in West\n  Africa", "comments": "6 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We use a multivariate formulation of sequential Monte Carlo filter that\nutilizes mechanistic models for Ebola virus propagation and available incidence\ndata to simultaneously estimate the disease progression states and the model\nparameters.

When individuals meet repeatedly, they can use\nconditional strategies to enforce cooperative outcomes that would not be\nfeasible in one-shot social dilemmas. Direct reciprocity requires that\nindividuals keep track of their past interactions and find the right response.\nHowever, there are natural bounds on strategic complexity: Humans find it\ndifficult to remember past interactions accurately, especially over long\ntimespans. Given these limitations, it is natural to ask how complex strategies\nneed to be for cooperation to evolve. Here, we study stochastic evolutionary\ngame dynamics in finite populations to systematically compare the evolutionary\nperformance of reactive strategies, which only respond to the co-player's\nprevious move, and memory-one strategies, which take into account the own and\nthe co-player's previous move. In both cases, we compare deterministic strategy\nand stochastic strategy spaces. For reactive strategies and small costs, we\nfind that stochasticity benefits cooperation, because it allows for\ngenerous-tit-for-tat. For memory one strategies and small costs, we find that\nstochasticity does not increase the propensity for cooperation, because the\ndeterministic rule of win-stay, lose-shift works best.
