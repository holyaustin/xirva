In this regard, contemporary genomes\ncan be used as molecular records that reveal associations of various genes\nworking in their natural lifestyles. By analyzing thousands of orthologs across\n~600 bacterial species, we constructed a map of gene-gene co-occurrence across\nmuch of the sequenced biome. If genes preferentially co-occur in the same\norganisms, they were called herein correlogs; in the opposite case, called\nanti-correlogs. To quantify correlogy and anti-correlogy, we alleviated the\ncontribution of indirect correlations between genes by adapting ideas developed\nfor reverse engineering of transcriptional regulatory networks. Resultant\ncorrelogous associations are highly enriched for physically interacting\nproteins and for co-expressed transcripts, clearly differentiating a subgroup\nof functionally-obligatory protein interactions from conditional or transient\ninteractions. Other biochemical and phylogenetic properties were also found to\nbe reflected in correlogous and anti-correlogous relationships. Additionally,\nour study elucidates the global organization of the gene association map, in\nwhich various modules of correlogous genes are strikingly interconnected by\nanti-correlogous crosstalk between the modules.

We\nwish to argue that the evolution of life marks the end of a physics world view\nof law entailed dynamics. Our considerations depend upon discussing the\nvariability of the very \"contexts of life\": the interactions between organisms,\nbiological niches and ecosystems. These are ever changing, intrinsically\nindeterminate and even unprestatable: we do not know ahead of time the \"niches\"\nwhich constitute the boundary conditions on selection. More generally, by the\nmathematical unprestatability of the \"phase space\" (space of possibilities), no\nlaws of motion can be formulated for evolution. We call this radical emergence,\nfrom life to life. The purpose of this paper is the integration of variation\nand diversity in a sound conceptual frame and situate unpredictability at a\nnovel theoretical level, that of the very phase space. Our argument will be\ncarried on in close comparisons with physics and the mathematical constructions\nof phase spaces in that discipline. The role of (theoretical) symmetries as\ninvariant preserving transformations will allow us to understand the nature of\nphysical phase spaces and to stress the differences required for a sound\nbiological theoretizing. In this frame, we discuss the novel notion of\n\"enablement\". This will restrict causal analyses to differential cases (a\ndifference that causes a difference). Mutations or other causal differences\nwill allow us to stress that \"non conservation principles\" are at the core of\nevolution, in contrast to physical dynamics, largely based on conservation\nprinciples as symmetries. Critical transitions, the main locus of symmetry\nchanges in physics, will be discussed, and lead to \"extended criticality\" as a\nconceptual frame for a better understanding of the living state of matter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jan 2012 15:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Longo", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Mont\u00e9vil", "Ma\u00ebl", ""], ["Kauffman", "Stuart", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.2467", "submitter": "K.S.

A gene family includes instances of the same gene in\ndifferent species (orthologs) and duplicate genes in the same species\n(paralogs). Genes are gained and lost during evolution. With advances in\nsequencing technology, researchers are able to investigate the important roles\nof gene duplications and losses in adaptive evolution. Because of gene complex\nevolution, ortholog identification is a basic but difficult task in comparative\ngenomics. A key method for the task is to use an explicit model of the\nevolutionary history of the genes being studied, called the gene (family) tree.\nIt compares the gene tree with the evolutionary history of the species in which\nthe genes reside, called the species tree, using the procedure known as tree\nreconciliation. Reconciling binary gene and specific trees is simple. However,\nboth gene and species trees may be non-binary in practice and thus tree\nreconciliation presents challenging problems. Here, non-binary gene and species\ntree reconciliation is studied in a binary refinement model.\n  Results: The problem of reconciling arbitrary gene and species trees is\nproved NP-hard even for the duplication cost. We then present the first\nefficient method for reconciling a non-binary gene tree and a non-binary\nspecies tree.

In this article I analyze competition between\ntwo phytoplankton species in a deep water column, where the distributions of\nmain resources (light and a limiting nutrient) have opposing gradients and\nco-limitation by both resources causes a deep biomass maximum. Assuming that\nthe species have a trade-off in resource requirements and the water column is\nweakly mixed, I apply the invasion threshold analysis (Ryabov and Blasius 2011)\nto determine relations between environmental conditions and phytoplankton\ncomposition. Although species deplete resources in the interior of the water\ncolumn, the resource levels at the bottom and surface remain high. As a result,\nthe slope of resources gradients becomes a new crucial factor which, rather\nthan the local resource values, determines the outcome of competition. The\nvalue of resource gradients nonlinearly depend on the density of consumers.\nThis leads to complex relationships between environmental parameters and\nspecies composition. In particular, it is shown that an increase of both the\nincident light intensity or bottom nutrient concentrations favors the best\nlight competitors, while an increase of the turbulent mixing or background\nturbidity favors the best nutrient competitors. These results might be\nimportant for prediction of species composition in deep ocean.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Jan 2012 09:22:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ryabov", "Alexei B.", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5364", "submitter": "Krzysztof Bartoszek", "authors": "Serik Sagitov and Krzysztof Bartoszek", "title": "Interspecies correlation for neutrally evolving traits", "comments": "19 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology 2012, Vol. 309, 11-19", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A simple way to model phenotypic evolution is to assume that after splitting,\nthe trait values of the sister species diverge as independent Brownian motions.\nRelying only on a prior distribution for the underlying species tree\n(conditioned on the number, n, of extant species) we study the random vector\n(X_1,...,X_n) of the observed trait values.

Conditional cooperators will\ncontribute to the public good only if other players within the group are likely\nto cooperate as well, but will withhold their contribution otherwise. Depending\non the number of other cooperators that are required to elicit cooperation of a\nconditional cooperator, the latter can be classified in as many types as there\nare players within each group. We find that the most cautious cooperators, such\nthat require all other players within a group to be conditional cooperators,\nare the undisputed victors of the evolutionary process, even at very low\nsynergy factors. We show that the remarkable promotion of cooperation is due\nprimarily to the spontaneous emergence of quarantining of defectors, which\nbecome surrounded by conditional cooperators and are forced into isolated\nconvex \"bubbles\" from where they are unable to exploit the public good.

In this regime we show that factors that\nare independent of the resource competition become as important as the\ncompetition efficiency and that the direct competition model is a good\napproximation of the chemostat. Assuming these two timescales allows us to\nestablish a mathematically rigorous proof showing that our resource-competition\nmodel with continuous traits converges to a direct competition model.
