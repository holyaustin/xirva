In this work, we demonstrate that\nthe well-known Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model can undergo a\nrate-induced critical transition in response to a continuous decline in the\nhabitat quality, resulting in a collapse of the predator and prey populations.\nRather surprisingly, the collapse occurs even if the environmental change is\nslower than the slowest process in the model.

All prokaryotes have genomes consisting of\ndouble-stranded DNA, where the A's and G's (purines) of one strand bind\nrespectively to the T's and C's (pyrimidines) of the other. As such, the number\nof A's on one strand nearly equals the number of T's on the other, and the same\nis true of one strand's G's and the other's C's. Globally, this relationship is\nformalized as Chargaff's first parity rule; its strandwise equivalent is\nChargaff's second parity rule. Therefore, the GC content of any double-stranded\nDNA genome can be expressed as %GC=100%-%AT. Variation in prokaryotic GC\ncontent can be substantial between taxa but is generally small within microbial\ngenomes. This variation has been found to correlate with both phylogeny and\nenvironmental factors. Since novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)\nwithin genomes are at least partially linked to the environment, SNP GC content\ncan be considered a compound measure of an organism's environmental influences,\nlifestyle and phylogeny. We present a mathematical model that describes how SNP\nGC content in microbial genomes evolves over time as a function of the AT->GC\nand GC->AT mutation rates with Gaussian white noise disturbances. The model\nsuggests that, in non-recombining bacteria, mutations can first accumulate\nunnoticeably and then abruptly fluctuate out of control. Thus, minuscule\nvariations in mutation rates can suddenly become unsustainable, ultimately\ndriving a species to extinction if not counteracted early enough. This model,\nwhich is suited specifically to symbiotic prokaryotes, conforms to scenarios\npredicted by Muller's ratchet and may suggest that this is not always a\ngradual, degrading process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Aug 2019 14:51:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Bohlin", "Jon", ""], ["Rose", "Brittany", ""], ["Brynildsrud", "Ola", ""], ["De Blasio", "Birgitte Freiesleben", ""]]}, {"id": "1908.09256", "submitter": "Thomas G\\\"otz", "authors": "N.C.

We find that the best ML models can successfully predict species\ninteractions in plant-pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial\nmargin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the\ncausally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case\nstudies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a\nglobal plant-pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible\ntrait-matching rules for a plant-hummingbird network, without any prior\nassumptions. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over\ntraditional regression models for understanding interaction networks.

Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from\ntheir wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a\ndomestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and moreover, this\ntransmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade\nintensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many\notherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so\nunderstanding this process with mathematical epidemiological models is\nnecessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions\nin public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we\naccount for spillovers of a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host\nby means of modeling transmission dynamics within and between three host\nspecies, namely, wild reservoir, intermediate domestic animals, and humans. We\ncalculate the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, present critical\nconditions for the emergence dynamics of zoonosis, and perform stability\nanalysis of admissible disease equilibria. Our analytical results agree well\nwith long-term simulations of the system. We find that in the presence of\nbiologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease\ncan establish itself in humans even if it fails to persist in its reservoir and\nintermediate host species.

We observe a non-trivial interplay between the inherent\nspatiotemporal dynamics that characterizes the spreading of cooperation in a\nparticular social dilemma type and the frequency of payoff changes. In\nparticular, we show that periodic changes between two available games with\nglobal ordering best be fast, while periodic changes between global and local\nordering games best be slow for cooperation to thrive. We also show that the\nfrequency of periodic changes between two local ordering social dilemmas is\nirrelevant, because then the process is fast and simply the average cooperation\nlevel of the two is returned. The structure of the interaction network plays an\nimportant role too in that lattices promote local ordering, whilst random\ngraphs hinder the formation of compact cooperative clusters.
