Analysis of this model indicates that\nalthough some dispersal does indeed decrease the probability of extinction of\nthe population, the frequency of dispersal is only important in certain\nextremes. Instead, both the mean population birth and death rates, and the\nlandscape composition, are much more important in determining the probability\nof extinction than the dispersal process. Thus, in order to develop effective\nconservation strategies for these spiders, better understanding of life history\nprocesses should be prioritized over an understanding of dispersal strategies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2009 15:50:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Jan 2010 11:43:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-15", "authors_parsed": [["Johnson", "Leah R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2885", "submitter": "Mike Steel Prof.", "authors": "Andreas Dress, Vincent Moulton, Mike Steel, Taoyang Wu", "title": "Species, Clusters and the 'Tree of Life': A graph-theoretic perspective", "comments": "19 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A hierarchical structure describing the inter-relationships of species has\nlong been a fundamental concept in systematic biology, from Linnean\nclassification through to the more recent quest for a 'Tree of Life.'

Recent experimental work has shown that MHC escape mutations form an\nimportant pathway for HIV to avoid such selection. In this paper, we study a\nmodel of MHC escape mutation. The model is a predator-prey model with two prey,\ncomposed of two HIV variants, and one predator, the immune system CD8 cells. We\nassume that one HIV variant is visible to CD8 cells and one is not. The model\ntakes the form of a system of stochastic differential equations. Motivated by\nwell-known results concerning the short life-cycle of HIV intrahost, we assume\nthat HIV population dynamics occur on a faster time scale then CD8 population\ndynamics. This separation of time scales allows us to analyze our model using\nan asymptotic approach.\n  Using this model we study the impact of an MHC escape mutation on the\npopulation dynamics and genetic evolution of the intrahost HIV population. From\nthe perspective of population dynamics, we show that the competition between\nthe visible and invisible HIV variants can reach steady states in which either\na single variant exists or in which coexistence occurs depending on the\nparameter regime. We show that in some parameter regimes the end state of the\nsystem is stochastic.
