Recent work has also exploited the connection between\ncontinuously- and discretely-observed BDPs to derive EM algorithms for maximum\nlikelihood estimation.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel deterministic framework for computing fixation probabilities\nfor strongly connected, directed, weighted evolutionary graphs under neutral\ndrift. We show how this framework can also be used to calculate the expected\nnumber of mutants at a given time step (even if we relax the assumption that\nthe graph is strongly connected), how it can extend to other related models\n(e.g. voter model), how our framework can provide non-trivial bounds for\nfixation probability in the case of an advantageous mutant, and how it can be\nused to find a non-trivial lower bound on the mean time to fixation.

In the absence of strong purifying\nselection, spontaneous and frequently deleterious mutations tend to accumulate\nin the human genome and gradually increase the genetic load; that is, the\nfrequency of potentially lethal genes in the gene pool. Gradual increase in\nincidence of many hereditary disorders suggests deleterious impact of the\ngenetic load on human well being. Many complex diseases such as type 1 and 2\ndiabetes, autism, bipolar disorder, allergies, Alzheimer disease, and some\ncancers show significantly higher concordance in monozygotic (MZ) twins than in\ndizygotic twins (DZ) or parent-child pairs, suggesting their etiology is\nstrongly influenced by genetics. Preventing these diseases based on genetic\ndata alone is frequently impossible. We hypothesize that the incidence of\ncomplex diseases could be significantly reduced in the future through a\nstrategy based on time-separated twinning. This strategy involves the\ncollection and fertilization of human oocytes followed by several rounds of\nartificial twinning. If preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) reports no\naneuploidy or known Mendelian disorders, one of the MZ siblings would be\nimplanted and the remaining embryos cryoconserved. Once the health of the adult\nMZ sibling(s) is established, subsequent parenthood with the cryoconserved\ntwins could substantially lower the incidence of hereditary disorders with\nMendelian or complex etiology.

The combination of actions and moral assessment\nleads to a large diversity of strategies, thus determining the stability of any\nof them against invasions by all the others is a difficult task.

We provide a scientific foundation to inform this debate, based on\nmathematical, epidemiological models that quantify the dependence of\nfirearm-related death rates of people on gun policies. We assume a shooter\nattacking a single individual or a crowd. Two strategies can minimize deaths in\nthe model, depending on parameters: either a ban of private firearms\npossession, or a policy allowing the general population to carry guns. In\nparticular, the outcome depends on the fraction of offenders that illegally\npossess a gun, on the degree of protection provided by gun ownership, and on\nthe fraction of the population who take up their right to own a gun and carry\nit with them when attacked, parameters that can be estimated from statistical\ndata. With the measured parameters, the model suggests that if the gun law is\nenforced at a level similar to that in the United Kingdom, gun-related deaths\nare minimized if private possession of firearms is banned. If such a policy is\nnot practical or possible due to constitutional or cultural constraints, the\nmodel and parameter estimation indicate that a partial reduction in firearm\navailability can lead to a reduction in gun-induced death rates, even if they\nare not minimized.
