It is an approach based on\nanother known universal dynamics: The evolutionary dynamics first conceived by\nDarwin and Wallace, referring to as Darwinian dynamics in the present paper,\nhas been found to be universally valid in biology; The statistical mechanics\nand thermodynamics, while enormously successful in physics, have been in an\nawkward situation of wanting a consistent dynamical understanding; Here we\npresent from a formal point of view an exploration of the connection between\nthermodynamics and Darwinian dynamics and a few related topics. We first show\nthat the stochasticity in Darwinian dynamics implies the existence temperature,\nhence the canonical distribution of Boltzmann-Gibbs type. In term of relative\nentropy the Second Law of thermodynamics is dynamically demonstrated without\ndetailed balance condition, and is valid regardless of size of the system. In\nparticular, the dynamical component responsible for breaking detailed balance\ncondition does not contribute to the change of the relative entropy. Two types\nof stochastic dynamical equalities of current interest are explicitly discussed\nin the present approach: One is based on Feynman-Kac formula and another is a\ngeneralization of Einstein relation. Both are directly accessible to\nexperimental tests. Our demonstration indicates that Darwinian dynamics\nrepresents logically a simple and straightforward starting point for\nstatistical mechanics and thermodynamics and is complementary to and consistent\nwith conservative dynamics that dominates the physical sciences. Present\nexploration suggests the existence of a unified stochastic dynamical framework\nboth near and far from equilibrium.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 1 Jun 2008 23:29:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ao", "P", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.0263", "submitter": "Francisco Fernandez Dr.", "authors": "Francisco M.

A particularly challenging problem for phylogenetic\nmethods arises when a rapid divergence event occurred in the distant past. We\nanalyse an idealised form of this problem in which the terminal edges of a\nsymmetric four--taxon tree are some factor ($p$) times the length of the\ninterior edge. We determine an order $p^2$ lower bound on the growth rate for\nthe sequence length required to resolve the tree (independent of any particular\nbranch length). We also show that this rate of sequence length growth can be\nachieved by existing methods (including the simple `maximum parsimony' method),\nand compare these order $p^2$ bounds with an order $p$ growth rate for a model\nthat describes low-homoplasy evolution. In the final section, we provide a\ngeneric bound on the sequence length requirement for a more general class of\nMarkov processes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Jun 2008 06:10:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Fischer", "Mareike", ""], ["Steel", "Mike", ""]]}, {"id": "0806.2636", "submitter": "Tibor Antal", "authors": "Tibor Antal, Hisashi Ohtsuki, John Wakeley, Peter D.

Individuals might behave differently towards those who look similar or\ndissimilar. Individuals mutate to nearby phenotypes. We study the `phenotypic\nspace walk' of populations.

As a\nparticular example, we investigate the evolution of cooperation in phenotype\nspace.
