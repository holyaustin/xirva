We here introduce a sequence-based\nmethod to predict vaccine effectiveness in humans. Historical epidemiological\ndata show that this sequence-based method is as predictive of vaccine\neffectiveness as hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay data from ferret animal\nmodel studies. Interestingly, the expected vaccine effectiveness is greater\nagainst H1N1 than H3N2, suggesting a stronger immune response against H1N1 than\nH3N2. The evolution rate of hemagglutinin in H1N1 is also shown to be greater\nthan that in H3N2, presumably due to greater immune selection pressure.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 14:25:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Pan", "Keyao", ""], ["Subieta", "Krystina C.", ""], ["Deem", "Michael W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6231", "submitter": "Carl Boettiger", "authors": "Carl Boettiger and Alan Hastings", "title": "Quantifying Limits to Detection of Early Warning for Critical\n  Transitions", "comments": "Accepted to Journal of the Royal Society Interface. 29 pages, 8\n  figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.OT physics.data-an q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  Catastrophic regime shifts in complex natural systems may be averted through\nadvanced detection. Recent work has provided a proof-of-principle that many\nsystems approaching a catastrophic transition may be identified through the\nlens of early warning indicators such as rising variance or increased return\ntimes. Despite widespread appreciation of the difficulties and uncertainty\ninvolved in such forecasts, proposed methods hardly ever characterize their\nexpected error rates. Without the benefits of replicates, controls, or\nhindsight, applications of these approaches must quantify how reliable\ndifferent indicators are in avoiding false alarms, and how sensitive they are\nto missing subtle warning signs. We propose a model based approach in order to\nquantify this trade-off between reliability and sensitivity and allow\ncomparisons between different indicators. We show these error rates can be\nquite severe for common indicators even under favorable assumptions, and also\nillustrate how a model-based indicator can improve this performance. We\ndemonstrate how the performance of an early warning indicator varies in\ndifferent data sets, and suggest that uncertainty quantification become a more\ncentral part of early warning predictions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 19:22:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boettiger", "Carl", ""], ["Hastings", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6313", "submitter": "Michael Deem", "authors": "Jiankui He and Michael W.

Main text abstract: Evolutionary experiments\nwith microbes are a powerful tool to study mutations and natural selection.\nThese experiments, however, are often limited to the well-mixed environments of\na test tube or a chemostat. Since spatial organization can significantly affect\nevolutionary dynamics, the need is growing for evolutionary experiments in\nspatially structured environments. The surface of a Petri dish provides such an\nenvironment, but a more detailed understanding of microbial growth on Petri\ndishes is necessary to interpret such experiments. We formulate a simple\ndeterministic reaction-diffusion model, which successfully predicts the spatial\npatterns created by two competing species during colony expansion. We also\nderive the shape of these patterns analytically without relying on microscopic\ndetails of the model. In particular, we find that the relative fitness of two\nmicrobial strains can be estimated from the logarithmic spirals created by\nselective sweeps. The theory is tested with strains of the budding yeast\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae, for spatial competitions with different initial\nconditions and for a range of relative fitnesses. The reaction-diffusion model\nalso connects the microscopic parameters like growth rates and diffusion\nconstants with macroscopic spatial patterns and predicts the relationship\nbetween fitness in liquid cultures and on Petri dishes, which we confirmed\nexperimentally. Spatial sector patterns therefore provide an alternative\nfitness assay to the commonly used liquid culture fitness assays.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 20:32:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Korolev", "Kirill S", ""], ["M\u00fcller", "Melanie J I", ""], ["Karahan", "Nilay", ""], ["Murray", "Andrew W", ""], ["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""], ["Nelson", "David R", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.6353", "submitter": "Fernando Antoneli Jr", "authors": "Fernando Antoneli, Francisco Bosco, Diogo Castro and Luiz Mario Janini", "title": "Virus Replication as a Phenotypic Version of Polynucleotide Evolution", "comments": "23 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text\n  overlap with arXiv:1110.3368", "journal-ref": "Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, April 2013, Volume 75, Issue 4,\n  pp 602-628", "doi": "10.1007/s11538-013-9822-9", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.PR physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper we revisit and adapt to viral evolution an approach based on\nthe theory of branching process advanced by Demetrius, Schuster and Sigmund\n(\"Polynucleotide evolution and branching processes\", Bull.
