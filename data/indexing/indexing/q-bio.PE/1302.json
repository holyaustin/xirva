Here we consider Markovian susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS)\ndynamics on finite strongly connected networks, applicable to several sexually\ntransmitted diseases and computer viruses. In this context, a theoretical\ndefinition of endemic prevalence is easily obtained via the quasi-stationary\ndistribution (QSD). By representing the model as a percolation process and\nutilising the property of duality, we also provide a theoretical definition of\ninvasion probability. We then show that, for undirected networks, the\nprobability of invasion from any given individual is equal to the\n(probabilistic) endemic prevalence, following successful invasion, at the\nindividual (we also provide a relationship for the directed case). The total\n(fractional) endemic prevalence in the population is thus equal to the average\ninvasion probability (across all individuals). Consequently, for such systems,\nthe regions or individuals already supporting a high level of infection are\nlikely to be the source of a successful invasion by another infectious agent.\nThis could be used to inform targeted interventions when there is a threat from\nan emerging infectious disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 19:16:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 15:35:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Wilkinson", "Robert R.", ""], ["Sharkey", "Kieran J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.0452", "submitter": "Sergey Kryazhimskiy", "authors": "Alison Feder, Sergey Kryazhimskiy, Joshua B.

Discriminating between these two evolutionary\nforces, based on a time series of samples from a population, remains an\noutstanding problem with increasing relevance to modern data sets. Even in the\nidealized situation when the sampled locus is independent of all other loci\nthis problem is difficult to solve, especially when the size of the population\nfrom which the samples are drawn is unknown. A standard $\\chi^2$-based\nlikelihood ratio test was previously proposed to address this problem. Here we\nshow that the $\\chi^2$ test of selection substantially underestimates the\nprobability of Type I error, leading to more false positives than indicated by\nits $P$-value, especially at stringent $P$-values. We introduce two methods to\ncorrect this bias. The empirical likelihood ratio test (ELRT) rejects\nneutrality when the likelihood ratio statistic falls in the tail of the\nempirical distribution obtained under the most likely neutral population size.\nThe frequency increment test (FIT) rejects neutrality if the distribution of\nnormalized allele frequency increments exhibits a mean that deviates\nsignificantly from zero. We characterize the statistical power of these two\ntests for selection, and we apply them to three experimental data sets. We\ndemonstrate that both ELRT and FIT have power to detect selection in practical\nparameter regimes, such as those encountered in microbial evolution\nexperiments.

Furthermore, because\nphenotypic divergence often correlates with founding niches, niche founders may\non average be more evolvable, which through population growth provides a\ngenotypic bias towards evolvability. Interestingly, the combination of these\ntwo mechanisms can lead to increasing evolvability without any pressure to\nout-compete other organisms, as demonstrated through experiments with a series\nof simulated models.

The laws for\nvariation and inheritance of the parameters are also subject to CNS if\nvariation in transmission laws occurs. This is the strategy introduced by Nei\n(1967) to understand genetic transmission, through the evolutionary theory of\nmodifier genes, whose methodology is adopted here.

The\nreduction principle for CNS is illustrated with a general multitype branching\nprocess model of universe creation containing competing inheritance laws. The\nmost faithful inheritance law dominates the ensemble of universes. The\nReduction Principle thus provides a mechanism to account for high fidelity of\ninheritance between universes. Moreover, it reveals that natural selection in\nthe presence of variation in inheritance mechanisms has two distinct objects:\nmaximization of both fitness and faithful inheritance.

First, we argue\nthat one cannot reliably estimate the absolute and relative number of microbial\nspecies present in a community without making unsupported assumptions about\nspecies abundance distributions. The reason for this is that sample data do not\ncontain information about the number of rare species in the tail of species\nabundance distributions. We illustrate the difficulty in comparing species\nrichness estimates by applying Chao's estimator of species richness to a set of\nin silico communities: they are ranked incorrectly in the presence of large\nnumbers of rare species. Next, we extend our analysis to a general family of\ndiversity metrics (\"Hill diversities\"), and construct lower and upper estimates\nof diversity values consistent with the sample data. The theory generalizes\nChao's estimator, which we retrieve as the lower estimate of species richness.\nWe show that Shannon and Simpson diversity can be robustly estimated for the in\nsilico communities. We analyze nine metagenomic data sets from a wide range of\nenvironments, and show that our findings are relevant for empirically-sampled\ncommunities.

Different trees from the posterior\ndistribution can give diversification rates ranging from high values to almost\nzero for the same clade, and for some clades both significant rate increase and\ndecrease were estimated. Only three out of 13 significant shifts found on the\nmaximum credibility tree were consistent across more than 95% of the trees from\nthe posterior: (i) accelerated diversification for Solanaceae feeders in the\ntribe Ithomiini; (ii) accelerated diversification in the genus Charaxes, and\n(iii) deceleration in the Danaina. By using the binary speciation and\nextinction model (BISSE), we found that a hostplant shift to Solanaceae or a\ncodistributed character is responsible for the increase in diversification rate\nin Ithomiini, and the result is congruent with the diffuse cospeciation\nhypothesis. A shift to Apocynaceae is not responsible for the slowdown of\ndiversification in Danaina. Our results show that taking phylogenetic\nuncertainty into account when estimating diversification rate shifts is of\ngreat importance, and relying on the maximum credibility tree alone potentially\ncan give erroneous results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2013 02:04:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Pe\u00f1a", "Carlos", ""], ["Espeland", "Marianne", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.6422", "submitter": "Ruriko Yoshida", "authors": "Grady Weyenberg and Peter Huggins and Christopher Schardl and Daniel K\n  Howe and Ruriko Yoshida", "title": "kdetrees: Nonparametric Estimation of Phylogenetic Tree Distributions", "comments": "3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: While the majority of gene histories found in a clade of\norganisms are expected to be generated by a common process (e.g. the coalescent\nprocess), it is well-known that numerous other coexisting processes (e.g.\nhorizontal gene transfers, gene duplication and subsequent\nneofunctionalization) will cause some genes to exhibit a history quite distinct\nfrom those of the majority of genes.

Fisher and Muller proposed that\nrecombination provides an evolutionary advantage in large populations by\nalleviating this competition. Based on recent progress in quantifying the speed\nof adaptation in asexual populations undergoing clonal interference, we present\na detailed analysis of the Fisher-Muller mechanism for a model genome\nconsisting of two loci with an infinite number of beneficial alleles each and\nmultiplicative fitness effects. We solve the infinite population dynamics\nexactly and show that, for a particular, natural mutation scheme, the speed of\nadaptation in sexuals is twice as large as in asexuals. Guided by the infinite\npopulation result and by previous work on asexual adaptation, we postulate an\nexpression for the speed of adaptation in finite sexual populations that agrees\nwith numerical simulations over a wide range of population sizes and\nrecombination rates. The ratio of the sexual to asexual adaptation speed is a\nfunction of population size that increases in the clonal interference regime\nand approaches 2 for extremely large populations. The simulations also show\nthat the imbalance between the numbers of accumulated mutations at the two loci\nis strongly suppressed even by a small amount of recombination. The\ngeneralization of the model to an arbitrary number $L$ of loci is briefly\ndiscussed. If each offspring samples the alleles at each locus from the gene\npool of the whole population rather than from two parents, the ratio of the\nsexual to asexual adaptation speed is approximately equal to $L$ in large\npopulations. A possible realization of this scenario is the reassortment of\ngenetic material in RNA viruses with $L$ genomic segments.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 13:54:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 15:31:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-16", "authors_parsed": [["Park", "Su-Chan", ""], ["Krug", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1302.7276", "submitter": "Shi Huang", "authors": "Zuobin Zhu, Qing Lu, Dejian Yuan, Yanke Li, Xian Man, Yueran Zhu, and\n  Shi Huang", "title": "Role of genetic polymorphisms in transgenerational inheritance in\n  budding yeast", "comments": "22 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 7 supplementary tables", "journal-ref": "Genomics, 106: 23-29 (2015)", "doi": "10.1016/j.ygeno.2015.04.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Transgenerational inheritance of a trait is presumably affected by both\ngenetic and environmental factors but remains poorly understood.

For each SNP analyzed, the parental\nallele present in less than half of the segregants panel was called the minor\nallele (MA). We found a nonrandom distribution of MAs in the segregants,\nindicating natural selection. We compared segregants with high MA content (MAC)\nrelative to those with less and found a more dramatic shortening of the lag\nphase length for the high MAC group in response to 14 days of ethanol training.\nAlso, the short lag phase as acquired and epigenetically memorized by ethanol\ntraining was more dramatically lost after 7 days of recovery in ethanol free\nmedium for the high MAC group.
