We analyze a model of trait evolution under mutations and genetic\ndrift in a single-peak fitness seascape.

Specifically, we show that the ratio of the average trait divergence\nand the diversity is a universal function of evolutionary time, which predicts\nthe stabilizing strength and the driving rate of the fitness seascape. From an\ninformation-theoretic point of view, this function measures the\nmacro-evolutionary entropy in a population ensemble, which determines the\npredictability of the evolutionary process. Our solution also quantifies two\nkey characteristics of adapting populations: the cumulative fitness flux, which\nmeasures the total amount of adaptation, and the adaptive load, which is the\nfitness cost due to a population's lag behind the fitness peak.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 7 Mar 2014 16:53:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Held", "Torsten", ""], ["Nourmohammad", "Armita", ""], ["L\u00e4ssig", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.1957", "submitter": "Joel Miller", "authors": "Joel C Miller and Istvan Z Kiss", "title": "Epidemic spread in networks: Existing methods and current challenges", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We consider the spread of infectious disease through contact networks of\nConfiguration Model type.

Here we\npresent a comparative numerical study of sexual and asexual evolutionary\ndynamics of haploids on tunably rugged model landscapes under strong selection,\npaying special attention to the temporal development of the evolutionary\nadvantage of recombination and the link between population diversity and the\nrate of adaptation. We show that the adaptive advantage of recombination on\nstatic rugged landscapes is strictly transitory. At early times, an advantage\nof recombination arises through the possibility to combine individually\noccurring beneficial mutations, but this effect is reversed at longer times by\nthe much more efficient trapping of recombining populations at local fitness\npeaks. These findings are explained by means of well established results for a\nsetup with only two loci. In accordance with the Red Queen hypothesis the\ntransitory advantage can be prolonged indefinitely in fluctuating environments,\nand it is maximal when the environment fluctuates on the same time scale on\nwhich trapping at local optima typically occurs.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2014 16:17:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 18:16:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Nowak", "Stefan", ""], ["Neidhart", "Johannes", ""], ["Szendro", "Ivan G.", ""], ["Krug", "Joachim", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.6670", "submitter": "Ang\\'elica Sousa da Mata", "authors": "Ang\\'elica S.

Such phenomena have been observed in natural predator-prey\nsystems, and characterized in the laboratory as showing unusual phase\nrelationships in population dynamics, including a $\\pi$ phase shift between\npredator and prey (evolutionary cycles) and even undetectable prey oscillations\ncompared to those of the predator (cryptic cycles). Here we present a generic\nindividual-level stochastic model of interacting populations that includes a\nsubpopulation of low nutritional value to the predator. Using a master equation\nformalism, and by mapping to a coherent state path integral solved by a\nsystem-size expansion, we show that evolutionary and cryptic quasicycles can\nemerge generically from the combination of intrinsic demographic fluctuations\nand clonal mutations alone, without additional biological mechanisms.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 04:21:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 17 Jul 2014 16:38:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2014 03:00:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 07:53:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 17:20:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Shih", "Hong-Yan", ""], ["Goldenfeld", "Nigel", ""]]}, {"id": "1403.8032", "submitter": "Gergely R\\\"ost", "authors": "Di\\'ana H.

A general\ncompartmental model is considered to describe the spread of an infectious\ndisease in a population distributed over several patches. For disconnected\nregions, many boundary equilibria may exist with mixed disease free and endemic\ncomponents, but these steady states usually disappear in the presence of\nspatial dispersal. However, if backward bifurcations can occur in the regions,\nsome partially endemic equilibria of the disconnected system move into the\ninterior of the nonnegative cone and persist with the introduction of mobility\nbetween the patches. We provide a mathematical procedure that precisely\ndescribes in terms of the local reproduction numbers and the connectivity\nnetwork of the patches, whether a steady state of the disconnected system is\npreserved or ceases to exist for low volumes of travel. Our results are\nillustrated on a patchy HIV transmission model with subthreshold endemic\nequilibria and backward bifurcation. We demonstrate the rich dynamical behavior\n(i.e., creation and destruction of steady states) and the presence of multiple\nstable endemic equilibria for various connection networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Mar 2014 14:55:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-04-01", "authors_parsed": [["Knipl", "Di\u00e1na H.", ""], ["R\u00f6st", "Gergely", ""]]}]
