The aim of this work is to\nmake a comparative study of these four upwelling systems focussing on their\nsurface stirring, using the Finite Size Lyapunov Exponents (FSLEs), and their\nbiological activity, based on satellite data. First, the spatial distribution\nof horizontal mixing is analysed from time averages and from probability\ndensity functions of FSLEs. Then we studied the temporal variability of surface\nstirring focussing on the annual and seasonal cycle. There is a global negative\ncorrelation between surface horizontal mixing and chlorophyll standing stocks\nover the four areas. To try to better understand this inverse relationship, we\nconsider the vertical dimension by looking at the Ekman-transport and vertical\nvelocities.

This implies, for example, that the increase in\nthe interaction between individuals caused by the development of modern\ncommunication tools, such as facebook and twitter, does not necessarily improve\nthe tendency towards global convergence between different communities.

Perhaps surprisingly, it is controversial\nhow much a protein's functional importance affects its rate of evolution. In\nmost studies, functional importance has been measured on the coarse scale of\nprotein knock-outs, while evolutionary rate has been measured on the fine scale\nof amino acid substitutions. Here we introduce dynamical influence, a finer\nmeasure of protein functional importance. To measure dynamical influence, we\nfirst use detailed biochemical models of particular reaction networks to\nmeasure the influence of each reaction rate constant on network dynamics. We\nthen define the dynamical influence of a protein to be the average influence of\nthe rate constants for all reactions it is involved in.\n  Using models of a dozen biochemical systems and sequence data from\nvertebrates, we show that dynamical influence and evolutionary rate are\nnegatively correlated; proteins with greater dynamical influence evolve more\nslowly. We also show that proteins with greater dynamical influence are not\nmore likely to be essential. This suggests that there are many cellular\nreactions whose presence is essential for life, but whose quantitative rate is\nrelatively unimportant to fitness. We also provide evidence that the effect of\ndynamical influence on evolutionary rate is independent of protein expression\nlevel, expression specificity, gene compactness, and reaction degree. Dynamical\ninfluence offers a finer view of functional importance, and our results suggest\nthat focusing on essentiality may have previously led to an underestimation of\nthe role function plays in protein evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2009 22:01:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 20 Sep 2009 01:15:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-09-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gutenkunst", "Ryan N.", ""]]}, {"id": "0909.3132", "submitter": "Wentian Li", "authors": "Jan Freudengerb, Mingyi Wang, Yaning Yang, Wentian Li", "title": "Partial correlation analysis indicates causal relationships between\n  GC-content, exon density and recombination rate in the human genome", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "BMC Bioinformatics, 10(suppl 1), S66 (2009)", "doi": "10.1186/1471-2105-10-S1-S66", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  {\\bf Background}: Several features are known to correlate with the GC-content\nin the human genome, including recombination rate, gene density and distance to\ntelomere.
