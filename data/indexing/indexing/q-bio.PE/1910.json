Examples include communicable diseases, rumors,\nmisinformation, ideas, innovations, bank failures, and electrical blackouts.\nSometimes, as in the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, a contagion mutates at some\npoint as it spreads through a network. Here, using a simple\nsusceptible-infected (SI) model of contagion, we explore the downstream impact\nof a single mutation event. Assuming that this mutation occurs at a random node\nin the contact network, we calculate the distribution of the number of\n\"descendants,\" $d$, downstream from the initial \"Patient Zero\" mutant. We find\nthat the tail of the distribution decays as $d^{-2}$ for complete graphs,\nrandom graphs, small-world networks, networks with block-like structure, and\nother infinite-dimensional networks. This prediction agrees with the observed\nstatistics of memes propagating and mutating on Facebook, and is expected to\nhold for other effectively infinite-dimensional networks, such as the global\nhuman contact network. In a wider context, our approach suggests a possible\nstarting point for a mesoscopic theory of contagion. Such a theory would focus\non the paths traced by a spreading contagion, thereby furnishing an\nintermediate level of description between that of individual nodes and the\ntotal infected population. We anticipate that contagion pathways will hold\nvaluable lessons, given their role as the conduits through which single\nmutations, innovations, or failures can sweep through a network as a whole.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 Oct 2019 20:27:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 1 Jun 2020 15:32:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-08", "authors_parsed": [["Juul", "Jonas S.", ""], ["Strogatz", "Steven H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.00897", "submitter": "Mohammadreza Bahadorian", "authors": "Mohammadreza Bahadorian, Christoph Zechner, and Carl Modes", "title": "The gift of gab: probing the limits of dynamic concentration-sensing\n  across a network of communicating cells", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "Phys.

Our computer simulations show that\nthe model gives rise simultaneously to several biodiversity patterns in space\nand time, from species abundance distributions to the waxing and waning of\ngeographic ranges. We find that trophic position in the network plays a crucial\nrole when it comes to the time evolution of range sizes, because the trophic\ncontext restricts the occurrence and survival of species especially on higher\ntrophic levels.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 18 Oct 2019 11:50:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-21", "authors_parsed": [["Hamm", "Michaela", ""], ["Drossel", "Barbara", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.08566", "submitter": "Chiara Villa", "authors": "Chiara Villa, Mark A.

Long-term\nstudies may be extremely useful in assessing the responses of high-elevation\necosystems to climate change and other anthropogenic drivers. Mountain research\nsites within the LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) network are representative\nof various types of ecosystems and span a wide bioclimatic and elevational\nrange. Here, we present a synthesis and a review of the main results from\nlong-term ecological studies in mountain ecosystems at 20 LTER sites in Italy,\nSwitzerland and Austria. We analyzed a set of key climate parameters, such as\ntemperature and snow cover duration, in relation to vascular species\ncomposition, plant traits, abundance patterns, pedoclimate, nutrient dynamics\nin soils and water, phenology and composition of freshwater biota. The overall\nresults highlight the rapid response of mountain ecosystems to climate change.\nAs temperatures increased, vegetation cover in alpine and subalpine summits\nincreased as well. Years with limited snow cover duration caused an increase in\nsoil temperature and microbial biomass during the growing season. Effects on\nfreshwater ecosystems were observed, in terms of increases in solutes,\ndecreases in nitrates and changes in plankton phenology and benthos\ncommunities. This work highlights the importance of comparing and integrating\nlong-term ecological data collected in different ecosystems, for a more\ncomprehensive overview of the ecological effects of climate change.\nNevertheless, there is a need for i) adopting co-located monitoring site\nnetworks to improve our ability to obtain sound results from cross-site\nanalysis, ii) carrying out further studies, with fine spatial and temporal\nresolutions to improve understanding of responses to extreme events, and iii)\nincreasing comparability and standardizing protocols across networks to clarify\nlocal from global patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 29 Oct 2019 19:50:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-31", "authors_parsed": [["Rogora", "M.", ""], ["Frate", "L.", ""], ["Carranza", "M.

Herein, it is proposed that\nthe first real-coding setup was a direct one, made up of continuous\npoly-tRNA-like molecules, with each tRNA-like moiety carrying, beyond and near\nits 5 prime or 3 prime end, a trinucleotide site for specific amino acid\nbinding: the sequence and continuity of the tRNA moieties of a particular\npoly-tRNA would ensure the sequence and continuity of the amino acids of the\ncorresponding peptide or small protein. In parallel with these particular\nentities, and enhancing their peptide-forming function, a proto-ribosome and\nprimitive amino acid-activation system would develop. At some stage, one\ncritical innovation would be the appearance of RNA fragments that could tighten\nseveral adjacent tRNA moieties together on a particular poly-tRNA molecule, by\npairing with the second trinucleotide sequence (identical to the first one\ncarrying the specific amino acid-binding site) situated at, or close to, the\nmiddle of each tRNA moiety (i.e., the present anticodon site). These RNA\nfragments, acting as authentic co-ribozymes in the peptide-synthesizing\napparatus, would constitute the ancestors of the present mRNAs. Later, on these\nmRNA-like guiding fragments, free tRNA forms would be additionally used, first\nkeeping their amino acid-binding sites, then losing them in favor of a specific\namino acid attachment at a CCA arm at their 3 prime end. Finally, these latter\nmechanisms would progressively prevail, leading to the modern and universal\nindirect genetic coding system.

Under favorable environmental\nconditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms\nreferred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating\nwave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A\ntantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the\npresence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band\nis mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this\neffect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and\nexperimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper\nbands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the\nfront. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the\nposition of individuals and a partial differential equation model that\ndescribes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary\n(and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which\nlocusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced\n(diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the\nformation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the\nbiological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our\nmodels. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band's\ncollective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By\nexamining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically\nconsistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate\nthat resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed\nin locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an\nintrinsic part of future modeling efforts.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2019 15:53:03 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 24 Feb 2020 22:58:45 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Bernoff", "Andrew J.", ""], ["Culshaw-Maurer", "Michael", ""], ["Everett", "Rebecca A.", ""], ["Hohn", "Maryann E.", ""], ["Strickland", "W.
