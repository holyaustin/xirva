In the immigration model, new individuals\nof an entirely new species singly enter the population at constant rate \\mu\n(e.g., from the mainland into the island). In the mutation model, each\nindividual independently experiences point mutations in its germ line, at\nconstant rate \\theta. We are interested in the species abundance distribution,\ni.e., in the numbers, denoted I_n(k) in the immigration model and A_n(k) in the\nmutation model, of species represented by k individuals, k=1,2,...,n, when\nthere are n individuals in the total population. In the immigration model, we\nprove that the numbers (I_t(k);k\\ge 1) of species represented by k individuals\nat time t, are independent Poisson variables with parameters as in Fisher's\nlog-series.

As the\nrepertoire of enzymes of an organism (its toolbox) grows larger, it can reuse\nits enzyme tools more often and thus needs to get fewer new ones to master each\nnew task. From this observation, it logically follows that the number of\nfunctional tasks and their regulators increases faster than linearly with the\ntotal number of genes encoding enzymes. Genomes can also shrink, e.g., because\nof a loss of a nutrient from the environment, followed by deletion of its\nregulator and all enzymes that become redundant. We propose several simple\nmodels of network evolution elaborating on this toolbox argument and\nreproducing the empirically observed quadratic scaling.

These pathways\nare part of a larger \"universal\" network formed by the union of all\nspecies-specific networks. It remained to be understood, however, how the\ntopological properties of this universal network influence the scaling law of\nfunctional content of genomes. In this study we answer this question by first\nanalyzing the scaling properties of the toolbox model on arbitrary tree-like\nuniversal networks. We mathematically prove that the critical branching\ntopology, in which the average number of upstream neighbors of a node is equal\nto one, is both necessary and sufficient for the quadratic scaling. Conversely,\nthe toolbox model on trees with exponentially expanding, supercritical topology\nis characterized by the linear scaling with logarithmic corrections.

Unlike the original model the\nnew version employs evolutionary optimized pathways with the smallest number of\nreactions necessary to achieve their metabolic tasks.
