In the last years,\nseveral experimental fitness landscapes have been completely resolved. As\nfitness landscapes are high-dimensional, their characterization relies on\nsimple measures of their structure, which can be used as statistics in\nempirical applications. Here we propose two new sets of measures that\nexplicitly capture two relevant features of fitness landscapes: epistasis and\nconstraints. The first set contains new measures for epistasis based on the\ncorrelation of fitness effects of mutations. They have a natural\ninterpretation, capture well the interaction between mutations, can be obtained\nanalytically for most landscape models and can therefore be used to\ndiscriminate between different models. The second set contains measures of\nevolutionary constraints based on \"chains\" of forced mutations along\nfitness-increasing paths. Some of these measures are non-monotonic in the\namount of epistatic interactions, but have instead a maximum for intermediate\nvalues. We further characterize the relationships of these measures to the ones\nthat were previous proposed (e.g. number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of\nnon-additive components, etc). Finally, we show how these measures can help\nuncovering the amount and the nature of epistatic interactions in two\nexperimental landscapes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 21:26:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-02", "authors_parsed": [["Ferretti", "Luca", ""], ["Weinreich", "Daniel", ""], ["Schmiegelt", "Benjamin", ""], ["Yamauchi", "Atsushi", ""], ["Kobayashi", "Yutaka", ""], ["Tajima", "Fumio", ""], ["Achaz", "Guillaume", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.00044", "submitter": "Tommaso Biancalani", "authors": "Farshid Jafarpour and Tommaso Biancalani and Nigel Goldenfeld", "title": "A noise-induced mechanism for biological homochirality of early life\n  self-replicators", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": "Phys.

An increasing number of experiments investigates the properties of\nfitness landscapes by identifying mutations, constructing genotypes with\ncombinations of these mutations, and measuring the fitness of these genotypes.\nYet these empirical landscapes represent a very small sample of the vast space\nof all possible genotypes, and this sample is often biased by the protocol used\nto identify mutations. Here we develop a rigorous statistical framework based\non Approximate Bayesian Computation to address these concerns, and use this\nflexible framework to fit a broad class of phenotypic fitness models (including\nFisher's model) to 26 empirical landscapes representing 9 diverse biological\nsystems. In spite of uncertainty due to the small size of most published\nempirical landscapes, the inferred landscapes have similar structure in similar\nbiological systems. Surprisingly, goodness of fit tests reveal that this class\nof phenotypic models, which has been successful so far in interpreting\nexperimental data, is a plausible model in only 3 out of 9 biological systems.\nMore precisely, although Fisher's model was able to explain several statistical\nproperties of the landscapes - including mean and standard deviation of\nselection and epistasis coefficients -, it was often unable to explain the full\nstructure of fitness landscapes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 18:08:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 17:08:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 17 May 2016 14:44:56 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-05-18", "authors_parsed": [["Blanquart", "Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Bataillon", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.08367", "submitter": "Marisa Eisenberg", "authors": "Jeremy P D'Silva, Marisa C.
