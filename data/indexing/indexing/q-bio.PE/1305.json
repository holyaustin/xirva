How and\nwhy does mortality change generate this diversity? We derive a precise link\nbetween changes in age-specific mortality and lifespan inequality, measured as\nthe variance of age at death. Key to this relationship is a young-old threshold\nage, below and above which mortality decline respectively decreases and\nincreases lifespan inequality. First, we show that shifts in the threshold's\nlocation modified the correlation between changes in life expectancy and\nlifespan inequality over the last two centuries. Second, we analyze the post\nSecond World War trajectories of lifespan inequality in a set of developed\ncountries, Japan, Canada and the United States (US), where thresholds centered\non retirement age. Our method reveals how divergence in the age-pattern of\nmortality change drives international divergence in lifespan inequality. Most\nstrikingly, early in the 1980s, mortality increases in young US males led\nlifespan inequality to remain high in the US, while in Canada the decline of\ninequality continued. In general, our wider international comparisons show that\nmortality change varied most at young working ages after the Second World War,\nparticularly for males. We conclude that if mortality continues to stagnate at\nyoung ages, yet declines steadily at old ages, increases in lifespan inequality\nwill become a common feature of future demographic change.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 May 2013 07:46:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 21 Nov 2013 08:20:26 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Gillespie", "Duncan O.

However, for diseases that have a direct impact\non fitness, strongly deleterious rare mutations likely do play important roles,\nand the impact of very rare mutations will be far greater as a result of recent\ngrowth.

With the help of limit theorems for L\\'evy\nprocesses with marked jumps established in a previous work (arXiv:1305.6245),\nwe prove the convergence of the marked coalescent point process with large\npopulation size and two possible regimes for the mutations - one of them being\na classical rare mutation regime, towards a multivariate Poisson point process.\nThis Poisson point process can be described as the coalescent point process of\nthe limiting population at \\tau, with mutations arising as inhomogeneous\nregenerative sets along the lineages. Its intensity measure is further\ncharacterized thanks to the excursion theory for spectrally positive L\\'evy\nprocesses. In the rare mutations asymptotic, mutations arise as the image of a\nPoisson process by the ladder height process of a L\\'evy process with infinite\nvariation, and in the particular case of the critical branching process with\nexponential lifetimes, the limiting object is the Poisson point process of the\ndepths of excursions of the Brownian motion, with Poissonian mutations on the\nlineages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 May 2013 13:51:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-29", "authors_parsed": [["Delaporte", "C\u00e9cile", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6580", "submitter": "Michael Assaf", "authors": "Michael Assaf, Mauro Mobilia, and Elijah Roberts", "title": "Cooperation dilemma in finite populations under fluctuating environments", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures - final version", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Research into early warning signals has demonstrated\nthat it is possible to define and detect such early warning signals in advance\nof a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as\nresearch continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A\ncore of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid\nregime shifts, a pattern of 'critical slowing down' that can be used to detect\nthe approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden\nchange. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming\nclear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing\ndown, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down,\nstatistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores\nthese edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors\nthat can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing\ndown, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an\nappropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a\npositive indication for some systems is a negative indication in others, and\n(c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early\nwarning behaviors and noise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 May 2013 06:00:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Boettiger", "Carl", ""], ["Ross", "Noam", ""], ["Hastings", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6717", "submitter": "Hiroshi Toyoizumi", "authors": "Hiroshi Toyizumi, Jeremy Field", "title": "Dyanamics of Social Queues", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Queues formed by social wasps to inherit the dominant position in the nest\nare analyzed by using a transient quasi-birth-and-death process.

Compositional convergence is a\nlikely cause of controversy regarding phylogeny of the SAR11 group of\nAlphaproteobacteria that have extremely streamlined, A+T-biased genomes. While\ncareful modeling can reduce artifacts caused by convergence, the most\nconsistent and robust phylogenetic signal in genomes may lie distributed among\nencoded functional features that govern macromolecular interactions. Here we\ndevelop a novel phyloclassification method based on signatures derived from\nbioinformatically defined tRNA Class-Informative Features (CIFs). tRNA CIFs are\nenriched for features that underlie tRNA-protein interactions. Using a simple\ntRNA-CIF-based phyloclassifier, we obtained results consistent with those of\nbias-corrected whole proteome phylogenomic studies, rejecting monophyly of\nSAR11 and affiliating most strains with Rhizobiales with strong statistical\nsupport. Yet SAR11 and Rickettsiales tRNA genes share distinct patterns of\nA+T-richness, as expected from their elevated genomic A+T compositions. Using\nconventional supermatrix methods on total tRNA sequence data, we could recover\nthe artifactual result of a monophyletic SAR11 grouping with Rickettsiales.\nThus tRNA CIF-based phyloclassification is more robust to base content\nconvergence than supermatrix phylogenomics on whole tRNA sequences. Also, given\nthe notoriously promiscuous HGT of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, tRNA CIF-based\nphyloclassification may be relatively robust to HGT of network components.
