The standard model for estimating\ndetection from removal-sampled point-count surveys assumes that organisms at a\nsurvey site are detected at a constant rate; however, this assumption is often\nnot justified. We consider a class of N-mixture models that allows for\ndetection heterogeneity over time through a flexibly defined time-to-detection\ndistribution (TTDD) and allows for fixed and random effects for both abundance\nand detection. Our model is thus a combination of survival time-to-event\nanalysis with unknown-N, unknown-p abundance estimation. We specifically\nexplore two-parameter families of TTDDs, e.g. gamma, that can additionally\ninclude a mixture component to model increased probability of detection in the\ninitial observation period. We find that modeling a TTDD by using a\ntwo-parameter family is necessary when data have a chance of arising from a\ndistribution of this nature. In addition, models with a mixture component can\noutperform non-mixture models even when the truth is non-mixture. Finally, we\nanalyze an Overbird data set from the Chippewa National Forest using mixed\neffect models for both abundance and detection. We demonstrate that the effects\nof explanatory variables on abundance and detection are consistent across\nmixture TTDDs but that flexible TTDDs result in lower estimated probabilities\nof detection and therefore higher estimates of abundance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 08:04:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 19 May 2017 19:05:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Martin-Schwarze", "Adam", ""], ["Niemi", "Jarad", ""], ["Dixon", "Philip", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.00396", "submitter": "Pengxing Cao", "authors": "Pengxing Cao, Nectarios Klonis, Sophie Zaloumis, Con Dogovski, Stanley\n  C.

As we vary production parameters of the model, we encounter three\nparadoxical behaviors, where a change that should intuitively benefit some cell\ntype, actually harms it. (1) If a cell type is more efficient than its\ncounterpart at producing a metabolite and becomes even more efficient, its\nfrequency in the population can decrease. (2) If a cell type is less efficient\nthan its counterpart at producing a metabolite but becomes less inefficient,\nthe growth rate of the population can decrease. (3) Finally, if a cell type\ncontrols its counterpart's production decisions so as to maximize its own\ngrowth rate, the ultimate growth rate it achieves can be lower than if the two\ncell types each maximized their own growth. These three paradoxes highlight the\ncomplex and counter-intuitive dynamics that emerge in simple microbial\neconomies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 18:48:19 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-01-16", "authors_parsed": [["Kallus", "Yoav", ""], ["Miller", "John H.", ""], ["Libby", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.03541", "submitter": "Michael Lydeamore", "authors": "M.

However, selection for characteristics that enable future\ninnovation seems paradoxical: natural selection cannot favor structures for\nbenefits they have not yet produced, and favoring characteristics for benefits\nthat have already been produced does not constitute future innovation. Here we\nresolve this paradox by exploiting a formal equivalence between the evolution\nof evolvability and learning systems.

Using numerical simulations of evolution on\nhighly epistatic fitness landscapes, we illustrate how the structure of evolved\ngene regulation networks can result in increased evolvability capable of\navoiding local fitness peaks and discovering higher fitness phenotypes. Our\nfindings support Riedl's intuition: Developmental organizations that \"mimic\"\nthe organization of constraints on phenotypes can be favored by short-term\nselection and also facilitate future innovation.

On the\nother hand, the probability distribution of sequences with maximum entropy that\nsatisfies a given amino acid composition at each site and a given pairwise\namino acid frequency at each site pair is a Boltzmann distribution with\n$\\exp(-\\psi_N)$, where $\\psi_N$ is represented as the sum of one body and\npairwise potentials. A protein folding theory indicates that homologous\nsequences obey a canonical ensemble characterized by $\\exp(-\\Delta G_{ND}/k_B\nT_s)$ or by $\\exp(- G_{N}/k_B T_s)$ if an amino acid composition is kept\nconstant, where $\\Delta G_{ND} \\equiv G_N - G_D$, $G_N$ and $G_D$ are the\nnative and denatured free energies, and $T_s$ is selective temperature. Thus,\n$4N_e m (1 - 1/(2N))$, $-\\Delta \\psi_{ND}$, and $-\\Delta G_{ND}/k_B T_s$ must\nbe equivalent to each other. Based on the analysis of the changes ($\\Delta\n\\psi_N$) of $\\psi_N$ due to single nucleotide nonsynonymous substitutions,\n$T_s$, and then glass transition temperature $T_g$, and $\\Delta G_{ND}$ are\nestimated with reasonable values for 14 protein domains. In addition,\napproximating the probability density function (PDF) of $\\Delta \\psi_N$ by a\nlog-normal distribution, PDFs of $\\Delta \\psi_N$ and $K_a/K_s$, which is the\nratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate per site, in all and in\nfixed mutants are estimated. It is confirmed that $T_s$ negatively correlates\nwith the mean of $K_a/K_s$. Stabilizing mutations are significantly fixed by\npositive selection, and balance with destabilizing mutations fixed by random\ndrift. Supporting the nearly neutral theory, neutral selection is not\nsignificant.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 04:11:46 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 02:13:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 16 Sep 2017 05:46:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-19", "authors_parsed": [["Miyazawa", "Sanzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09474", "submitter": "Eduardo Garc\\'ia-Portugu\\'es", "authors": "Michael Golden, Eduardo Garc\\'ia-Portugu\\'es, Michael S{\\o}rensen,\n  Kanti V.

We\npresent a generative, evolutionary model of protein structure and sequence that\nis valid on a local length scale. The model concerns the local dependencies\nbetween sequence and structure evolution in a pair of homologous proteins. The\nevolutionary trajectory between the two structures in the protein pair is\ntreated as a random walk in dihedral angle space, which is modelled using a\nnovel angular diffusion process on the two-dimensional torus. Coupling sequence\nand structure evolution in our model allows for modelling both \"smooth\"\nconformational changes and \"catastrophic\" conformational jumps, conditioned on\nthe amino acid changes. The model has interpretable parameters and is\ncomparatively more realistic than previous stochastic models, providing new\ninsights into the relationship between sequence and structure evolution. For\nexample, using the trained model we were able to identify an apparent\nsequence-structure evolutionary motif present in a large number of homologous\nprotein pairs. The generative nature of our model enables us to evaluate its\nvalidity and its ability to simulate aspects of protein evolution conditioned\non an amino acid sequence, a related amino acid sequence, a related structure\nor any combination thereof.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 12:25:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 8 May 2017 20:08:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 29 Apr 2020 12:45:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Mon, 21 Sep 2020 09:42:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-22", "authors_parsed": [["Golden", "Michael", ""], ["Garc\u00eda-Portugu\u00e9s", "Eduardo", ""], ["S\u00f8rensen", "Michael", ""], ["Mardia", "Kanti V.", ""], ["Hamelryck", "Thomas", ""], ["Hein", "Jotun", ""]]}, {"id": "1612.09595", "submitter": "Peter Waddell", "authors": "Peter J.
