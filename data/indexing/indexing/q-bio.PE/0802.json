The\nquasispecies dynamics on rugged fitness landscape follow a punctuated (or\nstep-like) pattern in which a population jumps from a low fitness peak to a\nhigher one, stays there for a considerable time before shifting the peak again\nand eventually reaches the global maximum of the fitness landscape. We\ncalculate exactly several properties of this dynamical process within a\nsimplified version of the quasispecies model.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2008 03:57:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Jain", "Kavita", ""]]}, {"id": "0802.3973", "submitter": "Emilio Hernandez-Garcia", "authors": "M.

Our focus is on a mechanism for the emergence of localized plankton\nblooms in vortices. Using a coupled system of a kinematic flow mimicking the\nmesoscale structures behind the island and a simple three component model for\nthe marine ecosystem, we show that the long residence times of nutrients and\nplankton in the vicinity of the island and the confinement of plankton within\nvortices are key factors for the appearance of localized plankton blooms\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Feb 2008 08:53:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sandulescu", "M.", ""], ["Lopez", "C.", ""], ["Hernandez-Garcia", "E.", ""], ["Feudel", "U.", ""]]}]
