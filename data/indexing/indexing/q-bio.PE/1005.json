The Wright-Fisher model\nand its extensions have given biologists powerful tools of statistical\ninference that enabled the quantification of genetic drift and selection. Given\nthe utility of these tools, we often forget that their model - for\nmathematical, and not biological reasons - makes assumptions that are violated\nin most real-world populations. In this paper, I consider an alternative\nframework that merges P. A. P. Moran's continuous-time Markov chain model of\nallele frequency with the density dependent models of ecological competition\nproposed by Gause, Lotka and Volterra, that, unlike Moran's model allow for a\nstochastically varying -- but bounded -- population size. I require that allele\nnumbers vary according to a density-dependent population process, for which the\nlimiting law of large numbers is a dissipative, irreducible, competitive\ndynamical system. Under the assumption that this limiting system admits a\ncodimension one submanifold of attractive fixed points -- a condition that\nnaturally generalises the weak selection regime of classical population\ndynamics -- it is shown that for an appropriate rescaling of time, the finite\ndimensional distributions of the original process converge to those of a\ndiffusion process on the submanifold. Weak convergence results are also\nobtained for a related process.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 20:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 22:50:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Parsons", "Todd L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0332", "submitter": "Michael Shapiro", "authors": "Edgar Delgado-Eckert and Michael Shapiro", "title": "A model of host response to a multi-stage pathogen", "comments": "22 pages, no figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We model the immune surveillance of a pathogen which passes through $n$\nimmunologically distinct stages.

However, a population can also adapt to a new situation by\nmultiple mutations of similar phenotypic effect that arise in parallel. These\nmutations can each quickly reach intermediate frequency, preventing any single\none from rapidly sweeping to fixation globally (a \"soft\" sweep). Here we study\nmodels of parallel mutation in a geographically spread population adapting to a\nglobal selection pressure. The slow geographic spread of a selected allele can\nallow other selected alleles to arise and spread elsewhere in the species\nrange. When these different selected alleles meet, their spread can slow\ndramatically, and so form a geographic patchwork which could be mistaken for a\nsignal of local adaptation. This random spatial tessellation will dissipate\nover time due to mixing by migration, leaving a set of partial sweeps within\nthe global population. We show that the spatial tessellation initially formed\nby mutational types is closely connected to Poisson process models of\ncrystallization, which we extend. We find that the probability of parallel\nmutation and the spatial scale on which parallel mutation occurs is captured by\na single characteristic length that reflects the expected distance a spreading\nallele travels before it encounters a different spreading allele. This\ncharacteristic length depends on the mutation rate, the dispersal parameter,\nthe effective local density of individuals, and to a much lesser extent the\nstrength of selection. We argue that even in widely dispersing species, such\nparallel geographic sweeps may be surprisingly common. Thus, we predict, as\nmore data becomes available, many more examples of intra-species parallel\nadaptation will be uncovered.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 May 2010 15:23:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 7 Jun 2010 22:02:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 21 Jul 2010 01:01:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-26", "authors_parsed": [["Ralph", "Peter", ""], ["Coop", "Graham", ""]]}, {"id": "1005.0865", "submitter": "Tobias Reichenbach", "authors": "Benjamin Andrae, Jonas Cremer, Tobias Reichenbach, Erwin Frey", "title": "Entropy production of cyclic population dynamics", "comments": "4 pages, 3 figures and Supplementary Material.

Here, this is\naddressed by adopting an ecological perspective and resorting to the niche\ntheory of competing communities, which assumes that the utilization of\nresources primarily determines ecological segregation between competing\nindividuals (the different viral variants that constitute the QS). Using this\nnovel combination of RME plus the ecological concept of niche overlapping, for\ndescribing QS, we explore the population distributions of viral variants that\nemerge, as well as the corresponding dynamics.

In general, it is not possible to find the fixation\nprobability analytically given the mutant's fitness and the topological\nconstraints that govern the spread of the mutation, so one resorts to\nsimulations instead. Depending on the topology in use, a great number of\nevolutionary steps may be needed in each of the simulation events, particularly\nin those that end with the population containing mutants only. We introduce two\ntechniques to accelerate the determination of the fixation probability. The\nfirst one skips all evolutionary steps in which the number of mutants does not\nchange and thereby reduces the number of steps per simulation event\nconsiderably. This technique is computationally advantageous for some of the\nso-called layered networks. The second technique, which is not restricted to\nlayered networks, consists of aborting any simulation event in which the number\nof mutants has grown beyond a certain threshold value, and counting that event\nas having led to a total spread of the mutation. For large populations, and\nregardless of the network's topology, we demonstrate, both analytically and by\nmeans of simulations, that using a threshold of about 100 mutants leads to an\nestimate of the fixation probability that deviates in no significant way from\nthat obtained from the full-fledged simulations.

We observed three different types of dynamics. In addition to\ncoarsening, in the evolutionary relevant limit of large times, oscillating\ntraveling waves and heteroclinic orbits play a dominant role. The weight of the\ndifferent processes depends on the degree of mixing and the system size. By\nanalytical arguments and extensive numerical simulations we provide the full\ncharacteristics of scenarios leading to extinction in one of the most\nsurprising models of ecology.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 May 2010 16:35:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 18 Oct 2010 09:32:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 26 Dec 2010 10:14:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Rulands", "S.", ""], ["Reichenbach", "T.", ""], ["Frey", "E.", ""]]}]
