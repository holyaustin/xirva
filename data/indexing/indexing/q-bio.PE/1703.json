Living systems have gradually developed strategies\nfor adaptation from random and passive diversification of the phenotype to more\nproactive decision making, in which environmental information is sensed and\nexploited more actively and effectively. Understanding the fundamental relation\nbetween fitness and information is therefore crucial to clarify the limits and\nuniversal properties of adaptation. In this work, we elucidate the underlying\nstochastic and information-thermodynamic structure in this process, by deriving\ncausal fluctuation relations (FRs) of fitness and information. Combined with a\nduality between phenotypic and environmental dynamics, the FRs reveal the limit\nof fitness gain, the relation of time reversibility with the achievability of\nthe limit, and the possibility and condition for gaining excess fitness due to\nenvironmental fluctuation. The loss of fitness due to causal constraints and\nthe limited capacity of real organisms is shown to be the difference between\ntime-forward and time-backward path probabilities of phenotypic and\nenvironmental dynamics. Furthermore, the FRs generalize the concept of\nevolutionary stable state (ESS) for fluctuating environment by giving the\nprobability that the optimal strategy on average can be invaded by a suboptimal\none owing to rare environmental fluctuation. These results clarify the\ninformation thermodynamic structures in adaptation and evolution.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 03:55:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 27 May 2017 23:28:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kobayashi", "Tetsuya J.", ""], ["Sughiyama", "Yuki", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.00219", "submitter": "Andrea De Martino", "authors": "Daniele De Martino, Fabrizio Capuani, Andrea De Martino", "title": "Quantifying the entropic cost of cellular growth control", "comments": "3 pages", "journal-ref": "Phys.

Major criticisms of neutral theory have\nfocused on interspecific differences, which are in conflict with ecological\nequivalence. However, neutrality in nature is also broken by differences\nbetween conspecific individuals at different life stages, which in many\ncommunities may vastly exceed interspecific differences between individuals at\nsimilar stages. These within-species asymmetries have not been fully explored\nin species-neutral models, and it is not known whether demographic stage\nstructure affects macroecological patterns in neutral theory.

We explore several qualitatively\ndifferent scenarios, and compare numerically obtained species abundance\ndistributions to the predictions of unstructured neutral theory. We find that\nabundance distributions are generally robust to this kind of stage structure,\nbut significant departures from unstructured predictions occur if adults have\nsufficiently low fecundity and mortality. In addition, we show that the\ncumulative number of births per species, which is distributed as a power law\nwith a 3/2 exponent, is invariant even when the abundance distribution departs\nfrom unstructured model predictions.

For\nregional control instead it might be sufficient to implement such programmes\nonly in a given subregion conveniently chosen so to lead to an effective\n(exponentially fast) eradication of the epidemic in the whole habitat; it is\nevident that this practice may have an enormous importance in real cases with\nrespect to both financial and practical affordability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 09:34:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-09", "authors_parsed": [["Anita", "Sebastian", ""], ["Capasso", "Vincenzo", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.02828", "submitter": "Masahiko Ueda", "authors": "Masahiko Ueda, Nobuto Takeuchi, Kunihiko Kaneko", "title": "Stronger selection can slow down evolution driven by recombination on a\n  smooth fitness landscape", "comments": "12 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 12(8): e0183120 (2017)", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0183120", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE cond-mat.stat-mech physics.bio-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Stronger selection implies faster evolution---that is, the greater the force,\nthe faster the change.

Here\nwe consider whether the insecticide pyriproxyfen used in Brazilian drinking\nwater might be the primary cause or a cofactor.

Methoprene, another juvenile hormone\nanalog approved as an insecticide in the 1970s has been shown to cause\ndevelopmental disorders in mammals. Isotretinoin is another retinoid causing\nmicrocephaly via activation of the retinoid X receptor in developing fetuses.\nWe review tests of pyriproxyfen by the manufacturer Sumitomo, which actually\nfound some evidence for this effect, including low brain mass and\narhinencephaly in exposed rat pups.

To achieve this, we developed a new additive model that\nmixes multiple size control strategies based on planarian size, growth, and\ntime between divisions. Our model quantifies the proportions of each strategy\nin the mixed dynamics, revealing the ability of the two planarian species to\nutilize different strategies in a coordinated manner for size control.\nAdditionally, we found that head and tail offspring of both species employ\ndifferent mechanisms to monitor and trigger their reproduction cycles. Thus, we\nfind a diversity of strategies not only between species but also between heads\nand tails within species.

However,\ncurrent approaches neglect the structure of inter-species competition by\nadopting a mean-field perspective that does not deal with competitive\ninteractions properly. Here, we introduce a framework based on the concept of\nmultilayer networks, which naturally accounts for both mutualism and\ncompetition. Hence, we abandon the mean field hypothesis and show, through a\ndynamical population model and numerical simulations, that there is an\nintricate relation between competition and mutualism. Specifically, we show\nthat when all interactions are taken into account, mutualism does not have the\nsame consequences on the evolution of specialist and generalist species. This\nleads to a non-trivial profile of biodiversity in the parameter space of\ncompetition and mutualism. Our findings emphasize how the simultaneous\nconsideration of positive and negative interactions can contribute to our\nunderstanding of the delicate trade-offs between topology and biodiversity in\necosystems and call for a reconsideration of previous findings in theoretical\necology, as they may affect the structural and dynamical stability of\nmutualistic systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 17:31:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-20", "authors_parsed": [["Gracia-L\u00e1zaro", "Carlos", ""], ["Hern\u00e1ndez", "Laura", ""], ["Borge-Holthoefer", "Javier", ""], ["Moreno", "Yamir", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.06446", "submitter": "Delfim F.

Therefore, advancing both\nthe science and practice of disease forecasting now requires testing for the\npresence of fundamental limits to outbreak prediction.

A significant problem in this area\nis the lack of standard well-defined evaluation measures to select the best\nalgorithm among different ones, as well as for selecting the best possible\nconfiguration for a particular algorithm.\n  Results: In this paper, we present an evaluation framework which allows for\ncombining different features, error measures, and ranking schema to evaluate\nforecasts. We describe the various epidemic features (Epi-features) included to\ncharacterize the output of forecasting methods and provide suitable error\nmeasures that could be used to evaluate the accuracy of the methods with\nrespect to these Epi-features. We focus on long-term predictions rather than\nshort-term forecasting and demonstrate the utility of the framework by\nevaluating six forecasting methods for predicting influenza in the United\nStates. Our results demonstrate that different error measures lead to different\nrankings even for a single Epi-feature. Further, our experimental analyses show\nthat no single method dominates the rest in predicting all Epi-features, when\nevaluated across error measures. As an alternative, we provide various\nconsensus ranking schema that summarizes individual rankings, thus accounting\nfor different error measures. We believe that a comprehensive evaluation\nframework, as presented in this paper, will add value to the computational\nepidemiology community.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 22:17:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Tabataba", "Farzaneh Sadat", ""], ["Chakraborty", "Prithwish", ""], ["Ramakrishnan", "Naren", ""], ["Venkatramanan", "Srinivasan", ""], ["Chen", "Jiangzhuo", ""], ["Lewis", "Bryan", ""], ["Marathe", "Madhav", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10726", "submitter": "Max Allen", "authors": "Maximilian L.

We developed a systematic method\nto deploy camera traps across a grid while targeting fine-scale features to\nmaximize carnivore detection (Appendix 1), including systematic methods for\norganizing and tagging the photo data (Appendix 2). We deployed 88 cameras on\n13 islands from 2014-2016. We collected 92,694 photographs across 18,721 trap\nnights, including 3,591 wildlife events and 1,070 carnivore events. We had a\nmean of 6.6 cameras per island (range 2-30), and our camera density averaged\n1.23 (range 0.74-3.08) cameras/ km2. We detected 27 species and 10 terrestrial\ncarnivores, including surprising detections of American martens (Martes\namericana) and gray wolves (Canis lupus). The mean richness of carnivores on an\nisland was 3.23 (range 0-10). The best single variable to explain carnivore\nrichness on the Apostle Islands was island size, while the best model was\nisland size (positive correlation) and distance from mainland (negative\ncorrelation) (R2 = 0.92). Relative abundances for carnivores ranged from a low\nof 0.01 for weasels (Mustela spp.) to a high of 2.64 for black bears (Ursus\namericanus), and the relative abundance of a species was significantly\ncorrelated with the number of islands on which they were found. Carnivore\noccupancy ranged from lows of 0.09 for gray wolves and 0.11 for weasels to a\nhigh of 0.82 for black bears. Fuller understanding of APIS ecology will require\non-going monitoring of carnivores to evaluate temporal dynamics as well as\nrelated ecological evaluations (e.g. small mammal dynamics, plant community\ndynamics) to understand trophic effects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 01:35:52 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Dec 2017 15:24:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 31 Jan 2018 22:40:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-02-02", "authors_parsed": [["Allen", "Maximilian L.", ""], ["Evans", "Bryn E.", ""], ["Wheeler", "Michael E.", ""], ["Mueller", "Marcus A.", ""], ["Pemble", "Kenneth", ""], ["Olson", "Erik R.", ""], ["Van Stappen", "Julie", ""], ["Van Deelen", "Timothy R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1703.10840", "submitter": "Georgios Stamoulis", "authors": "Steven Kelk, Georgios Stamoulis, Taoyang Wu", "title": "Treewidth distance on phylogenetic trees", "comments": "29 pages, 12 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DM cs.DS q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this article we study the treewidth of the \\emph{display graph}, an\nauxiliary graph structure obtained from the fusion of phylogenetic (i.e.,\nevolutionary) trees at their leaves. Earlier work has shown that the treewidth\nof the display graph is bounded if the trees are in some formal sense\ntopologically similar. Here we further expand upon this relationship. We\nanalyse a number of reduction rules which are commonly used in the\nphylogenetics literature to obtain fixed parameter tractable algorithms. In\nsome cases (the \\emph{subtree} reduction) the reduction rules behave similarly\nwith respect to treewidth, while others (the \\emph{cluster} reduction) behave\nvery differently, and the behaviour of the \\emph{chain reduction} is\nparticularly intriguing because of its link with graph separators and forbidden\nminors. We also show that the gap between treewidth and Tree Bisection and\nReconnect (TBR) distance can be infinitely large, and that unlike, for example,\nplanar graphs the treewidth of the display graph can be as much as linear in\nits number of vertices. On a slightly different note we show that if a display\ngraph is formed from the fusion of a phylogenetic network and a tree, rather\nthan from two trees, the treewidth of the display graph is bounded whenever the\ntree can be topologically embedded (\"displayed\") within the network. This opens\nthe door to the formulation of the display problem in Monadic Second Order\nLogic (MSOL). A number of other auxiliary results are given. We conclude with a\ndiscussion and list a number of open problems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 10:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-03", "authors_parsed": [["Kelk", "Steven", ""], ["Stamoulis", "Georgios", ""], ["Wu", "Taoyang", ""]]}]
