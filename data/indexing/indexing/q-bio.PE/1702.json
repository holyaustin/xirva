In this\ncontext, the concept of preadaptation refers to a common type of bet-hedging\nprotection strategy in which a relatively small number of individuals in a\npopulation stochastically switch their phenotypes to a `dormant' metabolic\nstate in which they increase their probability of survival against potential\nenvironmental shocks. Hence, if an environmental shock took place at some point\nin time, preadapted organisms would be better adapted to survive and\nproliferate once the shock is over. In many biological populations, the\nmechanisms of preadaptation and proliferation present delays whose influence in\nthe fitness of the population are not well-understood. In this paper, we\npropose a rigorous mathematical framework to analyze the role of delays in both\npreadaptation and proliferation mechanisms in the survival of biological\npopulations, with an emphasis on bacterial colonies. Our theoretical framework\nallows us to analytically quantify the average growth rate of a bet-hedging\nbacterial colony with stochastically delayed reactions with arbitrary\nprecision. We verify the accuracy of the proposed method by numerical\nsimulations and conclude that the growth rate of a bet-hedging population shows\na non-trivial dependency on their preadaptation and proliferation delays.\nContrary to the current belief, our results show that faster reactions do not,\nin general, increase the overall fitness of a biological population.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 00:41:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:57:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Ogura", "Masaki", ""], ["Wakaiki", "Masashi", ""], ["Rubin", "Harvey", ""], ["Preciado", "Victor M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.00351", "submitter": "Jose A.

Although the theoretical basis of\nalternative models such as Fokker-Planck diffusion is not less convincing,\nmovement of populations is commonly modelled using the diffusion law due to\nFick. It is an interesting feature of Fokker-Planck diffusion that for\nspatially varying diffusion coefficients the stationary solution is not a\nhomogeneous distribution; in contrast to Fickian diffusion. Instead,\nconcentration accumulates in regions of low diffusivity and tends to lower\nlevels for areas of high diffusivity. Thus, we may interpret the stationary\ndistribution of the Fokker-Planck diffusion as a reflection of different levels\nof habitat quality. Moreover, the most common model for environmental\nfluctuations, linear multiplicative noise, is based on the assumption that\nindividuals respond independently to stochastic environmental fluctuations. For\nlarge population densities the assumption of independence is debatable and the\nmodel further implies that noise intensities can increase to arbitrarily high\nlevels. Therefore, instead of the commonly used linear multiplicative noise\nmodel, we implement environmental variability by an alternative nonlinear noise\nterm which never exceeds a certain maximum noise intensity. With Fokker-Planck\ndiffusion and the nonlinear noise model replacing the classical approaches we\ninvestigate a simple invasive system based on the Lotka-Volterra competition\nmodel. We observe that the heterogeneous stationary distribution generated by\nFokker-Planck diffusion generally facilitates the formation of segregated\nhabitats of resident and invader. However, this segregation can be broken by\nnonlinear noise leading to coexistence of resident and invader across the whole\nspatial domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 15 Feb 2017 09:30:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-02-16", "authors_parsed": [["Siekmann", "Ivo", ""], ["Bengfort", "Michael", ""], ["Malchow", "Horst", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.04873", "submitter": "Jason Olejarz", "authors": "Jason Olejarz, Carl Veller, Martin A.

[....] For an\nunderstanding of the expansion process, it appears appropriate to apply a\ndiffusive model. Broadly, these numerical modeling approaches can be catego-\nrized in correlative, continuous and discrete. Common to all approaches is the\ncomparison to collections of radiocarbon data that show the apparent wave of\nadvance of the transition to farming. However, these data sets differ in entry\ndensity and data quality. Often they disregard local and regional specifics and\nresearch gaps, or dating uncertainties. Thus, most of these data bases may only\nbe used on a very general, broad scale. One of the pitfalls of using\nirregularly spaced or irregularly documented radiocarbon data becomes evident\nfrom the map generated by Fort (this volume, Chapter 16): while the general\neast-west and south-north trends become evident, some areas appear as having\nundergone anomalously early transitions to farming. This may be due to faulty\nentries into the data base or regional problems with radiocarbon dating, if not\nunnoticed or undocumented laboratory mistakes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 19:28:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-10", "authors_parsed": [["Lemmen", "Carsten", ""], ["Gronenborn", "Detlef", ""]]}, {"id": "1702.07814", "submitter": "Vu Dinh", "authors": "Vu Dinh, Arman Bilge, Cheng Zhang, and Frederick A.

Despite this striking assumption, many\nrecent studies have sought to assess whether neutrality can provide a good\ndescription of different episodes of cultural change. One approach has been to\ntest whether neutral predictions are consistent with observed progeny\ndistributions, recording the number of variants that have produced a given\nnumber of new instances within a specified time interval: a classic example is\nthe distribution of baby names. Using an overlapping generations model we show\nthat these distributions consist of two phases: a power law phase with a\nconstant exponent of -3/2, followed by an exponential cut-off for variants with\nvery large numbers of progeny. Maximum likelihood estimations of the model\nparameters provide a direct way to establish whether observed empirical\npatterns are consistent with neutral evolution. We apply our approach to a\ncomplete data set of baby names from Australia. Crucially we show that analyses\nbased on only the most popular variants, as is often the case in studies of\ncultural evolution, can provide misleading evidence for underlying transmission\nhypotheses. While neutrality provides a plausible description of progeny\ndistributions of abundant variants, rare variants deviate from neutrality.\nFurther, we develop a simulation framework that allows for the detection of\nalternative cultural transmission processes.
