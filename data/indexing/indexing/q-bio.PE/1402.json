With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible\nto follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time.

LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to\ninfer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested\nLIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology\nof the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to\ncharacterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals\nand found that the interaction networks varied significantly between\nindividuals.

Many GP maps share the following general properties: 1) The\nnumber of genotypes $N_G$ is much larger than the number of selectable\nphenotypes; 2) Neutral exploration changes the variation that is accessible to\nthe population; 3) The distribution of phenotype frequencies $F_p=N_p/N_G$,\nwith $N_p$ the number of genotypes mapping onto phenotype $p$, is highly\nbiased: the majority of genotypes map to only a small minority of the\nphenotypes.

For both maps the probability of a mutation leading to a phenotype $p$\nscales to first order as $F_p$, although for the RNA map there are further\ncorrelations as well. By using mean-field theory, supported by computer\nsimulations, we show that the discovery time $T_p$ of a phenotype $p$ similarly\nscales to first order as $1/F_p$ for a wide range of population sizes and\nmutation rates in both the monomorphic and polymorphic regimes. These\ndifferences in the rate at which variation arises can vary over many orders of\nmagnitude. Phenotypic variation with a larger $F_p$ is therefore be much more\nlikely to arise than variation with a small $F_p$.

In this work we provide a mathematical understanding of how CA\nexacerbates the role of luck in detriment of skill in simple and well-studied\ncompetition models. We show, for instance, that if two agents are competing for\nresources that arrive sequentially at each time unit, an early stroke of luck\ncan place the less skilled in the lead for an extremely long period of time, a\nphenomenon we call \"struggle of the fittest\". In the absence of CA, the more\nskilled quickly prevails despite any early stroke of luck that the less skilled\nmay have. We prove that duration of a simple skill and luck competition model\nexhibit power law tails when CA is present, regardless of skill difference,\nwhich is in sharp contrast to exponential tails when CA is absent. Our findings\nhave important implications to competitions not only in complex social systems\nbut also in contexts that leverage such models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 00:31:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 01:07:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-12-09", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Bo", ""], ["Sun", "Liyuan", ""], ["Figueiredo", "Daniel R.", ""], ["Ribeiro", "Bruno", ""], ["Towsley", "Don", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.4740", "submitter": "Genki Ichinose", "authors": "Genki Ichinose and Hiroki Sayama", "title": "Evolution of Fairness in the Not Quite Ultimatum Game", "comments": "14 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": "Scientific Reports 4, 5104, 2014", "doi": "10.1038/srep05104", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cs.GT q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The Ultimatum Game (UG) is an economic game where two players (proposer and\nresponder) decide how to split a certain amount of money.

The new\nmethodologi- cal approach was applied to a real data set together with a Monte\nCarlo experiment which showed the power performance of our new method. Finally,\nwe compared the new method based on beta distribution with the conventional\nmethod (based on Chi-Squared distribu- tion) using the agreement Kappa index\nand a principal component analysis (PCA). Both the analyses show found\ndifferences existed between both the approaches while selecting the single\nnucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in association.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Feb 2014 12:33:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Garc\u00eda-Cremades", "Jos\u00e9 Santiago", ""], ["del R\u00edo", "Angel", ""], ["Garc\u00eda", "Jos\u00e9 A.", ""], ["Gay\u00e1n", "Javier", ""], ["Gonz\u00e1lez-P\u00e9rez", "Antonio", ""], ["Ruiz", "Agust\u00edn", ""], ["Sotolongo-Grau", "O.", ""], ["Ruiz-Mar\u00edn", "Manuel", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6266", "submitter": "Jozsef Farkas", "authors": "\\`Angel Calsina and J\\'ozsef Z.

The trait distribution within the prey population is the result\nof interplay between genetic inheritance and mutation, as well as selectivity\nin the consumption of prey by the predator. The evolutionary processes are\nconsidered to take place on the same time scale as ecological dynamics, i.e. we\nconsider the evolution to be rapid. Previously published results show that\npopulation structuring and rapid evolution in such predator-prey system can\nstabilise an otherwise globally unstable dynamics even with an unlimited\ncarrying capacity of prey. However, those findings were only based on direct\nnumerical simulation of equations and obtained for particular parametrisations\nof model functions, which obviously calls into question the correctness and\ngenerality of the previous results. The main objective of the current study is\nto treat the model analytically and consider various parametrisations of\npredator selectivity and inheritance kernel.

We derive expressions for the Hopf bifurcation curve which can be\nused for constructing bifurcation diagrams in the parameter space without the\nneed for a direct numerical simulation of the underlying integro-differential\nequations.
