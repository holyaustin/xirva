We utilize a spatial\nstochastic process model of mutation accumulation and clonal expansion in a\nstructured tissue to describe this process. Under a two-step tumorigenesis\nmodel, we first derive estimates of a non-spatial measure of diversity:\nSimpson's Index, which is the probability that two individuals sampled at\nrandom from the population are identical, in the premalignant population. We\nnext analyze two new measures of spatial population heterogeneity. In\nparticular we study the typical length scale of genetic heterogeneity during\nthe carcinogenesis process and estimate the extent of a surrounding\npremalignant clone given a clinical observation of a premalignant point biopsy.\nThis evolutionary framework contributes to a growing literature focused on\ndeveloping a better understanding of the spatial population dynamics of cancer\ninitiation and progression. Although initially motivated by understanding\nquestions in cancer, these results can be applied more generally to help\nunderstand the dynamics of heterogeneity and diversity in a variety of\nspatially structured, evolving populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 02:49:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-11-03", "authors_parsed": [["Storey", "K.", ""], ["Ryser", "M.

Here we present a basic ecological disease model which examines the\nrole feedback loops may play in the spread of BSE and related diseases. Our\nmodel shows that there are critical thresholds between the infection's\nexpansion and decrease related to the lifespan of the hosts, the growth rate of\nthe prions, and the amount of prions circulating between hosts. The ecological\ndisease dynamics can be intrinsically oscillatory, having outbreaks as well as\nrefractory periods which can make it appear that the disease is under control\nwhile it is still increasing. We show that non-susceptible species that have\nbeen intentionally inserted into a feedback loop to stop the spread of disease\ndo not, strictly by themselves, guarantee its control, though they may give\nthat appearance by increasing the refractory period of an epidemic's\noscillations.
