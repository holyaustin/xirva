In both cases the active state is characterized by\nlocalized bursts of dislocations, followed by longer periods of coarsening. In\nthe case of the parallel dynamics, we find that there is another phase\ntransition between the active steady state and the coarsening state within the\nthree-line system when the invasion rate between the subsystems is varied.

However, these\nmodels fail to account for random fluctuations due to demographic and\nenvironmental stochasticity which are experienced by all populations.

Demographic stochasticity\nstems from populations and communities consisting of a finite number of\ninteracting individuals, and often are represented by Markovian models with a\ncountable number of states. For closed populations in a bounded world,\nextinction occurs in finite time but may be preceded by long-term transients.\nQuasi-stationary distributions (QSDs) of these Makov models characterize this\nmeta-stable behavior. For sufficiently large \"habitat sizes\", QSDs are shown to\nconcentrate on the positive attractors of deterministic models. Moreover, the\nprobability extinction decreases exponentially with habitat size.\nAlternatively, environmental stochasticity stems from fluctuations in\nenvironmental conditions which influence survival, growth, and reproduction.\nStochastic difference equations can be used to model the effects of\nenvironmental stochasticity on population and community dynamics. For these\nmodels, stochastic persistence corresponds to empirical measures placing\narbitrarily little weight on arbitrarily low population densities. Sufficient\nand necessary conditions for stochastic persistence are reviewed. These\nconditions involve weighted combinations of Lyapunov exponents corresponding to\n\"average\" per-capita growth rates of rare species.

As a result, tissues are made up of different \"patches\", i.e.,\nadjacent tissue regions of different ages and different material properties,\nwithin evolving boundaries. In this paper, generalised equations governing the\nspatio-temporal evolution of such tissues are developed within the continuum\nmodel.

In\na previous work, we introduced a network model of how a set of interrelated\ngenotypes (called a quasispecies, in the stationary state) and a set of\ninterrelated idiotypes (an idiotypic network) interact. That model, which does\nnot cover the case of a retroviral quasispecies, was instrumental for the study\nof quasispecies survival when confronting the immune system and led to the\nconclusion that, unlike what happens when a quasispecies is left to evolve by\nitself, letting genotypes mutate too infrequently leads to the destruction of\nthe quasispecies. Here we extend that genotype-idiotype interaction model by\nthe addition of a further parameter ($\\nu$) to account for the action of\nretroviruses (i.e., the destruction of idiotypes by genotypes). We give\nsimulation results within a suitable parameter niche, highlighting the issues\nof quasispecies survival and of the onset of autoimmunity through the\nappearance of the so-called pathogenic idiotypes. Our main findings refer to\nhow $\\nu$ and $\\lambda$, a parameter describing the rate at which idiotypes get\nstimulated, relate to each other. While for $\\nu>\\lambda$ the quasispecies\nsurvives at the expense of weakening the immune system significantly or even\ndestroying it, for $\\nu<\\lambda$ the fittest genotypes of the quasispecies\nbecome mimicked inside the immune system as pathogenic idiotypes. The latter is\nin agreement with the current understanding of the HIV quasispecies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 15:12:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Barbosa", "Valmir C.", ""], ["Donangelo", "Raul", ""], ["Souza", "Sergio R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09115", "submitter": "Peter Waddell", "authors": "Peter J.

These\ninclude evidence that the African Iwo Eleru skull, only about 12,000 years old,\nindeed represents a new species of near human. In contrast, the earliest known\nanatomically modern human skull, Qafzeh 9, the skull of Eve from\nIsrael/Palestine, is validated as fully modern in form. Analyses clearly show\nevidence of archaic introgression into Gravettian, pre_Gravettian, Qafzeh, and\nUpper Cave (China) populations of near modern humans, and in about that order\nof increasing archaic content. The enigmatic Saldahna (Elandsfontein) skull\nemerges as a probable first representative of that lineage, which exclusive of\nNeanderthals that, eventually lead to modern humans. There is also evidence\nthat the poorly dated Kabwe (Broken Hill) skull represents a much earlier\ndistinct lineage.

However, little is known regarding the spread of epidemics\nacross networks representing populations of multiple hosts. We explored\ncross-species transmission in a multilayer network where layers represent\npopulations of two distinct hosts, and disease can spread across intralayer\n(within-host) and interlayer (between-host) edges. We developed an analytic\nframework for the SIR epidemic model to examine the effect of (i) source of\ninfection and (ii) between-host asymmetry in infection probabilities, on\ndisease risk. We measured risk as outbreak probability and outbreak size in a\nfocal host, represented by one network layer. Numeric simulations were used to\nvalidate the analytic formulations. We found that outbreak probability is\ndetermined by a complex interaction between source of infection and\nbetween-host infection probabilities, whereas outbreak size is mainly affected\nby the non-focal host to focal host infection probability alone. Hence,\ninter-specific asymmetry in infection probabilities shapes disease dynamics in\nmultihost networks. These results expand current theory of monolayer networks,\nwhere outbreak size and probability are considered equal, highlighting the\nimportance of considering multiple measures of disease risk. Our study advances\nunderstanding of multihost systems and non-biological systems with asymmetric\nflow rates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Dec 2015 23:00:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 21:50:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pilosof", "Shai", ""], ["Greenbaum", "Gili", ""], ["Krasnov", "Boris R.", ""], ["Zelnik", "Yuval R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1512.09370", "submitter": "Emma Perracchione", "authors": "Giorgio Sabetta, Emma Perracchione, Ezio Venturino", "title": "Wild herbivores in forests: four case studies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  A three population system with a top predator population, i.e. the\nherbivores, and two prey populations, grass and trees, is considered to model\nthe interaction of herbivores with natural resources.
