The\nkey to understand this absorbing phenomenon is to characterize the decaying\ntime of the fittest class of the population. Adaptive landscape introduced by\nWright, a re-emerging powerful concept in systems biology, is used as a tool to\ndescribe biological processes. To our knowledge, the dynamical behaviors for\nMuller's ratchet over the full parameter regimes are not studied from the point\nof the adaptive landscape. And the characterization of the absorbing phenomenon\nis not yet quantitatively obtained without extraneous assumptions as well.\n  Results: We describe the dynamical behavior of the population exposed to\nMuller's ratchet in all parameters regimes by adaptive landscape. The adaptive\nlandscape has rich structures such as finite and infinite potential, real and\nimaginary fixed points. We give the formula about the single click time with\nfinite and infinite potential. And we find the single click time increases with\nselection rates and population size increasing, decreases with mutation rates\nincreasing. These results provide a new understanding of infinite potential. We\nanalytically demonstrate the adaptive and unadaptive states for the whole\nparameters regimes. Interesting issues about the parameters regions with the\nimaginary fixed points is demonstrated. This can help understand the biological\nmeaning of the critical points such as the intersection points of regimes. Most\nimportantly, we find that the absorbing phenomenon is characterized by the\nadaptive landscape and the single click time without any extraneous\nassumptions. These results suggest a graphical and quantitative framework to\nstudy the absorbing phenomenon.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 1 May 2012 06:55:54 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 6 Aug 2012 03:31:45 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sat, 8 Sep 2012 06:54:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-11", "authors_parsed": [["Jiao", "Shuyun", ""], ["Ao", "Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "1205.0541", "submitter": "Matjaz Perc", "authors": "Zhen Wang, Attila Szolnoki, Matjaz Perc", "title": "Percolation threshold determines the optimal population density for\n  public cooperation", "comments": "4 two-column pages, 5 figures; accepted for publication in Physical\n  Review E", "journal-ref": "Phys.

First, players often show ingroup\nfavoritism (i.e., cooperation only within the group) rather than full\ncooperation (i.e., cooperation within and across groups), even though the\nlatter is Pareto efficient. Second, in general, humans approximate outgroup\nmembers' personal characteristics, presumably including the reputation used for\nindirect reciprocity, by a single value attached to the group.

Aggregation is an emergent phenomenon\narising from the interactions between the individuals of the population, able\nto sense only -at most- local densities of their cohorts. Thus, taking into\naccount the individual-level interactions and fluctuations is essential to\nreach a correct description of the population. Classic deterministic equations\nare suitable to describe some aspects of the population, but leave out features\nrelated to the stochasticity inherent to the discreteness of the individuals.\nStochastic equations for the population do account for these\nfluctuation-generated effects by means of demographic noise terms but, owing to\ntheir complexity, they can be difficult (or, at times, impossible) to deal\nwith. Even when they can be written in a simple form, they are still difficult\nto numerically integrate due to the presence of the \"square-root\" intrinsic\nnoise. In this paper, we discuss a simple way to add the effect of demographic\nstochasticity to three classic, deterministic ecological examples where\naggregation plays an important role. We study the resulting equations using a\nrecently-introduced integration scheme especially devised to integrate\nnumerically stochastic equations with demographic noise.
