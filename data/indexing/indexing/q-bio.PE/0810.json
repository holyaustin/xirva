Here, we propose and analyze a simple\nmodel of asexual biological evolution at expanding frontiers to explain these\nneutral patterns and predict the effect of natural selection. Our model\nattributes the observed gradual decrease in the number of sectors at the\nleading edge to an unbiased random walk of sector boundaries. Natural selection\nintroduces a deterministic bias in the wandering of domain boundaries that\nrenders beneficial mutations more likely to escape genetic drift and become\nestablished in a sector. We find that the opening angle of those sectors and\nthe rate at which they become established depend sensitively on the selective\nadvantage of the mutants. Deleterious mutations, on the other hand, are not\nable to establish a sector permanently. They can, however, temporarily \"surf\"\non the population front, and thereby reach unusual high frequencies. As a\nconsequence, expanding frontiers are susceptible to deleterious mutations as\nrevealed by the high fraction of mutants at mutation-selection balance.\nNumerically, we also determine the condition at which the wild type is lost in\nfavor of deleterious mutants (genetic meltdown) at a growing front. Our\nprediction for this error threshold differs qualitatively from existing\nwell-mixed theories, and sets tight constraints on sustainable mutation rates\nfor populations that undergo frequent range expansions.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Oct 2008 04:06:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 12 Dec 2008 08:13:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-12-12", "authors_parsed": [["Hallatschek", "Oskar", ""], ["Nelson", "David R.", ""]]}, {"id": "0810.0296", "submitter": "Iaroslav Ispolatov", "authors": "Michael Doebeli and Iaroslav Ispolatov", "title": "A model for the evolutionary diversification of religions", "comments": "23 pages, 2 figures", "journal-ref": "Journal of Theoretical Biology Volume 267, Issue 4, 21 December\n  2010, Pages 676:684", "doi": "10.1016/j.jtbi.2010.09.013", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph cond-mat.other nlin.AO q-bio.PE", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We address the problem of diversification in religions by studying selection\non cultural memes that colonize humans hosts.

Philosophers of biology have\nargued that when biologists talk about information in genes and in evolution,\nthey are not talking about the sort of information that Shannon's theory\naddresses. First, philosophers have suggested that Shannon theory is only\nuseful for developing a shallow notion of correlation, the so-called \"causal\nsense\" of information. Second they typically argue that in genetics and\nevolutionary biology, information language is used in a \"semantic sense,\"\nwhereas semantics are deliberately omitted from Shannon theory. Neither\ncritique is well-founded. Here we propose an alternative to the causal and\nsemantic senses of information: a transmission sense of information, in which\nan object X conveys information if the function of X is to reduce, by virtue of\nits sequence properties, uncertainty on the part of an agent who observes X.\nThe transmission sense not only captures much of what biologists intend when\nthey talk about information in genes, but also brings Shannon's theory back to\nthe fore. By taking the viewpoint of a communications engineer and focusing on\nthe decision problem of how information is to be packaged for transport, this\napproach resolves several problems that have plagued the information concept in\nbiology, and highlights a number of important features of the way that\ninformation is encoded, stored, and transmitted as genetic sequence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Oct 2008 22:09:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-10-24", "authors_parsed": [["Bergstrom", "C.
