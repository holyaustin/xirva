However, for the many disabled people who live in the\ncommunity and require caregivers to assist them with activities of daily\nliving, limiting contacts is impractical or impossible. We seek to determine\nwhich interventions can prevent infections among disabled people and their\ncaregivers. To accomplish this, we simulate COVID-19 transmission with a\ncompartmental model on a network. The networks incorporate heterogeneity in the\nrisks of different types of interactions, time-dependent lockdown and reopening\nmeasures, and interaction distributions for four different groups (caregivers,\ndisabled people, essential workers, and the general population). Among these\ngroups, we find the probability of becoming infected is highest for caregivers\nand second highest for disabled people. Our analysis of the network structure\nillustrates that caregivers have the largest modal eigenvector centrality among\nthe four groups. We find that two interventions -- contact-limiting by all\ngroups and mask-wearing by disabled people and caregivers -- particularly\nreduce cases among disabled people and caregivers. We also test which group\nmost effectively spreads COVID-19 by seeding infections in a subset of each\ngroup and then comparing the total number of infections as the disease spreads.\nWe find that caregivers are the most effective spreaders of COVID-19. We then\ntest where limited vaccine doses could be used most effectively and we find\nthat vaccinating caregivers better protects disabled people than vaccinating\nthe general population, essential workers, or the disabled population itself.\nOur results highlight the potential effectiveness of mask-wearing,\ncontact-limiting throughout society, and strategic vaccination for limiting the\nexposure of disabled people and their caregivers to COVID-19.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Dec 2020 20:26:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-06", "authors_parsed": [["Valles", "Thomas E.", ""], ["Shoenhard", "Hannah", ""], ["Zinski", "Joseph", ""], ["Trick", "Sarah", ""], ["Porter", "Mason A.", ""], ["Lindstrom", "Michael R.", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.00405", "submitter": "Michele Garetto", "authors": "Michele Garetto and Emilio Leonardi and Giovanni Luca Torrisi", "title": "A time-modulated Hawkes process to model the spread of COVID-19 and the\n  impact of countermeasures", "comments": "13 colored figures", "journal-ref": "Annual Reviews in Control, 2021", "doi": "10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.02.002", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE math.PR physics.soc-ph stat.AP", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/", "abstract": "  Motivated by the recent outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), we propose a\nstochastic model of epidemic temporal growth and mitigation based on a\ntime-modulated Hawkes process.

In this\nwork we study population survival or extinction using a stochastic,\nlattice-based random walk model where individuals undergo migration, birth and\ndeath events. The stochastic model is defined on a two-dimensional hexagonal\nlattice with periodic boundary conditions. A key feature of the stochastic\nmodel is that crowding effects are introduced by specifying two different\ncrowding functions that govern how local agent density influences migration\nevents and birth/death events. The continuum limit description of the\nstochastic model is a nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, and in this work\nwe focus on crowding functions that lead to linear diffusion and a bistable\nreaction term that is often associated with the strong Allee effect. Using both\nthe discrete and continuum modelling tools we explore the complicated\nrelationship between the long-term survival or extinction of the population and\nthe initial spatial arrangement of the population. In particular, we study\nthree different types of initial conditions: (i) a zero-dimensional initial\ncondition where the initial density is independent of position in the domain;\n(ii) a one-dimensional initial condition where the initial density is\nindependent of vertical position in the domain; and, (iii) a two-dimensional\ninitial condition. Our results highlight the often-overlooked role of\ndimensionality in determining the long-term survival or extinction of bistable\npopulations.

We\nidentify two distinct modes in which chemotaxis influences the morphology of\nthe population: cells in different locations along a front migrate at different\nvelocities due to spatial variations in (i) the local nutrient gradient and in\n(ii) the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient.\nWhile the first mode is destabilizing, the second mode is stabilizing and\ndominates, ultimately driving smoothing of the overall population and enabling\ncontinued collective migration. This process is autonomous, arising without any\nexternal intervention; instead, it is a population-scale consequence of the\nmanner in which individual cells transduce external signals.

Such heterogeneity has been\nobserved in COVID-19 and is recognized as overdispersion (or\n\"super-spreading\"). The model of [8] suggests that super-spreaders contribute\nsignificantly to the effective reproduction factor, R, and that they are likely\nto get infected and immune early in the process. Consequently, under R_0 = 3\n(attributed to COVID-19), the Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) is as low as 5%, in\ncontrast to 67% according to the traditional models [1, 2, 4, 10]. This work\nfollows up on [8] and proposes that heterogeneity of infectiousness\n(susceptibility) has two \"faces\" whose mix affects dramatically the HIT: (1)\nPersonal-Trait-, and (2) Event-Based- Infectiousness (Susceptibility). The\nformer is a personal trait of specific individuals (super-spreaders) and is\nnullified once those individuals are immune (as in [8]). The latter is\nevent-based (e.g cultural super-spreading events) and remains effective\nthroughout the process, even after the super-spreaders immune. We extend [8]'s\nmodel to account for these two factors, analyze it and conclude that the HIT is\nvery sensitive to the mix between (1) and (2), and under R_0 = 3 it can vary\nbetween 5% and 67%.

However, many\nnetworks derived from modern datasets are quite dense, such as mobility\nnetworks where each location has links to a large number of potential\ndestinations. One way to reduce the computational effort of simulating\nepidemics on these networks is sparsification, where we select a representative\nsubset of edges based on some measure of their importance. Recently an approach\nwas proposed using an algorithm based on the effective resistance of the edges.\nWe explore how effective resistance is correlated with the probability that an\nedge transmits disease in the SI model. We find that in some cases these two\nnotions of edge importance are well correlated, making effective resistance a\ncomputationally efficient proxy for the importance of an edge to epidemic\nspread. In other cases, the correlation is weaker, and we discuss situations in\nwhich effective resistance is not a good proxy for epidemic importance.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2021 05:08:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Mercier", "Alexander", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.11990", "submitter": "Siddhartha Verma", "authors": "Jesse H.

Respiratory droplets are known to be the\nmost prominent source of transmission for COVID-19, however, alternative routes\nmay exist given the discovery of small numbers of viable viruses in urine and\nstool samples. Flushing biomatter can lead to the aerosolization of\nmicroorganisms, thus, there is a likelihood that bioaerosols generated in\npublic restrooms may pose a concern for the transmission of COVID-19,\nespecially since these areas are relatively confined, experience heavy foot\ntraffic, and may suffer from inadequate ventilation. To quantify the extent of\naerosolization, we measure the size and number of droplets generated by\nflushing toilets and urinals in a public restroom. The results indicate that\nthe particular designs tested in the study generate a large number of droplets\nin the size range 0.3$\\mu m$ to 3$\\mu m$, which can reach heights of at least\n1.52m. Covering the toilet reduced aerosol levels but did not eliminate them\ncompletely, suggesting that aerosolized droplets escaped through small gaps\nbetween the cover and the seat. In addition to consistent increases in aerosol\nlevels immediately after flushing, there was a notable rise in ambient aerosol\nlevels due to the accumulation of droplets from multiple flushes conducted\nduring the tests. This highlights the need for incorporating adequate\nventilation in the design and operation of public spaces, which can help\nprevent aerosol accumulation in high occupancy areas and mitigate the risk of\nairborne disease transmission.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2021 13:30:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-07", "authors_parsed": [["Schreck", "Jesse H.", ""], ["Lashaki", "Masoud Jahandar", ""], ["Hashemi", "Javad", ""], ["Dhanak", "Manhar", ""], ["Verma", "Siddhartha", ""]]}, {"id": "2101.12011", "submitter": "Guenter B\\\"arwolff", "authors": "Guenter B\\\"arwolff", "title": "COVID-19 propagation by diffusion -- a two-dimensional approach for\n  Germany", "comments": "10 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  Diffusion comes anytime and everywhere.
