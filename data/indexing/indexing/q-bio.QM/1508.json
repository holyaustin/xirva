For instance,\noptical engineers need to tune the recording parameters to get as many optimal\nsolutions as possible for multiple trials in the varied-line-spacing\nholographic grating design problem. Unfortunately, most traditional\noptimization techniques focus on solving for a single optimal solution. They\nneed to be applied several times; yet all solutions are not guaranteed to be\nfound. Thus the multimodal optimization problem was proposed. In that problem,\nwe are interested in not only a single optimal point, but also the others. With\nstrong parallel search capability, evolutionary algorithms are shown to be\nparticularly effective in solving this type of problem. In particular, the\nevolutionary algorithms for multimodal optimization usually not only locate\nmultiple optima in a single run, but also preserve their population diversity\nthroughout a run, resulting in their global optimization ability on multimodal\nfunctions. In addition, the techniques for multimodal optimization are borrowed\nas diversity maintenance techniques to other problems.

Above this threshold,\nadditional individuals do not increase the probability of capturing the prey.\nRecent direct observations of wolves in Yellowstone Park show that the group\nsize threshold when hunting its most formidable prey, bison, is nearly three\ntimes greater than when hunting elk, a prey that is considerably less\nchallenging to capture than bison. These observations provide empirical support\nto a computational particle model of group hunting which was previously shown\nto be effective in explaining why hunting success peaks at apparently small\npack sizes when hunting elk. The model is based on considering two critical\ndistances between wolves and prey: the minimal safe distance at which wolves\nstand from the prey, and the avoidance distance at which wolves move away from\neach other when they approach the prey. The minimal safe distance is longer\nwhen the prey is more dangerous to hunt. We show that the model explains\neffectively that the group size threshold is greater when the minimal safe\ndistance is longer. Although both distances are longer when the prey is more\ndangerous, they contribute oppositely to the value of the group size threshold:\nthe group size threshold is smaller when the avoidance distance is longer. This\nunexpected mechanism gives rise to a global increase of the group size\nthreshold when considering bison with respect to elk, but other prey more\ndangerous than elk can lead to specific critical distances that can give rise\nto the same group size threshold.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that provides an\neffect size analog of each explanatory variable for Bayesian kernel regression\nmodels when the kernel is shift-invariant --- for example, the Gaussian kernel.\nWe use function analytic properties of shift-invariant reproducing kernel\nHilbert spaces (RKHS) to define a linear vector space that: (i) captures\nnonlinear structure, and (ii) can be projected onto the original explanatory\nvariables. The projection onto the original explanatory variables serves as an\nanalog of effect sizes.

All available algorithms in this field can\nbe grouped into two categories, either solving the problem using sequence\nalignment through dynamic programming, or, employing certain heuristic measures\nto perform an initial screening followed by applying an optimal sequence\nalignment algorithm to the closest matching candidates. While the first\napproach suffers from huge time and space demands, the latter approach might\nmiss some protein sequences which are distantly related to the query sequence.\nIn this paper, we propose a heuristic pair-wise sequence alignment algorithm\nthat can be efficiently employed for protein database searches for moderately\nsized databases. The proposed algorithm is sufficiently fast to be applicable\nto database searches for short query sequences, has constant auxiliary space\nrequirements, produces good alignments, and is sensitive enough to return even\ndistantly related protein chains that might be of interest.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 16:58:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Nag", "Akash", ""], ["Karforma", "Sunil", ""]]}, {"id": "1508.06756", "submitter": "Didier Fraix-Burnet", "authors": "Didier Fraix-Burnet (IPAG), Marc Thuillard, Asis Kumar Chattopadhyay", "title": "Multivariate Approaches to Classification in Extragalactic Astronomy", "comments": "Open Access paper.\n  http://www.frontiersin.org/milky\\_way\\_and\\_galaxies/10.3389/fspas.2015.00003/abstract\\&gt;.\n  \\&lt;10.3389/fspas.2015.00003 \\&gt", "journal-ref": "Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences, Lee Samuel Finn, 2015,\n  2 (3), pp.00", "doi": "10.3389/fspas.2015.00003", "report-no": null, "categories": "astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Clustering objects into synthetic groups is a natural activity of any\nscience. Astrophysics is not an exception and is now facing a deluge of data.\nFor galaxies, the one-century old Hubble classification and the Hubble tuning\nfork are still largely in use, together with numerous mono-or bivariate\nclassifications most often made by eye.

The steady-state dynamics of PBNs\nis of special interest in the analysis of biological systems. However,\nobtaining the steady-state distributions for such systems poses a significant\nchallenge due to the state space explosion problem which often arises in the\ncase of large PBNs. The only viable way is to use statistical methods. We have\nconsidered the two-state Markov chain approach and the Skart method for the\nanalysis of large PBNs in our previous work. However, the sample size required\nin both methods is often huge in the case of large PBNs and generating them is\nexpensive in terms of computation time. Parallelising the sample generation is\nan ideal way to solve this issue. In this paper, we consider combining the\nGerman & Rubin method with either the two-state Markov chain approach or the\nSkart method for parallelisation. The first method can be used to run multiple\nindependent Markov chains in parallel and to control their convergence to the\nsteady-state while the other two methods can be used to determine the sample\nsize required for computing the steady-state probability of states of interest.\nExperimental results show that our proposed combinations can reduce time cost\nof computing stead-state probabilities of large PBNs significantly.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2015 13:55:33 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-09-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mizera", "Andrzej", ""], ["Pang", "Jun", ""], ["Yuan", "Qixia", ""]]}]
