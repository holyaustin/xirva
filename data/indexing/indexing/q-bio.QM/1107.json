A challenge all these approaches\nhave to address is to allow for simulations at cell-biologically relevant\ntimescales without neither neglecting important spatial and biochemical\nproperties of the simulated system nor introducing ad-hoc assumptions not based\non physical principles. Here we describe a PSSA that permits large time steps\nwhile still retaining a high degree of accuracy. The approach addresses the\ntypical disadvantage of Brownian dynamics, namely the need to use small time\nsteps to resolve bimolecular encounters accurately, by estimating the number of\notherwise unnoticed encounters with the help of the Green's functions of the\ndiffusion equation incorporating molecular interactions. This method has\npreviously been proposed for purely absorbing boundary conditions and\nirreversible bimolecular reactions. Building on those ideas, we developed a\ngeneral-purpose PSSA that is applicable to a broad class of reaction-diffusion\nproblems by incorporating reflective and radiation boundary conditions and\nreversible reactions. We furthermore discuss how reaction-diffusion systems on\n2D membranes can be described and derive small time expansions of the Green's\nfunctions that substantially speed up key calculations, particularly in the\nproblematic case of molecules in close proximity. Finally, we point out the\nformal relationship between our and exact algorithms.

Recent work (Cole-Fletcher et al. 2011) suggests Carlander (1969)\ncontains numerous errors in listed weight-length equations. This paper assesses\nthe weight-length relationships listed in Carlander for muskellunge, northern\npike, and chain pickerel by comparing graphs of the weight vs. length equations\nwith other data listed and with standard weight curves published by independent\nsources. A number of discrepancies are identified through this analysis and new\nweight-length relationships are produced from listed data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 15 Jul 2011 17:26:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Daviscourt", "Joshua", ""], ["Huertas", "Joshua", ""], ["Courtney", "Michael", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.3569", "submitter": "Charles Li", "authors": "Yipeng Yang, Y.

We found that helical periodicities with the lengths\nabout B-helix pitch ~10.2-10.5 bp and A-helix pitch ~10.8-11.1 bp coexist in\nthe genomic sequences. We mapped the distributions of stretches with A-, B-,\nand Z- like DNA periodicities onto E.coli genome.

Several approaches exist to account for\nthis feature but they do not usually enable the investigator to pinpoint the\nsites that evolve under one or another rate of evolution in a straightforward\nmanner. The focus is on Bayesian phylogenetic mixture models, augmented with\nallocation variables, as tools for site classification and quantification of\nclassification uncertainty. The method does not rely on prior knowledge of site\nmembership to classes or even the number of classes. Furthermore, it does not\nrequire correlated sites to be next to one another in the sequence alignment,\nunlike some phylogenetic hidden Markov or change-point models. In the approach\npresented, model selection on the number and type of mixture components is\nconducted ahead of both model estimation and site classification; the\nsteppingstone sampler (SS) is used to select amongst competing mixture models.\nExample applications of simulated data and mitochondrial DNA of primates\nillustrate site classification via 'augmented' Bayesian phylogenetic mixtures.\nIn both examples, all mixtures outperform commonly-used models of among-site\nrate variation and models that do not account for rate heterogeneity. The\nexamples further demonstrate how site classification is readily available from\nthe analysis output. The method is directly relevant to the choice of\npartitions in Bayesian phylogenetics, and its application may lead to the\ndiscovery of structure not otherwise recognised in a molecular sequence\nalignment. Computational aspects of Bayesian phylogenetic model estimation are\ndiscussed, including the use of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) moves\nthat mix efficiently without tempering the chains.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2011 21:24:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 28 Aug 2012 17:29:49 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 8 Apr 2013 10:51:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 07:40:36 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Wed, 22 May 2013 19:41:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-23", "authors_parsed": [["Loza-Reyes", "Elisa", ""], ["Hurn", "Merrilee", ""], ["Robinson", "Tony", ""]]}, {"id": "1107.5349", "submitter": "Luca Pinello", "authors": "Luca Pinello", "title": "Multi Layer Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CV cs.DS cs.LG q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This thesis presents a new methodology to analyze one-dimensional signals\ntrough a new approach called Multi Layer Analysis, for short MLA.
