However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as\nprior solutions can be used to inform future time steps.

MRI volumetry with AVS may support the\ndiagnosis of dementias by identifying regional atrophy. Moreover, automatic\nclassifiers using machine learning techniques have recently emerged as\npromising approaches to assist diagnosis. However, the performance of both AVS\nand automatic classifiers has been evaluated mostly in the artificial setting\nof research datasets.OBJECTIVE:Our aim was to evaluate the performance of two\nAVS and an automatic classifier in the clinical routine condition of a memory\nclinic.METHODS:We studied 239 patients with cognitive troubles from a single\nmemory center cohort. Using clinical routine T1-weighted MRI, we evaluated the\nclassification performance of: 1) univariate volumetry using two AVS (volBrain\nand Neuroreader$^{TM}$); 2) Support Vector Machine (SVM) automatic classifier,\nusing either the AVS volumes (SVM-AVS), or whole gray matter (SVM-WGM); 3)\nreading by two neuroradiologists. The performance measure was the balanced\ndiagnostic accuracy. The reference standard was consensus diagnosis by three\nneurologists using clinical, biological (cerebrospinal fluid) and imaging data\nand following international criteria.RESULTS:Univariate AVS volumetry provided\nonly moderate accuracies (46% to 71% with hippocampal volume). The accuracy\nimproved when using SVM-AVS classifier (52% to 85%), becoming close to that of\nSVM-WGM (52 to 90%). Visual classification by neuroradiologists ranged between\nSVM-AVS and SVM-WGM.CONCLUSION:In the routine practice of a memory clinic, the\nuse of volumetric measures provided by AVS yields only moderate accuracy.\nAutomatic classifiers can improve accuracy and could be a useful tool to assist\ndiagnosis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 08:44:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-23", "authors_parsed": [["Morin", "Alexandre", "", "ARAMIS"], ["Samper-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Jorge", "", "ARAMIS"], ["Bertrand", "Anne", "", "ARAMIS"], ["Stroer", "Sebastian", "", "ICM, ARAMIS"], ["Dormont", "Didier", "", "ICM, ARAMIS"], ["Mendes", "Aline", "", "IM2A"], ["Coup\u00e9", "Pierrick", "", "IM2A"], ["Ahdidan", "Jamila", "", "IM2A"], ["L\u00e9vy", "Marcel", "", "IM2A"], ["Samri", "Dalila", "", "APM"], ["Hampel", "Harald", "", "APM"], ["Dubois", "Bruno", "", "APM"], ["Teichmann", "Marc", "", "FRONTlab"], ["Epelbaum", "St\u00e9phane", "", "ARAMIS"], ["Colliot", "Olivier", "", "ARAMIS"]]}, {"id": "2003.09312", "submitter": "Nitish Nag", "authors": "Nitish Nag", "title": "Health State Estimation", "comments": "Ph.D. Dissertation @ University of California, Irvine", "journal-ref": "Proquest 2020, 307 pages", "doi": null, "report-no": "27743502", "categories": "cs.AI cs.CY cs.HC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Life's most valuable asset is health. Continuously understanding the state of\nour health and modeling how it evolves is essential if we wish to improve it.\nGiven the opportunity that people live with more data about their life today\nthan any other time in history, the challenge rests in interweaving this data\nwith the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an\nindividual continually. This dissertation presents an approach to build a\npersonal model and dynamically estimate the health state of an individual by\nfusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together\nfrom four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the\nlayers of our biological systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the\nfunctional utilities that arise from biological underpinnings, and 4. how we\ninteract with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting these\nfour elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we\ninstantiate a digital twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph\nstructure are then regularly updated with learning techniques as data is\ncontinuously digested. Experiments demonstrate the use of dense and\nheterogeneous real-world data from a variety of personal and environmental\nsensors to monitor individual cardiovascular health state. State estimation and\nindividual modeling is the fundamental basis to depart from disease-oriented\napproaches to a total health continuum paradigm. Precision in predicting health\nrequires understanding state trajectory. By encasing this estimation within a\nnavigational approach, a systematic guidance framework can plan actions to\ntransition a current state towards a desired one. This work concludes by\npresenting this framework of combining the health state and personal graph\nmodel to perpetually plan and assist us in living life towards our goals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 16 Mar 2020 21:06:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-04", "authors_parsed": [["Nag", "Nitish", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.09496", "submitter": "Giuseppe de Vito", "authors": "Giuseppe de Vito, Pietro Ricci, Lapo Turrini, Vladislav Gavryusev,\n  Caroline M\\\"ullenbroich, Natascia Tiso, Francesco Vanzi, Ludovico Silvestri,\n  Francesco Saverio Pavone", "title": "Effects of excitation light polarization on fluorescence emission in\n  two-photon light-sheet microscopy", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures.

By applying these new\nmeasures, we show that new information can be gained; in our example we show\nthat distinct morphological alterations underlie healthy ageing compared to\ntemporal lobe epilepsy, even on the coarse level of a whole hemisphere.\n  We thus provide a conceptual framework for characterising cortical morphology\nin a statistically valid and interpretable manner, based on theoretical\nreasoning about the shape of the cortex.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:53:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-03-25", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Yujiang", ""], ["Ludwig", "Tobias", ""], ["Little", "Bethany", ""], ["Necus", "Joe H", ""], ["Winston", "Gavin", ""], ["Vos", "Sjoerd B", ""], ["de Tisi", "Jane", ""], ["Duncan", "John S", ""], ["Taylor", "Peter N", ""], ["Mota", "Bruno", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.10778", "submitter": "Jevgenij Gamper", "authors": "Jevgenij Gamper, Navid Alemi Koohbanani, Ksenija Benes, Simon Graham,\n  Mostafa Jahanifar, Syed Ali Khurram, Ayesha Azam, Katherine Hewitt, Nasir\n  Rajpoot", "title": "PanNuke Dataset Extension, Insights and Baselines", "comments": "Work in progress", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.IV cs.CV q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The emerging area of computational pathology (CPath) is ripe ground for the\napplication of deep learning (DL) methods to healthcare due to the sheer volume\nof raw pixel data in whole-slide images (WSIs) of cancerous tissue slides.\nHowever, it is imperative for the DL algorithms relying on nuclei-level details\nto be able to cope with data from `the clinical wild', which tends to be quite\nchallenging.\n  We study, and extend recently released PanNuke dataset consisting of ~200,000\nnuclei categorized into 5 clinically important classes for the challenging\ntasks of segmenting and classifying nuclei in WSIs.

It would be useful to\nmeasure this loss of resilience before the full desynchronization takes place.\nSeveral dynamical indicators of resilience (DIORs) have been proposed to\naccount for the loss of resilience of a dynamical system.

Similarly, snake robots hold the\npromise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like\nearthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently\nstable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of\nplane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent\nprogress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth\nobstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered\nthat the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and\ncantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait\nis preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a\nmethod to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and\norientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support\nusing the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the\nsnake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most\nchallenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake\nrobot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with\nvariable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly\nand stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As\nstep height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of\nflipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in\nthe snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the\nrobot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll\ninstability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing\ntraversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly\nthan most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:30:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-09-04", "authors_parsed": [["Fu", "Qiyuan", ""], ["Gart", "Sean W.", ""], ["Mitchel", "Thomas W.", ""], ["Kim", "Jin Seob", ""], ["Chirikjian", "Gregory S.", ""], ["Li", "Chen", ""]]}, {"id": "2003.13754", "submitter": "Connor Coley", "authors": "Connor W.
