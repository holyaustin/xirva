A shortcoming of the\nstandard framework for Granger causality is that it only allows for examination\nof interactions between single (univariate) variables within a system, perhaps\nconditioned on other variables. However, interactions do not necessarily take\nplace between single variables, but may occur among groups, or \"ensembles\", of\nvariables. In this study we establish a principled framework for Granger\ncausality in the context of causal interactions among two or more multivariate\nsets of variables. Building on Geweke's seminal 1982 work, we offer new\njustifications for one particular form of multivariate Granger causality based\non the generalized variances of residual errors. Taken together, our results\nsupport a comprehensive and theoretically consistent extension of Granger\ncausality to the multivariate case. Treated individually, they highlight\nseveral specific advantages of the generalized variance measure, which we\nillustrate using applications in neuroscience as an example. We further show\nhow the measure can be used to define \"partial\" Granger causality in the\nmultivariate context and we also motivate reformulations of \"causal density\"\nand \"Granger autonomy\". Our results are directly applicable to experimental\ndata and promise to reveal new types of functional relations in complex\nsystems, neural and otherwise.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 1 Feb 2010 18:31:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Apr 2010 17:43:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Barrett", "Adam B.", ""], ["Barnett", "Lionel", ""], ["Seth", "Anil K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1002.0559", "submitter": "Randen Patterson", "authors": "Gaurav Bhardwaj, Zhenhai Zhang, Yoojin Hong, Kyung Dae Ko, Gue Su\n  Chang, Evan J.

As phylogenetic profiles are used as the\ninformation source, rather than MSA, we propose PHYRN as a paradigm shift in\nstudying evolution when MSA approaches fail. Perhaps most importantly, due to\nthe improvements in our computational approach and the availability of vast\namount of sequencing data, PHYRN is scalable to thousands of sequences. Taken\ntogether with PHYRNs adaptability to any protein family, this method can serve\nas a tool for resolving ambiguities in evolutionary studies of rapidly\nevolving/highly divergent protein families.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 2 Feb 2010 18:13:11 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 16:12:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-26", "authors_parsed": [["Bhardwaj", "Gaurav", ""], ["Zhang", "Zhenhai", ""], ["Hong", "Yoojin", ""], ["Ko", "Kyung Dae", ""], ["Chang", "Gue Su", ""], ["Smith", "Evan J.", ""], ["Kline", "Lindsay A.", ""], ["Hartranft", "D.

We perceive flux as the flow of resources in stochastic\nsimulations. We resort to an established correspondence between event\nstructures, a broadly recognised model of concurrency, and state transitions of\nprocess models, seen as Petri nets. We show that we can this way extract the\ncausal resource dependencies in simulations between individual state\ntransitions as partial orders of events. We propose transformations on the\npartial orders that provide means for further analysis, and introduce a\nsoftware tool, which implements these ideas. By means of an example of a\npublished model of the Rho GTP-binding proteins, we argue that this approach\ncan provide the substitute for flux analysis techniques on ordinary\ndifferential equation models within the stochastic setting of process algebras.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 22 Feb 2010 06:27:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kahramano\u011fullari", "Ozan", "", "The Microsoft Research - University of\n  Trento, Centre for Computational and Systems Biology"]]}, {"id": "1002.4062", "submitter": "EPTCS", "authors": "Robin Donaldson (University of Glasgow), Muffy Calder (University of\n  Glasgow)", "title": "Modelling and Analysis of Biochemical Signalling Pathway Cross-talk", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "EPTCS 19, 2010, pp. 40-54", "doi": "10.4204/EPTCS.19.3", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.CE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Signalling pathways are abstractions that help life scientists structure the\ncoordination of cellular activity.
