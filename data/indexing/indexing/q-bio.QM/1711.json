Changes in synaptic efficacy between neurons constitute one of the\nmajor mechanisms of plasticity. Therefore, estimation of neural connections is\ncrucial for investigating information processing in the brain. Although many\nanalysis methods have been proposed for this purpose, most of them suffer from\none or all the following mathematical difficulties: (1) only partially observed\nneural activity is available; (2) correlations can include both direct and\nindirect pseudo-interactions; and (3) biological evidence that a neuron\ntypically has only one type of connection (excitatory or inhibitory) should be\nconsidered. To overcome these difficulties, a novel probabilistic framework for\nestimating neural connections from partially observed spikes is proposed in\nthis paper. First, based on the property of a sum of random variables, the\nproposed method estimates the influence of unobserved neurons on observed\nneurons and extracts only the correlations among observed neurons. Second, the\nrelationship between pseudo-correlations and target connections is modeled by\nneural propagation in a multiplicative manner.

In this paper, we develop a stylized bioeconomic model to determine the\noptimal reintroduction time, in which the objective is to minimize the cost of\nreintroduction while providing a viably-sized population in the wild.

This can also integrate multiple programs or datasets,\neach as an individual, for the same predictive questions. Crowd wisdom\nestimates each individual's independent error level arising from their limited\nknowledge, and finds the crowd consensus that minimizes the overall error.\nHowever, previous studies have merely built isolated, problem-specific models\nwith limited generalizability, and mainly for binary (yes/no) responses. Here\nwe show with simulation and real-world data that the crowd wisdom problem is\nanalogous to one-dimensional unsupervised dimension reduction in machine\nlearning. This provides a natural class of crowd wisdom solutions, such as\nprincipal component analysis and Isomap, which can handle binary and also\ncontinuous responses, like confidence levels, and consequently can be more\naccurate than existing solutions. They can even outperform\nsupervised-learning-based collective intelligence that is calibrated on\nhistorical performance of individuals, e.g. penalized linear regression and\nrandom forest. This study unifies crowd wisdom and unsupervised dimension\nreduction, and thereupon introduces a broad range of highly-performing and\nwidely-applicable crowd wisdom methods. As the costs for data acquisition and\nprocessing rapidly decrease, this study will promote and guide crowd wisdom\napplications in the social and natural sciences, including data fusion,\nmeta-analysis, crowd-sourcing, and committee decision making.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 28 Nov 2017 21:40:49 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-12-01", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Lingfei", ""], ["Michoel", "Tom", ""]]}, {"id": "1711.11070", "submitter": "Victor Greiff", "authors": "Enkelejda Miho, Alexander Yermanos, C\\'edric R.

The\ninterrogation of immune repertoires is of high relevance for understanding the\nadaptive immune response in disease and infection (e.g., autoimmunity, cancer,\nHIV). Adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) has driven the\nquantitative and molecular-level profiling of immune repertoires thereby\nrevealing the high-dimensional complexity of the immune receptor sequence\nlandscape. Several methods for the computational and statistical analysis of\nlarge-scale AIRR-seq data have been developed to resolve immune repertoire\ncomplexity in order to understand the dynamics of adaptive immunity.
