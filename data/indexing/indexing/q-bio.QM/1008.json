Pattern classification and\nfeature extraction are among the first applications of machine learning that\nhave received extensive attention. The most remarkable achievements have\naddressed data sets of moderate-to-large size. The 'data deluge' in the last\ndecade or two has posed new challenges for AI researchers to design new,\neffective and accurate algorithms for similar tasks using ultra-massive data\nsets and complex (natural or synthetic) dynamical systems. We propose a novel\nprincipled approach to feature extraction in hybrid architectures comprised of\nhumans and machines in networked communication, who collaborate to solve a\npre-assigned pattern recognition (feature extraction) task. There are two\npractical considerations addressed below: (1) Human experts, such as plant\nbiologists or astronomers, often use their visual perception and other implicit\nprior knowledge or expertise without any obvious constraints to search for the\nsignificant features, whereas machines are limited to a pre-programmed set of\ncriteria to work with; (2) in a team collaboration of collective problem\nsolving, the human experts have diverse abilities that are complementary, and\nthey learn from each other to succeed in cognitively complex tasks in ways that\nare still impossible imitate by machines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Aug 2010 18:53:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-22", "authors_parsed": [["Dashti", "Hesam T.", ""], ["Ardalan", "Adel", ""], ["Siahpirani", "Alireza F.", ""], ["Tonejc", "Jernej", ""], ["Uilecan", "Ioan V.", ""], ["Simas", "Tiago", ""], ["Miranda", "Bruno", ""], ["Ribeiro", "Rita", ""], ["Wang", "Liya", ""], ["Assadi", "Amir H.", ""]]}, {"id": "1008.5390", "submitter": "Hesam Dashti", "authors": "Hesam T.
