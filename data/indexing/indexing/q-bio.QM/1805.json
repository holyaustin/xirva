Understanding\nhow a system constitutes itself as an individual, cohesive, self-organized\nentity is a fundamental challenge for the understanding of life. However, it is\ngenerally a difficult task to determine whether the system or its environment\nhas generated the correlations that allow an observer to trace the boundary of\na living system as a coherent unit. Inspired by the framework of integrated\ninformation theory, we propose a measure of the level of integration of a\nsystem as the response of a system to partitions that introduce perturbations\nin the interaction between subsystems, without assuming the existence of a\nstationary distribution. With the goal of characterizing transitions in\nintegrated information in the thermodynamic limit, we apply this measure to\nkinetic Ising models of infinite size using mean field techniques. Our findings\nsuggest that, in order to preserve the integration of causal influences of a\nsystem as it grows in size, a living entity must be poised near critical points\nmaximizing its sensitivity to perturbations in the interaction between\nsubsystems. Moreover, we observe how such a measure is able to delimit an agent\nand its environment, being able to characterize simple instances of\nagent-environment asymmetries in which the agent has the ability to modulate\nits coupling with the environment.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 2 Apr 2018 11:19:14 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 22 May 2018 13:01:53 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Tue, 19 Jun 2018 12:43:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 5 Feb 2019 23:14:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-07", "authors_parsed": [["Aguilera", "Miguel", ""], ["Di Paolo", "Ezequiel", ""]]}, {"id": "1805.00674", "submitter": "Yannick Ramonet", "authors": "Yannick Ramonet, Carole Bertin", "title": "Use of accelerometers to measure physical activity of group-housed\n  pregnant sows.

This study reveals that the relative stability of dyadic spatial\nrelationships between changes in group composition or enclosure is due to the\nidentities of transferred individuals more than the quantity of individuals\nthat are transferred. Older cattle had higher network centralities than other\nindividuals. The centrality of individuals was also affected by their sex and\nthe number of familiar individuals in the group.
