At the same time, the\ndirected evolution of biological molecules (in vitro evolution) is reasonably\ninterpreted as an implementation of GA in biochemical experiments. One of the\ntheoretical foundations of GA, justifying the effectiveness of evolutionary\nsearch, is the concept of building blocks (BB). In EC, it is reasonable to\nmatch these BBs to domains and motifs of macromolecules in evolutionary and\nsynthetic biology. Computer scientists have shown and carefully studied the\nimportance of preserving already found BBs for the effectiveness of\nevolutionary search. For this purpose, dozens of algorithms have been\ndeveloped, including heuristic crossover algorithms. On the other hand, the\nexperimental procedures defining and preserving domains remain a poorly\ndeveloped area in the techniques of evolution in vitro. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate how several simple algorithms preserving the BBs can increase the\nefficiency of in vitro evolution in numerical experiments by almost an order of\nmagnitude. As test problems, we propose and use such well-known problems of\nsynthetic biology as the evolutionary search for strong bacterial promoters\n(with several motifs) and search for multi-domain RNA devices, as compared to\nthe classic GA tests (Royal Road functions). The success of these primary tests\nwith simple algorithms gives us every reason to expect that the implementation\nand application of more advanced and modern EC procedures will give an even\ngreater increase in efficiency.

A deeper insight into spinal\nloading could provide valuable information for the improvement of current\ntreatment strategies. This work therefore aimed at using subject-specific\nmusculoskeletal full-body models of patients with AIS to predict segmental\ncompressive forces around the curve apex and to investigate how these forces\nare affected by simulated load carrying. Models were created based on spatially\ncalibrated biplanar radiographic images from 24 patients with mild to moderate\nAIS and validated by comparing predictions of paravertebral muscle activity\nwith reported values from in vivo studies. Spinal compressive forces were\npredicted during unloaded upright standing as well as upright standing with\nexternal loads of 10%, 15% and 20% of body weight (BW) applied to the scapulae\nto simulate carrying a backpack in the regular way, in front of the body and\nover both shoulders. The validation studies showed higher convex muscle\nactivity, which was comparable to the literature. The implementation of spinal\ndeformity resulted in a 10% increase of compressive force at the curve apex\nduring unloaded upright standing. Apical compressive forces further increased\nby 50-62%, 77-94% and 103-128% for 10%, 15% and 20% BW loads, respectively.\nMoreover, load-dependent compressive force increases were the lowest in the\nregular backpack and the highest in the frontpack and convex conditions. The\npredictions indicated increased segmental compressive forces during unloaded\nstanding, which could be ascribed to the scoliotic deformation. When carrying\nloads, compressive forces further increased depending on the carrying mode and\nthe weight of the load.

Recent advancements in electrode designs and micro-fabrication\ntechnology has allowed existence of microelectrode arrays with hundreds of\nchannels for single-cell recordings. In such electrophysiological recordings,\neach implanted micro-electrode can record the activities of more than one\nneuron in its vicinity. Recording the activities of multiple neurons may also\nbe referred to as multiple unit activity. However, for any further analysis,\nthe main goal is to isolate the activity of each recorded neuron and thus\ncalled single-unit activity. This process may also be referred to as spike\nsorting or spike classification. Recent approaches to extract SUA are time\nconsuming, mainly due to the requirement of human intervention at various\nstages of spike sorting pipeline. Lack of standardization is another drawback\nof the current available approaches. Therefore, in this study we proposed a\nstandard spike sorter: SpikeDeep-Classifier, a fully automatic spike sorting\nalgorithm. Approach. We proposed a novel spike sorting pipeline, based on a set\nof supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. We used supervised, deep\nlearning-based algorithms for extracting meaningful channels and removing\nbackground activities (noise) from the extracted channels. We also showed that\nthe process of clustering becomes straight-forward, once the noise/artifact is\ncompletely removed from the data. Therefore, in the next stage, we applied a\nsimple clustering algorithm (K-mean) with predefined maximum number of\nclusters.

A typical example is provided by\nthe 3D wave equation, widely used in acoustics. We face vibrating eardrums as a\nbinaural auditory input stemming from an external sound source. In the setup of\ninternally coupled ears (ICE), which are present in more than half of the\nland-living vertebrates, the two tympana are coupled by an internal air-filled\ncavity, whose geometry determines the acoustic properties of the ICE system.\nThe eardrums themselves are described by a 2-dimensional, damped, wave equation\nand are part of the spatial boundary conditions of the three-dimensional\nLaplacian belonging to the wave equation in the internal cavity that couples\nand internally drives the eardrums. In animals with ICE the resulting signal is\nthe superposition of external sound arriving at both eardrums and the internal\npressure coupling them.

In the context of ICE it boils down to acoustic\nboundary-condition dynamics (ABCD) for the coupled dynamical system of eardrums\nand internal cavity. In acoustics the deviations from equilibrium are extremely\nsmall (nm). Perturbation theory is therefore natural and shown to be\nappropriate.
