Here, we\npropose an approach for simultaneous determination of changes in mRNA\ntranscription rate and lifetime using regulatory small RNAs to control mRNA\ndecay. We analyze a stochastic model for coupled degradation of mRNAs and sRNAs\nand derive exact results connecting RNA lifetimes and transcription rates to\nmean abundances. The results obtained show how steady-state measurements of RNA\nlevels can be used to analyze factors and processes regulating changes in mRNA\ntranscription and decay.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 9 Oct 2009 00:19:55 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 11 Oct 2009 23:42:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-14", "authors_parsed": [["Elgart", "Vlad", ""], ["Jia", "Tao", ""], ["Kulkarni", "Rahul", ""]]}, {"id": "0910.1953", "submitter": "Yunfeng Shan Dr.", "authors": "Yunfeng Shan, and Xiu-Qing Li", "title": "GeneSupport Maximum Gene-Support Tree Approach to Species Phylogeny\n  Inference", "comments": "Application note", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Summary: GeneSupport implements a genome-scale algorithm: Maximum\nGene-Support Tree to estimate species tree from gene trees based on multilocus\nsequences.

So far, theoretical explanations for body-size patterns in periodic\npopulation dynamics have received little attention.

The parameters in the equations were linked to\nbody mass, using a consistent set of allometric relationships that was\ncalibrated on 230 regressions. Oscillation period and amplitude predicted by\nthe models were validated with data taken from literature. Results. The\ncollected data showed that cycle times of herbivores scaled to species body\nmass with a slope up to 1/4 as expected from the models. With exception of\naquatic herbi-detritivores, intercepts were observed at the level calculated by\nthe two-species model. Remarkably, oscillation periods were size-independent\nfor predatory invertebrates, fishes, birds and mammals. Average cycles were of\n4 to 5 years, similar to those predicted by the one-species model with a\nsize-independent delay of 1 year. The consistent difference between herbivores\nand the carnivores could be explained by the models from the small parameter\nspace for consumer-resource cycles in generalist predators. As expected,\namplitudes recorded in the field did not scale to size. Observed oscillation\nperiods were generally within a factor of about 2 from the values expected from\nthe models. This demonstrates that a set of slopes and intercepts for age and\ndensity parameters applicable to a wide range of species allows a reasonable\nestimate of independently measured cycle times.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 27 Oct 2009 08:25:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-24", "authors_parsed": [["Hendriks", "A.
