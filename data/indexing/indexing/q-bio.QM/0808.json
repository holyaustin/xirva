Through a\nsystematic and consistent procedure of finding a set of parameters in the\nphysiological range we overcome an outstanding difficulty in large scale\nkinetic modeling: the requirement for a massive number of enzymatic reaction\nparameters. We are able to construct the kinetic model based on general\nbiological considerations and incomplete experimental kinetic parameters. The\nsuccess of our approach with incompletely input information is guaranteed by\ntwo known principles in biology, the robustness of the system and the\ncooperation among its various parts.

All three models are trees, as that term is\ncommonly used in mathematics; the difference between them lies in the\nbiological interpretation of their vertices and edges. Phylogenetic trees and\nHennig trees carry exactly the same information, and translation between these\ntwo kinds of trees can be accomplished by a simple algorithm. On the other\nhand, evolutionary concepts such as monophyly are represented as different\nmathematical substructures are represented differently in the two models. For\neach phylogenetic or Hennig tree, there is a Nelson cladogram carrying the same\ninformation, but the requirement that all taxa be represented by leaves\nnecessarily makes the representation less efficient. Moreover, we claim that it\nis necessary to give some interpretation to the edges and internal vertices of\na Nelson cladogram in order to make it useful as a biological model. One\npossibility is to interpret internal vertices as sets of characters and the\nedges as statements of inclusion; however, this interpretation carries little\nmore than incomplete phenetic information. We assert that from the standpoint\nof phylogenetics, one is forced to regard each internal vertex of a Nelson\ncladogram as an actual (albeit unsampled) species simply to justify the use of\nsynapomorphies rather than symplesiomorphies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Aug 2008 02:22:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["Martin", "Jeremy L.", ""], ["Wiley", "E.

The syndrome is featured by a bilateral, symmetric and\nmultisensory involvement, and by a functional depression with dynamic effects\ndependent on the neural mass lost and related to physiological laws of nervous\nexcitability. Inverted or tilted vision as well as tactile and auditive\ninversion, under minimum stimulus, appears as a stage of incomplete\nintegration, being almost corrected under higher stimulus or facilitation by\nmultisensory integration. The syndrome reveals aspects of the brain dynamics\nthat suggest a functional continuity and unity of the cortex. A functional\ngradients scheme was proposed in which the specificity of the cortex is\ndistributed with a continuous variation. This syndrome is interpreted as a\nscale reduction in the nervous excitability of the system, the different\nsensory qualities being affected allometricaly according to scaling laws. A\ncontinuity from lower to higher sensory functions was proposed. The sensory\ngrowth by an increase of the stimulus or by multisensory facilitation is found\nto follow approximately power laws, that would reflect basic laws of biological\nneural networks.

Since the former can be regarded as the basis to realize\nthe latter, playing essential roles in various cellular functions, it is\nimportant to investigate spontaneous movement quantitatively at different\nphysiological conditions in relation to cellular physiological functions. For\nthat purpose, we observed a series of spontaneous movements by Dictyostelium\ncells at different developmental periods by using a single cell tracking\nsystem. Using statistical analysis of these traced data, we found that cells\nshowed complex dynamics with anomalous diffusion and that their velocity\ndistribution had power-law tails in all conditions.
