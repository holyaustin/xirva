Current experimental methods to analyze synaptic network\nstructure on the cellular level, however, cover only small fractions of\nfunctional neuronal circuits, typically without a simultaneous record of\nneuronal spiking activity. Here we present a method for the reconstruction of\nlarge recurrent neuronal networks from thousands of parallel spike train\nrecordings. We employ maximum likelihood estimation of a generalized linear\nmodel of the spiking activity in continuous time. For this model the point\nprocess likelihood is concave, such that a global optimum of the parameters can\nbe obtained by gradient ascent. Previous methods, including those of the same\nclass, did not allow recurrent networks of that order of magnitude to be\nreconstructed due to prohibitive computational cost and numerical\ninstabilities. We describe a minimal model that is optimized for large networks\nand an efficient scheme for its parallelized numerical optimization on generic\ncomputing clusters. For a simulated balanced random network of 1000 neurons,\nsynaptic connectivity is recovered with a misclassification error rate of less\nthan 1% under ideal conditions. We show that the error rate remains low in a\nseries of example cases under progressively less ideal conditions. Finally, we\nsuccessfully reconstruct the connectivity of a hidden synfire chain that is\nembedded in a random network, which requires clustering of the network\nconnectivity to reveal the synfire groups. Our results demonstrate how synaptic\nconnectivity could potentially be inferred from large-scale parallel spike\ntrain recordings.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 18:43:58 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 11:09:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-28", "authors_parsed": [["Zaytsev", "Yury V.", ""], ["Morrison", "Abigail", ""], ["Deger", "Moritz", ""]]}, {"id": "1502.05101", "submitter": "Vladimir Gavrikov", "authors": "Vladimir L Gavrikov", "title": "Whether relative respiration in trees can be constant: a discussion of a\n  scaling hypothesis", "comments": "Draft manuscript", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Respiration measurements of whole tree plants have been reported that give\nevidence that the relative per volume/mass unit respiration decreases with\nincrease of tree body size.

Here we present a method of quantifying the escape\ntrajectories of individual animals using a path complexity approach. When fish\n(Pseudomugil signifer) were attacked either on their own or in groups, we find\nthat an individual's path rapidly increases in entropy (our measure of\ncomplexity) following the attack. For individuals on their own, this entropy\nremains elevated (indicating a more random path) for a sustained period (10\nseconds) after the attack, whilst it falls more quickly for individuals in\ngroups. The entropy of the path is context dependent. When attacks towards\nsingle fish come from greater distances, a fish's path shows less complexity\ncompared to attacks that come from short range. This context dependency effect\ndid not exist, however, when individuals were in groups. Nor did the path\ncomplexity of individuals in groups depend on a fish's local density of\nneighbours. We separate out the components of speed and direction changes to\ndetermine which of these components contributes to the overall increase in path\ncomplexity following an attack. We found that both speed and direction measures\ncontribute similarly to an individual's path's complexity in absolute terms.\nOur work highlights the adaptive behavioural tactics that animals use to avoid\npredators and also provides a novel method for quantifying the escape\ntrajectories of animals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 23:47:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-02", "authors_parsed": [["Herbert-Read", "James E.", ""], ["Ward", "Ashley J.

They revealed elevated choline peaks in\naddition to reduced NAA. The values of NAA to Cr ratio were determined after\nduly processing the spectroscopic data from both cases and controls. Each group\n(Cases and controls) were divided on the basis of age into two age groups:\nLesser than or equal to 40 years, and greater than 40 years. In all three\ngroups the values of the mean NAA to Cr ratio ratio was significantly (p-value\nless than 0.05) reduced in comparison to controls. An ancillary finding was the\nreduction of NAA to Cr ratio further in cases of PML. Combined use of both the\nconventional and advanced MRI sequences is advisable as spectroscopy helps in\nconfirming the diagnosis of opportunistic infection of the CNS in HIV positive\npatients.
