However, mvMSE has three drawbacks: 1) mvMSE values are either\nundefined or unreliable for short signals; 2) mvMSE is not fast enough for\nreal-time applications; and 3) the computation of mvMSE for signals with a\nlarge number of channels requires the storage of a huge number of elements.\nMethods: To deal with these problems and improve the stability of mvMSE, we\nintroduce multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE - mvMDE) as an\nextension of our recently developed MDE, to quantify the complexity of\nmultivariate time series. Results: We assess mvMDE, in comparison with mvMSE\nand multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE), on correlated and\nuncorrelated multi-channel noise signals, bivariate autoregressive processes,\nand three biomedical datasets. The results show that mvMDE takes into account\ndependencies in patterns across both the time and spatial domains. The mvMDE,\nmvMSE, and mvMFE methods are consistent in that they lead to similar\nconclusions about the underlying physiological conditions. However, the\nproposed mvMDE discriminates various physiological states of the biomedical\nrecordings better than mvMSE and mvMFE. In addition, for both the short and\nlong time series, the mvMDE-based results are noticeably more stable than the\nmvMSE- and mvMFE-based ones. Conclusion: For short multivariate time series,\nmvMDE, unlike mvMSE, does not result in undefined values. Furthermore, mvMDE is\nnoticeably faster than mvMFE and mvMSE and also needs to store a considerably\nsmaller number of elements. Significance: Due to its ability to detect\ndifferent kinds of dynamics of multivariate signals, mvMDE has great potential\nto analyse various physiological signals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 22:37:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-04-14", "authors_parsed": [["Azami", "Hamed", ""], ["Fernandez", "Alberto", ""], ["Escudero", "Javier", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.04039", "submitter": "Vladimir Golkov", "authors": "Vladimir Golkov, Marcin J.

Recently direct evolutionary coupling analysis (DCA) sheds some light\non protein contact prediction and accordingly, contact-assisted folding, but\nDCA is effective only on some very large-sized families since it uses\ninformation only in a single protein family. This paper presents a deep\ntransfer learning method that can significantly improve MP contact prediction\nby learning contact patterns and complex sequence-contact relationship from\nthousands of non-membrane proteins (non-MPs). Tested on 510 non-redundant MPs,\nour deep model (learned from only non-MPs) has top L/10 long-range contact\nprediction accuracy 0.69, better than our deep model trained by only MPs (0.63)\nand much better than a representative DCA method CCMpred (0.47) and the CASP11\nwinner MetaPSICOV (0.55). The accuracy of our deep model can be further\nimproved to 0.72 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs. When only contacts\nin transmembrane regions are evaluated, our method has top L/10 long-range\naccuracy 0.62, 0.57, and 0.53 when trained by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, by\nnon-MPs only, and by MPs only, respectively, still much better than MetaPSICOV\n(0.45) and CCMpred (0.40). All these results suggest that sequence-structure\nrelationship learned by our deep model from non-MPs generalizes well to MP\ncontact prediction. Improved contact prediction also leads to better\ncontact-assisted folding. Using only top predicted contacts as restraints, our\ndeep learning method can fold 160 and 200 of 510 MPs with TMscore>0.6 when\ntrained by non-MPs only and by a mix of non-MPs and MPs, respectively, while\nCCMpred and MetaPSICOV can do so for only 56 and 77 MPs, respectively. Our\ncontact-assisted folding also greatly outperforms homology modeling.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 13:27:22 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-05-11", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Zhen", ""], ["Wang", "Sheng", ""], ["Yu", "Yizhou", ""], ["Xu", "Jinbo", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07259", "submitter": "Ankit Gupta", "authors": "Ankit Gupta, Jan Mikelson and Mustafa Khammash", "title": "A finite state projection algorithm for the stationary solution of the\n  chemical master equation", "comments": "8 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1063/1.5006484", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM math.PR", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The chemical master equation (CME) is frequently used in systems biology to\nquantify the effects of stochastic fluctuations that arise due to biomolecular\nspecies with low copy numbers. The CME is a system of ordinary differential\nequations that describes the evolution of probability density for each\npopulation vector in the state-space of the stochastic reaction dynamics. For\nmany examples of interest, this state-space is infinite, making it difficult to\nobtain exact solutions of the CME. To deal with this problem, the Finite State\nProjection (FSP) algorithm was developed by Munsky and Khammash (Jour. Chem.\nPhys. 2006), to provide approximate solutions to the CME by truncating the\nstate-space. The FSP works well for finite time-periods but it cannot be used\nfor estimating the stationary solutions of CMEs, which are often of interest in\nsystems biology. The aim of this paper is to develop a version of FSP which we\nrefer to as the stationary FSP (sFSP) that allows one to obtain accurate\napproximations of the stationary solutions of a CME by solving a finite\nlinear-algebraic system that yields the stationary distribution of a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain over the truncated state-space. We derive bounds\nfor the approximation error incurred by sFSP and we establish that under\ncertain stability conditions, these errors can be made arbitrarily small by\nappropriately expanding the truncated state-space. We provide several examples\nto illustrate our sFSP method and demonstrate its efficiency in estimating the\nstationary distributions. In particular, we show that using a quantised tensor\ntrain (QTT) implementation of our sFSP method, problems admitting more than 100\nmillion states can be efficiently solved.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 14:41:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:56:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 15:52:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-25", "authors_parsed": [["Gupta", "Ankit", ""], ["Mikelson", "Jan", ""], ["Khammash", "Mustafa", ""]]}, {"id": "1704.07753", "submitter": "Winston Guess Mr", "authors": "W.

The experimental study\nof this phenomenon, termed dynamic disorder, has become possible due to\nadvances in single-molecule enzymology measurement techniques, through which\nthe catalytic activity of individual enzyme molecules can be tracked in time.\nThe biological role and importance of these fluctuations in a system with a\nsmall number of enzymes such as a living cell have only recently started being\nexplored. In this work, we examine a simple stochastic reaction system\nconsisting of an inflowing substrate and an enzyme with a randomly fluctuating\ncatalytic reaction rate that converts the substrate into an outflowing product.\nTo describe analytically the effect of rate fluctuations on the average\nsubstrate abundance at steady-state, we derive an explicit formula that\nconnects the relative speed of enzymatic fluctuations with the mean substrate\nlevel. We demonstrate that the relative speed of rate fluctuations can have a\ndramatic effect on the mean substrate, and lead to large positive deviations\nfrom predictions based on the assumption of deterministic enzyme activity. Our\nresults also establish an interesting connection between the amplification\neffect and the mixing properties of the Markov process describing the enzymatic\nactivity fluctuations, which can be used to easily predict the fluctuation\nspeed above which such deviations become negligible. As the techniques of\nsingle-molecule enzymology continuously evolve, it may soon be possible to\nstudy the stochastic phenomena due to enzymatic activity fluctuations within\nliving cells.
