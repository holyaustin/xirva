In this work, we develop modeling and numerical schemes for\nparticle-based reaction-diffusion in an open setting, where the reservoirs are\nmediated by reaction-diffusion PDEs. We derive two important theoretical\nresults. The first one is the mean-field for open systems of diffusing\nparticles; the second one is the mean-field for a particle-based\nreaction-diffusion system with second-order reactions. We employ these two\nresults to develop a numerical scheme that consistently couples particle-based\nreaction-diffusion processes with reaction-diffusion PDEs.

Adaptations to drainage\nregimes are one of the most promising options for methane mitigation in rice\nproduction. Whereas several studies have focused on mid-season drainage (MD) to\nmitigate GHG emissions, early-season drainage (ED) varying in timing and\nduration has not been extensively studied. However, such ED periods could\npotentially be very effective since initial available Carbon levels (and\nthereby the potential for methanogenesis) can be very high in paddy systems\nwith rice straw incorporation. This study tested the effectiveness of seven\ndrainage regimes varying in their timing and duration (combinations of ED and\nMD) to mitigate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a 101-day\ngrowth chamber experiment. Emissions were considerably reduced by early-season\ndrainage compared to both conventional continuous flooding (CF) and the MD\ndrainage regime. The results suggest that ED + MD drainage may have the\npotential to reduce methane emissions and yield-scaled global warming potential\nby 85 to 90% compared to CF and by 75 to 77% compared to MD only.

In this study, 74 pre-treatment Glioblastoma MRI scans with\nPsP (33) and tumor recurrence (41) were analyzed. First, enhancing lesion on\nGd-T1w MRI and peri-lesional hyperintensities on T2w/FLAIR were segmented by\nexperts and then registered to a brain atlas. Using patients from the two\nphenotypes, we construct two atlases by quantifying frequency of occurrence of\nenhancing lesion and peri-lesion hyperintensities, by averaging voxel\nintensities across the population. Analysis of differential involvement was\nthen performed to compute voxel-wise significant differences (p-value<0.05)\nacross the atlases. Statistically significant clusters were finally mapped to a\nstructural atlas to provide anatomic localization of their location. Our\nresults demonstrate that patients with tumor recurrence showed prominence of\ntheir initial tumor in the parietal lobe, while patients with PsP showed a\nmulti-focal distribution of the initial tumor in the frontal and temporal\nlobes, insula, and putamen.

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials\nmust start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that\nimproves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in\ndeath. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence\nabout clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating\nmortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in\nbetween \"cure\" and \"death\" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity\nscores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary\nmeasure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in\nrelating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes\nmeasured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An\nendpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem.\nHowever, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the\nordinal scale to a binary state of \"recovered\" vs \"not recovered.\"\n  Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for\nCOVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent\nCOVID-19 treatment trials.\n  Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time\nselected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not\nspecify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical\npower, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal\ntime.\n  Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19\nsetting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in\nadvance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may\nincrease power for interim analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 9 Jun 2020 10:34:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Dodd", "Lori E", ""], ["Follmann", "Dean", ""], ["Wang", "Jing", ""], ["Koenig", "Franz", ""], ["Korn", "Lisa L", ""], ["Schoergenhofer", "Christian", ""], ["Proschan", "Michael", ""], ["Hunsberger", "Sally", ""], ["Bonnett", "Tyler", ""], ["Makowski", "Mat", ""], ["Belhadi", "Drifa", ""], ["Wang", "Yeming", ""], ["Cao", "Bin", ""], ["Mentre", "France", ""], ["Jaki", "Thomas", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.10613", "submitter": "Anatoly Kolomeisky", "authors": "Golan Bel, Anton Zilman and Anatoly B.

But the presence of other exits\ninfluences the statistical properties and dynamics measured at any specific\nexit. Here, we present theoretical arguments to explicitly show the existence\nof different time scales, such as mean exit times and inverse exit fluxes, for\ndynamic processes with multiple exits. This implies that the statistics of any\nspecific exit dynamics cannot be considered without taking into account the\npresence of other exits. Several illustrative examples are described in detail\nusing analytical calculations, mean-field estimates, and kinetic Monte Carlo\ncomputer simulations. The underlying microscopic mechanisms for the existence\nof different time scales are discussed.

Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex\n3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways.

Kinetic energy fluctuation from\noscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one\nbasin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards\nlower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of\nnear-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for\nmulti-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from\nfirst principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of\nmulti-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain.

Methods: Participants were imaged with 4.5X4.5-mm volumetric disc\nscans using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The normalized\nNFL reflectance map was processed by an azimuthal filter to reduce directional\nreflectance bias due to variation of beam incidence angle. The peripapillary\narea of the map was divided into 160 superpixels. Average reflectance was the\nmean of superpixel reflectance. Low-reflectance superpixels were identified as\nthose with NFL reflectance below the 5 percentile normative cutoff. Focal\nreflectance loss was measure by summing loss in low-reflectance superpixels.\nResults: Thirty-five normal, 30 pre-perimetric and 35 perimetric glaucoma\nparticipants were enrolled. Azimuthal filtering improved the repeatability of\nthe normalized NFL reflectance, as measured by the pooled superpixel standard\ndeviation (SD), from 0.73 to 0.57 dB (p<0.001, paired t-test) and reduced the\npopulation SD from 2.14 to 1.78 dB (p<0.001, t-test). Most glaucomatous\nreflectance maps showed characteristic patterns of contiguous wedge or diffuse\ndefects. Focal NFL reflectance loss had significantly higher diagnostic\nsensitivity than the best NFL thickness parameter (overall, inferior, or focal\nloss volume): 53% v. 23% (p=0.027) in PPG eyes and 100% v. 80% (p=0.023) in PG\neyes, with the specificity fixed at 99%. Conclusions: Azimuthal filtering\nreduces the variability of NFL reflectance measurements. Focal NFL reflectance\nloss has excellent glaucoma diagnostic accuracy compared to the standard NFL\nthickness parameters. The reflectance map may be useful for localizing NFL\ndefects.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:22:18 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-25", "authors_parsed": [["Tan", "Ou", ""], ["Liu", "Liang", ""], ["You", "Qisheng", ""], ["Wang", "Jie", ""], ["Chen", "Aiyin", ""], ["Ing", "Eliesa", ""], ["Morrison", "John C.", ""], ["Jia", "Yali", ""], ["Huang", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.13798", "submitter": "Loic Le Folgoc", "authors": "L.

A dynamic response range of 50 fM-2 nM for HIV-1\ngene detection can be achieved through this multi-cycled G-triplex machine, and\nbenefit from the high efficiency amplification strategy, enzymatic reaction can\nbe completed within 45 minutes followed by fluorescence measurement. In\naddition, analysis of other targets can be achieved by replacing the template\nsequence. Thus there is a certain application potential for trace biomarker\nanalysis in this strategy.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Jun 2020 09:14:10 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Duan", "Qiuyue", ""], ["Yan", "Qi", ""], ["Huang", "Yuqi", ""], ["Zhang", "Wenxiu", ""], ["Zhao", "Shuhui", ""], ["Yi", "Gang", ""]]}, {"id": "2006.15706", "submitter": "Rudy Kusdiantara", "authors": "H.

First, they show that standard autoregressive linear\nmodels are outclassed by kernel-based non-linear ones and neural networks. In\nparticular, the support vector regression model stands out, being at the same\ntime one of the most accurate and clinically acceptable model. Finally, the\nrelative performances of the models are the same for both datasets.
