They are known to\nplay an important role in several biological processes and, together with\ntranscription factors, form a complex and highly interconnected regulatory\nnetwork. Looking at the structure of this network it is possible to recognize a\nfew overrepresented motifs which are expected to perform important elementary\nregulatory functions. Among them a special role is played by the\nmicroRNA-mediated feedforward loop in which a master transcription factor\nregulates a microRNA and, together with it, a set of target genes. In this\npaper we show analytically and through simulations that the incoherent version\nof this motif can couple the fine-tuning of a target protein level with an\nefficient noise control, thus conferring precision and stability to the overall\ngene expression program, especially in the presence of fluctuations in upstream\nregulators. Among the other results, a nontrivial prediction of our model is\nthat the optimal attenuation of fluctuations coincides with a modest repression\nof the target expression. This feature is coherent with the expected\nfine-tuning function and in agreement with experimental observations of the\nactual impact of a wide class of microRNAs on the protein output of their\ntargets. Finally we describe the impact on noise-buffering efficiency of the\ncross-talk between microRNA targets that can naturally arise if the\nmicroRNA-mediated circuit is not considered as isolated, but embedded in a\nlarger network of regulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 2 Apr 2010 13:48:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Sep 2011 14:09:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Osella", "Matteo", ""], ["Bosia", "Carla", ""], ["Cora'", "Davide", ""], ["Caselle", "Michele", ""]]}, {"id": "1004.1234", "submitter": "Max Little", "authors": "Max A.

In this paper, we have proposed methods to\nreduce the time and cost for the manufacture of the customized multiple arrays.\nWe have first introduced a heuristic algorithm for the mask decomposition\nproblem for multiple arrays. Then a streamline method is proposed for the\nintegration of different steps of manufacture on a higher level. Experiments\nshow that our methods are very effective in reduction of the time and cost of\nmanufacture of multiple arrays.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 02:27:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-05-03", "authors_parsed": [["Ning", "Kang", ""]]}]
