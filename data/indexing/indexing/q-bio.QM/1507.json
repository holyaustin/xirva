The term classical tomography is used, when the\nimaging beam travels in straight lines through the object. This assumption is\nvalid for light with short wavelengths, for example in x-ray tomography. For\nclassical tomography, a commonly used reconstruction method is the filtered\nback-projection algorithm which yields fast and stable object reconstructions.\nIn the context of single-cell imaging, the back-projection algorithm has been\nused to investigate the cell structure or to quantify the refractive index\ndistribution within single cells using light from the visible spectrum.\nNevertheless, these approaches, commonly summarized as optical projection\ntomography, do not take into account diffraction. Diffraction tomography with\nthe Rytov approximation resolves this issue. The explicit incorporation of the\nwave nature of light results in an enhanced reconstruction of the object's\nrefractive index distribution. Here, we present a full literature review of\ndiffraction tomography. We derive the theory starting from the wave equation\nand discuss its validity with the focus on applications for refractive index\ntomography. Furthermore, we derive the back-propagation algorithm, the\ndiffraction-tomographic pendant to the back-projection algorithm, and describe\nits implementation in three dimensions. Finally, we showcase the application of\nthe back-propagation algorithm to computer-generated scattering data.

Recorded\nvocalizations of these animals were collected and processed using several known\nsignal processing techniques to convert the respective sounds into computable\nbioacoustics values. The converted values of the vocalizations, together with\nthe breed or species identifications, were used to train the ANNs following a\nten-fold cross validation technique.

After explaining that the IPR plays\na crucial role as a central regulator in calcium dynamics, several sources of\nrelevant experimental data are introduced. Single ion channels are best studied\nby recording single-channel currents under different ligand concentrations via\nthe patch-clamp technique. The particular relevance of modal gating, the\nspontaneous switching between different levels of channel activity that occur\neven at constant ligand concentrations, is highlighted. In order to investigate\nthe interactions of IPRs, calcium release from small clusters of channels,\nso-called calcium puffs, can be used. We then present the mathematical\nframework common to all models based on single-channel data, aggregated\ncontinuous-time Markov models, and give a short review of statistical\napproaches for parameterising these models with experimental data. The process\nof building a Markov model that integrates various sources of experimental data\nis illustrated using two recent examples, the model by Ullah et al. and the\n\"Park-Drive\" model by Siekmann et al., the only models that account for all\nsources of data currently available. Finally, it is demonstrated that the\nessential features of the Park-Drive model in different models of calcium\ndynamics are preserved after reducing it to a two-state model that only\naccounts for the switching between the inactive \"park\" and the active \"drive\"\nmode. This highlights the fact that modal gating is the most important\nmechanism of ligand regulation in the IPR. It also emphasises that data-driven\nmodels of ion channels do not necessarily have to lead to detailed models but\ncan be constructed so that relevant data is selected to represent ion channels\nat the appropriate level of complexity for a given application.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 05:13:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-07-23", "authors_parsed": [["Siekmann", "Ivo", ""], ["Cao", "Pengxing", ""], ["Sneyd", "James", ""], ["Crampin", "Edmund J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1507.07039", "submitter": "Kimberly Glass", "authors": "Kimberly Glass, John Quackenbush, Jeremy Kepner", "title": "High Performance Computing of Gene Regulatory Networks using a\n  Message-Passing Model", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1109/HPEC.2015.7322475", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gene regulatory network reconstruction is a fundamental problem in\ncomputational biology.

While not universal, scaling relationships with\nexponents that are close to multiples of 1/4 are common and have been described\nin all major clades. Foremost among these relationships is the 3/4 scaling of\nmetabolism with mass which underpins the 1/4 power dependence of biological\nrates and times. Several models have been advanced to explain the underlying\nmechanistic drivers of such patterns, but questions regarding a disconnect\nbetween model structures and empirical data have limited their widespread\nacceptance. Notable among these is a fractal branching model which predicts\npower law scaling of both metabolism and physical dimensions. While a power law\nis a useful first approximation to many datasets, non-linearity in some large\ndata compilations suggest the possibility of more complex or alternative\nmechanisms. Here, we first show that quarter power scaling can be derived using\nonly the preservation of volume flow rate and velocity as model constraints.\nApplying our model to the specific case of land plants, we show that\nincorporating biomechanical principles and allowing different parts of plant\nbranching networks to be optimized to serve different functions predicts\nnon-linearity in allometric relationships, and helps explain why interspecific\nscaling exponents covary along a fractal continuum. We also demonstrate that\nwhile branching may be a stochastic process, due to the conservation of volume,\ndata may still be consistent with the expectations for a fractal network when\none examines subtrees within a tree. Data from numerous sources at the level of\nplant shoots, stems, petioles, and leaves show strong agreement with our model\npredictions.

Complex, multi-factorial models are commonly used to study\nmorphogenesis.

In this paper, we introduce a\nworkflow for a global sensitivity analysis approach to study the impact of\nsingle parameters and the interactions between them on the output of\nmorphogenesis models. To demonstrate the workflow, we used a published,\nwell-studied model of vascular morphogenesis. The parameters of the model\nrepresent cell properties and behaviors that drive the mechanisms of angiogenic\nsprouting. The global sensitivity analysis correctly identified the dominant\nparameters in the model, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, the\nanalysis provides information on the relative impact of single parameters and\nof interactions between them. The uncertainty in the output of the model was\nlargely caused by single parameters. The parameter interactions, although of\nlow impact, provided new insights in the mechanisms of \\emph{in silico}\nsprouting. Finally, the analysis indicated that the model could be reduced by\none parameter. We propose global sensitivity analysis as an alternative\napproach to study and validate the mechanisms of morphogenesis. Comparison of\nthe ranking of the impact of the model parameters to knowledge derived from\nexperimental data and validation of manipulation experiments can help to\nfalsify models and to find the operand mechanisms in morphogenesis.
