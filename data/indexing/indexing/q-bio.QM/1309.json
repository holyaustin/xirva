We observe that such noise can\nsimultaneously enhance sensitivities in one behavioral region while reducing\nsensitivities in another. Employing this novel phenomenon we designed three\nbiochemical signal processing modules: (a) A gene regulatory network that acts\nas a concentration detector with both enhanced amplitude and sensitivity. (b) A\nnon-cooperative positive feedback system, with a graded dose-response in the\ndeterministic case, that serves as a bistable switch due to noise-induced\nbimodality. (c) A noise-induced linear amplifier for gene regulation that\nrequires no feedback.

A\nmajor improvement of our model over extant models is that it can explain the\nlow active microbial fractions commonly observed in undisturbed soils.

All these studies were based on protein-coding genes, in\nwhich variants are also impacted by natural selection. In this study, we\nintroduce targeted sequencing data for studying recent human history with\nminimal confounding by natural selection. We sequenced loci very far from genes\nthat meet a wide array of additional criteria such that mutations in these loci\nare putatively neutral. As population structure also skews allele frequencies,\nwe sequenced a sample of relatively homogeneous ancestry by first analyzing the\npopulation structure of 9,716 European Americans. We employed very high\ncoverage sequencing to reliably call rare variants, and fit an extensive array\nof models of recent European demographic history to the site frequency\nspectrum. The best-fit model estimates ~3.4% growth per generation during the\nlast ~140 generations, resulting in a population size increase of two orders of\nmagnitude. This model fits the data very well, largely due to our observation\nthat assumptions of more ancient demography can impact estimates of recent\ngrowth. This observation and results also shed light on the discrepancy in\ndemographic estimates among recent studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 25 Sep 2013 16:01:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 15 Nov 2013 22:36:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-17", "authors_parsed": [["Gazave", "Elodie", ""], ["Ma", "Li", ""], ["Chang", "Diana", ""], ["Coventry", "Alex", ""], ["Gao", "Feng", ""], ["Muzny", "Donna", ""], ["Boerwinkle", "Eric", ""], ["Gibbs", "Richard", ""], ["Sing", "Charles F.", ""], ["Clark", "Andrew G.", ""], ["Keinan", "Alon", ""]]}, {"id": "1309.6900", "submitter": "Jomar Rabajante", "authors": "Dylan Antonio SJ.
