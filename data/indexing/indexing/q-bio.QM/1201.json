As hair bundles move, the viscous\nfriction between stereocilia and the surrounding liquid poses a fundamental\nchallenge to the ear's high sensitivity and sharp frequency selectivity. Part\nof the solution to this problem lies in the active process that uses energy for\nfrequency-selective sound amplification.

Using force measurement on a\ndynamically scaled model, finite-element analysis, analytical estimation of\nhydrodynamic forces, stochastic simulation and high-resolution interferometric\nmeasurement of hair bundles, we characterize the origin and magnitude of the\nforces between individual stereocilia during small hair-bundle deflections.

We show that in the case of a vanishing decay\nrate for the long-lasting immune response, the system exhibits the so-called\n\"bifurcations without parameters\" due to the existence of a hypersurface of\nequilibria in the phase space. When the decay rate of the long-lasting immune\nresponse is different from zero, the hypersurface of equilibria degenerates,\nand a multitude of other steady states are born, many of which are related by a\npermutation symmetry of the system. The robustness of the fully symmetric state\nof the system was investigated by means of numerical computation of transverse\nLyapunov exponents. The results of this exercise indicate that for a vanishing\ndecay of long-lasting immune response, the fully symmetric state is not robust\nin the substantial part of the parameter space, and instead all variants\ndevelop their own temporal dynamics contributing to the overall time evolution.\nAt the same time, if the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is\nincreased, the fully symmetric state can become robust provided the growth rate\nof the long-lasting immune response is rapid.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 22 Jan 2012 19:15:09 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-09-21", "authors_parsed": [["Blyuss", "K.

Data-driven models often circumvent this difficulty by using\npair correlations of the protein expression levels to produce a small numbers\n(<10) of principal components, each a linear combination of the concentrations,\nto successfully model how cells respond to different stimuli. However, it is\nnot understood if this reduction is specific to a particular biological system\nor to nature of the stimuli used in these experiments. We study temporal\nchanges in pair correlations described by the covariance matrix between\ndifferent molecular species that evolve following deterministic mass action\nkinetics in large biologically relevant reaction networks and show that this\ndramatic reduction of dimensions (from hundreds to <5) arises from the strong\ncorrelations between different species at any time and is in sensitive of the\nform of the nonlinear interactions, network architecture and values of rate\nconstants and concentrations over a wide range. We relate temporal changes in\nthe eigenvalue spectrum of the covariance matrix to low-dimensional, local\nchanges in directions of the trajectory embedded in much larger dimensions\nusing elementary differential geometry. We illustrate how to extract\nbiologically relevant insights such as identifying significant time scales and\ngroups of correlated chemical species from our analysis.

Ideally, these\nstudies can identify limitations in sound processing strategies and lead to\nimproved methods for providing sound information to cochlear implant users. To\naccomplish this, models must accurately describe auditory nerve spiking while\navoiding excessive complexity that would preclude large-scale simulations of\npopulations of auditory nerve fibers and obscure insight into the mechanisms\nthat influence neural encoding of sound information. In this spirit, we develop\na point process model of the auditory nerve that provides a compact and\naccurate description of neural responses to electric stimulation. Inspired by\nthe framework of generalized linear models, the proposed model consists of a\ncascade of linear and nonlinear stages. We show how each of these stages can be\nassociated with biophysical mechanisms and related to models of neuronal\ndynamics. Moreover, we derive a semi-analytical procedure that uniquely\ndetermines each parameter in the model on the basis of fundamental statistics\nfrom recordings of single fiber responses to electric stimulation, including\nthreshold, relative spread, jitter, and chronaxie. The model also accounts for\nrefractory and summation effects that influence the responses of auditory nerve\nfibers to high pulse rate stimulation. Throughout, we compare model predictions\nto published physiological data and explain differences in auditory nerve\nresponses to high and low pulse rate stimulation. We close by performing an\nideal observer analysis of simulated spike trains in response to sinusoidally\namplitude modulated stimuli and find that carrier pulse rate does not affect\nmodulation detection thresholds.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 26 Jan 2012 02:14:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-08-07", "authors_parsed": [["Goldwyn", "Joshua H.", ""], ["Rubinstein", "Jay T.", ""], ["Shea-Brown", "Eric", ""]]}, {"id": "1201.5893", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "A new stochastic differential equation modelling incidence and\n  prevalence with an application to systemic lupus erythematosus in England and\n  Wales, 1995", "comments": "10 pages, 6 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This article reformulates a common illness-death model in terms of a new\nsystem of stochastical differential equations (SDEs).
