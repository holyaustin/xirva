It is thus often difficult to distinguish miRNA-encoding\nsequences from other non-coding RNAs and pseudo miRNAs that have a similar\nlength, and most previous studies have recommended using precursor miRNAs\ninstead of mature miRNAs for robust detection. A great number of conventional\nmachine-learning-based classification methods have been proposed, but they\noften have the serious disadvantage of requiring manual feature engineering,\nand their performance is limited as well. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmiRNA precursor prediction algorithm, deepMiRGene, based on recurrent neural\nnetworks, specifically long short-term memory networks. deepMiRGene\nautomatically learns suitable features from the data themselves without manual\nfeature engineering and constructs a model that can successfully reflect\nstructural characteristics of precursor miRNAs.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying biological systems, and\nultimately, predicting their behaviours in a changing environment requires\novercoming the gap between mathematical models and experimental or\nobservational data. Differential equations (DEs) are commonly used to model the\ntemporal evolution of biological systems, but statistical methods for comparing\nDE models to data and for parameter inference are relatively poorly developed.\nThis is especially problematic in the context of biological systems where\nobservations are often noisy and only a small number of time points may be\navailable. 2. The Bayesian approach offers a coherent framework for parameter\ninference that can account for multiple sources of uncertainty, while making\nuse of prior information. It offers a rigorous methodology for parameter\ninference, as well as modelling the link between unobservable model states and\nparameters, and observable quantities. 3. We present deBInfer, a package for\nthe statistical computing environment R, implementing a Bayesian framework for\nparameter inference in DEs. deBInfer provides templates for the DE model, the\nobservation model and data likelihood, and the model parameters and their prior\ndistributions. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure processes these\ninputs to estimate the posterior distributions of the parameters and any\nderived quantities, including the model trajectories. Further functionality is\nprovided to facilitate MCMC diagnostics, the visualisation of the posterior\ndistributions of model parameters and trajectories, and the use of compiled DE\nmodels for improved computational performance. 4.

Automatically\nregistering CLARITY images to a pre-annotated brain atlas offers a solution,\nbut is difficult for several reasons. Removal of the brain from the skull and\nsubsequent storage and processing cause variable non-rigid deformations, thus\ncompounding inter-subject anatomical variability.

In their human infectious stage, immature, submillimetre-scale forms\nof the parasite known as cercariae swim in freshwater and infect humans by\npenetrating through the skin. This infection causes Schistosomiasis, a\nparasitic disease that is comparable to malaria in its global socio-economic\nimpact. Given that cercariae do not feed and hence have a finite lifetime of\naround 12 hours, efficient motility is crucial for the parasite's survival and\ntransmission of Schistosomiasis. However, a first-principles understanding of\nhow cercariae swim is lacking. Via a combined experimental, theoretical and\nrobotics based approach, we demonstrate that cercariae propel themselves\nagainst gravity by exploiting a unique elastohydrodynamic coupling. We show\nthat cercariae beat their tail in a periodic fashion while maintaining a fixed\nflexibility near their posterior and anterior ends. The flexibility in these\nregions allows an interaction between the fluid drag and bending resistance: an\nelastohydrodynamic coupling, to naturally break time-reversal symmetry and\nenable locomotion at small length-scales.

We further\nvalidate our results experimentally through a macro-scale robotic realization\nof the 'T-swimmer', explaining the unique forked-tail geometry of cercariae.\nFinally, we find that cercariae maintain the flexibility at their posterior and\nanterior ends at an optimal regime for efficient swimming, as predicted by our\ntheoretical model.

During metaphase in the early C. elegans embryo, the spindle\nis aligned and centered on the anterior-posterior axis by a\nmicrotubule-dependent machinery that exerts restoring forces when the spindle\nis displaced from the center. To investigate the accuracy and stability of\ncentering, we tracked the position and orientation of the mitotic spindle\nduring the first cell division with high temporal and spatial resolution. We\nfound that the precision is remarkably high: the cell-to-cell variation in the\ntransverse position of the center of the spindle during metaphase, as measured\nby the standard deviation, was only 1.5% of the length of the short axis of the\ncell. Spindle position is also very stable: the standard deviation of the\nfluctuations in transverse spindle position during metaphase was only 0.5% of\nthe short axis of the cell. Assuming that stability is limited by fluctuations\nin the number of independent motor elements such as microtubules or dyneins\nunderlying the centering machinery, we infer that the number is on the order of\none thousand, consistent with the several thousand of astral microtubules in\nthese cells. Astral microtubules grow out from the two spindle poles, make\ncontact with the cell cortex, and then shrink back shortly thereafter. The high\nstability of centering can be accounted for quantitatively if, while making\ncontact with the cortex, the astral microtubules buckle as they exert\ncompressive, pushing forces. We thus propose that the large number of\nmicrotubules in the asters provides a highly precise mechanism for positioning\nthe spindle during metaphase while assembly is completed prior to the onset of\nanaphase.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 May 2016 15:14:23 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 13 Sep 2016 06:36:05 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-23", "authors_parsed": [["Pecreaux", "Jacques", ""], ["Redemann", "Stefanie", ""], ["Alayan", "Zahraa", ""], ["Mercat", "Benjamin", ""], ["Pastezeur", "Sylvain", ""], ["Garzon-Coral", "Carlos", ""], ["Hyman", "Anthony A.", ""], ["Howard", "Jonathon", ""]]}, {"id": "1605.07124", "submitter": "Mauricio Barahona", "authors": "Justine Dattani and Mauricio Barahona", "title": "Stochastic models of gene transcription with upstream drives: exact\n  solution and sample path characterization", "comments": "10 figures", "journal-ref": "J Roy Soc Interface 14: 20160833 (2017)", "doi": "10.1098/rsif.2016.0833", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.MN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gene transcription is a highly stochastic and dynamic process.
