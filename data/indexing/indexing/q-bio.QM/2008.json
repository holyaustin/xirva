Simple models\nare easy to infer and to sample from. In addition, model selection within the\nMCMs' class is invariant with respect to changes in the representation of the\ndata. They portray the structure of dependencies among variables in a simple\nway. They provide robust predictions on dependencies and symmetries, as\nillustrated in several examples.

Our objective\nis to design an ECG-based algorithm that predicts pulse status during\nuninterrupted CPR and evaluate its performance. Methods: We evaluated 383\npatients being treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using defibrillator\ndata. We collected paired and immediately adjacent ECG segments having an\norganized rhythm. Segments were collected during the 10s period of ongoing CPR\nprior to a pulse check, and 5s segments without CPR during the pulse check. ECG\nsegments with or without a pulse were identified by the audio annotation of a\nparamedic's pulse check findings and recorded blood pressures. We developed an\nalgorithm to predict the clinical pulse status based on the wavelet transform\nof the bandpass-filtered ECG, applying principle component analysis. We then\ntrained a linear discriminant model using 3 principle component modes.

Conclusion: A novel ECG-based algorithm demonstrates\npotential to improve resuscitation by predicting presence of a spontaneous\npulse without pausing CPR.

The time series of gait parameters are long-range\ncorrelated (statistical persistence). In contrast, when gait is synchronized\nwith external rhythmic cues, the fluctuation regime is modified to stochastic\noscillations around the target frequency (statistical anti-persistence). To\nhighlight these two fluctuation modes, the prevalent methodology is the\ndetrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The DFA outcome is the scaling exponent,\nwhich lies between 0.5 and 1 if the time series exhibit long-range\ncorrelations, and below 0.5 if the time series is anti-correlated. A\nfundamental assumption for applying DFA is that the analyzed time series\nresults from a time-invariant generating process.

However, in addition to the\nstandard classification or regression problems, in bioinformatics, we often\nneed to predict more complex structured targets, such as 2D images and 3D\nmolecular structures. The above complex prediction tasks are referred to as\nstructured prediction. Structured prediction is more complicated than the\ntraditional classification but has much broader applications, considering that\nmost of the original bioinformatics problems have complex output objects. Due\nto the properties of those structured prediction problems, such as having\nproblem-specific constraints and dependency within the labeling space, the\nstraightforward application of existing deep learning models can lead to\nunsatisfactory results. Here, we argue that the following ideas can help\nresolve structured prediction problems in bioinformatics. Firstly, we can\ncombine deep learning with other classic algorithms, such as probabilistic\ngraphical models, which model the problem structure explicitly. Secondly, we\ncan design the problem-specific deep learning architectures or methods by\nconsidering the structured labeling space and problem constraints, either\nexplicitly or implicitly. We demonstrate our ideas with six projects from four\nbioinformatics subfields, including sequencing analysis, structure prediction,\nfunction annotation, and network analysis.

In brief, we use an adiabatic\napproximation to summarise fast fluctuations in hidden neuronal states (and\ntheir expression in sensors) in terms of their second order statistics; namely,\ntheir complex cross spectra. This allows one to specify and compare models of\nslowly changing parameters (using Bayesian model reduction) that generate a\nsequence of empirical cross spectra of electrophysiological recordings.\nCrucially, we use the slow fluctuations in the spectral power of neuronal\nactivity as empirical priors on changes in synaptic parameters. This introduces\na circular causality, in which synaptic parameters underwrite fast neuronal\nactivity that, in turn, induces activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic\nparameters.

The dimensional wave speed is found to be proportional to the product\nof the square root of the diffusivity and of an increasing function of R0,\nconfirming the importance of restricting mobility in arresting the propagation\nof infection. We examine the interaction of infection waves under various\nconditions and scenarios, and extend the wave propagation analysis to 2-D\nheterogeneous systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Aug 2020 17:45:39 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 4 Dec 2020 21:03:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-12-08", "authors_parsed": [["Ramaswamy", "Harisankar", ""], ["Oberai", "Assad A", ""], ["Yortsos", "Yannis C", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13238", "submitter": "Mariam Aboian", "authors": "Marina Kazarian, Sandra Abi Fadel, Amit Mahajan, Mariam Aboian", "title": "Utilization of 3D segmentation for measurement of pediatric brain tumor\n  outcomes after treatment: review of available free tools, step-by-step\n  instructions, and applications to clinical practice", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Volumetric measurements are known to provide more information when it comes\nto segmenting tumors, in comparison to one- and two-dimensional measurements,\nand thus can lead to better informed therapy.

Due to the exponential growth of infections, many healthcare systems\nacross the world are under pressure to care for increasing amounts of at-risk\npatients. Given the high number of infected patients, identifying patients with\nthe highest mortality risk early is critical to enable effective intervention\nand optimal prioritisation of care. Here, we present the COVID-19 Early Warning\nSystem (CovEWS), a clinical risk scoring system for assessing COVID-19 related\nmortality risk. CovEWS provides continuous real-time risk scores for individual\npatients with clinically meaningful predictive performance up to 192 hours (8\ndays) in advance, and is automatically derived from patients' electronic health\nrecords (EHRs) using machine learning. We trained and evaluated CovEWS using\nde-identified data from a cohort of 66430 COVID-19 positive patients seen at\nover 69 healthcare institutions in the United States (US), Australia, Malaysia\nand India amounting to an aggregated total of over 2863 years of patient\nobservation time. On an external test cohort of 5005 patients, CovEWS predicts\nCOVID-19 related mortality from $78.8\\%$ ($95\\%$ confidence interval [CI]:\n$76.0$, $84.7\\%$) to $69.4\\%$ ($95\\%$ CI: $57.6, 75.2\\%$) specificity at a\nsensitivity greater than $95\\%$ between respectively 1 and 192 hours prior to\nobserved mortality events - significantly outperforming existing generic and\nCOVID-19 specific clinical risk scores. CovEWS could enable clinicians to\nintervene at an earlier stage, and may therefore help in preventing or\nmitigating COVID-19 related mortality.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 31 Aug 2020 08:07:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Schwab", "Patrick", ""], ["Mehrjou", "Arash", ""], ["Parbhoo", "Sonali", ""], ["Celi", "Leo Anthony", ""], ["Hetzel", "J\u00fcrgen", ""], ["Hofer", "Markus", ""], ["Sch\u00f6lkopf", "Bernhard", ""], ["Bauer", "Stefan", ""]]}, {"id": "2008.13521", "submitter": "Simon Childs", "authors": "S.

The most convenient\nexplanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic\nreproduction number, $r_{\\rm 0}$; and there certainly are arguments for this.\nOther factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to\nreconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes\nsimilar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two,\ndifferent, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of\ninfection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second\nis that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population.\nWhile it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception\nof an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two\nphenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any\nmeasure, be insignificant. It also remains an inescapable fact that the early\npeak in infections coincided with a fairly profound change in $r_{\\rm 0}$; in\nall the contemplated scenarios of data-deficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 24 Aug 2020 19:46:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2020 08:26:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 19 Feb 2021 19:00:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-02-23", "authors_parsed": [["Childs", "S.
