In simulations detecting\ndifferential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson\nmixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude\nproportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false\npositives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the\nrarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately\nclustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size\nthreshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in\npractice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling\nmicrobiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in\nedgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to\nnormalize by rarefying or crude proportions.

Understanding the mechanistic links between environment and population\nprocesses for these diseases is key to predicting the consequences of climate\nchange on transmission and for developing effective interventions. An important\nmeasure of the intensity of disease transmission is the reproductive number\n$R_0$.

Unfortunately, computational tools\ndeveloped to call variants from human sequencing data disagree on many of their\npredictions, and current methods to evaluate accuracy and computational\nperformance are ad-hoc and incomplete. Agreement on benchmarking variant\ncalling methods would stimulate development of genomic processing tools and\nfacilitate communication among researchers.\n  Results: We propose SMaSH, a benchmarking methodology for evaluating human\ngenome variant calling algorithms. We generate synthetic datasets, organize and\ninterpret a wide range of existing benchmarking data for real genomes, and\npropose a set of accuracy and computational performance metrics for evaluating\nvariant calling methods on this benchmarking data. Moreover, we illustrate the\nutility of SMaSH to evaluate the performance of some leading single nucleotide\npolymorphism (SNP), indel, and structural variant calling algorithms.\n  Availability: We provide free and open access online to the SMaSH toolkit,\nalong with detailed documentation, at smash.cs.berkeley.edu.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Oct 2013 08:09:16 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 5 Jan 2014 07:36:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-07", "authors_parsed": [["Talwalkar", "Ameet", ""], ["Liptrap", "Jesse", ""], ["Newcomb", "Julie", ""], ["Hartl", "Christopher", ""], ["Terhorst", "Jonathan", ""], ["Curtis", "Kristal", ""], ["Bresler", "Ma'ayan", ""], ["Song", "Yun S.", ""], ["Jordan", "Michael I.", ""], ["Patterson", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1310.8585", "submitter": "Slim Ouni", "authors": "Ingmar Steiner (MMCI, DFKI, Allgemeine Linguistik), Korin Richmond\n  (CSTR), Slim Ouni (INRIA Nancy - Grand Est / LORIA)", "title": "Speech animation using electromagnetic articulography as motion capture\n  data", "comments": null, "journal-ref": "AVSP - 12th International Conference on Auditory-Visual Speech\n  Processing - 2013 (2013) 55-60", "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.HC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Electromagnetic articulography (EMA) captures the position and orientation of\na number of markers, attached to the articulators, during speech.
