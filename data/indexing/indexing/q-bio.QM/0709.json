This mode of protein function assignment\nis mostly based on the detection of sequence similarity and the premise that\nfunctional properties are conserved during evolution. Most automatic approaches\ndeveloped to date rely on the identification of clusters of homologous proteins\nand the mapping of new proteins onto these clusters, which are expected to\nshare functional characteristics. RESULTS: Here, we inverse the logic of this\nprocess, by considering the mapping of sequences directly to a functional\nclassification instead of mapping functions to a sequence clustering. In this\nmode, the starting point is a database of labelled proteins according to a\nfunctional classification scheme, and the subsequent use of sequence similarity\nallows defining the membership of new proteins to these functional classes. In\nthis framework, we define the Correspondence Indicators as measures of\nrelationship between sequence and function and further formulate two Bayesian\napproaches to estimate the probability for a sequence of unknown function to\nbelong to a functional class. This approach allows the parametrisation of\ndifferent sequence search strategies and provides a direct measure of\nannotation error rates. We validate this approach with a database of enzymes\nlabelled by their corresponding four-digit EC numbers and analyse specific\ncases. CONCLUSION: The performance of this method is significantly higher than\nthe simple strategy consisting in transferring the annotation from the highest\nscoring BLAST match and is expected to find applications in automated\nfunctional annotation pipelines.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Sep 2007 15:22:08 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-09-28", "authors_parsed": [["Levy", "Emmanuel D.", "", "LMB"], ["Ouzounis", "Christos A.", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Gilks", "Walter R.", "", "Phys-ENS"], ["Audit", "Benjamin", "", "Phys-ENS"]]}]
