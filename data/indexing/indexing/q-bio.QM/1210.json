Then the relative or absolute protein abundance is estimated\nwith quantification methods, such as spectral counting. Until now, researchers\nhave been dealing with these two processes separately. In fact, they are two\nsides of same coin in the sense that truly present proteins are those proteins\nwith non-zero abundances. Then, one interesting question is if we regard the\nprotein inference problem as a special protein quantification problem, is it\npossible to achieve better protein inference performance?\n  Contribution: In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using protein\nquantification methods to solve the protein inference problem. Protein\ninference is to determine whether each candidate protein is present in the\nsample or not. Protein quantification is to calculate the abundance of each\nprotein. Naturally, the absent proteins should have zero abundances. Thus, we\nargue that the protein inference problem can be viewed as a special case of\nprotein quantification problem: present proteins are those proteins with\nnon-zero abundances. Based on this idea, our paper tries to use three very\nsimple protein quantification methods to solve the protein inference problem\neffectively.\n  Results: The experimental results on six datasets show that these three\nmethods are competitive with previous protein inference algorithms.

Our main concern is\nwith the issue of existence of (selectively) accessible paths; that is,\nmonotonic paths in the hypercube along which fitness is always increasing. Our\nmain results resolve open questions about three such models, which in the\nbiophysics literature are known as house of cards (HoC), constrained house of\ncards (CHoC) and rough Mount Fuji (RMF).

A widely used strategy in this context\nis to compare samples from several populations, and to look for genomic regions\nwith outstanding genetic differentiation between these populations. Genetic\ndifferentiation is generally based on allele frequency differences between\npopulations, which are measured by Fst or related statistics. Here we introduce\na new statistic, denoted hapFLK, which focuses instead on the differences of\nhaplotype frequencies between populations. In contrast to most existing\nstatistics, hapFLK accounts for the hierarchical structure of the sampled\npopulations. Using computer simulations, we show that each of these two\nfeatures - the use of haplotype information and of the hierarchical structure\nof populations - significantly improves the detection power of selected loci,\nand that combining them in the hapFLK statistic provides even greater power. We\nalso show that hapFLK is robust with respect to bottlenecks and migration and\nimproves over existing approaches in many situations. Finally, we apply hapFLK\nto a set of six sheep breeds from Northern Europe, and identify seven regions\nunder selection, which include already reported regions but also several new\nones. We propose a method to help identifying the population(s) under selection\nin a detected region, which reveals that in many of these regions selection\nmost likely occurred in more than one population. Furthermore, several of the\ndetected regions correspond to incomplete sweeps, where the favourable\nhaplotype is only at intermediate frequency in the population(s) under\nselection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Oct 2012 07:53:00 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-24", "authors_parsed": [["Fariello", "Mar\u00eca In\u00e8s", ""], ["Boitard", "Simon", ""], ["Naya", "Hugo", ""], ["SanCristobal", "Magali", ""], ["Servin", "Bertrand", ""]]}, {"id": "1210.7683", "submitter": "Paolo Bientinesi", "authors": "Diego Fabregat-Traver (1), Paolo Bientinesi (1), ((1) AICES, RWTH\n  Aachen)", "title": "Computing Petaflops over Terabytes of Data: The Case of Genome-Wide\n  Association Studies", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE cs.PF q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In many scientific and engineering applications, one has to solve not one but\na sequence of instances of the same problem. Often times, the problems in the\nsequence are linked in a way that allows intermediate results to be reused. A\ncharacteristic example for this class of applications is given by the\nGenome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), a widely spread tool in computational\nbiology. GWAS entails the solution of up to trillions ($10^{12}$) of correlated\ngeneralized least-squares problems, posing a daunting challenge: the\nperformance of petaflops ($10^{15}$ floating-point operations) over terabytes\nof data.\n  In this paper, we design an algorithm for performing GWAS on multi-core\narchitectures. This is accomplished in three steps. First, we show how to\nexploit the relation among successive problems, thus reducing the overall\ncomputational complexity. Then, through an analysis of the required data\ntransfers, we identify how to eliminate any overhead due to input/output\noperations. Finally, we study how to decompose computation into tasks to be\ndistributed among the available cores, to attain high performance and\nscalability. With our algorithm, a GWAS that currently requires the use of a\nsupercomputer may now be performed in matter of hours on a single multi-core\nnode.\n  The discussion centers around the methodology to develop the algorithm rather\nthan the specific application.

We present a mathematical model that aims to understand how small RNA\ncompetition for the PTR resources affects target gene repression. We discuss\nthat small RNA activity is limited by RISC-formation, RISC-degradation and the\navailability of Argonautes. Together, these observations explain a number of\nPTR saturation effects encountered experimentally. We show that different\ncompetition conditions for RISC-loading result in different signatures of PTR\nactivity determined also by the amount of RISC-recycling taking place. In\nparticular, we find that the small RNAs less efficient at RISC-formation, using\nfewer resources of the PTR pathway, can perform in the low RISC-recycling range\nequally well as their more effective counterparts. Additionally, we predict a\nnovel signature of PTR in target expression levels. Under conditions of low\nRISC-loading efficiency and high RISC-recycling, the variation in target levels\nincreases linearly with the target transcription rate. Furthermore, we show\nthat RISC-recycling determines the effect that Argonaute scarcity conditions\nhave on target expression variation.
