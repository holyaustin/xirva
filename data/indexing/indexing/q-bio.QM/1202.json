In this paper, we define the\nnotion of equivalence of gene expression and determine a `strength of evidence'\nmeasure for gene equivalence. It is common practice in genome-wide studies to\nrank genes according to observed gene-specific P-values or adjusted P-values,\nwhich are assumed to measure the strength of evidence against the null\nhypothesis of no differential gene expression. We show here, both empirically\nand formally, that the equivalence P-value does not satisfy the basic\nconsistency requirements for a valid strength of evidence measure for\nequivalence. This means that the widely-used q-value (Storey, 2002) defined for\neach gene to be the minimum positive false discovery rate that would result in\nthe inclusion of the corresponding P-value in the discovery set, cannot be\ntranslated to the equivalence testing framework. However, when represented as a\nposterior probability, we find that the q-value does satisfy some basic\nconsistency requirements needed to be a credible measure of evidence for\nequivalence. We propose a simple estimate for the q-value from posterior\nprobabilities of equivalence, and analyse data from a mouse stem cell\nmicroarray experiment which demonstrate the theory and methods presented here.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 23:10:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-02-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tuke", "J.", ""], ["Glonek", "G.
