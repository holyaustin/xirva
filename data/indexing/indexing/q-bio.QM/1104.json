We find that colored motifs can be viewed as the building blocks of\nthe networks (much more so than the uncolored structural motifs can be) and\nthat the relative frequency with which these motifs appear in the network can\nbe used to define the information content of the network. This information is\ndefined in such a way that a network with random coloration (but keeping the\nrelative number of nodes with different colors the same) has zero color\ninformation content. Thus, colored motif information captures the\nexceptionality of coloring in the motifs that is maintained via selection. We\nstudy the motif information content of the C. elegans brain as well as the\nevolution of colored motif information in networks that reflect the interaction\nbetween instructions in genomes of digital life organisms. While we find that\ncolored motif information appears to capture essential functionality in the C.\nelegans brain (where the color assignment of nodes is straightforward) it is\nnot obvious whether the colored motif information content always increases\nduring evolution, as would be expected from a measure that captures network\ncomplexity. For a single choice of color assignment of instructions in the\ndigital life form Avida, we find rather that colored motif information content\nincreases or decreases during evolution, depending on how the genomes are\norganized, and therefore could be an interesting tool to dissect genomic\nrearrangements.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Mar 2011 20:35:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-11-08", "authors_parsed": [["Adami", "Christoph", ""], ["Qian", "Jifeng", ""], ["Rupp", "Matthew", ""], ["Hintze", "Arend", ""]]}, {"id": "1104.0341", "submitter": "David R.

Comparison of different populations of weighted networks is hard\nbecause topology is inherently dependent on wiring cost, where cost is defined\nas the number of edges in an unweighted graph.

Our focus is on comparing populations of weighted undirected graphs\nusing global efficiency. We evaluate different approaches to the comparison of\nweighted networks that differ in mean association weight. Our key result shows\nthat integrating over cost is equivalent to controlling for any monotonic\ntransformation of the weight set of a weighted graph. That is, when integrating\nover cost, we eliminate the differences in topology that may be due to a\nmonotonic transformation of the weight set. Our result holds for any unweighted\ntopological measure. Cost-integration is therefore helpful in disentangling\ndifferences in cost from differences in topology. By contrast, we show that the\nuse of the weighted version of a topological metric does not constitute a valid\napproach to this problem. Indeed, we prove that, under mild conditions, the use\nof the weighted version of global efficiency is equivalent to simply comparing\nweighted costs. Thus, we recommend the reporting of (i) differences in weighted\ncosts and (ii) differences in cost-integrated topological measures. We\ndemonstrate the application of these techniques in a re-analysis of an fMRI\nworking memory task.

In this work we focus our attention on human contacts\nheterogeneities through two of the main individual-based models: mobile agents\nand complex networks models. We introduce a novel mobile agents model in which\nindividuals make displacements with sizes according to a truncated power-law\ndistribution based on empirical evidence about human mobility. Besides, we\npresent a procedure to obtain an equivalent weighted contact network from the\nprevious mobile agents model, where the weights of the links are interpreted as\ncontact probabilities. From the topological analysis of the equivalent contact\nnetworks we show that small world characteristics are related with truncated\npower-law distribution for agent displacements. Finally, we show the\nequivalence between both approaches through some numerical experiments for the\nspread of an infectious disease.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Apr 2011 11:45:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-04-27", "authors_parsed": [["Medus", "A.

Parameters noted as doubtful by FishBase were excluded.\nFor each species, variations in curves were noted, and the minimum and maximum\npredicted weights for a 30 cm long fish were compared with each other and with\nthe standard weight for that length. For lake trout, additional comparisons\nwere made between the parameters and study details reported in FishBase.org for\n6 of 8 length-weight relationships and those reported in the reference\n(Carlander 1969) for those 6 relationships. In all species studied, minimum and\nmaximum curves produced with the length-weight parameters at FishBase.org are\nnotably different from each other, and in many cases predict weights that are\nclearly absurd. For example, one set of parameters predicts a 30 cm rainbow\ntrout weighing 44 g. For 30 cm length, the range of weights (relative to the\nstandard weight) for each species are: channel catfish (31.4% to 193.1%), black\ncrappie (54.0% to 149.0%), largemouth bass (28.8% to 130.4%), rainbow trout\n(14.9% to 113.4%), flathead catfish (29.3% to 250.7%), and lake trout (44.0% to\n152.7%). Length-weight tables at FishBase.org are not generally reliable and\nthe on-line database contains dubious parameters.

As\nwith any other field in Systems Biology, computational tools are required to\ndeal with this ocean of data. iTRAQ (isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute\nquantification) is a technique that allows simultaneous quantification of\nproteins from multiple samples. Although iTRAQ data gives useful insights to\nthe biologist, it is more complex to perform analysis and draw biological\nconclusions because of its multi-plexed design. One such problem is to find\nproteins that behave in a similar way (i.e. change in abundance) among various\ntime points since the temporal variations in the proteomics data reveal\nimportant biological information. Distance based methods such as Euclidian\ndistance or Pearson coefficient, and clustering techniques such as k-mean etc,\nare not able to take into account the temporal information of the series. In\nthis paper, we present an linear-time algorithm for clustering similar patterns\namong various iTRAQ time course data irrespective of their absolute values. The\nalgorithm, referred to as Temporal Pattern Mining(TPM), maps the data from a\nCartesian plane to a discrete binary plane. After the mapping a dynamic\nprogramming technique allows mining of similar data elements that are\ntemporally closer to each other. The proposed algorithm accurately clusters\niTRAQ data that are temporally closer to each other with more than 99%\naccuracy. Experimental results for different problem sizes are analyzed in\nterms of quality of clusters, execution time and scalability for large data\nsets. An example from our proteomics data is provided at the end to demonstrate\nthe performance of the algorithm and its ability to cluster temporal series\nirrespective of their distance from each other.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 20:41:43 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-05-02", "authors_parsed": [["Saeed", "Fahad", ""], ["Pisitkun", "Trairak", ""], ["Knepper", "Mark A.", ""], ["Hoffert", "Jason D.", ""]]}]
