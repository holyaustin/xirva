Ecologists and social scientists have described many ways that\nindividuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this\nresearch area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter\nentering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative\ncontribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global\nbecause it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.\nFurther, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social\nscience. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists\nto use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,\nI characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic\necosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a\nsmall fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the\nsystem activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes\ngenerate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant\nnodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the\n130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary\nproducers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality\nindicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power\nconcentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these\nresults are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis\nbased on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be\nuseful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban\nmetabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Sep 2012 18:41:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1209.1341", "submitter": "Xiang Zhou", "authors": "Xiang Zhou and Peter Carbonetto and Matthew Stephens", "title": "Polygenic Modeling with Bayesian Sparse Linear Mixed Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.GN stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Both linear mixed models (LMMs) and sparse regression models are widely used\nin genetics applications, including, recently, polygenic modeling in\ngenome-wide association studies.

Due to high randomness in the individual\nbehavior of the bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is\nalmost impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of\nbacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular transmission\nand reception. This proposition enables us to form a reliable node out of many\nunreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a node sense the environment and\nrespond accordingly. In this paper, we study the communication between two\nnodes, one acting as the transmitter and the other as the receiver. We consider\nthe case in which the information is encoded in the concentration of molecules\nby the transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter\nnode propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their\nconcentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode the\ninformation. The randomness in the communication is caused by both the error in\nthe molecular production at the transmitter and the reception of molecules at\nthe receiver.

Several possible mechanisms of interactions\nbetween a virus and immune system have been analysed, with a prevailing opinion\nbeing that the onset of autoimmunity can in many cases be attributed to\n\"molecular mimicry\", where linear peptide epitopes, processed from viral\nproteins, mimic normal host self proteins, thus leading to a cross-reaction of\nimmune response against virus with host cells. In this paper we present a\nmathematical model for the dynamics of an immune response to a viral infection\nand autoimmunity, which takes into account T cells with different activation\nthresholds.
