However most gene circuits in a\ncell are under control of external signals and thus quantitative agreement\nbetween experimental data and a mathematical model is difficult. Circadian\nbiology has been one notable exception: quantitative models of the internal\nclock that orchestrates biological processes over the 24-hour diurnal cycle\nhave been constructed for a few organisms, from cyanobacteria to plants and\nmammals. In most cases, a complex architecture with interlocked feedback loops\nhas been evidenced. Here we present first modeling results for the circadian\nclock of the green unicellular alga Ostreococcus tauri. Two plant-like clock\ngenes have been shown to play a central role in Ostreococcus clock. We find\nthat their expression time profiles can be accurately reproduced by a minimal\nmodel of a two-gene transcriptional feedback loop. Remarkably, best adjustment\nof data recorded under light/dark alternation is obtained when assuming that\nthe oscillator is not coupled to the diurnal cycle. This suggests that coupling\nto light is confined to specific time intervals and has no dynamical effect\nwhen the oscillator is entrained by the diurnal cycle. This intringuing\nproperty may reflect a strategy to minimize the impact of fluctuations in\ndaylight intensity on the core circadian oscillator, a type of perturbation\nthat has been rarely considered when assessing the robustness of circadian\nclocks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 28 Jan 2010 20:07:24 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 29 Jan 2010 06:31:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 16 Jul 2010 07:20:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-12-10", "authors_parsed": [["Thommen", "Quentin", "", "PhLAM"], ["Pfeuty", "Benjamin", "", "PhLAM"], ["Morant", "Pierre-Emmanuel", "", "PhLAM"], ["Corellou", "Florence", "", "PhLAM"], ["Bouget", "Fran\u00e7ois-Yves", "", "PhLAM"], ["Lefranc", "Marc", "", "PhLAM"]]}, {"id": "1001.5420", "submitter": "Dhagash Mehta", "authors": "William Hanan, Dhagash Mehta, Guillaume Moroz, Sepanda Pouryahya", "title": "Stability and Bifurcation Analysis of Coupled Fitzhugh-Nagumo\n  Oscillators", "comments": "\"Extended abstract\" published in the Joint Conference of ASCM2009 and\n  MACIS2009, Japan, 2009", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.NC cs.SC nlin.CD q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Neurons are the central biological objects in understanding how the brain\nworks.
