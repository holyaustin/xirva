It has been shown that the combinatorial logic of such\nnetworks can be captured in many cases by special functions called nested\ncanalyzing in the context of discrete dynamic network models. It was also shown\nthat the dynamics of networks constructed from such functions has very special\nproperties that are consistent with what is known about molecular networks, and\nthat simplify analysis. It is important to know how restrictive this class of\nfunctions is, for instance for the purpose of network reverse-engineering. This\npaper contains a formula for the number of such functions and a comparison to\nthe class of all functions. In particular, it is shown that, as the number of\nvariables becomes large, the ratio of the number of nested canalyzing functions\nto the number of all functions converges to zero. This shows that the class of\nnested canalyzing functions is indeed very restrictive, indicating that\nmolecular networks have very special properties. The principal tool used for\nthis investigation is a description of these functions as polynomials and a\nparameterization of the class of all such polynomials in terms of relations on\ntheir coefficients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Jul 2011 22:01:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 7 Aug 2011 00:08:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-01-18", "authors_parsed": [["Murrugarra", "David", ""], ["Laubenbacher", "Reinhard", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.1772", "submitter": "Alain Rapaport", "authors": "Ihab Haidar (MISTEA), Fr\\'ed\\'eric G\\'erard (Eco\\&Sols), Alain\n  Rapaport (MISTEA, INRIA Sophia Antipolis)", "title": "Comparison of numerical simulations of reactive transport and\n  chemostat-like models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS physics.geo-ph q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The objective of the paper is to evaluate the ability of reactive transport\nmodels and their numerical implementations (such as MIN3P) to simulate simple\nmicrobial transformations in conditions of chemostat or gradostat models, that\nare popular in microbial ecology and waste treatment ecosystems.

Moreover, their space and time resolution are limited, so that\ndata is not explicit at the person-to-person level, and the dynamical aspect of\nthe contacts is disregarded. Here, we want to assess the role of data-driven\ndynamic contact patterns among individuals, and in particular of their temporal\naspects, in shaping the spread of a simulated epidemic in the population.\n  We consider high resolution data of face-to-face interactions between the\nattendees of a conference, obtained from the deployment of an infrastructure\nbased on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices that assess mutual\nface-to-face proximity. The spread of epidemics along these interactions is\nsimulated through an SEIR model, using both the dynamical network of contacts\ndefined by the collected data, and two aggregated versions of such network, in\norder to assess the role of the data temporal aspects.\n  We show that, on the timescales considered, an aggregated network taking into\naccount the daily duration of contacts is a good approximation to the full\nresolution network, whereas a homogeneous representation which retains only the\ntopology of the contact network fails in reproducing the size of the epidemic.\n  These results have important implications in understanding the level of\ndetail needed to correctly inform computational models for the study and\nmanagement of real epidemics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 24 Aug 2011 13:52:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-25", "authors_parsed": [["Stehl\u00e9", "Juliette", ""], ["Voirin", "Nicolas", ""], ["Barrat", "Alain", ""], ["Cattuto", "Ciro", ""], ["Colizza", "Vittoria", ""], ["Isella", "Lorenzo", ""], ["R\u00e9gis", "Corinne", ""], ["Pinton", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois", ""], ["Khanafer", "Nagham", ""], ["Broeck", "Wouter Van den", ""], ["Vanhems", "Philippe", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.4936", "submitter": "Efraim Feinstein", "authors": "Julea Vlassakis, Efraim Feinstein, Darren Yang, Antoine Tilloy,\n  Dominic Weiller, Julian Kates-Harbeck, Vincent Coljee and Mara Prentiss", "title": "The Tension on dsDNA Bound to ssDNA/RecA Filaments May Play an Important\n  Role in Driving Efficient and Accurate Homology Recognition and Strand\n  Exchange", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1103/PhysRevE.87.032702", "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.BM q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "abstract": "  It is well known that during homology recognition and strand exchange the\ndouble stranded DNA (dsDNA) in DNA/RecA filaments is highly extended, but the\nfunctional role of the extension has been unclear.

The model suggests that the binding of additional dsDNA base\npairs to the DNA/RecA filament alters the tension in dsDNA that was already\nbound to the filament, resulting in a non-linear increase in the mechanical\nenergy as a function of the number of bound base pairs.

Motifs are biological patterns of great interest to\nbiologists. Many different versions of the motif finding problem have been\nidentified by researchers. Examples include the Planted $(l, d)$ Motif version,\nthose based on position-specific score matrices, etc. A comparative study of\nthe various motif search algorithms is very important for several reasons. For\nexample, we could identify the strengths and weaknesses of each. As a result,\nwe might be able to devise hybrids that will perform better than the individual\ncomponents. In this paper we (either directly or indirectly) compare the\nperformance of PMSprune (an algorithm based on the $(l, d)$ motif model) and\nseveral other algorithms in terms of seven measures and using well established\nbenchmarks\n  In this paper, we (directly or indirectly) compare the quality of motifs\npredicted by PMSprune and 14 other algorithms. We have employed several\nbenchmark datasets including the one used by Tompa, et.al. These comparisons\nshow that the performance of PMSprune is competitive when compared to the other\n14 algorithms tested.\n  We have compared (directly or indirectly) the performance of PMSprune and 14\nother algorithms using the Benchmark dataset provided by Tompa, et.al. It is\nobserved that both PMSprune and DME (an algorithm based on position-specific\nscore matrices) in general perform better than the 13 algorithms reported in\nTompa et. al.. Subsequently we have compared PMSprune and DME on other\nbenchmark data sets including ChIP-Chip, ChIP-seq, and ABS. Between PMSprune\nand DME, PMSprune performs better than DME on six measures. DME performs better\nthan PMSprune on one measure (namely, specificity).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Aug 2011 00:26:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Sharma", "Dolly", ""], ["Rajasekaran", "Sanguthevar", ""], ["Dinh", "Hieu", ""]]}, {"id": "1108.5397", "submitter": "Charles Bergeron PhD", "authors": "Charles Bergeron, Theresa Hepburn, C.
