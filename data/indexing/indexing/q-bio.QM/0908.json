To understand these\ncomplex displays both empirical data and models are needed. Whereas detailed\nempirical data were recently collected through video recordings and position\nmeasurements by stereo photography of flocks of thousands of starlings, there\nare as yet no models that generate these complex patterns. Numerous computer\nmodels in biology, however, suggest that patterns of single groups of moving\nanimals may emerge by self-organisation from movement and local coordination\n(through attraction, alignment and avoidance of collision). In this paper, we\ninvestigated whether this approach can be extended to generate patterns\nresembling these aerial displays of starlings. We show in a model that to\ngenerate many of the patterns measured empirically in real starlings we have to\nextend the usual rules of local coordination with specifics of starling\nbehaviour, mainly 1) their aerial locomotion, 2) a low and constant number of\ninteraction-partners and 3) preferential movement above a roosting area. Our\nmodel can be used as a tool for the study of these displays, because it\nprovides new integrative hypotheses about the mechanisms underlying these\ndisplays and of swarming patterns in biological systems in general.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2009 05:32:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-08-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hildenbrandt", "H.", ""], ["Carere", "C.", ""], ["Hemelrijk", "C-K.", ""]]}, {"id": "0908.2778", "submitter": "Leah R.
