Although nearly all recent studies supported the existence\nof fragile regions in mammalian genomes, the most comprehensive phylogenomic\nstudy of mammals (Ma et al. (2006) Genome Research 16, 1557-1565) raised some\ndoubts about their existence. We demonstrate that fragile regions are subject\nto a \"birth and death\" process, implying that fragility has limited\nevolutionary lifespan. This finding implies that fragile regions migrate to\ndifferent locations in different mammals, explaining why there exist only a few\nchromosomal breakpoints shared between different lineages. The birth and death\nof fragile regions phenomenon reinforces the hypothesis that rearrangements are\npromoted by matching segmental duplications and suggests putative locations of\nthe currently active fragile regions in the human genome.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 31 Oct 2010 20:02:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-11-02", "authors_parsed": [["Alekseyev", "Max A.", ""], ["Pevzner", "Pavel A.", ""]]}, {"id": "1011.0241", "submitter": "Christopher Hillar", "authors": "Guy Isely, Christopher J.
