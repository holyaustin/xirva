However, due to the complex internal structure of\nthe scaffolds, whole scaffold calculations of the local shear forces are\ncomputationally-intensive. Instead, representative volume elements (RVEs),\nwhich are obtained by extracting smaller portions of the scaffold, are commonly\nused in literature without a numerical accuracy standard. Hence, the goal of\nthis study is to examine how closely the whole scaffold simulations are\napproximated by the two types of boundary conditions used to enable the RVEs:\n\"wall boundary condition\" (WBC) and \"periodic boundary condition\" (PBC). To\nthat end, Lattice-Boltzmann Method fluid dynamics simulations were used to\nmodel the surface shear stresses in 3D scaffold reconstructions, obtained from\nhigh resolution microcomputed tomography images. It was found that despite the\nRVEs being sufficiently larger than 6 times the scaffold pore size (which is\nthe only accuracy guideline found in literature), the stresses were still\nsignificantly under-predicted by both types of boundary conditions: between 20\nand 80% average error, depending on the scaffold's porosity. Moreover, it was\nfound that the error grew with higher porosity. This is likely due to the small\npores dominating the flow field, and thereby negating the effects of the\nunrealistic boundary conditions, when the scaffold porosity is small. Finally,\nit was found that the PBC was always more accurate and computationally\nefficient than the WBC. Therefore, it is the recommended type of RVE. Overall,\nthis work provides a previously-unavailable guidance to researchers regarding\nthe best choice of boundary conditions for RVE simulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 1 Mar 2018 21:19:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Kadri", "Olufemi E.", ""], ["Williams", "Cortes", "III"], ["Sikavitsas", "Vassilios", ""], ["Voronov", "Roman S.", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.00905", "submitter": "V\\'ictor J.

However,\nassessing the performance of such generative models is notoriously difficult.\nMetrics that are typically used to assess the performance of such generative\nmodels are the percentage of chemically valid molecules or the similarity to\nreal molecules in terms of particular descriptors, such as the partition\ncoefficient (logP) or druglikeness. However, method comparison is difficult\nbecause of the inconsistent use of evaluation metrics, the necessity for\nmultiple metrics, and the fact that some of these measures can easily be\ntricked by simple rule-based systems. We propose a novel distance measure\nbetween two sets of molecules, called Fr\\'echet ChemNet distance (FCD), that\ncan be used as an evaluation metric for generative models. The FCD is similar\nto a recently established performance metric for comparing image generation\nmethods, the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID). Whereas the FID uses one of\nthe hidden layers of InceptionNet, the FCD utilizes the penultimate layer of a\ndeep neural network called ChemNet, which was trained to predict drug\nactivities. Thus, the FCD metric takes into account chemically and biologically\nrelevant information about molecules, and also measures the diversity of the\nset via the distribution of generated molecules. The FCD's advantage over\nprevious metrics is that it can detect if generated molecules are a) diverse\nand have similar b) chemical and c) biological properties as real molecules.

Most\nexisting CNN-based methods treat segmentation as a pixel-wise classification\nproblem. However, three unique problems of cell images adversely affect\nsegmentation accuracy: lack of established training dataset, few pixels on cell\nboundaries, and ubiquitous blurry features. The problem becomes especially\nsevere with densely packed cells, where a pixel-wise classification method\ntends to identify two neighboring cells with blurry shared boundary as one\ncell, leading to poor cell count accuracy and affecting subsequent analysis.\nHere we developed a different learning strategy that combines strengths of CNN\nand watershed algorithm. The method first trains a CNN to learn Euclidean\ndistance transform of binary masks corresponding to the input images. Then\nanother CNN is trained to detect individual cells in the Euclidean distance\ntransform. In the third step, the watershed algorithm takes the outputs from\nthe previous steps as inputs and performs the segmentation. We tested the\ncombined method and various forms of the pixel-wise classification algorithm on\nsegmenting fluorescence and transmitted light images. The new method achieves\nsimilar pixel accuracy but significant higher cell count accuracy than\npixel-wise classification methods do, and the advantage is most obvious when\napplying on noisy images of densely packed cells.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Mar 2018 19:54:13 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Apr 2019 15:13:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-24", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Weikang", ""], ["Taft", "David A.", ""], ["Chen", "Yi-Jiun", ""], ["Zhang", "Jingyu", ""], ["Wallace", "Callen T.", ""], ["Xu", "Min", ""], ["Watkins", "Simon C.", ""], ["Xing", "Jianhua", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.11004", "submitter": "Guy Harling", "authors": "Yingrui Yang, Ashley McKhann, Guy Harling, Jukka-Pekka Onnela", "title": "Efficient vaccination strategies for epidemic control using network\n  information", "comments": "38 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Network-based interventions are most powerful against epidemics\nwhen the full network structure is known. However, resource constraints often\nrequire decisions based on partial network data. We investigated how the\neffectiveness of network-based vaccination schemes varied based on the accuracy\nof network data available. Methods: We simulated propagating an SIR process on\nstatic empirical social networks from 75 rural Indian villages. First, we used\nregression analysis to predict the percentage of individuals ever infected\n(cumulative incidence) based on village-level networks. Second, we simulated\nvaccinating 10% of each village at baseline, selecting vaccinees using 1 of 5\nnetwork-based approaches: at random (Random); random contacts of random\nindividuals (Nomination); random high-degree individuals (High Degree); highest\ndegree (Highest Degree); or most central (Central). The first three approaches\nrequire only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also\nsimulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate\n(Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces data collection burden but generates\nonly partially observed networks. Results: We found the mean and standard\ndeviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence.\nIn simulations, Nomination reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared\nto Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds.\nHigh Degree had intermediate effectiveness. Somewhat surprisingly, FCD\ntruncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as using complete\nnetworks. Conclusions: Using even partial network information to prioritize\nvaccines at either the village or individual level substantially improved\nepidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak\nsettings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Mar 2018 10:46:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-03-30", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Yingrui", ""], ["McKhann", "Ashley", ""], ["Harling", "Guy", ""], ["Onnela", "Jukka-Pekka", ""]]}, {"id": "1803.11062", "submitter": "Weijun Zhu", "authors": "Weijun Zhu", "title": "Analyzing DNA Hybridization via machine learning", "comments": "11 pages, 5 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In DNA computing, it is impossible to decide whether a specific hybridization\namong complex DNA molecules is effective or not within acceptable time.
