Though the status of large nodules can be easily diagnosed by fine\nneedle biopsy or bronchoscopy, small nodules are often difficult to classify on\ncomputed tomography (CT). Recent works have shown that shape analysis of lung\nnodules can be used to differentiate benign lesions from malignant ones, though\nexisting methods are limited in their sensitivity and specificity. In this work\nwe introduced a new 3D shape analysis within the framework of differential\ngeometry to calculate the Wasserstein distance between benign and malignant\nlung nodules to derive an accurate classification scheme. The Wasserstein\ndistance between the nodules is calculated based on our new spherical optimal\nmass transport, this new algorithm works directly on sphere by using spherical\nmetric, which is much more accurate and efficient than previous methods. In the\nprocess of deformation, the area-distortion factor gives a probability measure\non the unit sphere, which forms the Wasserstein space. From known cases of\nbenign and malignant lung nodules, we can calculate a unique optimal mass\ntransport map between their correspondingly deformed Wasserstein spaces. This\ntransportation cost defines the Wasserstein distance between them and can be\nused to classify new lung nodules into either the benign or malignant class. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first work that utilizes Wasserstein\ndistance for lung nodule classification. The advantages of Wasserstein distance\nare it is invariant under rigid motions and scalings, thus it intrinsically\nmeasures shape distance even when the underlying shapes are of high complexity,\nmaking it well suited to classify lung nodules as they have different sizes,\norientations, and appearances.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 30 Jun 2018 00:30:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-03", "authors_parsed": [["Zhang", "Min", ""], ["Ma", "Qianli", ""], ["Wen", "Chengfeng", ""], ["Chen", "Hai", ""], ["Liu", "Deruo", ""], ["Gu", "Xianfeng", ""], ["He", "Jie", ""], ["Xu", "Xiaoyin", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.00123", "submitter": "Marinka Zitnik", "authors": "Marinka Zitnik, Francis Nguyen, Bo Wang, Jure Leskovec, Anna\n  Goldenberg, Michael M.

Two theoretical properties of the\nAvgAICc approach might justify that future studies will prefer its use over\nalternative approaches: (1) it is not limited to make predictions based on a\nsingle model, but it also uses secondary models that might have important\npredictive power absent in a given single model favored by alternative\noptimality criteria; (2) it balances goodness of fit and model accuracy, this\nbeing of critical importance in applications of ENM that require model\ntransference.\n  Main conclusions: Our introduction of the AvgAICc approach in ENM; its\ntheoretical properties, which are expected to confer advantages over\nalternatives approaches; and the differences we found when comparing the\nAvgAICc approach with alternative ones; should eventually lead to a wider use\nof the AvgAICc approach.

We find that, while in the low-strain regime, microtubules may\nbe quantitatively described in terms of the classical Euler-Bernoulli elastic\nfilament, above a critical strain they deviate from this simple elastic model,\nshowing a softening response with increasingdeformations. A three-dimensional\nthin-shell model, in which the increased mechanical compliance is caused by\nflattening and eventual buckling of the filament cross-section, captures this\nsoftening effect in the high strain regime and yields quantitative values of\nthe effective mechanical properties of microtubules. Our results demonstrate\nthat properties of microtubules are highly dependent on the magnitude of the\napplied strain and offer a new interpretation for the large variety in\nmicrotubule mechanical data measured by different methods.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 23 Jul 2018 17:00:57 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Memet", "Edvin", ""], ["Hilitski", "Feodor", ""], ["Morris", "Margaret A", ""], ["Schwenger", "Walter J", ""], ["Dogic", "Zvonimir", ""], ["Mahadevan", "L", ""]]}, {"id": "1807.08723", "submitter": "Debashish Chowdhury", "authors": "Swayamshree Patra (IIT Kanpur), Swagata Dey (TIFR Mumbai), Krishanu\n  Ray (TIFR Mumbai), Debashish Chowdhury (IIT Kanpur)", "title": "A pattern in the imaging data: mere artefact of spatio-temporal\n  resolution", "comments": "Although technically sound, the interpretation is potentially\n  misleading.

Sequence patterns might have structural, functional or some\nother relevance, and numerous methods have been developed to detect and analyze\nthem. These methods often depend on the wealth of information already\ncollected. The explosion in the number of newly available sequences calls for\nnovel methods to explore local sequence similarity. We have developed a high\nsensitivity web-based iterative local similarity scanner, that finds sequence\npatterns similar to a submitted query.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 31 Jul 2018 15:15:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-01", "authors_parsed": [["Rabar", "Braslav", ""], ["Ristov", "Strahil", ""], ["Zagor\u0161\u010dak", "Maja", ""], ["Rosenzweig", "Martin", ""], ["Goldstein", "Pavle", ""]]}]
