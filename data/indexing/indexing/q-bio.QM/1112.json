However, despite considerable attention from\nthe combinatorial optimization community it remains to this day unknown whether\na constant factor polynomial-time approximation exists for DFVS. Our result\nthus places the (in)approximability of hybridization number in a much broader\ncomplexity context, and as a consequence we obtain that hybridization number\ninherits inapproximability results from the problem Vertex Cover. On the\npositive side, we use results from the DFVS literature to give an O(log r log\nlog r) approximation for hybridization number, where r is the value of an\noptimal solution to the hybridization number problem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 15:58:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-12-23", "authors_parsed": [["Kelk", "Steven", ""], ["van Iersel", "Leo", ""], ["Lekic", "Nela", ""], ["Linz", "Simone", ""], ["Scornavacca", "Celine", ""], ["Stougie", "Leen", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.5475", "submitter": "Alexandre Vidal", "authors": "Alexandre Vidal, Qinghua Zhang (IRISA / INRIA Rennes), Claire\n  M\\'edigue (INRIA Rocquencourt), St\\'ephane Fabre (PRC), Fr\\'ed\\'erique\n  Cl\\'ement (INRIA Rocquencourt)", "title": "DynPeak : An algorithm for pulse detection and frequency analysis in\n  hormonal time series", "comments": "Nombre de pages : 35 ; Nombre de figures : 16 ; Nombre de tableaux :\n  1", "journal-ref": "PLoS ONE 7, 7 (2012) e39001", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0039001", "report-no": null, "categories": "math.DS q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The endocrine control of the reproductive function is often studied from the\nanalysis of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatile secretion by the pituitary\ngland. Whereas measurements in the cavernous sinus cumulate anatomical and\ntechnical difficulties, LH levels can be easily assessed from jugular blood.\nHowever, plasma levels result from a convolution process due to clearance\neffects when LH enters the general circulation. Simultaneous measurements\ncomparing LH levels in the cavernous sinus and jugular blood have revealed\nclear differences in the pulse shape, the amplitude and the baseline. Besides,\nexperimental sampling occurs at a relatively low frequency (typically every 10\nmin) with respect to LH highest frequency release (one pulse per hour) and the\nresulting LH measurements are noised by both experimental and assay errors. As\na result, the pattern of plasma LH may be not so clearly pulsatile. Yet,\nreliable information on the InterPulse Intervals (IPI) is a prerequisite to\nstudy precisely the steroid feedback exerted on the pituitary level. Hence,\nthere is a real need for robust IPI detection algorithms. In this article, we\npresent an algorithm for the monitoring of LH pulse frequency, basing ourselves\nboth on the available endocrinological knowledge on LH pulse (shape and\nduration with respect to the frequency regime) and synthetic LH data generated\nby a simple model. We make use of synthetic data to make clear some basic\nnotions underlying our algorithmic choices. We focus on explaining how the\nprocess of sampling affects drastically the original pattern of secretion, and\nespecially the amplitude of the detectable pulses. We then describe the\nalgorithm in details and perform it on different sets of both synthetic and\nexperimental LH time series. We further comment on how to diagnose possible\noutliers from the series of IPIs which is the main output of the algorithm.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 22:00:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-07-24", "authors_parsed": [["Vidal", "Alexandre", "", "IRISA / INRIA Rennes"], ["Zhang", "Qinghua", "", "IRISA / INRIA Rennes"], ["M\u00e9digue", "Claire", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"], ["Fabre", "St\u00e9phane", "", "PRC"], ["Cl\u00e9ment", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rique", "", "INRIA Rocquencourt"]]}, {"id": "1112.5506", "submitter": "Joshua Vogelstein", "authors": "Joshua T.

If multiple recombination sites are\norganized in a compact cluster within the same genome, a series of random\nrecombination events may generate substantial cell specific genomic diversity.\nThis diversity is used, for example, to distinguish neurons in the brain of the\nsame multicellular mosaic organism, within the brainbow approach to neuronal\nconnectome. In this paper we study an exactly solvable statistical model for\nSSR operating on a cluster of recombination sites. We consider two types of\nrecombination events: inversions and excisions. Both of these events are\navailable in the Cre-lox system. We derive three properties of the sequences\ngenerated by multiple recombination events. First, we describe the set of\nsequences that can in principle be generated by multiple inversions operating\non the given initial sequence. We call this description the ergodicity theorem.\nOn the basis of this description we calculate the number of sequences that can\nbe generated from an initial sequence. This number of sequences is\nexperimentally testable. Second, we demonstrate that after a large number of\nrandom inversions every sequence that can be generated is generated with equal\nprobability. Lastly, we derive the equations for the probability to find a\nsequence as a function of time in the limit when excisions are much less\nfrequent than inversions, such as in shufflon sequences.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 24 Dec 2011 00:41:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 00:15:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-06-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wei", "Yi", ""], ["Koulakov", "Alexei", ""]]}, {"id": "1112.5966", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "Calculation of the mean duration and age of onset of a chronic disease\n  and application to dementia in Germany", "comments": "11 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.PE stat.AP stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  This paper descibes a new method of calculating the mean duration and mean\nage of onset of a chronic disease from incidence and mortality rates.
