Despite its free availability to academic users and\nimproving documentation, use of Rosetta has largely remained confined to\ndevelopers and their immediate collaborators due to the code's difficulty of\nuse, the requirement for large computational resources, and the unavailability\nof servers for most of the Rosetta applications. Here, we present a unified web\nframework for Rosetta applications called ROSIE (Rosetta Online Server that\nIncludes Everyone). ROSIE provides (a) a common user interface for Rosetta\nprotocols, (b) a stable application programming interface for developers to add\nadditional protocols, (c) a flexible back-end to allow leveraging of computer\ncluster resources shared by RosettaCommons member institutions, and (d)\ncentralized administration by the RosettaCommons to ensure continuous\nmaintenance. This paper describes the ROSIE server infrastructure, a\nstep-by-step 'serverification' protocol for use by Rosetta developers, and the\ndeployment of the first nine ROSIE applications by six separate developer\nteams: Docking, RNA de novo, ERRASER, Antibody, Sequence Tolerance,\nSupercharge, Beta peptide design, NCBB design, and VIP redesign. As illustrated\nby the number and diversity of these applications, ROSIE offers a general and\nspeedy paradigm for serverification of Rosetta applications that incurs\nnegligible cost to developers and lowers barriers to Rosetta use for the\nbroader biological community.

The resulting pairwise interaction model is\nformally equivalent to the disordered Potts models of statistical mechanics and\nit generalizes previous approaches to interdependent positions. Its structure\nallows for co-variation of two or more base pairs, as well as secondary motifs.\nAlthough models consisting of mixtures of PWMs also have this last feature, we\nshow that pairwise interaction models outperform them.

In these applications, for a given set of sequences,\ndepending on the feature of interest the optimal msa is likely to be different,\nand sequence similarity can only be used as a rough initial estimate on the\naccuracy of an msa. This has motivated the growth in template based heuristics\nthat supplement the sequence information with evolutionary, structural and\nfunctional data and exploit feature similarity instead of sequence similarity\nto construct multiple sequence alignments that are biologically more accurate.\nHowever, current frameworks for designing template based heuristics do not\nallow the user to explicitly specify information that can help to classify\nfeatures into types and associate weights signifying the relative importance of\na feature with respect to other features. In this paper, we first provide a\nmechanism where as a part of the template information the user can explicitly\nspecify for each feature, its type, and weight. The type is to classify the\nfeatures into different categories based on their characteristics and the\nweight signifies the relative importance of a feature with respect to other\nfeatures in that sequence.
