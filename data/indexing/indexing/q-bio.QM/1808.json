In the study presented here, differences in the\nproperties of protein domains in single-domain and multi-domain systems and\ntheir influence on functions are discussed.

From these\nobservations, the differences observed in the functions of homologous proteins\ncould be attributed to the presence of tethered domain.

Sources of this data include wearable devices, images,\nsocial media, geospatial information and more. A tremendous opportunity rests\nwithin cross-modal data analysis that leverages existing domain knowledge\nmethods to understand and guide human health. Especially in chronic diseases,\ncurrent medical practice uses a combination of sparse hospital based biological\nmetrics (blood tests, expensive imaging, etc.) to understand the evolving\nhealth status of an individual. Future health systems must integrate data\ncreated at the individual level to better understand health status perpetually,\nespecially in a cybernetic framework. In this work we fuse multiple user\ncreated and open source data streams along with established biomedical domain\nknowledge to give two types of quantitative state estimates of cardiovascular\nhealth. First, we use wearable devices to calculate cardiorespiratory fitness\n(CRF), a known quantitative leading predictor of heart disease which is not\nroutinely collected in clinical settings. Second, we estimate inherent genetic\ntraits, living environmental risks, circadian rhythm, and biological metrics\nfrom a diverse dataset. Our experimental results on 24 subjects demonstrate how\nmulti-modal data can provide personalized health insight. Understanding the\ndynamic nature of health status will pave the way for better health based\nrecommendation engines, better clinical decision making and positive lifestyle\nchanges.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 7 Aug 2018 00:38:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 23 Aug 2018 21:19:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-27", "authors_parsed": [["Nag", "Nitish", ""], ["Pandey", "Vaibhav", ""], ["Putzel", "Preston J.", ""], ["Bhimaraju", "Hari", ""], ["Krishnan", "Srikanth", ""], ["Jain", "Ramesh C.", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.06576", "submitter": "Samuel Schoenholz", "authors": "Samuel S.

Given the Fourier Transform of the data at one\nor multiple frequencies and/or trials, the algorithm approximates numerically\nthe posterior distribution with Monte Carlo techniques.\n  Results: We use synthetic data to show that the proposed method behaves well\nunder a wide range of experimental conditions, including low signal-to-noise\nratios and correlated sources. We use dipole clusters to mimic the effect of\nextended sources. In addition, we test the algorithm on real MEG data to\nconfirm its feasibility.\n  Comparison with existing method(s): Throughout the whole study, DICS (Dynamic\nImaging of Coherent Sources) is used systematically as a benchmark. The two\nmethods provide similar general pictures; the posterior distributions of the\nBayesian approach contain much richer information at the price of a higher\ncomputational cost.\n  Conclusions: The Bayesian method described in this paper represents a\nreliable approach for localization of multiple dipoles in the frequency domain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 24 Aug 2018 10:55:07 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 13 Dec 2018 14:21:54 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-14", "authors_parsed": [["Luria", "Gianvittorio", ""], ["Duran", "Dunja", ""], ["Visani", "Elisa", ""], ["Sommariva", "Sara", ""], ["Rotondi", "Fabio", ""], ["Sebastiano", "Davide Rossi", ""], ["Panzica", "Ferruccio", ""], ["Piana", "Michele", ""], ["Sorrentino", "Alberto", ""]]}, {"id": "1808.08230", "submitter": "Andrew Borkowski M.D.", "authors": "Andrew A.

It subsumes all the usual updating modes, while enabling\nnew behaviors achievable by more concrete models. Moreover, it appears that\nclassical dynamical analyzes of reachability and attractors have a simpler\ncomputational complexity:- reachability can be assessed in a polynomial number\nof iterations. The computation of iterations is in NP in the very general case,\nand is linear when local functions are monotonic, or with some usual\nrepresentations of functions of BNs (binary decision diagrams, Petri nets,\nautomata networks, etc.). Thus, reachability is in P with locally-monotonic\nBNs, and P$^{\\text{NP}}$ otherwise (instead of being PSPACE-complete with\nupdate modes);- deciding wherever a configuration belongs to an attractor is in\ncoNP with locally-monotonic BNs, and coNP$^{\\text{coNP}}$ otherwise (instead of\nPSPACE-complete with update modes).Furthermore, we demonstrate that the\nsemantics completely captures any behavior achievable with any multilevel or\nODE refinement of the BN; and the semantics is minimal with respect to this\nmodel refinement criteria: to any most permissive trajectory, there exists a\nmultilevel refinement of the BN which can reproduce it.In brief, the most\npermissive semantics of BNs enables a correct abstract reasoning on dynamics of\nBNs, with a greater tractability than previously introduced update modes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 30 Aug 2018 11:49:31 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 8 Apr 2020 08:12:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-09", "authors_parsed": [["Chatain", "Thomas", "", "MEXICO"], ["Haar", "Stefan", "", "MEXICO"], ["Kol{\u010d}\u00e1k", "Juraj", "", "LSV"], ["Paulev\u00e9", "Lo\u00efc", "", "LaBRI, BioInfo - LRI"]]}, {"id": "1808.10795", "submitter": "Ruiqi Zhong", "authors": "Ruiqi Zhong, Tyler Joseph, Joao B Xavier, Itsik Pe'er", "title": "Latent Space Temporal Model of Microbial Abundance to Predict Domination\n  and Bacteremia", "comments": "Experiment code available at\n  https://github.com/ZhongRuiqi1997/NIPS2017MLCB, software at\n  https://github.com/ZhongRuiqi1997/Kalman-Filter-Intestinal-Microbiota", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Gut microbial composition has been linked to multiple health outcomes.
