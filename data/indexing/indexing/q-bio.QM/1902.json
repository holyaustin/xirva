Most surgical procedures involve structures deeper than the skin.\nHowever, the difference in surgical noxious stimulation between skin incision\nand laparoscopic trocar insertion is unknown. By analyzing instantaneous heart\nrate (IHR) calculated from the electrocardiogram, in particular the transient\nbradycardia in response to surgical stimuli, this study investigates surgical\nnoxious stimuli arising from skin incision and laparoscopic trocar insertion.\nMethods. Thirty-five patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were\nenrolled in this prospective observational study. Sequential surgical steps\nincluding umbilical skin incision (11 mm), umbilical trocar insertion (11 mm),\nxiphoid skin incision (5 mm), xiphoid trocar insertion (5 mm), subcostal skin\nincision (3 mm), and subcostal trocar insertion (3 mm) were investigated. IHR\nwas derived from electrocardiography and calculated by the modern time-varying\npower spectrum. Similar to the classical heart rate variability analysis, the\ntime-varying low frequency power (tvLF), time-varying high frequency power\n(tvHF), and tvLF-to-tvHF ratio (tvLHR) were calculated. Prediction probability\n(PK) analysis and global pointwise F-test were used to compare the performance\nbetween indices and the heart rate readings from the patient monitor. Results.\nAnalysis of IHR showed that surgical stimulus elicits a transient bradycardia,\nfollowed by the increase of heart rate. Transient bradycardia is more\nsignificant in trocar insertion than skin incision. The IHR change quantifies\ndifferential responses to different surgical intensity.

Fortunately, qualimetry, a young\nscience with the purpose of quality quantification, provides the tools to\nresolve these gaps. To be able to use these tools, the authors propose a\nsynthetic representation of qualimetry and its six pillars, named the ''House\nof Qualimetry'' and explain the fundamendal aspects of qualimetry. They\nidentify a set of 8 attributes to characterize the design quality model and\nbased on these attributes, propose a new process to design or adapt the quality\nmodel. Among these attributes, a new one is introduced to capture and measure\nthe quality model evolution and adaptation aspect: the polymorphism and the\npolymorphism degree. Finally, the authors consolidate the measurement part\nthanks to a new measurement process before returning to the benefits of these\ncontributions to systems engineering.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 8 Feb 2019 10:00:42 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-11", "authors_parsed": [["Argotti", "Yann", "", "LAAS-ISI"], ["Baron", "Claude", "", "LAAS-ISI"], ["Esteban", "Phillipe", "", "LAAS-ISI"]]}, {"id": "1902.03216", "submitter": "Gaoxiang Zhou", "authors": "Gaoxiang Zhou, Kai-Wen Liang, Natasa Miskov-Zivanov", "title": "Intervention Pathway Discovery via Context-Dependent Dynamic Sensitivity\n  Analysis", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "abstract": "  The sensitivity analysis of biological system models can significantly\ncontribute to identifying and explaining influences of internal or external\nchanges on model and its elements.

Differentiating them is a\nchallenging and time-consuming task for radiologists. Although deep neural\nnetworks can automatically diagnose PsP and TTP, interpretability shortage is\nalways the heel of Achilles. To overcome these shortcomings and win the trust\nof physician, we propose a transparency guided ensemble convolutional neural\nnetwork to automatically stratify PsP and TTP on magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI). A total of 84 patients with GBM are enrolled in the study. First, three\ntypical convolutional neutral networks (CNNs) -- VGG, ResNet and DenseNet --\nare trained to distinguish PsP and TTP on the dataset. Subsequently, we use the\nclass-specific gradient information from convolutional layers to highlight the\nimportant regions in MRI. Radiological experts are then recruited to select the\nmost lesion-relevant layer of each CNN. Finally, the selected layers are\nutilized to guide the construction of multi-scale ensemble CNN. The classified\naccuracy of the presented network is 90.20%, the promotion of specificity\nreaches more than 20%. The results demonstrate that network transparency and\nensemble can enhance the reliability and accuracy of CNNs. The presented\nnetwork is promising for the diagnosis of PsP and TTP.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2019 13:29:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Liu", "Xiaoming", ""], ["Chan", "Michael D.", ""], ["Zhou", "Xiaobo", ""], ["Qian", "Xiaohua", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.09934", "submitter": "Jiahang Xu", "authors": "Jiahang Xu, Fangyang Jiao, Yechong Huang, Xinzhe Luo, Qian Xu, Ling\n  Li, Xueling Liu, Chuantao Zuo, Ping Wu and Xiahai Zhuang", "title": "A Fully-Automatic Framework for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis by\n  Multi-Modality Images", "comments": "16 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.LG stat.ML", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prevalent long-term\nneurodegenerative disease. Though the diagnostic criteria of PD are relatively\nwell defined, the current medical imaging diagnostic procedures are\nexpertise-demanding, and thus call for a higher-integrated AI-based diagnostic\nalgorithm. Methods: In this paper, we proposed an automatic, end-to-end,\nmulti-modality diagnosis framework, including segmentation, registration,\nfeature generation and machine learning, to process the information of the\nstriatum for the diagnosis of PD. Multiple modalities, including T1- weighted\nMRI and 11C-CFT PET, were used in the proposed framework. The reliability of\nthis framework was then validated on a dataset from the PET center of Huashan\nHospital, as the dataset contains paired T1-MRI and CFT-PET images of 18 Normal\n(NL) subjects and 49 PD subjects. Results: We obtained an accuracy of 100% for\nthe PD/NL classification task, besides, we conducted several comparative\nexperiments to validate the diagnosis ability of our framework. Conclusion:\nThrough experiment we illustrate that (1) automatic segmentation has the same\nclassification effect as the manual segmentation, (2) the multi-modality images\ngenerates a better prediction than single modality images, and (3) volume\nfeature is shown to be irrelevant to PD diagnosis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Feb 2019 13:52:41 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-02-27", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Jiahang", ""], ["Jiao", "Fangyang", ""], ["Huang", "Yechong", ""], ["Luo", "Xinzhe", ""], ["Xu", "Qian", ""], ["Li", "Ling", ""], ["Liu", "Xueling", ""], ["Zuo", "Chuantao", ""], ["Wu", "Ping", ""], ["Zhuang", "Xiahai", ""]]}, {"id": "1902.10117", "submitter": "Giovanni Stilo", "authors": "Lorenzo Madeddu, Giovanni Stilo, Paola Velardi", "title": "Network-based methods for disease-gene prediction", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We predict disease-genes relations on the Human Interactome network using a\nmethodology that jointly learns functional and connectivity patterns\nsurrounding proteins.
