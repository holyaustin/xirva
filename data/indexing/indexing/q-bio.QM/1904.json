Methods: We identified studies describing an NLP\nmethod to extract specific cancer-related information from EHR sources from\nPubMed, Google Scholar, ACL Anthology, and existing reviews. Two exclusion\ncriteria were used in this study. We excluded articles where the extraction\ntechniques used were too broad to be represented as frames and also where very\nlow-level extraction methods were used. 79 articles were included in the final\nreview. We organized this information according to frame semantic principles to\nhelp identify common areas of overlap and potential gaps. Results: Frames were\ncreated from the reviewed articles pertaining to cancer information such as\ncancer diagnosis, tumor description, cancer procedure, breast cancer diagnosis,\nprostate cancer diagnosis and pain in prostate cancer patients.

Our model has both environmental\nstochasticity in the growth rates and interaction stochasticity, i.e., a\nstochastic functional response. We examine what the kill rate data brings to\nthe quality of the estimates, and whether estimation is possible (for various\ntime series lengths) solely with time series of population counts or biomass\ndata. Both Bayesian and frequentist estimation are performed, providing\nmultiple ways to check model identifiability. The Fisher Information Matrix\nsuggests that models with and without kill rate data are all identifiable,\nalthough correlations remain between parameters that belong to the same\nfunctional form. However, our results show that if the attractor is a fixed\npoint in the absence of stochasticity, identifying parameters in practice\nrequires kill rate data as a complement to the time series of population\ndensities, due to the relatively flat likelihood. Only noisy limit cycle\nattractors can be identified directly from population count data (as in inverse\nmodelling), although even in this case, adding kill rate data - including in\nsmall amounts - can make the estimates much more precise.

We propose learning an intermediate representation invariant to\nsite/protocol variables, a technique adapted from information theory-based\nalgorithmic fairness; by leveraging the data processing inequality, such a\nrepresentation can then be used to create an image reconstruction that is\nuninformative of its original source, yet still faithful to underlying\nstructures.

This new approach is called\nconnectomics. It brings together a series of techniques and methodologies\ncapable of systematizing, from the different types of signals and images of the\nnervous system, how neuronal units to brain areas are connected. Through this\napproach, the different patterns of connectivity can be graphically and\nmathematically represented by the so-called connectomes. The connectome uses\nquantitative metrics to evaluate structural and functional information from\nimages of neural tracts and pathways or signals from the metabolic and/or\nelectrophysiologic activity of cell populations or brain areas. Besides, with\nadequate treatment of this information, it is also possible to infer causal\nrelationships. In this way, structural and functional evaluations are\ncomplementary descriptions which, together, represent the anatomic and\nphysiologic neural properties, establishing a new paradigm for understanding\nhow the brain functions by looking at brain connections. Here, we highlight\nfive critical elements of a network that allows an integrative analysis,\nfocusing mainly on a functional description.

Many clustering methods have been developed that pursue different\nstrategies to identify the optimal clustering for a data set.\n  We previously published TiCoNE, an interactive clustering approach coupled\nwith de-novo network enrichment of identified clusters. However, in this first\nversion time-series and network analysis remained two separate steps in that\nonly time-series data was clustered, and identified clusters mapped to and\nenriched within a network in a second separate step.\n  In this work, we present TiCoNE 2: An extension that can now seamlessly\nincorporate multiple data types within its composite clustering model.\nSystematic evaluation on 50 random data sets, as well as on 2,400 data sets\ncontaining enriched cluster structure and varying levels of noise, shows that\nour approach is able to successfully recover cluster patterns embedded in\nrandom data and that it is more robust towards noise than non-composite models\nusing only one data type, when applied to two data types simultaneously.\n  Herein, each data set was clustered using five different similarity functions\ninto k=10/30 clusters, resulting to ~5,000 clusterings in total. We evaluated\nthe quality of each derived clustering with the Jaccard index and an internal\nvalidity score. We used TiCoNE to calculate empirical p-values for all\ngenerated clusters with different permutation functions, resulting in ~80,000\ncluster p-values. We show, that derived p-values can be used to reliably\ndistinguish between foreground and background clusters.\n  TiCoNE 2 allows researchers to seamlessly analyze time-series data together\nwith biological interaction networks in an intuitive way and thereby provides\nmore robust results than single data type cluster analyses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 28 Apr 2019 17:47:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-04-30", "authors_parsed": [["Wiwie", "Christian", ""], ["R\u00f6ttger", "Richard", ""], ["Baumbach", "Jan", ""]]}, {"id": "1904.12456", "submitter": "Yousef Jamali", "authors": "Yousef Jamali, Mohammad Jamali, Mehdi Golshani", "title": "A new method of brain stimulation at ultra-high frequency", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "physics.bio-ph q-bio.NC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Nerve stimulation via micro-electrode implants is one of the neurostimulation\napproaches which is used frequently in the medical treatment of some brain\ndisorders, neural prosthetics, brain-machine interfaces and also in the cyborg.\nIn this method, the electrical stimulation signal can be categorized by the\nfrequency band: low frequency, high frequency, and ultra-high frequency.

To control a creature via a machine called cyborg method, three\nstages are considerable: stimulation of neurons, neural response, and the\nbehavioral reaction of the subject. Our main concern was to know how electrical\nstimulation induces neural activity and leads to a behavioral response.\nAdditionally, we were interested to explore which type of electrical\nstimulation is optimal from different aspects such as maximum response with\nminimum induction stimulus field, minimum damage of the tissue and the\nelectrode, reduction of the noxiousness of stimuli or pain in the living\ncreature. In this article, we proposed a new model for the induction of neural\nactivity led to locomotion responses through electrical stimulation.\nFurthermore, based on this model, we developed a new approach of electrical\nneural stimulation to provide a better locomotion control of living beings.\nThis approach was verified through the empirical data of fish cyborg. We\nstimulated the fish brain by use of an ultra-high frequency signal which\ncareered by a random low frequency. According to our model, we could control\nthe locomotion of fish in a novel and innovative way. In this study, we\ncategorized the different cyborg methods based on the nervous system areas and\nthe stimulation signal properties to reach the better and optimal behavioral\ncontrol of creature. According to this, we proposed a new stimulation method\ntheoretically and confirmed it experimentally.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Apr 2019 06:03:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 30 Apr 2019 06:41:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Jamali", "Mohammad", ""], ["Jamali", "Yousef", ""], ["Golshani", "Mehdi", ""]]}]
