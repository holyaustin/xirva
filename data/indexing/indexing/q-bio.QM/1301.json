Both models treat molecules as points undergoing Brownian\nmotion. The former represents chemical reactions between two reactants through\nthe use of reactive boundary conditions, with two molecules reacting instantly\nupon reaching a fixed separation (called the reaction-radius). The Doi model\nuses reaction potentials, whereby two molecules react with a fixed probability\nper unit time, $\\lambda$, when separated by less than the reaction radius. In\nthis work we study the rigorous relationship between the two models. For the\nspecial case of a protein diffusing to a fixed DNA binding site, we prove that\nthe solution to the Doi model converges to the solution of the Smoluchowski\nmodel as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, with a rigorous $O(\\lambda^{-1/2 + \\epsilon})$\nerror bound (for any fixed $\\epsilon > 0$). We investigate by numerical\nsimulation, for biologically relevant parameter values, the difference between\nthe solutions and associated reaction time statistics of the two models.

A common limitation in experiments using these technologies is\nthe low number or even absence of biological replicates, which complicates the\nstatistical analysis of digital gene expression data. Analysis of this type of\ndata has often been based on modified tests originally devised for analysing\nmicroarrays; both these and even de novo methods for the analysis of RNA-seq\ndata are plagued by the common problem of low replication. We propose a novel,\nnon-parametric Bayesian approach for the analysis of digital gene expression\ndata. We begin with a hierarchical model for modelling over-dispersed count\ndata and a blocked Gibbs sampling algorithm for inferring the posterior\ndistribution of model parameters conditional on these counts. The algorithm\ncompensates for the problem of low numbers of biological replicates by\nclustering together genes with tag counts that are likely sampled from a common\ndistribution and using this augmented sample for estimating the parameters of\nthis distribution. The number of clusters is not decided a priori, but it is\ninferred along with the remaining model parameters.

This greatly simplifies the process of model\nspecification, avoiding the tedious and error prone task of manually\nenumerating all species and reactions that can potentially exist in a system.\nFrom a simulation perspective, rule-based models can be expanded\nalgorithmically into fully-enumerated reaction networks and simulated using a\nvariety of network-based simulation methods, provided that the network is not\nexceedingly large.

This cluster has the ability to maintain its core\ntemperature actively without a central controller, and raises the question of\nhow this is achieved. We suggest that the swarm cluster is akin to an active\nporous structure whose functional requirement is to adjust to outside\nconditions by varying its porosity to control its core temperature. Using a\ncontinuum model that takes the form of a set of advection-diffusion equations\nfor heat transfer in a mobile porous medium, we show that the equalization of\nan effective \"behavioural pressure\", which propagates information about the\nambient temperature through variations in density, leads to effective\nthermoregulation. Our model extends and generalizes previous models by focusing\nthe question of mechanism on the form and role of the behavioural pressure, and\nallows us to explain the vertical asymmetry of the cluster (as a consequence of\nbuoyancy driven flows), the ability of the cluster to overpack at low ambient\ntemperatures without breaking up at high ambient temperatures, and the relative\ninsensitivity to large variations in the ambient temperature. Finally, our\ntheory makes testable hypotheses for how the cluster bee density should respond\nto externally imposed temperature inhomogeneities, and suggests strategies for\nbiomimetic thermoregulation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 16:32:05 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 6 Nov 2013 20:05:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-11-07", "authors_parsed": [["Ocko", "Samuel A.", ""], ["Mahadevan", "L.", ""]]}, {"id": "1301.7745", "submitter": "Justin Kinney", "authors": "Justin B.

MIC is based on mutual information, a\nfundamental quantity in information theory that is widely understood to serve\nthis need. MIC, however, is not an estimate of mutual information. Indeed, it\nwas claimed that MIC possesses a desirable mathematical property called\n\"equitability\" that mutual information lacks. This was not proven; instead it\nwas argued solely through the analysis of simulated data. Here we show that\nthis claim, in fact, is incorrect. First we offer mathematical proof that no\n(non-trivial) dependence measure satisfies the definition of equitability\nproposed by Reshef et al.. We then propose a self-consistent and more general\ndefinition of equitability that follows naturally from the Data Processing\nInequality. Mutual information satisfies this new definition of equitability\nwhile MIC does not. Finally, we show that the simulation evidence offered by\nReshef et al. was artifactual. We conclude that estimating mutual information\nis not only practical for many real-world applications, but also provides a\nnatural solution to the problem of quantifying associations in large data sets.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 31 Jan 2013 20:44:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Kinney", "Justin B.", ""], ["Atwal", "Gurinder S.", ""]]}]
