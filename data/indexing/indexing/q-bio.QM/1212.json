We take Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), one of the formalisms\ndesigned to reason about such systems, as the foundation of the language we\nwill build.\n  BioAmbient calculus is an extension of \\pi-calculus, developed largely for\napplications to biomolecular systems. It deals with ambients and their ability\nto communicate and to execute concurrent processes while moving.\n  In this paper we combine the formalism of Dynamic Epistemic Logic together\nwith the formalism of BioAmbient Calculus in order to reason about knowledge\nmaintained and gained upon process transitions. The motivation lies in\ndeveloping a language that captures locally available information through\nassignment of knowledge, with potential application to biological systems as\nwell as social, virtual, and others.\n  We replace the ambients of BioAmbient Calculus with agents, to which we\nattribute knowledge, and explore the parallels of this treatment. The resulting\nlogic describes the information flow governing mobile structured agents,\norganized hierarchically, whose architecture (and local information) may change\ndue to actions such as communication, merging (of two agents), entering (of an\nagent into the inner structure of another agent) and exiting (of an agent from\nthe structure of another). We show how the main axioms of DEL must be altered\nto accommodate the informational effects of the agents' dynamic architecture.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2012 22:15:44 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-12-19", "authors_parsed": [["Yermakova", "Anya", ""], ["Baltag", "Alexandru", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.4229", "submitter": "Dirson Jian Li", "authors": "Dirson Jian Li", "title": "The tectonic cause of mass extinctions and the genomic contribution to\n  biodiversification", "comments": "64 pages, 24 figures, 7 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite numerous mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic eon, the overall trend\nin biodiversity evolution was not blocked and the life has never been wiped\nout.

However, understanding the\nbiology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in\nmultiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of\ncell types.

By modeling the sharing of\nactive eQTLs among tissues this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that\nare present in more than one tissue compared with \"tissue-by-tissue\" analyses\nthat examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of\neQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared\nacross different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model,\naddressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing\noverlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our\nframework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells and fibroblasts\nwe find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue\nanalysis, identifying 63% more genes with eQTLs (at FDR=0.05).

We add repulsive interactions\nbetween open contours to the original model, treat the trajectories as an\nextrusion in the temporal dimension, and show applications to two tracking\nproblems. The walking behavior of Drosophila is studied at different population\ndensity and gender composition. We demonstrate that individual male flies have\ndistinct walking signatures, and that the social interaction between flies in a\nmixed gender arena is gender specific. We also apply our model to studies of\ntrajectories of gliding Myxococcus xanthus bacteria at high density. We examine\nthe individual gliding behavioral statistics in terms of the gliding speed\ndistribution. Using these two examples at very distinctive spatial scales, we\nillustrate the use of our algorithm on tracking both short rigid bodies\n(Drosophila) and long flexible objects (Myxococcus xanthus). Our repulsive\nactive membrane model reaches error rates better than $5\\times 10^{-6}$ per fly\nper second for Drosophila tracking and comparable results for Myxococcus\nxanthus.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 26 Dec 2012 16:30:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Deng", "Yi", ""], ["Coen", "Philip", ""], ["Sun", "Mingzhai", ""], ["Shaevitz", "Joshua W.", ""]]}, {"id": "1212.6899", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "Simulation of Populations in a Time-, Age- and Duration Dependent\n  Illness-Death Model", "comments": "10 pages, 4 figures, 2 algorithms", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM stat.CO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Relevant events in a three state illness-death model (IDM) of a chronic\ndisease are the diagnosis of the disease and death with or without the disease.\nIn this article a simulation framework for populations moving in the IDM is\npresented.
