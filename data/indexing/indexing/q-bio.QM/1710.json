Further they are also incapable to consider\ninter-individual variability. A physical description of platelets deposition\nwas introduced recently in Chopard et. al. [2017], by integrating fundamental\nunderstandings of how platelets interact in a numerical model, parameterized by\nfive parameters. These parameters specify the deposition process and are\nrelevant for a biomedical understanding of the phenomena. One of the main\nintuition is that these parameters are precisely the information needed for a\npathological test identifying CVD captured and that they capture the\ninter-individual variability. Following this intuition, here we devise a\nBayesian inferential scheme for estimation of these parameters. As the\nlikelihood function of the numerical model is intractable due to the complex\nstochastic nature of the model, we use a likelihood-free inference scheme\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to calibrate the parameters in a\ndata-driven manner. As ABC requires the generation of many pseudo-data by\nexpensive simulation runs, we use a high performance computing (HPC) framework\nfor ABC to make the inference possible for this model. We illustrate that our\nmean posterior prediction of platelet deposition pattern matches the\nexperimental dataset closely with a tight posterior prediction error margin for\na collective dataset of 7 volunteers. The present approach can be used to build\na new generation of personalized platelet functionality tests for CVD\ndetection, using numerical modeling of platelet deposition, Bayesian\nuncertainty quantification and High performance computing.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 3 Oct 2017 09:52:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 21 May 2018 12:39:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-05-22", "authors_parsed": [["Dutta", "Ritabrata", ""], ["Chopard", "Bastien", ""], ["L\u00e4tt", "Jonas", ""], ["Dubois", "Frank", ""], ["Boudjeltia", "Karim Zouaoui", ""], ["Mira", "Antonietta", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.01262", "submitter": "Hossein Babashah", "authors": "Fereshte Mozafari, Hossein Babashah, Somayyeh Koohi, Zahra Kavehvash", "title": "DNA Sequence Alignment by Window based Optical Correlator", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In genomics, pattern matching against a sequence of nucleotides plays a\npivotal role for DNA sequence alignment and comparing genomes.

Emerging technologies now allow for mass spectrometry based\nprofiling of up to thousands of small molecule metabolites (metabolomics) in an\nincreasing number of biosamples. While offering great promise for revealing\ninsight into the pathogenesis of human disease, standard approaches have yet to\nbe established for statistically analyzing increasingly complex,\nhigh-dimensional human metabolomics data in relation to clinical phenotypes\nincluding disease outcomes. To determine optimal statistical approaches for\nmetabolomics analysis, we sought to formally compare traditional statistical as\nwell as newer statistical learning methods across a range of metabolomics\ndataset types. Results. In simulated and experimental metabolomics data derived\nfrom large population-based human cohorts, we observed that with an increasing\nnumber of study subjects, univariate compared to multivariate methods resulted\nin a higher false discovery rate due to substantial correlations among\nmetabolites. In scenarios wherein the number of assayed metabolites increases,\nas in the application of nontargeted versus targeted metabolomics measures,\nmultivariate methods performed especially favorably across a range of\nstatistical operating characteristics. In nontargeted metabolomics datasets\nthat included thousands of metabolite measures, sparse multivariate models\ndemonstrated greater selectivity and lower potential for spurious\nrelationships. Conclusion. When the number of metabolites was similar to or\nexceeded the number of study subjects, as is common with nontargeted\nmetabolomics analysis of relatively small sized cohorts, sparse multivariate\nmodels exhibited the most robust statistical power with more consistent\nresults.

In this work, based on the investigation of an idealized\nball-and-stick neuron model and a biologically realistic pyramidal neuron\nmodel, we first demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the\nconductance determined by the traditional method has no clear biological\ninterpretation due to the neglect of a nonlinear interaction between the clamp\ncurrent and the synaptic current across the spatial dendrites. As a\nconsequence, the traditional method can induce an arbitrarily large error of\nconductance measurement, sometimes even leads to unphysically negative\nconductance. To circumvent the difficulty of elucidating synaptic impact on\nneuronal computation using the traditional method, we then propose a framework\nto determine the effective conductance that reflects directly the functional\nimpact of synaptic inputs on action potential initiation and thereby neuronal\ninformation processing. Our framework has been further verified in realistic\nneuron simulations, thus greatly improves upon the traditional approach by\nproviding a reliable and accurate assessment of the role of synaptic activity\nin neuronal computation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 14 Oct 2017 00:45:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-10-17", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Songting", ""], ["Zhang", "Xiaohui", ""], ["Zhou", "Douglas", ""], ["Cai", "David", ""]]}, {"id": "1710.05292", "submitter": "Farnaz Zamani Esfahlani", "authors": "Farnaz Zamani Esfahlani and Hiroki Sayama", "title": "A Percolation-based Thresholding Method with Applications in Functional\n  Connectivity Analysis", "comments": "12 pages, 6 figures; to appear in the Proceedings of CompleNet 2018,\n  in press", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Despite the recent advances in developing more effective thresholding methods\nto convert weighted networks to unweighted counterparts, there are still\nseveral limitations that need to be addressed.

All the proteomic analyses including\npeptide/protein identification and quantification, differential expression\nanalysis, biomarker discovery and so on are all based on the matching of mass\nspectra with peptide sequences, which is significantly influenced by the\nquality of the spectra, such as the peak numbers, noisy peaks, signal-to-noise\nratios, etc. Hence, it is crucial to assess the quality of the spectra in order\nfor filtering and/or post-processing after identification. The handcrafted\nfeatures representing spectra quality, however, need human expertise to design\nand are difficult to optimize, and thus the existing assessing algorithms are\nstill lacking in accuracy.

RNA sequences fold into secondary structures where some bases\nmatch one another while others remain unpaired. Pseudoknot-free secondary\nstructures can be represented as well-parenthesized expressions with additional\ndots, where pairs of matching parentheses symbolize paired bases and dots,\nunpaired bases. The two fundamental problems in RNA algorithmic are to predict\nhow sequences fold within some model of energy and to design sequences of bases\nwhich will fold into targeted secondary structures. Predicting how a given RNA\nsequence folds into a pseudoknot-free secondary structure is known to be\nsolvable in cubic time since the eighties and in truly subcubic time by a\nrecent result of Bringmann et al.

As a stark contrast, it is\nunknown whether or not designing a given RNA secondary structure is a tractable\ntask; this has been raised as a challenging open question by Anne Condon (ICALP\n2003). Because of its crucial importance in a number of fields such as\npharmaceutical research and biochemistry, there are dozens of heuristics and\nsoftware libraries dedicated to RNA secondary structure design. It is therefore\nrather surprising that the computational complexity of this central problem in\nbioinformatics has been unsettled for decades.\n  In this paper we show that, in the simplest model of energy which is the\nWatson-Crick model the design of secondary structures is NP-complete if one\nadds natural constraints of the form: index $i$ of the sequence has to be\nlabeled by base $b$.
