Their existence is determined by the bulk properties of the\nstructures and, as such, the topological phonon modes are stable to changes\noccurring at the edges. The first class of topological phonons was recently\nfound in 2-dimensional structures similar to that of Microtubules. The present\nwork introduces another class of topological phonons, this time occurring in\nquasi one-dimensional filamentous structures with inversion symmetry. The\nphenomenon is exemplified using a structure inspired from that of actin\nMicrofilaments, present in most live cells. The system discussed here is\nprobably the simplest structure that supports topological phonon modes, a fact\nthat allows detailed analysis in both time and frequency domains. We advance\nthe hypothesis that the topological phonon modes are ubiquitous in the\nbiological world and that living organisms make use of them during various\nprocesses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Oct 2010 14:17:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 6 Jan 2011 18:13:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Berg", "Nina", ""], ["Joel", "Kira", ""], ["Koolyk", "Miriam", ""], ["Prodan", "Emil", ""]]}]
