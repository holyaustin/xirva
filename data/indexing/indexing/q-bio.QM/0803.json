Two new numeric systems are defined by these\n8-dimensional and 4-dimensional algebras: genetic Yin-Yang-octaves and genetic\ntetrions. Their comparison with quaternions by Hamilton is presented. Elements\nof new \"genovector calculation\" and ideas of \"genetic mechanics\" are discussed.\nThese algebras are considered as models of the genetic code and as its possible\npre-code basis. They are related with binary oppositions of the Yin-Yang type\nand they give new opportunities to investigate evolution of the genetic code.\nThe revealed fact of the relation between the genetic code and these genetic\nalgebras is discussed in connection with the idea by Pythagoras: \"All things\nare numbers\". Simultaneously these genetic algebras can be utilized as the\nalgebras of genetic operators in biological organisms. The described results\nare related with the problem of algebraization of bioinformatics. They take\nattention to the question: what is life from the viewpoint of algebra?\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 23 Mar 2008 16:35:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 May 2008 07:21:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Petoukhov", "Sergey V.", "", "Department of Biomechanics, Mechanical\n  Engineering Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences"]]}, {"id": "0803.3591", "submitter": "Simon Flyvbjerg Norrelykke", "authors": "Liang Li, Simon F.

Amoebae, fibroblasts, neutrophils and growth cones all behave in this\nway. Little is known however about cell motion and searching behavior in the\nabsence of a signal. Is individual cell motion best characterized as a random\nwalk? Do individual cells have a search strategy when they are beyond the range\nof the signal they would otherwise move toward? Here we ask if single,\nisolated, Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium amoebae bias their motion in the\nabsence of external cues. We placed single well-isolated Dictyostelium and\nPolysphondylium cells on a nutrient-free agar surface and followed them at 10\nsec intervals for ~10 hr, then analyzed their motion with respect to velocity,\nturning angle, persistence length, and persistence time, comparing the results\nto the expectation for a variety of different types of random motion. We find\nthat amoeboid behavior is well described by a special kind of random motion:\nAmoebae show a long persistence time (~10 min) beyond which they start to lose\ntheir direction; they move forward in a zig-zag manner; and they make turns\nevery 1-2 min on average. They bias their motion by remembering the last turn\nand turning away from it. Interpreting the motion as consisting of runs and\nturns, the duration of a run and the amplitude of a turn are both found to be\nexponentially distributed. We show that this behavior greatly improves their\nchances of finding a target relative to performing a random walk. We believe\nthat other eukaryotic cells may employ a strategy similar to Dictyostelium when\nseeking conditions or signal sources not yet within range of their detection\nsystem.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Mar 2008 16:31:14 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-05-19", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Liang", ""], ["Norrelykke", "Simon F.", ""], ["Cox", "Edward C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0803.3657", "submitter": "Yeow Meng Chee", "authors": "Yeow Meng Chee and San Ling", "title": "Improved Lower Bounds for Constant GC-Content DNA Codes", "comments": "4 pages", "journal-ref": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, vol. 54, no. 1, pp.\n  391-394, 2008", "doi": "10.1109/TIT.2007.911167", "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.IT cs.DS math.CO math.IT q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The design of large libraries of oligonucleotides having constant GC-content\nand satisfying Hamming distance constraints between oligonucleotides and their\nWatson-Crick complements is important in reducing hybridization errors in DNA\ncomputing, DNA microarray technologies, and molecular bar coding.
