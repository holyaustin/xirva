A successful application of this method is\ngiven on a motivating example, a RNA hairpin with GCAA tetraloop, where we are\nable to provide structural evidence from computer simulations on the multiple\nintermediate states and exhibit different pictures about unfolding and\nrefolding pathways. The method is effective in dealing with high degree of\nheterogeneity in distribution, capturing structural features in multiple\npathways, and being less sensitive to the distance metric than nonlinear\ndimensionality reduction or geometric embedding methods.

Here, we present a rejection-free method for determining the\nkinetics of multivalent biomolecular interactions, and we apply the method to\nsimulate simple models for ligand-receptor interactions. Simulation results\nshow that performance of the rejection-free method is equal to or better than\nthat of the rejection method over wide parameter ranges, and the rejection-free\nmethod is more efficient for simulating systems in which aggregation is\nextensive. The rejection-free method reported here should be useful for\nsimulating a variety of systems in which multisite molecular interactions yield\nlarge molecular aggregates.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 25 Dec 2008 17:19:44 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sat, 20 Jun 2009 17:49:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 26 Jun 2009 04:05:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v4", "created": "Tue, 1 Sep 2009 18:20:00 GMT"}, {"version": "v5", "created": "Thu, 4 Mar 2010 01:23:51 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-03-04", "authors_parsed": [["Yang", "Jin", ""], ["Hlavacek", "William S.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4648", "submitter": "Kyung-Ah Sohn", "authors": "Kyung-Ah Sohn, Eric P.

This\nproblem gets further complicated in a co-clustering scenario in which one needs\nto solve multiple clustering problems simultaneously because of the presence of\ncommon centroids (e.g., ancestors) shared by clusters (e.g., possible descents\nfrom a certain ancestor) from different multiple-cluster samples (e.g.,\ndifferent human subpopulations). In this paper we present a hierarchical\nnonparametric Bayesian model to address this problem in the context of\nmulti-population haplotype inference. Uncovering the haplotypes of single\nnucleotide polymorphisms is essential for many biological and medical\napplications. While it is uncommon for the genotype data to be pooled from\nmultiple ethnically distinct populations, few existing programs have explicitly\nleveraged the individual ethnic information for haplotype inference. In this\npaper we present a new haplotype inference program, Haploi, which makes use of\nsuch information and is readily applicable to genotype sequences with thousands\nof SNPs from heterogeneous populations, with competent and sometimes superior\nspeed and accuracy comparing to the state-of-the-art programs. Underlying\nHaploi is a new haplotype distribution model based on a nonparametric Bayesian\nformalism known as the hierarchical Dirichlet process, which represents a\ntractable surrogate to the coalescent process. The proposed model is\nexchangeable, unbounded, and capable of coupling demographic information of\ndifferent populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 26 Dec 2008 06:40:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 20 Aug 2009 08:17:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-08-20", "authors_parsed": [["Sohn", "Kyung-Ah", ""], ["Xing", "Eric P.", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.4968", "submitter": "Gustav Delius", "authors": "Samik Datta, Gustav W.

A\nstochastic process is defined in which organisms undergo jumps in body size as\nthey catch and eat smaller organisms. Using a systematic expansion of the\nmaster equation, we derive a deterministic equation for the macroscopic\ndynamics, which we call the deterministic jump-growth equation, and a linear\nFokker-Planck equation for the stochastic fluctuations. The McKendrick--von\nFoerster equation, used in previous studies, is shown to be a first-order\napproximation, appropriate in equilibrium systems where predators are much\nlarger than their prey. The model has a power-law steady state consistent with\nthe approximate constancy of mass density in logarithmic intervals of body mass\noften observed in marine ecosystems. The behaviours of the stochastic process,\nthe deterministic jump-growth equation and the McKendrick--von Foerster\nequation are compared using numerical methods. The numerical analysis shows two\nclasses of attractors: steady states and travelling waves.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 29 Dec 2008 20:39:18 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 10 Jun 2009 16:35:50 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 11 Jan 2010 16:50:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-01-11", "authors_parsed": [["Datta", "Samik", ""], ["Delius", "Gustav W.", ""], ["Law", "Richard", ""]]}, {"id": "0812.5087", "submitter": "Mladen Kolar", "authors": "Mladen Kolar, Le Song, Amr Ahmed, Eric P.
