In the\nbiopsy microscope slide of membranous nephropathy, spikelike projections on the\nglomerular basement membrane is a prominent feature of the MN. However, due to\nthe whole biopsy slide contains large number of glomeruli, and each glomerulus\nincludes many spike lesions, the pathological feature of the spikes is not\nobvious. It thus is time-consuming for doctors to diagnose glomerulus one by\none and is difficult for pathologists with less experience to diagnose. In this\npaper, we establish a visualized classification model based on the multi-scale\nannotation multi-instance learning (MSA-MIL) to achieve glomerular\nclassification and spikes visualization. The MSA-MIL model mainly involves\nthree parts. Firstly, U-Net is used to extract the region of the glomeruli to\nensure that the features learned by the succeeding algorithm are focused inside\nthe glomeruli itself. Secondly, we use MIL to train an instance-level\nclassifier combined with MSA method to enhance the learning ability of the\nnetwork by adding a location-level labeled reinforced dataset, thereby\nobtaining an example-level feature representation with rich semantics. Lastly,\nthe predicted scores of each tile in the image are summarized to obtain\nglomerular classification and visualization of the classification results of\nthe spikes via the usage of sliding window method. The experimental results\nconfirm that the proposed MSA-MIL model can effectively and accurately classify\nnormal glomeruli and spiked glomerulus and visualize the position of spikes in\nthe glomerulus.

This data is often represented\nas $k$-mers, i.e., strings of some fixed length $k$ with symbols chosen from a\nreference alphabet. In contrast, some of the most effective and well-studied\nmachine learning algorithms require numerical representations of the data. The\nconcept of metric dimension of the so-called Hamming graphs presents a\npromising way to address this issue. A subset of vertices in a graph is said to\nbe resolving when the distances to those vertices uniquely characterize every\nvertex in the graph. The metric dimension of a graph is the size of a smallest\nresolving subset of vertices. Finding the metric dimension of a general graph\nis a challenging problem, NP-complete in fact. Recently, an efficient algorithm\nfor finding resolving sets in Hamming graphs has been proposed, which suffices\nto uniquely embed $k$-mers into a real vector space. Since the dimension of the\nembedding is the cardinality of the associated resolving set, determining\nwhether or not a node can be removed from a resolving set while keeping it\nresolving is of great interest. This can be quite challenging for large graphs\nsince only a brute-force approach is known for checking whether a set is a\nresolving set or not. In this thesis, we characterize resolvability of Hamming\ngraphs in terms of a linear system over a finite domain: a set of nodes is\nresolving if and only if the linear system has only a trivial solution over\nsaid domain. We can represent the domain as the roots of a polynomial system so\nthe apparatus of Gr\\\"obner bases comes in handy to determine, whether or not a\nset of nodes is resolving.

In addition to\ndetailing the main characteristics of this computational methodology, we\nillustrate its application to simulating the spread of an infectious disease in\na simple, dynamical process.

The dataset\nincluded in the analysis and training contains anonymized full blood counts\nresults from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S\\~ao\nPaulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 rt-PCR\ntest during a visit to the hospital. Patient data was anonymised by the\nhospital, clinical data was standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit\nstandard deviation. This data was made public with the aim to allow researchers\nto develop ways to enable the hospital to rapidly predict and potentially\nidentify SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. We find that with full blood counts\nrandom forest, shallow learning and a flexible ANN model predict SARS-CoV-2\npatients with high accuracy between populations on regular wards (AUC = 94-95%)\nand those not admitted to hospital or in the community (AUC=80-86%). Here, AUC\nis the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve and a measure\nfor model performance. Moreover, a simple linear combination of 4 blood counts\ncan be used to have an AUC of 85% for patients within the community. The\nnormalised data of different blood parameters from SARS-CoV-2 positive patients\nexhibit a decrease in platelets, leukocytes, eosinophils, basophils and\nlymphocytes, and an increase in monocytes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 14 Jul 2020 11:08:22 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 12 Apr 2021 10:22:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-04-13", "authors_parsed": [["Banerjee", "Abhirup", ""], ["Ray", "Surajit", ""], ["Vorselaars", "Bart", ""], ["Kitson", "Joanne", ""], ["Mamalakis", "Michail", ""], ["Weeks", "Simonne", ""], ["Baker", "Mark", ""], ["Mackenzie", "Louise S.", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.07029", "submitter": "Alexander Becker", "authors": "Vladimir Golkov, Alexander Becker, Daniel T.

Our method uses ideas from compressed sensing and\nerror-correction coding to correct for a certain number of errors in the test\nresults. The intuition is that when each individual's sample is part of many\npooled sample mixtures, the test results from all of the sample mixtures\ncontain redundant information about each individual's diagnosis, which can be\nexploited to automatically correct for wrong test results in exactly the same\nway that error correction codes correct errors introduced in noisy\ncommunication channels.

This abrupt\ntransition to periodic epidemics of high amplitude is quite accurately\npredicted by the Hopf-bifurcation curve computed from the ODE model using the\nalerting rate and the infection transmission rate for aware individuals as\ntuning parameters.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 10:16:43 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:47:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-11-11", "authors_parsed": [["Juher", "David", ""], ["Rojas", "David", ""], ["Salda\u00f1a", "Joan", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.15991", "submitter": "Sarah Friedrich", "authors": "Sarah Friedrich and Tim Friede", "title": "Causal inference methods for small non-randomized studies: Methods and\n  an application in COVID-19", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP q-bio.QM stat.ME", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The usual development cycles are too slow for the development of vaccines,\ndiagnostics and treatments in pandemics such as the ongoing SARS-CoV-2\npandemic.

Extensions\ninclude the g-computation approach, which is less frequently applied, in\nparticular in clinical studies. Moreover, doubly robust estimators provide\nadditional advantages. Here, we investigate the properties of propensity score\nbased methods including three variations of doubly robust estimators in small\nsample settings, typical for early trials, in a simulation study.

Supervised learning paradigms are often limited by the amount of\nlabeled data that is available. This phenomenon is particularly problematic in\nclinically-relevant data, such as electroencephalography (EEG), where labeling\ncan be costly in terms of specialized expertise and human processing time.\nConsequently, deep learning architectures designed to learn on EEG data have\nyielded relatively shallow models and performances at best similar to those of\ntraditional feature-based approaches. However, in most situations, unlabeled\ndata is available in abundance. By extracting information from this unlabeled\ndata, it might be possible to reach competitive performance with deep neural\nnetworks despite limited access to labels. Approach. We investigated\nself-supervised learning (SSL), a promising technique for discovering structure\nin unlabeled data, to learn representations of EEG signals. Specifically, we\nexplored two tasks based on temporal context prediction as well as contrastive\npredictive coding on two clinically-relevant problems: EEG-based sleep staging\nand pathology detection. We conducted experiments on two large public datasets\nwith thousands of recordings and performed baseline comparisons with purely\nsupervised and hand-engineered approaches. Main results. Linear classifiers\ntrained on SSL-learned features consistently outperformed purely supervised\ndeep neural networks in low-labeled data regimes while reaching competitive\nperformance when all labels were available. Additionally, the embeddings\nlearned with each method revealed clear latent structures related to\nphysiological and clinical phenomena, such as age effects. Significance. We\ndemonstrate the benefit of self-supervised learning approaches on EEG data. Our\nresults suggest that SSL may pave the way to a wider use of deep learning\nmodels on EEG data.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 14:34:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Banville", "Hubert", ""], ["Chehab", "Omar", ""], ["Hyv\u00e4rinen", "Aapo", ""], ["Engemann", "Denis-Alexander", ""], ["Gramfort", "Alexandre", ""]]}, {"id": "2007.16177", "submitter": "Drasko Tomic Dr", "authors": "Dra\\v{s}ko Tomi\\'c (1), Karolj Skala (1), Attila Marcel Szasz (2),\n  Melinda Rezeli (3), Vesna Ba\\v{c}i\\'c Vrca (4), Boris Pirki\\'c (5), Jozsef\n  Petrik (6), Vladimir Jan{\\dj}el (7), Marija Milkovi\\'c Peri\\v{s}a (8), Branka\n  Medved Rogina (9), Josip Mesari\\'c (10), Davor Davidovi\\'c (1) and Tomislav\n  Lipi\\'c (10) ((1) Center for Informatics and Computing, Ru{\\dj}er\n  Bo\\v{s}kovi\\'c Institute, Zagreb, Croatia, (2) Department of Bioinformatics\n  and Cancer Center, Semmelweis University Budapest, Hungary, (3) Department of\n  Biomedical Engineering, Lund University, Lund, Sweden, (4) Central Hospital\n  Pharmacy, Clinical Hospital Center Dubrava, Zagreb, Croatia, (5) Surgery,\n  Orthopedics and Ophthalmology Clinic, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,\n  University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, (6) Department of Medical Biochemistry\n  and Hematology, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, University of Zagreb,\n  Zagreb, Croatia, (7) Deprtment of Obstetricy, Clinical Hospital Centre\n  Zagreb, (8) Institute of Pathology, School of Medicine University of Zagreb,\n  Zagreb, Croatia, (9) Laboratory for Information and Signal Processing,\n  Division of Electronics, Ru{\\dj}er Boskovi\\'c Institute, Zagreb, Croatia,\n  (10) Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb,\n  Zagreb, Croatia, (11) Machine Learning Lab and Knowledge Representations,\n  Division of Electronics, Ru{\\dj}er Bo\\v{s}kovi\\'c Institute, Zagreb, Croatia)", "title": "Screening and evaluation of potential clinically significant HIV drug\n  combinations against SARS-CoV-2 virus", "comments": "8 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  In this study, we investigated the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike\nglycoprotein with HIV drugs and their combinations. This glycoprotein is\nessential for the reproduction of the SARS-COV-2 virus, so its inhibition opens\nnew avenues for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 disease. In doing so,\nwe used the VINI in silico model of cancer, whose high accuracy in finding\neffective drugs and their combinations was confirmed in vitro by comparison\nwith existing results from NCI-60 bases, and in vivo by comparison with\nexisting clinical trial results. In the first step, the VINI model calculated\nthe inhibition efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with 44 FDA-approved\nantiviral drugs. Of these drugs, HIV drugs have been shown to be effective,\nwhile others mainly have shown weak or no efficiency. Subsequently, the VINI\nmodel calculated the inhibition efficiency of all possible double and triple\nHIV drug combinations, and among them identified ten with the highest\ninhibition efficiency. These ten combinations were analyzed by Medscape\ndrug-drug interaction software and LexiComp Drug Interactions. All combinations\nexcept the combination of cobicistat_abacavir_rilpivirine appear to have\nserious interactions (risk rating category D) when dosage\nadjustments/reductions are required for possible toxicity. Finally, the VINI\nmodel compared the inhibition efficiency of cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine\ncombination with cocktails and individual drugs already used or planned to be\ntested against SARS-CoV-2. Combination cobicistat_abacivir_rilpivirine\ndemonstrated the highest inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein over\nothers. Thus, this combination seems to be a promising candidate for the\nfurther in vitro testing and clinical trials.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:05:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-08-03", "authors_parsed": [["Tomi\u0107", "Dra\u0161ko", ""], ["Skala", "Karolj", ""], ["Szasz", "Attila Marcel", ""], ["Rezeli", "Melinda", ""], ["Vrca", "Vesna Ba\u010di\u0107", ""], ["Pirki\u0107", "Boris", ""], ["Petrik", "Jozsef", ""], ["Jan\u0111el", "Vladimir", ""], ["Peri\u0161a", "Marija Milkovi\u0107", ""], ["Rogina", "Branka Medved", ""], ["Mesari\u0107", "Josip", ""], ["Davidovi\u0107", "Davor", ""], ["Lipi\u0107", "Tomislav", ""]]}]
