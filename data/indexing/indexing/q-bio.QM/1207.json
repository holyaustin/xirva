In recent years these methods\nhave demonstrated their potential for solving optimization and analysis\nproblems on large-scale networks.

Therefore, slowed-down Brownian motion could be\nconsidered the macroscopic limit of transient anomalous diffusion. On the other\nhand, membranes are also heterogeneous media in which Brownian motion may be\nlocally slowed-down due to variations in lipid composition. Here, we\ninvestigate whether both situations lead to a similar behavior for the\nreversible ligand-binding reaction in 2d. We compare the (long-time)\nequilibrium properties obtained with transient anomalous diffusion due to\nobstacle hindrance or power-law distributed residence times (continuous-time\nrandom walks) to those obtained with space-dependent slowed-down Brownian\nmotion. Using theoretical arguments and Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that\nthose three scenarios have distinctive effects on the apparent affinity of the\nreaction. While continuous-time random walks decrease the apparent affinity of\nthe reaction, locally slowed-down Brownian motion and local hinderance by\nobstacles both improve it. However, only in the case of slowed-down Brownian\nmotion, the affinity is maximal when the slowdown is restricted to a subregion\nof the available space.
