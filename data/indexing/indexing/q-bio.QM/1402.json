The number of words arising from n tandem\nduplications can then be recursively derived. Secondly, each single word\naccounts for multiple evolutions. With the aid of a bi-coloured 2d- tree, a\nHasse diagram corresponding to a partially ordered set is constructed, from\nwhich we can count the number of evolutions corresponding to a given word.\nThirdly, we implement some subtree prune and graft operations on this structure\nto show that the total number of possible evolutions arising from n tandem\nduplications is $\\prod_{k=1}^n(4^k - (2k + 1))$. The space of structures\narising from tandem duplication thus grows at a super-exponential rate with\nleading order term $\\mathcal{O}(4^{\\frac{1}{2}n^2})$.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 17:11:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-11-25", "authors_parsed": [["Penso-Dolfin", "L", ""], ["Greenman", "CD", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.0136", "submitter": "Wei Sun", "authors": "Wei Sun, Yufeng Liu, James J.

With modern metagenomic sequencing methods it is possible\nto follow the relative abundance of microbes in a community over time. These\nmicrobial communities exhibit rich ecological dynamics and an important goal of\nmicrobial ecology is to infer the interactions between species from sequence\ndata. Any algorithm for inferring species interactions must overcome three\nobstacles: 1) a correlation between the abundances of two species does not\nimply that those species are interacting, 2) the sum constraint on the relative\nabundances obtained from metagenomic studies makes it difficult to infer the\nparameters in timeseries models, and 3) errors due to experimental uncertainty,\nor mis-assignment of sequencing reads into operational taxonomic units, bias\ninferences of species interactions. Here we introduce an approach, Learning\nInteractions from MIcrobial Time Series (LIMITS), that overcomes these\nobstacles. LIMITS uses sparse linear regression with boostrap aggregation to\ninfer a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model for microbial dynamics. We tested\nLIMITS on synthetic data and showed that it could reliably infer the topology\nof the inter-species ecological interactions. We then used LIMITS to\ncharacterize the species interactions in the gut microbiomes of two individuals\nand found that the interaction networks varied significantly between\nindividuals.

Complex systems of moving and interacting objects are ubiquitous in the\nnatural and social sciences. Predicting their behavior often requires models\nthat mimic these systems with sufficient accuracy, while accounting for their\ninherent stochasticity.

We propose such a framework, using a novel application of the Earth\nmover's distance, also known as the Wasserstein metric. It is applicable to any\nstochastic process where the probability of the model's state at time $t$ is a\nfunction of the state at previous times. It generalizes the concept of a\nresidual, often used to analyze 1D summary statistics, to situations where the\ncomplexity of the underlying model's probability distribution makes standard\nresidual analysis too imprecise for practical use.\n  3.

Measurement of KEH performed on adult non-breeding male and female\nbullheads exposed for 14 and 21 days to 0, 1.26 and 6.50 mu g/L showed that\nkidney hypertrophy is induced in a dose-dependent manner, confirming the\nhypothesis that the European bullhead possesses a potential biomarker of\nandrogen exposure. Combined with the wide distribution of the European bullhead\nin European countries and the potential of this fish species for environmental\ntoxicology studies in field and laboratory conditions, the hypothesis of a\npotential biomarker of androgen exposure offers interesting perspectives for\nthe use of the bullhead as a relevant sentinel fish species in monitoring\nstudies.

Conclusions: The novel thin-tail test provides an efficient and\neffective means for distinguishing CRMs from NCNRs based on the specific\nstatistical properties of CRMs and can guide future experiments aimed at\nfinding new CRMs in the post-genome time.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 16:25:09 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 12:22:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-02-28", "authors_parsed": [["Shu", "Jian-Jun", ""], ["Li", "Yajing", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6260", "submitter": "Jozsef Farkas", "authors": "A.

Methods: Chinese pulse curves are\ntreated as wave signals. Multidimensional variable analysis is performed to\nprovide the best curve fit between the recorded Chinese pulse waveforms and the\ncollective Gamma density functions. Results: Chinese pulses can be recognized\nquantitatively by the newly-developed four classification indices, that is, the\nwave length, the relative phase difference, the rate parameter, and the peak\nratio. The new quantitative classification not only reduces the dependency of\npulse diagnosis on Chinese physician's experience, but also is able to\ninterpret pathological wrist-pulse waveforms more precisely. Conclusions:\nTraditionally, Chinese physicians use fingertips to feel the wrist-pulses of\npatients in order to determine their health conditions. The qualitative theory\nof the Chinese pulse diagnosis is based on the experience of Chinese physicians\nfor thousands of years. However, there are no quantitative theories to relate\nthese different wrist-pulse waveforms to the health conditions of patients. In\nthis paper, new quantified classification indices have been introduced to\ninterpret the Chinese pulse waveform patterns objectively.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 16:00:38 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 28 Feb 2014 14:43:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Shu", "Jian-Jun", ""], ["Sun", "Yuguang", ""]]}, {"id": "1402.6770", "submitter": "Jerome Vanclay", "authors": "Jerome K Vanclay", "title": "Unsuspected implications arising from assumptions in simulations:\n  insights from recasting a forest growth model in system dynamics", "comments": "17 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "Forest Ecosystems 2014, 1:7", "doi": "10.1186/2197-5620-1-7", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Familiarity with a simulation platform can seduce modellers into accepting\nuntested assumptions for convenience of implementation.

In the absence of rich enough gold standard data sets, the\nperformance of these methods is generally assessed using unrealistic simulation\nstudies, or based on small real data analyses. We have designed and implemented\na framework to generate realistic DNA copy number profiles of cancer samples\nwith known truth. These profiles are generated by resampling real SNP\nmicroarray data from genomic regions with known copy-number state. The original\nreal data have been extracted from dilutions series of tumor cell lines with\nmatched blood samples at several concentrations. Therefore, the signal-to-noise\nratio of the generated profiles can be controlled through the (known)\npercentage of tumor cells in the sample. In this paper, we describe this\nframework and illustrate some of the benefits of the proposed data generation\napproach on a practical use case: a comparison study between methods for\nsegmenting DNA copy number profiles from SNP microarrays. This study indicates\nthat no single method is uniformly better than all others. It also helps\nidentifying pros and cons for the compared methods as a function of\nbiologically informative parameters, such as the fraction of tumor cells in the\nsample and the proportion of heterozygous markers.
