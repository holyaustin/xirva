Mathematical modeling\nis used as a systems biology tool to answer biological questions, and more\nprecisely, to validate a network that describes biological observations and to\npredict the effect of perturbations.\n  We propose a modeling approach that is intrinsically continuous in time. The\nalgorithm presented here fills the gap between qualitative and quantitative\nmodeling. It is based on continuous time Markov process applied on a Boolean\nstate space. In order to describe the temporal evolution, we explicitly specify\nthe transition rates for each node. For that purpose, we built a language that\ncan be seen as a generalization of Boolean equations. The values of transition\nrates have a natural interpretation: it is the inverse of the time for the\ntransition to occur. Mathematically, this approach can be translated in a set\nof ordinary differential equations on probability distributions; therefore, it\ncan be seen as an approach in between quantitative and qualitative.\n  We developed a C++ software, MaBoSS, that is able to simulate such a system\nby applying Kinetic Monte-Carlo (or Gillespie algorithm) in the Boolean state\nspace. This software, parallelized and optimized, computes temporal evolution\nof probability distributions and can also estimate stationary distributions.\nApplications of Boolean Kinetic Monte-Carlo have been demonstrated for two\nqualitative models: a toy model and a published p53/Mdm2 model. Our approach\nallows to describe kinetic phenomena which were difficult to handle in the\noriginal models. In particular, transient effects are represented by time\ndependent probability distributions, interpretable in terms of cell\npopulations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 4 Apr 2012 16:47:33 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 29 May 2012 13:51:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-05-30", "authors_parsed": [["Stoll", "Gautier", ""], ["Viara", "Eric", ""], ["Barillot", "Emmanuel", ""], ["Calzone", "Laurence", ""]]}, {"id": "1204.2180", "submitter": "Yury Person", "authors": "Maria Axenovich, Yury Person, Svetlana Puzynina", "title": "A regularity lemma and twins in words", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "math.CO cs.DM q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  For a word $S$, let $f(S)$ be the largest integer $m$ such that there are two\ndisjoints identical (scattered) subwords of length $m$.

An advantage of RDMEX is that it can readily be used to model\nmolecular communication networks with multiple transmitters and receivers.
