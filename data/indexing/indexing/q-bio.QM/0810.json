When no treatment\nis applied the model reproduces the typical dynamics of early tumor growth. The\ninitially avascular tumor reaches a diffusion limited size of the order of\nmillimeters and initiates angiogenesis through the release of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by hypoxic cells in the core of the\ntumor. This stimulates endothelial cells to migrate towards the tumor and\nestablishes a nutrient supply sufficient for sustained invasion. To this model\nwe apply cytostatic treatment in the form of a VEGF-inhibitor, which reduces\nthe proliferation and chemotaxis of endothelial cells. This treatment has the\ncapability to reduce tumor mass, but more importantly, we were able to\ndetermine that inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation is the more\nimportant of the two cellular functions targeted by the drug. Further, we\nconsidered the application of a cytotoxic drug that targets proliferating tumor\ncells. The drug was treated as a diffusible substance entering the tissue from\nthe blood vessels. Our results show that depending on the characteristics of\nthe drug it can either reduce the tumor mass significantly or in fact\naccelerate the growth rate of the tumor.
