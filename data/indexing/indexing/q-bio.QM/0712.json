But, what is a complex network, i.e.\\\nhow can one quantify the complexity of a graph? Here the Offdiagonal Complexity\n(OdC), a new, and computationally cheap, measure of complexity is defined,\nbased on the node-node link cross-distribution, whose nondiagonal elements\ncharacterize the graph structure beyond link distribution, cluster coefficient\nand average path length. The OdC apporach is applied to the {\\sl Helicobacter\npylori} protein interaction network and randomly rewired surrogates thereof. In\naddition, OdC is used to characterize the spatial complexity of cell\naggregates. We investigate the earliest embryo development states of\nCaenorhabditis elegans. The development states of the premorphogenetic phase\nare represented by symmetric binary-valued cell connection matrices with\ndimension growing from 4 to 385. These matrices can be interpreted as adjacency\nmatrix of an undirected graph, or network. The OdC approach allows to describe\nquantitatively the complexity of the cell aggregate geometry.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2007 11:54:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-12-28", "authors_parsed": [["Claussen", "Jens Christian", "", "University Kiel, Germany"]]}, {"id": "0712.4224", "submitter": "Jens Christian Claussen", "authors": "Jens Christian Claussen", "title": "Drift reversal in asymmetric coevolutionary conflicts: Influence of\n  microscopic processes and population size", "comments": "9 pages, color online figs on p.3+4", "journal-ref": "European Physical Journal B 60, 391-399 (2007)", "doi": "10.1140/epjb/e2007-00357-2", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph q-bio.QM", "license": null, "abstract": "  The coevolutionary dynamics in finite populations currently is investigated\nin a wide range of disciplines, as chemical catalysis, biological evolution,\nsocial and economic systems. The dynamics of those systems can be formulated\nwithin the unifying framework of evolutionary game theory. However it is not a\npriori clear which mathematical description is appropriate when populations are\nnot infinitely large. Whereas the replicator equation approach describes the\ninfinite population size limit by deterministic differential equations, in\nfinite populations the dynamics is inherently stochastic which can lead to new\neffects. Recently, an explicit mean-field description in the form of a\nFokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent selection in finite\npopulations based on microscopic processes. In asymmetric conflicts between two\npopulations with a cyclic dominance, a finite-size dependent drift reversal was\ndemonstrated, depending on the underlying microscopic process of the\nevolutionary update. Cyclic dynamics appears widely in biological coevolution,\nbe it within a homogeneous population, or be it between disjunct populations as\nfemale and male. Here explicit analytic address is given and the average drift\nis calculated for the frequency-dependent Moran process and for different\npairwise comparison processes. It is explicitely shown that the drift reversal\ncannot occur if the process relies on payoff differences between pairs of\nindividuals. Further, also a linear comparison with the average payoff does not\nlead to a drift towards the internal fixed point. Hence the nonlinear\ncomparison function of the frequency-dependent Moran process, together with its\nusage of nonlocal information via the average payoff, is the essential part of\nthe mechanism.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 27 Dec 2007 12:08:59 GMT"}], "update_date": "2012-06-12", "authors_parsed": [["Claussen", "Jens Christian", ""]]}, {"id": "0712.4248", "submitter": "Reinhard Laubenbacher", "authors": "Reinhard Laubenbacher and Bernd Sturmfels", "title": "Computer algebra in systems biology", "comments": "to appear in American Mathematical Monthly", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.SC q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Systems biology focuses on the study of entire biological systems rather than\non their individual components.
