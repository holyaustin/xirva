A key\naspect of our work is the modeling of single-cell variability by assigning a\nprobability distribution to intervals of initial concentration values and\nkinetic rate constants. We propagate this distribution through the system\ndynamics to obtain a distribution over the set of trajectories of the ODEs.\nThis in turn opens the door for performing statistical analysis of the ODE\nsystem's behavior. To illustrate this we first encode quantitative data and\nqualitative trends as bounded linear time temporal logic (BLTL) formulas. Based\non this we construct a parameter estimation method using an SMC-driven\nevaluation procedure applied to the stochastic version of the behavior of the\nODE system. We then describe how this SMC framework can be generalized to\nhybrid automata by exploiting the given distribution over the initial states\nand the--much more sophisticated--system dynamics to associate a Markov chain\nwith the hybrid automaton. We then establish a strong relationship between the\nbehaviors of the hybrid automaton and its associated Markov chain.\nConsequently, we sample trajectories from the hybrid automaton in a way that\nmimics the sampling of the trajectories of the Markov chain. This enables us to\nverify approximately that the Markov chain meets a BLTL specification with high\nprobability. We have applied these methods to ODE based models of Toll-like\nreceptor signaling and the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis, as well\nas to systems exhibiting hybrid dynamics including the circadian clock pathway\nand cardiac cell physiology. We present an overview of these applications and\nsummarize the main empirical results.

These systems often consist of interacting subsystems,\nwhose characterization is of importance for a complete understanding of the\nbrain interaction processes. To address this issue, we present a technique,\nnamely the bispectral Pairwise Interacting Source Analysis (biPISA), for\nanalyzing systems of cross-frequency interacting brain sources when\nmultichannel electroencephalographic (EEG) or magnetoencephalographic (MEG)\ndata are available. Specifically, the biPISA allows to identify one or many\nsubsystems of cross-frequency interacting sources by decomposing the\nantisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra between EEG or MEG signals,\nbased on the assumption that interactions are pairwise. Thanks to the\nproperties of the antisymmetric components of the cross-bispectra, biPISA is\nalso robust to spurious interactions arising from mixing artifacts, i.e. volume\nconduction or field spread, which always affect EEG or MEG functional\nconnectivity estimates. This method is an extension of the Pairwise Interacting\nSource Analysis (PISA), which was originally introduced for investigating\ninteractions at the same frequency, to the study of cross-frequency\ninteractions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated in simulations\nfor up to three interacting source pairs, and for real MEG recordings of\nspontaneous brain activity. Simulations show that the performances of biPISA in\nestimating the phase difference between the interacting sources are affected by\nthe increasing level of noise rather than by the number of the interacting\nsubsystems.

Using an\nintegrated approach comprising structural, biochemical, biophysical and\nsingle-molecule fluorescence methods, we show that Cdk2$/$cyclin A-bound p27\nsamples lowly-populated conformations that dynamically anticipate the\nsequential steps of this signaling cascade. \"Dynamic anticipation\" provides\naccess to the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, BCR-ABL and Src, which\nsequentially phosphorylate Y88 and Y74 and promote intra-assembly\nphosphorylation (of p27) on distal T187. Tyrosine phosphorylation also\nallosterically relieves p27-dependent inhibition of substrate binding to\nCdk2$/$cyclin A, a phenomenon we term \"cross-complex allostery\". Even when\ntightly bound to Cdk2$/$cyclin A, intrinsic flexibility enables p27 to\nintegrate and process signaling inputs, and generate outputs including altered\nCdk2 activity, p27 stability, and, ultimately, cell cycle progression.\nIntrinsic dynamics within multi-component assemblies may be a general mechanism\nof signaling by regulatory IDPs, which can be subverted in human disease, as\nexemplified by hyper-active BCR-ABL and Src in certain cancers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 17 Dec 2018 19:21:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-19", "authors_parsed": [["Tsytlonok", "Maksym", ""], ["Sanabria", "Hugo", ""], ["Wang", "Yuefeng", ""], ["Felekyan", "Suren", ""], ["Hemmen", "Katherina", ""], ["Phillips", "Aaron", ""], ["Yun", "Mi-Kyung", ""], ["Waddell", "Brett", ""], ["Park", "Cheon-Gil", ""], ["Vaithiyalingam", "Sivaraja", ""], ["Iconaru", "Luigi", ""], ["White", "Stephen W.", ""], ["Tompa", "Peter", ""], ["Seidel", "Claus A.

However, classification performance obtained with\ndifferent approaches is difficult to compare and these studies are also\ndifficult to reproduce. In the present paper, we first extend a previously\nproposed framework to diffusion MRI data for AD classification. Specifically,\nwe add: conversion of diffusion MRI ADNI data into the BIDS standard and\npipelines for diffusion MRI preprocessing and feature extraction. We then apply\nthe framework to compare different components. First, FS has a positive impact\non classification results: highest balanced accuracy (BA) improved from 0.76 to\n0.82 for task CN vs AD. Secondly, voxel-wise features generally gives better\nperformance than regional features. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean\ndiffusivity (MD) provided comparable results for voxel-wise features. Moreover,\nwe observe that the poor performance obtained in tasks involving MCI were\npotentially caused by the small data samples, rather than by the data\nimbalance. Furthermore, no extensive classification difference exists for\ndifferent degree of smoothing and registration methods. Besides, we demonstrate\nthat using non-nested validation of FS leads to unreliable and over-optimistic\nresults: 0.05 up to 0.40 relative increase in BA.
