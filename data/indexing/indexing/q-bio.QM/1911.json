Similarly, numerous small terrestrial animals move through\ncluttered terrain where 3-D, multi-component obstacles like grass, shrubs,\nvines, and leaf litter resist motion, but it is unknown whether their body\nshape plays a major role in traversal. Few ground vehicles or terrestrial\nrobots have used body shape to effectively traverse cluttered terrain. Here, we\nchallenged forest-floor-dwelling discoid cockroaches possessing a thin, rounded\nbody to traverse tall, narrowly spaced, vertical, grass-like compliant beams.\nAnimals displayed high traversal performance (79 +/- 12% probability and 3.4\n+/- 0.7 s time). Although we observed diverse traversal strategies, cockroaches\nprimarily (48 +/- 9 % probability) used a novel roll maneuver, allowing them to\nrapidly traverse obstacle gaps narrower than half body width (2.0 +/- 0.5 s\ntraversal time). Reduction of body roundness by addition of artificial shells\nnearly inhibited roll maneuvers and decreased traversal performance. Inspired\nby this discovery, we added a thin, rounded exoskeletal shell to a legged robot\nwith a nearly cuboidal body, common to many existing terrestrial robots.\nWithout adding sensory feedback or changing the open-loop control, the rounded\nshell enabled the robot to traverse beam obstacles with gaps narrower than\nshell width via body roll. Terradynamically streamlined shapes can reduce\nterrain resistance and enhance traversability by assisting effective body\nreorientation via distributed mechanical feedback. Our findings highlight the\nneed to consider body shape to improve robot mobility in real-world terrain\noften filled with clutter, and to develop better locomotor-ground contact\nmodels to understand interaction with complex terrain.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Nov 2019 15:37:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-11-06", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chen", ""], ["Pullin", "Andrew O.", ""], ["Haldane", "Duncan W.", ""], ["Lam", "Han K.", ""], ["Fearing", "Ronald S.", ""], ["Full", "Robert J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.02095", "submitter": "Gowri Nayar", "authors": "Edward E.

We introduce a novel measure of\nirreversibility we term the entropy production factor (EPF) to quantify how\ntime reversal symmetry is broken in field theories across scales. We use the\nEPF to characterize a dynamical phase transition in simulations of the\nBrusselator, a prototypical biochemically motivated non-linear oscillator. The\nEPF quantifies the distribution of irreversibility across spatiotemporal\nfrequencies as the Brusselator transitions from local to global coherent\noscillations, bounding the energetic cost to establish spatially synchronized\nbiochemical oscillations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Nov 2019 04:14:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 15 Jan 2020 20:41:42 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 19 Aug 2020 18:06:32 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-22", "authors_parsed": [["Seara", "Daniel S.", ""], ["Machta", "Benjamin B.", ""], ["Murrell", "Michael P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.10978", "submitter": "Brendan Odigwe", "authors": "Brendan E.

However, their\nextrapolated predictive performance remains unclear.Therefore,in this study,we\naimed to evaluate their external predictability and identify their potential\ninfluencing factors. Methods:The external predictability of each selected popPK\nmodel was evaluated using an independent dataset of 84 patients with 572 trough\nconcentrations prospectively collected from Huashan Hospital. Prediction and\nsimulation based diagnostics and Bayesian forecasting were conducted to\nevaluate model predictability. Furthermore, the effect of model structure on\nthe predictive performance was investigated.Results:Sixteen published popPK\nmodels were assessed. In prediction-based diagnostics,the prediction error\nwithin 30% was below 50% in all the published models. The simulation based\nnormalised prediction distribution error test and visual predictive check\nindicated large discrepancies between the observations and simulations in most\nof the models. Bayesian forecasting showed improvement in model predictability\nwith two to three prior observations. Additionally, the predictive performance\nof the nonlinear Michaelis Menten model was superior to that of linear\ncompartment models,indicating the underlying nonlinear kinetics of tacrolimus\nin liver transplant recipients.Conclusions:The published models performed\ninadequately in prediction and simulation based diagnostics. Bayesian\nforecasting may improve the predictive performance of the models. Furthermore,\nnonlinear kinetics of tacrolimus may be mainly caused by the properties of the\ndrug itself, and incorporating nonlinear kinetics may be considered to improve\nmodel predictability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 Nov 2019 00:43:13 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-02-20", "authors_parsed": [["Cai", "Xiaojun", ""], ["Li", "Ruidong", ""], ["Sheng", "Changcheng", ""], ["Tao", "Yifeng", ""], ["Zhang", "Quanbao", ""], ["Zhang", "Xiaofei", ""], ["Li", "Juan", ""], ["Shen", "Conghuan", ""], ["Qiu", "Xiaoyan", ""], ["Wang", "Zhengxin", ""], ["Jiao", "Zheng", ""]]}, {"id": "1911.13077", "submitter": "Kazuya Nishimura", "authors": "Kazuya Nishimura, Dai Fei Elmer Ker, Ryoma Bise", "title": "Weakly Supervised Cell Instance Segmentation by Propagating from\n  Detection Response", "comments": "9 pages, 3 figures, Accepted in MICCAI 2019", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "eess.IV cs.CV q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Cell shape analysis is important in biomedical research. Deep learning\nmethods may perform to segment individual cells if they use sufficient training\ndata that the boundary of each cell is annotated. However, it is very\ntime-consuming for preparing such detailed annotation for many cell culture\nconditions. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised method that can\nsegment individual cell regions who touch each other with unclear boundaries in\ndense conditions without the training data for cell regions. We demonstrated\nthe efficacy of our method using several data-set including multiple cell types\ncaptured by several types of microscopy. Our method achieved the highest\naccuracy compared with several conventional methods. In addition, we\ndemonstrated that our method can perform without any annotation by using\nfluorescence images that cell nuclear were stained as training data.

However, the reliability of connection\ninferences from dMRI-based fiber tracking is still debated, due to low\nsensitivity, dominance of false positives, and inaccurate and incomplete\nreconstruction of long-range connections. Furthermore, parameters of tracking\nalgorithms are typically tuned in a heuristic way, which leaves room for\nmanipulation of an intended result. Here we propose a data-driven framework to\noptimize and validate parameters of dMRI-based fiber-tracking algorithms using\nneural tracer data as a reference. Japan's Brain/MINDS Project provides\ninvaluable datasets containing both dMRI and neural tracer data from the same\nprimates. We considered four criteria for goodness of fiber tracking:\ndistance-weighted coverage, true/false positive ratio, projection coincidence,\nand commissural passage, applied using a multi-objective optimization\nalgorithm. We implemented a variant of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm\nII (NSGA-II) to optimize five major parameters of a global fiber-tracking\nalgorithm over multiple brain samples in parallel. Using optimized parameters\ncompared to the default parameters, dMRI-based fiber tracking performance was\nsignificantly improved, while minimizing false positives and impossible\ncross-hemisphere connections. Parameters optimized for 10 tracer injection\nsites showed good generalization capability for other brain samples. These\nresults demonstrate the importance of data-driven adjustment of fiber-tracking\nalgorithms and support the validity of dMRI-based tractography, if appropriate\nadjustments are employed.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Nov 2019 15:22:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 24 Apr 2020 17:43:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-04-28", "authors_parsed": [["Gutierrez", "Carlos Enrique", ""], ["Skibbe", "Henrik", ""], ["Nakae", "Ken", ""], ["Tsukada", "Hiromichi", ""], ["Lienard", "Jean", ""], ["Watakabe", "Akiya", ""], ["Hata", "Junichi", ""], ["Reisert", "Marco", ""], ["Woodward", "Alexander", ""], ["Okano", "Hideyuki", ""], ["Yamamori", "Tetsuo", ""], ["Yamaguchi", "Yoko", ""], ["Ishii", "Shin", ""], ["Doya", "Kenji", ""]]}]
