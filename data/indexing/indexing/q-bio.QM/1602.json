Here, we analyse the collective motion and\nthe response to visual stimuli in two morphologically different strains (TL and\nAB) of zebrafish. For both strains, we observe 10 groups of 5 and 10 zebrafish\nswimming freely in a large experimental tank with two identical attractive\nlandmarks (cylinders or disks) for one hour. We track the positions of the fish\nby an automated tracking method and compute several metrics at the group level.\nFirst, the probability of presence shows that both strains avoid free space and\nare more likely to swim in the vicinity of the walls of the tank and the\nattractive landmarks. Second, the analysis of landmarks occupancy shows that AB\nzebrafish are more present in their vicinity than TL zebrafish and that both\nstrains regularly transit from one landmark to the other with no preference on\nthe long duration. Finally, TL zebrafish show a higher cohesion than AB\nzebrafish. Thus, landmarks and duration of the repicates allow to reveal\ncollective behavioural variabilities among different strains of zebrafish.\nThese results provide a new insight into the need to take into account\nindividual variability of zebrafish strains for studying collective behaviour.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 19:33:51 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:27:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 10:06:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-01-12", "authors_parsed": [["S\u00e9guret", "Axel", ""], ["Collignon", "Bertrand", ""], ["Halloy", "Jos\u00e9", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.00467", "submitter": "Giuseppe Jurman", "authors": "Giuseppe Jurman and Michele Filosi and Samantha Riccadonna and Roberto\n  Visintainer and Cesare Furlanello", "title": "Differential network analysis and graph classification: a glocal\n  approach", "comments": "Submitted for BMTL 2015 Proceedings", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.MN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Based on the glocal HIM metric and its induced graph kernel, we propose a\nnovel solution in differential network analysis that integrates network\ncomparison and classification tasks.

Mapping these\nconnection topographies, or 'connectopies' in short, is crucial for\nunderstanding how information is processed in the brain. Here, we propose\nprincipled, fully data-driven methods for mapping connectopies using functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired at rest by combining spectral\nembedding of voxel-wise connectivity 'fingerprints' with a novel approach to\nspatial statistical inference. We applied the approach in human primary motor\nand visual cortex, and show that it can trace biologically plausible,\noverlapping connectopies in individual subjects that follow these regions'\nsomatotopic and retinotopic maps. As a generic mechanism to perform inference\nover connectopies, the new spatial statistics approach enables rigorous\nstatistical testing of hypotheses regarding the fine-grained spatial profile of\nfunctional connectivity and whether that profile is different between subjects\nor between experimental conditions. The combined framework offers a fundamental\nalternative to existing approaches to investigating functional connectivity in\nthe brain, from voxel- or seed-pair wise characterizations of functional\nassociation, towards a full, multivariate characterization of spatial\ntopography.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 09:35:34 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 09:39:28 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-07-18", "authors_parsed": [["Haak", "Koen V.", ""], ["Marquand", "Andre F.", ""], ["Beckmann", "Christian F.", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07181", "submitter": "Peter Schuck", "authors": "Abhiksha Desai, Jonathan Krynitsky, Thomas J.

A key mechanical element in AUC is the centerpiece, a\ncomponent of the sample cell assembly that is mounted between the optical\nwindows to allow imaging and to seal the sample solution column against high\nvacuum while exposed to gravitational forces in excess of 300,000 g. For\nsedimentation velocity it needs to be precisely sector-shaped to allow\nunimpeded radial macromolecular migration. During the history of AUC a great\nvariety of centerpiece designs have been developed for different types of\nexperiments. Here, we report that centerpieces can now be readily fabricated by\n3D printing at low cost, from a variety of materials, and with customized\ndesigns. The new centerpieces can exhibit sufficient mechanical stability to\nwithstand the gravitational forces at the highest rotor speeds and be\nsufficiently precise for sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity\nexperiments. Sedimentation velocity experiments with bovine serum albumin as a\nreference molecule in 3D printed centerpieces with standard double-sector\ndesign result in sedimentation boundaries virtually indistinguishable from\nthose in commercial double-sector epoxy centerpieces, with sedimentation\ncoefficients well within the range of published values. The statistical error\nof the measurement is slightly above that obtained with commercial epoxy, but\nstill below 1%. Facilitated by modern open-source design and fabrication\nparadigms, we believe 3D printed centerpieces and AUC accessories can spawn a\nvariety of improvements in AUC experimental design, efficiency and resource\nallocation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 15:02:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-08-23", "authors_parsed": [["Desai", "Abhiksha", ""], ["Krynitsky", "Jonathan", ""], ["Pohida", "Thomas J.", ""], ["Zhao", "Huaying", ""], ["Schuck", "Peter", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07207", "submitter": "Christian R\\\"over", "authors": "Steffen Unkel, Christian R\\\"over, Nigel Stallard, Norbert Benda,\n  Martin Posch, Sarah Zohar, Tim Friede", "title": "Systematic reviews in paediatric multiple sclerosis and\n  Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease exemplify shortcomings in methods used to evaluate\n  therapies in rare conditions", "comments": "11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables", "journal-ref": "Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases, 11:16, 2016", "doi": "10.1186/s13023-016-0402-6", "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM stat.AP", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard design\nof clinical research to assess interventions. However, RCTs cannot always be\napplied for practical or ethical reasons. To investigate the current practices\nin rare diseases, we review evaluations of therapeutic interventions in\npaediatric multiple sclerosis (MS) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In\nparticular, we shed light on the endpoints used, the study designs implemented\nand the statistical methodologies applied.\n  METHODS: We conducted literature searches to identify relevant primary\nstudies. Data on study design, objectives, endpoints, patient characteristics,\nrandomization and masking, type of intervention, control, withdrawals and\nstatistical methodology were extracted from the selected studies. The risk of\nbias and the quality of the studies were assessed.\n  RESULTS: Twelve (seven) primary studies on paediatric MS (CJD) were included\nin the qualitative synthesis. No double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled\ntrial for evaluating interventions in paediatric MS has been published yet.\nEvidence from one open-label RCT is available. The observational studies are\nbefore-after studies or controlled studies. Three of the seven selected studies\non CJD are RCTs, of which two received the maximum mark on the Oxford Quality\nScale. Four trials are controlled observational studies.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from double-blind RCTs on the efficacy of treatments\nappears to be variable between rare diseases. With regard to paediatric\nconditions it remains to be seen what impact regulators will have through e.g.,\npaediatric investigation plans. Overall, there is space for improvement by\nusing innovative trial designs and data analysis techniques.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 21 Feb 2016 16:28:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-25", "authors_parsed": [["Unkel", "Steffen", ""], ["R\u00f6ver", "Christian", ""], ["Stallard", "Nigel", ""], ["Benda", "Norbert", ""], ["Posch", "Martin", ""], ["Zohar", "Sarah", ""], ["Friede", "Tim", ""]]}, {"id": "1602.07758", "submitter": "Scott Hotton", "authors": "Scott Hotton", "title": "A geometric invariant for the study of planar curves and its application\n  to spiral tip meander", "comments": "19 pages, 15 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.SC q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Planar curves with periodically varying curvature arise in the natural\nsciences as the result of a wide variety of periodic processes.

We\nalso demonstrate that our kinship coefficient estimates outperform\nstate-of-the-art covariance-based approaches and PLINK's kinship estimate.\n  To assess the kinship-corrected association test, we simulated individuals\nfrom deep pedigrees and drew one site to recessively determine the disease\nstatus. We applied our EM algorithm to estimate the kinship coefficients and\nran a kinship-adjusted association test. Our approach compares favorably with\nthe state-of-the-art and far out-performs a na\\\"ive association test.\n  We advocate use of our method to detect cryptic relationships and for\ncorrecting association tests.

Coregulation can also arise through the physical\nassociation of multi-gene complexes through chromosomal looping, which are then\ntranscribed together.

We provide\nfurther analysis of the stability of small networks of both kinds through\nsimulations.
