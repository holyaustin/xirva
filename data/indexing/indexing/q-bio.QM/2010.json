In this paper, we investigate how functional\nconnectivity in males and females differs in an age prediction framework. We\nfirst estimate functional connectivity between regions-of-interest (ROIs) using\ndistance correlation instead of Pearson's correlation. Distance correlation, as\na multivariate statistical method, explores spatial relations of voxel-wise\ntime courses within individual ROIs and measures both linear and nonlinear\ndependence, capturing more complex information of between-ROI interactions.\nThen, a novel non-convex multi-task learning (NC-MTL) model is proposed to\nstudy age-related gender differences in functional connectivity, where age\nprediction for each gender group is viewed as one task. Specifically, in the\nproposed NC-MTL model, we introduce a composite regularizer with a combination\nof non-convex $\\ell_{2,1-2}$ and $\\ell_{1-2}$ regularization terms for\nselecting both common and task-specific features. Finally, we validate the\nproposed NC-MTL model along with distance correlation based functional\nconnectivity on rs-fMRI of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort for\npredicting ages of both genders. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed NC-MTL model outperforms other competing MTL models in age prediction,\nas well as characterizing developmental gender differences in functional\nconnectivity patterns.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 30 Sep 2020 21:48:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-02", "authors_parsed": [["Xiao", "Li", ""], ["Cai", "Biao", ""], ["Qu", "Gang", ""], ["Stephen", "Julia M.", ""], ["Wilson", "Tony W.", ""], ["Calhoun", "Vince D.", ""], ["Wang", "Yu-Ping", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.00124", "submitter": "Konstantinos Zygalakis", "authors": "Christian A.

To achieve internationally agreed\ntargets for HIV control and elimination, test-and-treat prevention efforts have\nbeen dramatically intensified over the period 2010-2015, and, from 2016,\nfurther strengthened by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n  Methods: Application of a novel age-stratified back-calculation approach to\ndata on new HIV diagnoses and CD4 count-at-diagnosis, enabled age-specific\nestimation of HIV incidence, undiagnosed infections and mean time-to-diagnosis\nacross both the 2010-2015 and 2016-2018 periods. Estimated incidence trends\nwere then extrapolated, to quantify the likelihood of achieving HIV elimination\nby 2030.\n  Findings: A fall in HIV incidence in MSM is estimated to have started in\n2012/3, eighteen months before the observed fall in new diagnoses. A steep\ndecrease from 2,770 annual infections (95% credible interval 2.490-3,040) in\n2013 to 1,740 (1,500-2,010) in 2015 is estimated, followed by steady decline\nfrom 2016, reaching 854 (441-1,540) infections in 2018. A decline is\nconsistently estimated in all age groups, with a fall particularly marked in\nthe 24-35 age group, and slowest in the 45+ group. Comparable declines are\nestimated in the number of undiagnosed infections.\n  Interpretation: The peak and subsequent sharp decline in HIV incidence\noccurred prior to the phase-in of PrEP. Definining elimination as a public\nhealth threat to be < 50 new infections (1.1 infections per 10,000 at risk),\n40% of incidence projections hit this threshold by 2030.

Objective: To assess how well\ndifferent variations of the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), a measure of\nchange in activity, predict injury in children. Methods: We conducted a\nprospective cohort study using data from 1670 Danish schoolchildren measured\nover 5.5 years (2008 to 2014). Coupled 4-week, uncoupled 4-week, and uncoupled\n5-week ACWRs were calculated using activity frequency in the past week as the\nacute load (numerator), and average weekly activity frequency in the past 4 or\n5 weeks as the chronic load (denominator).

Results:\nThe prognostic relationship between the ACWR and injury risk was best\nrepresented using a generalized additive mixed model for the uncoupled 5-week\nACWR.

But once a relevant system is found, such rapid disruption and\nrearrangement would be very likely to destroy the system before much evolution\ncould take place. In this paper we explore the possibility, using a model\ndeveloped previously, that the search process could occur under different\nenvironmental conditions than the subsequent fixation and growth of a lifelike\nchemical system. We use the example of a rapid change in temperature to\nillustrate the effect and refer to the rapid change as a `quench' borrowing\nterminology from study of the physics and chemistry of glass formation. The\nmodel study shows that interrupting a high temperature nonequilibrium state\nwith a rapid quench to lower temperatures can substantially increase the\nprobability of producing a chemical state with lifelike characteristics of\nnonequilibrium metastability, internal dynamics and exponential population\ngrowth in time. Previously published data on the length distributions of\nproteomes of prokaryotes may be consistent with such an idea and suggest a\nprebiotic high temperature `search' phase near the boiling point of water. A\nrapid change in pH could have a similar effect. We discuss possible scenarios\non early earth which might have allowed frequent quenches of the sort\nconsidered here to have occurred. The models show a strong dependence of the\neffect on the number of chemical monomers available for bond formation.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 12 Oct 2020 23:00:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-01-04", "authors_parsed": [["Sheng", "Qianyi", ""], ["Intoy", "Ben", ""], ["Halley", "J.

Even though several finite element\n(FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain\ndeformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE\nhead models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This\nwork aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus\nimprove the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep\nlearning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature\nengineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a\ncombination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed\nmartial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can\ncalculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in\nless than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a\nstandard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and\nmodel initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive\npower of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based\non angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features\nbased on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head\nimpacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of\nbrain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended\nby incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In\naddition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation\nmonitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a\nlarge number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 16 Oct 2020 17:37:59 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 20 Oct 2020 18:50:29 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-22", "authors_parsed": [["Zhan", "Xianghao", ""], ["Liu", "Yuzhe", ""], ["Raymond", "Samuel J.", ""], ["Alizadeh", "Hossein Vahid", ""], ["Domel", "August G.", ""], ["Gevaert", "Olivier", ""], ["Zeineh", "Michael", ""], ["Grant", "Gerald", ""], ["Camarillo", "David B.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.08687", "submitter": "Matthew Ragoza", "authors": "Matthew Ragoza, Tomohide Masuda, David Ryan Koes", "title": "Learning a Continuous Representation of 3D Molecular Structures with\n  Deep Generative Models", "comments": "Camera-ready submission to NeurIPS 2020 MLSB workshop", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.LG q-bio.BM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Machine learning in drug discovery has been focused on virtual screening of\nmolecular libraries using discriminative models.

In this paper, we formulate this peak detection\nproblem as a multivariate time series segmentation problem, and propose a novel\napproach based on the Transformer architecture. Here we augment Transformers,\nwhich are capable of capturing long distance dependencies with a global view,\nwith Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can capture local context\nimportant to the task at hand, in the form of Transformers with Convolutional\nSelf-Attention. We further train this model in a semisupervised manner by\nadapting state of the art semisupervised image classification techniques for\nmulti-channel time series data. Experiments on a representative LC-MS dataset\nare benchmarked using manual annotations to showcase the encouraging\nperformance of our method; it outperforms baseline neural network architectures\nand is competitive against the current state of the art in automated peak\ndetection.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Oct 2020 18:55:27 GMT"}], "update_date": "2020-10-28", "authors_parsed": [["Xu", "Leon L.", ""], ["R\u00f6st", "Hannes L.", ""]]}, {"id": "2010.14068", "submitter": "Navodini Wijethilake", "authors": "Navodini Wijethilake, Mobarakol Islam, Dulani Meedeniya, Charith\n  Chitraranjan, Indika Perera, Hongliang Ren", "title": "Radiogenomics of Glioblastoma: Identification of Radiomics associated\n  with Molecular Subtypes", "comments": "2nd MICCAI workshop on Radiomics and Radiogenomics in Neuro-oncology\n  using AI, Springer, LNCS, (to appear)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.AI cs.LG", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Glioblastoma is the most malignant type of central nervous system tumor with\nGBM subtypes cleaved based on molecular level gene alterations.

However, ROC can\nprovide a distorted view of classifiers ability to predict short-term mortality\ndue to the overwhelmingly greater proportion of patients who survive, i.e.\nimbalanced data.\n  Methods: This study compared the ROC and PRC for the outcome of two\nclassifiers for 90-day LVAD mortality for 800 patients (test group) recorded in\nINTERMACS who received a continuous-flow LVAD between 2006 and 2016 (mean age\nof 59 years; 146 females vs. 654 males) in which mortality rate is only %8 at\n90-day (imbalanced data).
