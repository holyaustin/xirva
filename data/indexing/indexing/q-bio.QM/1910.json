Recently, Volz et al. introduced a simple probabilistic measure of the\ncount of distinct fiber populations within a voxel, which was shown to reduce\nvariance in group comparisons. We propose a complementary measure that\nconsiders the complexity of a voxel in context of its local region, with an aim\nto quantify the localized wiring complexity of every part of white matter. This\nallows, for example, identification of particularly ambiguous regions of the\nbrain for tractographic approaches of modeling global wiring connectivity. Our\nmethod builds on recent advances in image inpainting, in which the task is to\nplausibly fill in a missing region of an image. Our proposed method builds on a\nBayesian estimate of heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainty of a region of white\nmatter by inpainting it from its context. We define the localized wiring\ncomplexity of white matter as how accurately and confidently a well-trained\nmodel can predict the missing patch. In our results, we observe low aleatoric\nuncertainty along major neuronal pathways which increases at junctions and\ntowards cortex boundaries. This directly quantifies the difficulty of lesion\ninpainting of dMRI images at all parts of white matter.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Oct 2019 16:45:32 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Dec 2019 02:48:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-12-03", "authors_parsed": [["Hallgrimsson", "Haraldur T.", ""], ["Sharan", "Richika", ""], ["Grafton", "Scott T.", ""], ["Singh", "Ambuj K.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.05176", "submitter": "Camile Bahi", "authors": "Camile Bahi", "title": "Psilocybin based therapy for cancer related distress, a systematic\n  review and meta analysis", "comments": "33 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.NC", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Background : depression and anxiety are common in patients with cancer,\nclassical antidepressant has no proven efficacy on this type of distress\ncompared to placebo.

However, the ballistocardiogram (BCG), a large-amplitude artifact\ncaused by cardiac induced movement contaminates the EEG during EEG-fMRI\nrecordings. Removal of BCG in software has generally made use of linear\ndecompositions of the corrupted EEG. This is not ideal as the BCG signal is\nnon-stationary and propagates in a manner which is non-linearly dependent on\nthe electrocardiogram (ECG). In this paper, we present a novel method for BCG\nartifact suppression using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Methods: EEG\nsignals were recovered by training RNNs on the nonlinear mappings between ECG\nand the BCG corrupted EEG. We evaluated our model's performance against the\ncommonly used Optimal Basis Set (OBS) method at the level of individual\nsubjects, and investigated generalization across subjects. Results: We show\nthat our algorithm can generate larger average power reduction of the BCG at\ncritical frequencies, while simultaneously improving task relevant EEG based\nclassification. Conclusion: The presented deep learning architecture can be\nused to reduce BCG related artifacts in EEG-fMRI recordings.

Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to\ncorrelate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can\ninfluence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal\npropagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small\nmotifs both at steady state and \\red{away from stationarity}. Experimental\nevidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA)\ncrosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the\nintegration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale\neffects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to\nwhich crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its\nemergent systemic features in silico in large-scale miRNA-RNA network\nreconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level\ncrosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii)\ncan achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are\nrobust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly\nnon-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters.\nFurthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is\nstrongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network's\ntopology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection.

Results: In this paper, we propose a generic strategy for\nheritability inference, termed as ``boosting heritability\", by combining the\nadvantageous features of different recent methods to produce an estimate of the\nheritability with a high-dimensional linear model. Boosting heritability uses\nin particular a multiple sample splitting strategy which leads in general to a\nstable and and accurate estimate. We use both simulated data and real\nantibiotic resistance data from a major human pathogen, Sptreptococcus\npneumoniae, to demonstrate the attractive features of our inference strategy.\nConclusions: Boosting is shown to offer a reliable and practically useful tool\nfor inference about heritability.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 14:14:08 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 19 Nov 2019 09:14:21 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:21:48 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-03-16", "authors_parsed": [["Mai", "The Tien", ""], ["Turner", "Paul", ""], ["Corander", "Jukka", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.11942", "submitter": "Sreyashi Chakraborty", "authors": "Sreyashi Chakraborty, Hiroyuki Iwano, Michael E.

Unlike current approaches, the\nmethod requires no assumptions, user inputs, or heuristic conventions.\nBackground: Current methods for measuring VP using CMM echocardiography do not\naccount for the spatiotemporal variation of the filling wave propagation\nvelocity. They are instead confined by empirical assumptions and user inputs\nthat significantly hinder the accuracy of VP, subsequently limiting its\nclinical utility. Methods: We evaluated three methods for measuring LV early\nfilling VP: conventional VP, the strength of propagation (VS), and VP\ndetermined from the most energetically important wave (Peak-VW), using 125\npatients (Group A) with normal filling (n=50), impaired relaxation (n=25),\npseudonormal filling (n=25) and restrictive filling (n=25), and in 69 patients\n(Group B) with normal (n=32), dilated (n=15), and hypertrophic ventricles\n(n=22). Results: Peak-VW most accurately distinguished normal left ventricles\nfrom diseased ones. Specifically, for Group A which spanned the stages of\ndiastolic function, using receiver operator characteristics (ROC) and measuring\ntheir corresponding area under the curve (AUC), the AUC for Peak-VW was 0.92,\nversus 0.62 for conventional VP, 0.63 for VS and 0.58 for intraventricular\npressure difference (IVPD). These correspond to a 50-70% improvement in\nclassification ability. Similar improvements were found using Group B.\nConclusion: A new determination of the LV early filling using wavelet analysis,\nPeak-VW, may provide a more accurate evaluation of diastolic function than the\nstandard method of determining Vp and enable better diagnostic classification\nof patients suffering with diastolic dysfunction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Oct 2019 21:07:38 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-10-29", "authors_parsed": [["Chakraborty", "Sreyashi", ""], ["Iwano", "Hiroyuki", ""], ["Hall", "Michael E.", ""], ["Vlachos", "Pavlos P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1910.12007", "submitter": "Anastasios Matzavinos", "authors": "Karen Larson, Sarah Olson, Anastasios Matzavinos", "title": "Bayesian uncertainty quantification for micro-swimmers with fully\n  resolved hydrodynamics", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.NA math.NA physics.bio-ph physics.flu-dyn", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Due to the computational complexity of micro-swimmer models with fully\nresolved hydrodynamics, parameter estimation has been prohibitively expensive.\nHere, we describe a Bayesian uncertainty quantification framework that is\nhighly parallelizable, making parameter estimation for complex forward models\ntractable.
