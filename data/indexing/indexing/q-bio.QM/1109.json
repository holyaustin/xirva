Optimal therapy for both the models is determined using the\nsteepest gradient method, by defining an objective functional which minimizes\nthe infected hepatocyte levels, virion population and the side-effects of the\ndrug(s). The optimal therapy for both the models shows an initial period of\nhigh efficacy, followed by a gradual decline. The period of high efficacy\ncoincides with a significant decrease in the infected hepatocyte levels as well\nas viral load, whereas the efficacy drops after liver regeneration through\nrestored hepatocyte levels. The period of high efficacy is not altered\nsignificantly when the cost coefficients are varied, as long as the side\neffects are relatively small. This suggests a higher dependence of the optimal\ntherapy on the model parameters in case of drugs with minimal side effects.\n  We use the Latin hypercube sampling technique to randomly generate a large\nnumber of patient scenarios (i.e, model parameter sets) and study the dynamics\nof each set under the optimal therapy already determined. Results show an\nincrease in the percentage of responders (as indicated by drop in viral load\nbelow detection levels) in case of combination therapy as compared to\nmonotherapy. Statistical tests performed to study the correlations between\nsample parameters and the time required for the viral load to fall below\ndetection level, show a strong monotonic correlation with the death rate of\ninfected hepatocytes, identifying it to be an important factor in deciding\nindividual drug regimens.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 3 Sep 2011 11:17:16 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-06", "authors_parsed": [["Pachpute", "Gaurav", ""], ["Chakrabarty", "Siddhartha P.", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.1015", "submitter": "Alain Barrat", "authors": "J.

Contacts occur mostly within each class, and each\nchild spends on average three times more time in contact with classmates than\nwith children of other classes.

Further analysis\nexamines the small-world properties of the system, including average path\nlength and clustering coefficient.

However, most of them are specific to either a\nquantification strategy (e.g. label-free or isotopic labelling) or a\nmass-spectrometry system (e.g. high or low resolution).\n  In this context, we have developed MassChroQ, a versatile software that\nperforms LC-MS data alignment and peptide quantification by peak area\nintegration on extracted ion chromatograms. MassChroQ is suitable for\nquantification with or without labelling and is not limited to high resolution\nsystems.

It can handle large experiments that include protein or peptide\nfractionation (as SDS-PAGE, 2D-LC). It is fully configurable. Every processing\nstep is traceable, the produced data are in open standard format and its\nmodularity allows easy integration into proteomic pipelines. The output results\nare ready for use in statistical analyses.\n  Evaluation of MassChroQ on complex label-free data obtained from low and high\nresolution mass spectrometers showed low CVs for technical reproducibility\n(1.4%) and high coefficients of correlation to protein quantity (0.98).\n  MassChroQ is freely available under the GNU General Public Licence v3.0 at\nhttp://pappso.inra.fr/bioinfo/masschroq/.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 26 Sep 2011 08:52:55 GMT"}], "update_date": "2011-09-27", "authors_parsed": [["Valot", "Beno\u00eet", ""], ["Langella", "Olivier", ""], ["Nano", "Edlira", ""], ["Zivy", "Michel", ""]]}, {"id": "1109.5796", "submitter": "Xuan Vinh Nguyen", "authors": "Nguyen Xuan Vinh", "title": "Genetic Testing for Complex Diseases: a Simulation Study Perspective", "comments": "5 pages technical report", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "stat.AP cs.CE q-bio.GN q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  It is widely recognized nowadays that complex diseases are caused by, amongst\nthe others, multiple genetic factors.

Topological pressure measures the \"weighted\ninformation content\" of a finite word, and incorporates 64 parameters which can\nbe interpreted as a choice of weight for each nucleotide triplet. We train the\nparameters so that the topological pressure fits the observed coding sequence\ndensity on the human genome, and use this to give ab initio predictions of CDS\ndensity over windows of size around 66,000bp on the genomes of Mus Musculus,\nRhesus Macaque and Drososphilia Melanogaster. While the differences between\nthese genomes are too great to expect that training on the human genome could\npredict, for example, the exact locations of genes, we demonstrate that our\nmethod gives reasonable estimates for the \"coarse scale\" problem of predicting\nCDS density.\n  Inspired again by ergodic theory, the weightings of the nucleotide triplets\nobtained from our training procedure are used to define a probability\ndistribution on finite sequences, which can be used to distinguish between\nintron and exon sequences from the human genome of lengths between 750bp and\n5,000bp. At the end of the paper, we explain the theoretical underpinning for\nour approach, which is the theory of Thermodynamic Formalism from the dynamical\nsystems literature.

The\nmathematical model is based on five basic processes: (1) The formation of\nachiral glycine clusters in solution, (2) The nucleation of oriented glycine\ncrystals at the air/water interface in the presence of hydrophobic amino acids,\n(3) A kinetic orienting effect which inhibits crystal growth, (4) The\nenantioselective occlusion of the amino acids from solution, and (5) The growth\nof oriented host glycine crystals at the interface. We translate these\nprocesses into differential rate equations. We first study the model with the\norienting process (2) without (3) and then combine both allowing us to make\ndetailed comparisons of both orienting effects which actually act in unison in\nthe experiment. Numerical results indicate that the model can yield a high\npercentage orientation of the mixed crystals at the interface and the\nconsequent resolution of the initially racemic mixture of amino acids in\nsolution. The model thus leads to separation of enantiomeric territories, the\ngeneration and amplification of optical activity by enantioselective occlusion\nof chiral additives through chiral surfaces of glycine crystals.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 29 Sep 2011 15:27:46 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-09-13", "authors_parsed": [["Blanco", "Celia", ""], ["Hochberg", "David", ""]]}]
