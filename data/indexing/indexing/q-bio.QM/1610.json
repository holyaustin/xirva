This assump- tion does not take into account the\nconformational changes of the constituent proteins as well as minor changes to\nthe binding interfaces that continues throughout the assembly process until\nstabilization. This paper presents a statistical-ensemble based approach which\nprovides sufficient samples of the configurational space for each monomer and\nthe relative local orientation between monomers, to capture the uncertainties\nin their binding and conformations. Furthermore, instead of using larger\ncapsomers (trimers, pentamers) as building blocks, we allow all possible\nsub-assemblies to bind in all pos- sible combinations. We represent this\nassembly graph in two different ways. First, we use the Wilcoxon signed rank\nmeasure to compare the distributions of binding free energy computed on the\nsampled conformations to predict likely pathways. Second, we represent chemical\nequilibrium aspects of the transitions as a Bayesian Factor graph where both\nassociations and dissociations are modeled based on concentrations and the\nbinding free energies. Results from both of these experiments showed\nsignificant departure from those one would obtain if only the static\nconfigurations of the proteins were considered. Hence, we establish the\nimportance of an uncertainty-aware protocol for pathway analysis, and provide a\nstatistical framework as an important first step towards assembly pathway\nprediction with high statistical confidence.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 17:11:03 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-04", "authors_parsed": [["Clement", "Nathan L", ""], ["Rasheed", "Muhibur", ""], ["Bajaj", "Chandrajit L", ""]]}, {"id": "1610.00661", "submitter": "Helen Byrne M", "authors": "Holger Perfahl and Barry D Hughes and Tomas Alaracon and Philip K\n  Maini and Mark C Lloyd and Matthias Reuss and Helen M Byrne", "title": "3D hybrid modeling of vascular network formation", "comments": "46 pages, 20 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.TO", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We develop an agent-based model of vasculogenesis, the de novo formation of\nblood vessels. Endothelial cells in the vessel network are viewed as linearly\nelastic spheres and are of two types: vessel elements are contained within the\nnetwork; tip cells are located at endpoints. Tip cells move in response to\nforces due to interactions with neighbouring vessel elements, the local tissue\nenvironment, chemotaxis and a persistence force modeling their tendency to\ncontinue moving in the same direction. Vessel elements experience similar\nforces but not chemotaxis. An angular persistence force representing local\ntissue interactions stabilises buckling instabilities due to proliferation.\nVessel elements proliferate, at rates that depend on their degree of stretch:\nelongated elements proliferate more rapidly than compressed elements. Following\ndivision, new cells are more likely to form new sprouts if the parent vessel is\nhighly compressed and to be incorporated into the parent vessel if it is\nstretched.\n  Model simulations reproduce key features of vasculogenesis. Parameter\nsensitivity analyses reveal significant changes in network size and morphology\non varying the chemotactic sensitivity of tip cells, and the sensitivities of\nthe proliferation rate and sprouting probability to mechanical stretch. Varying\nchemotactic sensitivity also affects network directionality. Branching and\nnetwork density are influenced by the sprouting probability. Glyphs depicting\nmultiple network properties show how network quantities change over time and as\nmodel parameters vary. We also show how glyphs constructed from in vivo data\ncould be used to discriminate between normal and tumour vasculature and,\nultimately, for model validation.

Existing\nstrategies for strain design typically focus on designing mutations that\nachieve the highest yield possible while maintaining growth viability. While\nthese methods are computationally tractable, an optimum productivity could be\nachieved by a dynamic strategy in which the intracellular division of resources\nis permitted to change with time. New methods for the design and implementation\nof dynamic microbial processes, both computational and experimental, have\ntherefore been explored to maximize productivity. However, solving for the\noptimal metabolic behavior under the assumption that all fluxes in the cell are\nfree to vary is a challenging numerical task. This work presents an efficient\nmethod for the calculation of a maximum theoretical productivity of a batch\nculture system using a dynamic optimization framework. This metric is analogous\nto the maximum theoretical yield, a measure that is well established in the\nmetabolic engineering literature and whose use helps guide strain and pathway\nselection. The proposed method follows traditional assumptions of dynamic flux\nbalance analysis: (1) that internal metabolite fluxes are governed by a\npseudo-steady state, and (2) that external metabolite fluxes are dynamically\nbounded. The optimization is achieved via collocation on finite elements, and\naccounts explicitly for an arbitrary number of flux changes. The method can be\nfurther extended to explicitly solve for the trade-off curve between maximum\nproductivity and yield. We demonstrate the method on succinate production in\ntwo common microbial hosts, Escherichia coli and Actinobacillus succinogenes,\nrevealing that nearly optimal yields and productivities can be achieved with\nonly two discrete flux stages.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 18:10:25 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-10-05", "authors_parsed": [["John", "Peter C.

Despite\nsubstantial advances in fluorescence-based imaging methodologies, labeling with\nbeads remains critical for optical-trapping-based investigations of molecular\nmotors. A key experimental challenge in bead-based assays is that the number of\nmotors on a bead is not well defined. Particularly for single-molecule\ninvestigations, the probability of single versus multiple-motor events has not\nbeen experimentally investigated. Here, we used bead travel distance as an\nindicator of multiple-motor transport and determined the lower-bound\nprobability of bead transport by two or more motors. We limited the ATP\nconcentration to increase our detection sensitivity for multiple- versus\nsingle-kinesin transport. Surprisingly, for all but the lowest motor number\nexamined, our measurements exceeded estimations of a previous model by R2-fold.\nTo bridge this apparent gap between theory and experiment, we derived a\nclosed-form expression for the probability of bead transport by multiple\nmotors, and constrained the only free parameter in this model using our\nexperimental measurements. Our data indicate that kinesin extends to ~57 nm\nduring bead transport, suggesting that kinesin exploits its conformational\nflexibility to interact with microtubules at highly curved interfaces such as\nthose present for vesicle transport in cells. To our knowledge, our findings\nprovide the first experimentally constrained guide for estimating the\nprobability of multiple-motor transport in optical trapping studies.

While most efficient spiking simulations rely on the communication of\ndiscrete events, rate models require time-continuous interactions between\nneurons. Exploiting the conceptual similarity to the inclusion of gap junctions\nin spiking network simulations, we arrive at a reference implementation of\ninstantaneous and delayed interactions between rate-based models in a spiking\nnetwork simulator. The separation of rate dynamics from the general connection\nand communication infrastructure ensures flexibility of the framework. We\nfurther demonstrate the broad applicability of the framework by considering\nvarious examples from the literature ranging from random networks to neural\nfield models.

The software can analyze a real confocal stack to\nderivate noise parameters and will use them directly to generate new images\nwith similar noise characteristics. Such synthetic images can then be used to\nassert the quality and robustness of an image analysis pipeline, as well as be\nused to train machine-learning image analysis procedures. We illustrate the\napproach with closed curves corresponding to the microtubule ring present in\nblood platelet.
