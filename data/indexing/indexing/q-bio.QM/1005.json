Amongst all the techniques developed for this purpose, FCS, by means\nof determination of FCS diffusion laws, has been shown to be a very efficient\napproach. In this paper, FCS diffusion laws are used to probe the behavior of a\npure lipid and a lipid mixture at temperatures below and above phase\ntransitions, both numerically, using a full thermodynamic model, and\nexperimentally. In both cases FCS diffusion laws exhibit deviation from free\ndiffusion and reveal the existence of domains.
