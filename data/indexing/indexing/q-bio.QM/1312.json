One limitation of existing methods is that they only look\ninto the marginal effects of rare variants but do not systematically take into\naccount effects due to interactions among rare variants and between rare\nvariants and environmental factors.

SPA has three advantages. First, it accounts for the interaction\ninformation and gains considerable power in the presence of unknown and\ncomplicated G-G or G-E interactions. Secondly, it does not sacrifice the\nmarginal detection power; in the situation when rare variants only have\nmarginal effects it is comparable with the most competitive method in current\nliterature.

Here I describe new\nresults that allow this field-theoretic approach to be rapidly and\ndeterministically computed in low dimensions, making it practical for use in\nday-to-day data analysis. Importantly, this approach does not impose a\nprivileged length scale for smoothness of the inferred probability density, but\nrather learns a natural length scale from the data due to the tradeoff between\ngoodness-of-fit and an Occam factor.

This enables researchers to quantitatively infer the magnitude\nand directionality of forces experienced by biomolecules in their native\ncellular environments. Situations where such forces are biologically relevant\nrange from mitosis to directed transport of protein cargo along cytoskeletal\nstructures. Models commonly applied to quantify single-molecule dynamics assume\nthat effective forces and velocity in the $x,y$ (or $x,y,z$) directions are\nstatistically independent, but this assumption is physically unrealistic in\nmany situations. We present a hypothesis testing approach capable of\ndetermining if there is evidence of statistical dependence between positional\ncoordinates in experimentally measured trajectories; if the hypothesis of\nindependence between spatial coordinates is rejected, then a new model\naccounting for 2D (3D) interactions should be considered to more faithfully\nrepresent the underlying experimental kinetics. The technique is robust in the\nsense that 2D (3D) interactions can be detected via statistical hypothesis\ntesting even if there is substantial inconsistency between the physical\nparticle's actual noise sources and the simplified model's assumed noise\nstructure. For example, 2D (3D) interactions can be reliably detected even if\nthe researcher assumes normal diffusion, but the experimental data experiences\n\"anomalous diffusion\" and/or is subjected to a measurement noise characterized\nby a distribution differing from that assumed by the fitted model. The approach\nis demonstrated on control simulations and on experimental data (IFT88 directed\ntransport in the primary cilium).\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 02:27:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-06-18", "authors_parsed": [["Calderon", "Christopher P.", ""], ["Weiss", "Lucien E.", ""], ["Moerner", "W.

The probability that a\ngiven dose and schedule of ionizing radiation eradicates all the tumor cells in\na given tissue is called the tumor control probability (TCP), and is often used\nto compare various treatment strategies used in radiation therapy. In this\npaper, we aim to investigate the effects of including cell-cycle phase on the\nTCP by analyzing a stochastic model of a tumor comprised of actively dividing\ncells and quiescent cells with different radiation sensitivities. We derive an\nexact phase-diagram for the steady-state TCP of the model and show that at\nhigh, clinically-relevant doses of radiation, the distinction between active\nand quiescent tumor cells (i.e. accounting for cell-cycle effects) becomes of\nnegligible importance in terms of its effect on the TCP curve. However, for\nvery low doses of radiation, these proportions become significant determinants\nof the TCP. Moreover, we use a novel numerical approach based on the method of\ncharacteristics for partial differential equations, validated by the Gillespie\nalgorithm, to compute the TCP as a function of time.
