While the accessory hardware\nrequirements for a conventional CLSM are minimal, data evaluation can pose a\nbottleneck. The photon events must be assigned to each scan, in which the\nmaximum signal intensities have to be detected, binned, and aligned between the\nscans, in order to derive the membrane related intensity fluctuations of one\nspot. Finally, this time-dependent signal must be correlated and evaluated by\nwell known FCS model functions.

Ionic fluids flow driven by gradients of concentration,\nchemical and electrical potential, and hydrostatic pressure. Each flow is\nclassically described by its own field theory, independent of the others, but\nof course, in reality every gradient drives every kind of flow to a varying\nextent. Combining field equations is tricky and so the theory of complex fluids\nderives the equations, rather than assumes their interactions. When field\nequations are derived, rather than assumed, their variables are consistent.\nThat is to say all variables satisfy all equations under all conditions with\none set of parameters. Here we treat a classical osmotic cell in this spirit,\nusing a sharp interface method to derive boundary conditions consistent with\nall flows and fields.
