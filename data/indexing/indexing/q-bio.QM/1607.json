These models increasingly involve large numbers of unknown\nparameters, have complex structure which can result in substantial evaluation\ntime relative to the needs of the analysis, and need to be compared to observed\ndata. The correct analysis of such models usually requires a global parameter\nsearch, over a high dimensional parameter space, that incorporates and respects\nthe most important sources of uncertainty.

It hence represents a fundamental challenge for\nthe whole of systems biology.\n  Results: Bayesian statistical methodology for the uncertainty analysis of\ncomplex models is introduced, which is designed to address the high dimensional\nglobal parameter search problem. Bayesian emulators that mimic the systems\nbiology model but which are extremely fast to evaluate are embedded within an\niterative history match: an efficient method to search high dimensional spaces\nwithin a more formal statistical setting, while incorporating major sources of\nuncertainty. The approach is demonstrated via application to two models of\nhormonal crosstalk in Arabidopsis root development, which have 32 rate\nparameters, for which we identify the sets of rate parameter values that lead\nto acceptable matches to observed trend data.

One of\nthe major challenges in rare variant testing is lack of statistical power of\ntraditional testing methods due to extremely low variances of single nucleotide\npolymorphisms. In this paper, we introduce a W-test collapsing method that\nevaluates the distributional differences in cases and controls using a combined\nlog of odds ratio. The proposed method is compared with the Weighted-Sum\nStatistic and Sequence Kernel Association Test using simulation data sets and\nshowed better performances and faster computing speed. In the study of real\nnext generation sequencing data set of hypertensive disorder, we identified\ngenes of interesting biological functions that are associated to metabolism\ndisorder and inflammation, which include the MACROD1, NLRP7, AGK, PAK6 and\nAPBB1. The W-test collapsing method offers a fast, effective and alternative\nway for rare variants association analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Jul 2016 18:32:30 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-07-27", "authors_parsed": [["Sun", "Rui", ""], ["Weng", "Haoyi", ""], ["Hu", "Inchi", ""], ["Guo", "Junfeng", ""], ["Wu", "William K.

Given the rise in immunization-preventable diseases, a\nconsequence of people opting out of their routine vaccinations, we determined\nthat Canadian health data can identify individuals over the age of 60 who chose\nnot to get vaccinated (80.1% negative predictive value) and individuals under\nthe age of 60 who have recently been vaccinated (96.4% positive predictive\nvalue).

Of 1,381 variables, 47 with the most significant marginal\neffects were selected, including the presence of diseases (e.g. diabetes and\ncancer), behavioral characteristics (e.g. smoking and exercise), exposure to\nthe medical system (e.g. whether the individual gets a regular check-up), and a\nperson's living situation (e.g. having young children in the household). These\nvariables were then used to generate a Random Forest classification model,\ntrained on the 2009-2013 dataset, and tested on the 2014 dataset. We achieved\nan overall accuracy of 87.8% between the two final models, each using 25\nclassification trees with bounded depth of 20 nodes, randomly selecting from\nall 47 variables.
