A remarkable early\nfinding in the study of temporal expectancy is the foreperiod effect on\nreaction times; i.e., the influence or reaction time of the time period between\na warning signal and an imperative stimulus to which subjects are instructed to\nrespond as quickly as possible. Recently it has been shown that the phase of\noscillatory activity preceding stimulus presentation is related to behavior.\nHere we connect both of these findings by reporting a novel foreperiod effect\non the inter-trial phase coherence of the electroencephalogram (EEG) triggered\nby stimuli to which subjects are instructed not to respond. Inter-trial phase\ncoherence has been used to describe regularities in phases of groups of trials\ntime locked to an event of interest.

We expect the practical utility of such measures to be\ngreater when human subjects execute movements that maximize energy efficiency.\nWe therefore seek to understand if and when subjects select movements with that\nmaximizing energy efficiency. We proceed using a model-based approach to\ndescribe movements which perform a task requiring the body to add or remove\nexternal mechanical work to or from an object. We use the specific example of\nwalking gaits doing external mechanical work by pulling a cart, and estimate\nthe relationship between the avg. walking speed and avg. step length. In the\nlimit where no external work is done, we find that the estimated maximum energy\nefficiency walking gait is much slower than the walking gaits healthy adults\ntypically select. We then modify the situation of the walking gait by\nintroducing an idealized mechanical device that creates an adjustable\nmechanical advantage. The walking gaits that maximize the energy efficiency\nusing the optimal mechanical advantage are again much slower than the walking\ngaits healthy adults typically select. We finally modify the situation so that\nthe avg. walking speed is fixed and derive the pattern of the avg. step length\nand mechanical advantage that maximize energy efficiency.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 13 Nov 2016 21:16:15 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 22:50:17 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Sun, 9 Dec 2018 19:52:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-12-11", "authors_parsed": [["Hagler", "Stuart", ""]]}, {"id": "1611.04281", "submitter": "Johannes Berg", "authors": "Johannes Berg", "title": "Statistical mechanics of the inverse Ising problem and the optimal\n  objective function", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": "10.1088/1742-5468/aa7df6", "report-no": null, "categories": "cond-mat.dis-nn q-bio.QM stat.ML", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The inverse Ising problem seeks to reconstruct the parameters of an Ising\nHamiltonian on the basis of spin configurations sampled from the Boltzmann\nmeasure.
