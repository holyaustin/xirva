The diffusion process\nfollowed by a passive tracer in prototypical active media such as suspensions\nof active colloids or swimming microorganisms indeed differs significantly from\nBrownian motion, manifest in a greatly enhanced diffusion coefficient,\nnon-Gaussian tails of the displacement statistics, and crossover phenomena from\nnon-Gaussian to Gaussian scaling. While such characteristic features have been\nextensively observed in experiments, there is so far no comprehensive theory\nexplaining how they emerge from the microscopic active dynamics. Here we\npresent a theoretical framework of the enhanced tracer diffusion in an active\nmedium from its microscopic dynamics by coarse-graining the hydrodynamic\ninteractions between the tracer and the active particles as a stochastic\nprocess. The tracer is shown to follow a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process\nthat accounts quantitatively for all empirical observations. The theory\npredicts in particular a long-lived L\\'evy flight regime of the tracer motion\nwith a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The\nduration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, thus suggesting\nthat the optimal foraging strategy of swimming microorganisms might crucially\ndepend on the density in order to exploit the L\\'evy flights of nutrients.

A significant obstacle to current trend analyses is the\ndevelopment of a numerically stable and efficiency-finite element scheme that\nperforms well at low frequency and does not require a large number of degrees\nof freedom. Here, a custom finite element method (FEM) solver based on edge\nelements is proposed using the weakly coupled theory, which separates the\nsolution into two steps. First, the background field (the magnetic vector\npotential on each edge) is calculated and stored. Then, the electric scalar\npotential on each node is obtained by FEM based on Galerkin formulations.\nConsequently, the electric field and eddy current distribution in the object\ncan be obtained. This solver is more efficient than typical commercial solvers\nsince it reduces the vector eddy current equation to a scalar one, and reduces\nthe meshing domain to just the eddy current region. It can therefore tackle\ncomplex eddy current calculations for models with much larger numbers of\nelements, such as those encountered in eddy current computation in biological\ntissues. An example is presented with a realistic human brain mesh of 2 million\nelements. In addition, with this solver, the equivalent magnetic field induced\nfrom the excitation coil is applied, and therefore there is no need to mesh the\nexcitation coil.

As a result, in the grand\nscheme of things, mathematical models have so far played an auxiliary role in\nbiomedical sciences. We propose a new methodology allowing mathematical\nmodeling to give, in certain cases, definitive answers to systemic biomedical\nquestions that elude empirical resolution. Our methodology is based on two\nideas: (1) employing mathematical models that are firmly rooted in established\nbiomedical knowledge yet so general that they can account for any, or at least\nmany, biological mechanisms, both known and unknown; (2) finding model\nparameters whose likelihood-maximizing values are independent of observations\n(existence of such parameters implies that the model must not meet regularity\nconditions required for the consistency of maximum likelihood estimator). These\nuniversal parameter values may reveal general patterns (that we call natural\nlaws) in biomedical processes. We illustrate this approach with the discovery\nof a clinically important natural law governing cancer metastasis.\nSpecifically, we found that under minimal, and fairly realistic, mathematical\nand biomedical assumptions the likelihood-maximizing scenario of metastatic\ncancer progression in an individual patient is invariably the same: Complete\nsuppression of metastatic growth before primary tumor resection followed by an\nabrupt growth acceleration after surgery. This scenario is widely observed in\nclinical practice and supported by a wealth of experimental studies on animals\nand clinical case reports published over the last 110 years. The above most\nlikely scenario does not preclude other possibilities e.g. metastases may start\naggressive growth before primary tumor resection or remain dormant after\nsurgery.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 3 Jun 2019 18:33:11 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-06", "authors_parsed": [["Hanin", "Leonid", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.02308", "submitter": "Kangjie Lin", "authors": "Kangjie Lin, Youjun Xu, Jianfeng Pei, Luhua Lai", "title": "Automatic Retrosynthetic Pathway Planning Using Template-free Models", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  We present an attention-based Transformer model for automatic retrosynthesis\nroute planning.

Circuitscape.jl allows users to solve\nproblems faster via improved parallel processing and solvers, and supports\napplications to larger problems (e.g., datasets with hundreds of millions of\ncells). We document speed improvements of up to 1800\\%. We also demonstrate\nscaling of problem sizes up to 437 million grid cells. These improvements allow\nmodelers to work with higher resolution data, larger landscapes and perform\nsensitivity analysis effortlessly. These improvements accelerate the pace of\ninnovation, helping modelers address pressing challenges like species range\nshifts under climate change. Our collaboration between ecologists and computer\nscientists has led to the use of connectivity models to inform conservation\ndecisions. Further, these next generation connectivity models will produce\nresults faster, facilitating stronger engagement with decision-makers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 8 Jun 2019 23:46:47 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-11", "authors_parsed": [["Anantharaman", "Ranjan", ""], ["Hall", "Kimberly", ""], ["Shah", "Viral", ""], ["Edelman", "Alan", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.03722", "submitter": "Eric Lock", "authors": "Jun Young Park and Eric F.

The percentage of compromised\ncells increased as the percentage of live cells increased after the 100 C\ntreatment. However, the number of compromised cells after 60 or 65 C treatments\ndecreased as the percentage of live cells increased, showing that both mild\ntemperatures would not be completely effective eliminating all bacteria but\ncompromising their membranes, and showing that mild heat treatments are not\nenough to guarantee the safety of PIF. FC was capable to detect C. sakazakii\ncompromised cells that cannot be detected with classical plate count methods,\nthus it could be used to decreasing the risk of pathogenic viable but\nnon-culturable cells to be in the ingested food. Linear regression analysis\nshowed good correlations between plate count results vs FC results.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 21 Jun 2019 22:46:02 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-06-27", "authors_parsed": [["De-La-Cal-Sabater", "Paloma", ""], ["Caro", "Irma", ""], ["Mateo", "Javier", ""], ["Castro", "Maria J.", ""], ["Cao", "Maria J.", ""], ["Quinto", "Emiliano J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1906.11062", "submitter": "Thomas Heinis", "authors": "Thomas Heinis", "title": "Survey of Information Encoding Techniques for DNA", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM cs.DB cs.DS cs.IT math.IT", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Key to DNA storage is encoding the information to a sequence of nucleotides\nbefore it can be synthesised for storage.

Similarly, the G-C content of the\nresulting sequences should be higher than 50\\%. Second, given that synthesis is\nexpensive, the encoding must map as many bits as possible to one nucleotide.\nThird, the synthesis (as well as the sequencing) is error prone, leading to\nsubstitutions, deletions and insertions. An encoding must therefore be designed\nto be resilient to errors through error correction codes or replication.\nFourth, for the purpose of computation and selective retrieval, encodings\nshould result in substantially different sequences across all data, even for\nvery similar data.

However, the\napplicability and accuracy presumptions of such algorithms remain unclear due\nto experimental heterogeneity. This paper assesses the performance of recent\nand successful network inference strategies under a novel, multifactorial\nevaluation framework in order to highlight pragmatic tradeoffs in experimental\ndesign. The effects of data quantity and systems perturbations are addressed,\nthereby formulating guidelines for efficient resource management.\n  Realistic data were generated from six widely used benchmark models of\nrhythmic and non-rhythmic gene regulatory systems with random perturbations\nmimicking the effect of gene knock-out or chemical treatments. Then,\ntime-series data of increasing lengths were provided to five state-of-the-art\nnetwork inference algorithms representing distinctive mathematical paradigms.\nThe performances of such network reconstruction methodologies are uncovered\nunder various experimental conditions. We report that the algorithms do not\nbenefit equally from data increments. Furthermore, for rhythmic systems, it is\nmore profitable for network inference strategies to be run on long time-series\nrather than short time-series with multiple perturbations. By contrast, for the\nnon-rhythmic systems, increasing the number of perturbation experiments yielded\nbetter results than increasing the sampling frequency. We expect that future\nbenchmark and algorithm design would integrate such multifactorial\nconsiderations to promote their widespread and conscientious usage.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 28 Jun 2019 14:36:04 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-07-01", "authors_parsed": [["Mombaerts", "Laurent", ""], ["Aalto", "Atte", ""], ["Markdahl", "Johan", ""], ["Goncalves", "Jorge", ""]]}]
