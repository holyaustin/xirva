For density dependent families\nof MCs that represent the interaction of large groups of identical objects,\nKurtz has proposed two kinds of approximations.

The\ncomputational cost of the deterministic approximation is significantly lower,\nbut the diffusion approximation retains stochasticity and is able to reproduce\nrelevant random features like variance, bimodality, and tail behavior. In a\nrecent paper, for particular stochastic Petri net models, we proposed a jump\ndiffusion approximation that aims at being applicable beyond the limits of\nKurtz's diffusion approximation, namely when the process reaches the boundary\nwith non-negligible probability. Other limitations of the diffusion\napproximation in its original form are that it can provide inaccurate results\nwhen the number of objects in some groups is often or constantly low and that\nit can be applied only to pure density dependent Markov chains. In order to\novercome these drawbacks, in this paper we propose to apply the jump-diffusion\napproximation only to those components of the model that are in density\ndependent form and are associated with high population levels. The remaining\ncomponents are treated as discrete quantities. The resulting process is a\nhybrid switching jump diffusion.

However, although fundamental, the role of chemical potential and\nGibb's free energy in the analysis of biochemical systems is often overlooked\nleading to models which are physically impossible. The bond graph approach was\ndeveloped for modelling engineering systems where energy generation, storage\nand transmission are fundamental. The method focuses on how power flows between\ncomponents and how energy is stored, transmitted or dissipated within\ncomponents. Based on early ideas of network thermodynamics, we have applied\nthis approach to biochemical systems to generate models which automatically\nobey the laws of thermodynamics. We illustrate the method with examples of\nbiochemical cycles. We have found that thermodynamically compliant models of\nsimple biochemical cycles can easily be developed using this approach. In\nparticular, both stoichiometric information and simulation models can be\ndeveloped directly from the bond graph. Furthermore, model reduction and\napproximation while retaining structural and thermodynamic properties is\nfacilitated. Because the bond graph approach is also modular and scaleable, we\nbelieve that it provides a secure foundation for building thermodynamically\ncompliant models of large biochemical networks.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 07:25:10 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 11 Sep 2014 05:34:40 GMT"}], "update_date": "2018-08-14", "authors_parsed": [["Gawthrop", "Peter J.", ""], ["Crampin", "Edmund J.", ""]]}, {"id": "1406.2502", "submitter": "David Schnoerr", "authors": "David Schnoerr, Guido Sanguinetti, Ramon Grima", "title": "The complex chemical Langevin equation", "comments": "47 pages, 8 figures", "journal-ref": "J.

For communities of up to medium\ndiversity, e.g. excluding environments such as soil, this is often achieved by\na combination of sequence assembly and binning, where sequences are grouped\ninto 'bins' representing taxa of the underlying microbial community from which\nthey originate. Assignment to low-ranking taxonomic bins is an important\nchallenge for binning methods as is scalability to Gb-sized datasets generated\nwith deep sequencing techniques. One of the best available methods for the\nrecovery of species bins from an individual metagenome sample is the\nexpert-trained PhyloPythiaS package, where a human expert decides on the taxa\nto incorporate in a composition-based taxonomic metagenome classifier and\nidentifies the 'training' sequences using marker genes directly from the\nsample. Due to the manual effort involved, this approach does not scale to\nmultiple metagenome samples and requires substantial expertise, which\nresearchers who are new to the area may not have. With these challenges in\nmind, we have developed PhyloPythiaS+, a successor to our previously described\nmethod PhyloPythia(S). The newly developed + component performs the work\npreviously done by the human expert. PhyloPythiaS+ also includes a new k-mer\ncounting algorithm, which accelerated k-mer counting 100-fold and reduced the\noverall execution time of the software by a factor of three.
