Observable variables are limited to a few components of\nstate vector and an input signal. The problem of state and parameter\nreconstruction is viewed within the classical framework of observer design.\nThis framework offers computationally-efficient solutions to the problem of\nstate and parameter reconstruction of a system of nonlinear differential\nequations, provided that these equations are in the so-called adaptive observer\ncanonic form. We show that despite typical neural oscillators being locally\nobservable they are not in the adaptive canonic observer form. Furthermore, we\nshow that no parameter-independent diffeomorphism exists such that the original\nequations of these models can be transformed into the adaptive canonic observer\nform. We demonstrate, however, that for the class of Hindmarsh-Rose and\nFitzHugh-Nagumo models, parameter-dependent coordinate transformations can be\nused to render these systems into the adaptive observer canonical form. This\nallows reconstruction, at least partially and up to a (bi)linear\ntransformation, of unknown state and parameter values with exponential rate of\nconvergence. In order to avoid the problem of only partial reconstruction and\nto deal with more general nonlinear models in which the unknown parameters\nenter the system nonlinearly, we present a new method for state and parameter\nreconstruction for these systems. The method combines advantages of standard\nLyapunov-based design with more flexible design and analysis techniques based\non the non-uniform small-gain theorems. Effectiveness of the method is\nillustrated with simple numerical examples.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 May 2009 21:03:48 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 10 Jun 2010 09:30:56 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Fri, 18 Jun 2010 13:19:12 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-03-13", "authors_parsed": [["Fairhurst", "David", ""], ["Tyukin", "Ivan", ""], ["Nijmeijer", "Henk", ""], ["van Leeuwen", "Cees", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.0586", "submitter": "Mohamed Abouelhoda", "authors": "Mohamed Abouelhoda and Hisham Mohamed", "title": "WinBioinfTools: Bioinformatics Tools for Windows High Performance\n  Computing Server 2008", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.MS cs.CE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/", "abstract": "  Open source bioinformatics tools running under MS Windows are rare to find,\nand those running under Windows HPC cluster are almost non-existing.

In part, this difficulty is due to our poor understanding of the in\nvivo efficacy of CD8$^+$T cells. Using a recently developed experimental method\nof in vivo cytotoxicity we investigated quantitative aspects of killing of\npeptide-pulsed targets by effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, specific to three\nepitopes of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), in the mouse spleen. By\nanalyzing data on killing of targets with varying number of epitope-specific\neffector and memory CD8$^+$T cells, we find that killing of targets by\neffectors follows the law of mass-action, that is the death rate of\npeptide-pulsed targets is proportional to the frequency of CTLs in the spleen.\nIn contrast, killing of targets by memory CD8$^+$T cells does not follow the\nmass action law because the death rate of targets saturates at high frequencies\nof memory CD8$^+$T cells. For both effector and memory cells, we also find no\nsupport for a killing term that includes the decrease of the death rate of\ntargets with increasing target cell density. Importantly, we find that at low\nCD8$^+$T cell frequencies, effector and memory CD8$^+$T cells on the per capita\nbasis are equally efficient at killing peptide-pulsed targets.

The\nfirst principle, that auxin is produced at a constant rate in all cells, leads\nto a (Poisson) reaction-diffusion equation. Equilibrium solutions uniquely\ncodify information about distances, thereby providing cells with the signal to\nbegin differentiation from ground to vascular. A uniform destruction hypothesis\nand scaling by cell size leads to a more biologically-relevant (Helmholtz)\nmodel, and simulations demonstrate its capability to predict leaf and root\nauxin distributions and venation patterns. The mathematical development is\ncentered on properties of the distance map, and provides a mechanism by which\nglobal information about shape can be presented locally to individual cells.\nThe principles provide the foundation for an elaboration of these models in a\ncompanion paper \\cite{plos-paper2}, and together they provide a framework for\nunderstanding organ- and plant-scale organization.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 27 May 2009 15:18:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Dimitrov", "Pavel", ""], ["Zucker", "Steven W.", ""]]}, {"id": "0905.4468", "submitter": "Tina Toni", "authors": "Tina Toni, Michael P.

We describe how the inconsistency can be\nreconciled if the association and dissociation rates used in the RDME are\nderived from the underlying microscopic description. These rate constants will\nhowever necessarily depend on the spatial discretization. At fine spatial\nresolution the rates approach the microscopic rate constants defined at the\nreaction radius. At low resolution the rates converge to the macroscopic\ndiffusion limited rate constants in 3D, whereas there is no limiting value in\n2D.

Recent bio-inspired legged robots display\nspeed relative to body size on hard ground comparable to high performing\norganisms like cockroaches but suffer significant performance loss on flowing\nmaterials like sand. In laboratory experiments we study the performance (speed)\nof a small (2.3 kg) six-legged robot, SandBot, as it runs on a bed of granular\nmedia (1 mm poppy seeds). For an alternating tripod gait on the granular bed,\nstandard gait control parameters achieve speeds at best two orders of magnitude\nsmaller than the 2 body lengths/s ($\\approx 60$ cm/s) for motion on hard\nground. However, empirical adjustment of these control parameters away from the\nhard ground settings, restores good performance, yielding top speeds of 30\ncm/s. Robot speed depends sensitively on the packing fraction $\\phi$ and the\nlimb frequency $\\omega$, and a dramatic transition from rotary walking to slow\nswimming occurs when $\\phi$ becomes small enough and/or $\\omega$ large enough.\nWe propose a kinematic model of the rotary walking mode based on generic\nfeatures of penetration and slip of a curved limb in granular media. The model\ncaptures the dependence of robot speed on limb frequency and the transition\nbetween walking and swimming modes but highlights the need for a deeper\nunderstanding of the physics of granular media.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 29 May 2009 19:37:53 GMT"}], "update_date": "2021-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Chen", ""], ["Umbanhowar", "Paul B.", ""], ["Komsuoglu", "Haldun", ""], ["Koditschek", "Daniel E.", ""], ["Goldman", "Daniel I.", ""]]}]
