Amplification of DNA is formulated as a problem in\ncontrol theory with optimal solutions that can differ considerably from\nstrategies typically used in practice. Using the Polymerase Chain Reaction\n(PCR) as an example, sequence-dependent biophysical models for DNA\namplification are cast as control systems, wherein the dynamics of the reaction\nare controlled by a manipulated input variable.

A pathogen's\nreproductive fitness can be quantified by the basic reproductive number, R0.\nSince pathogen transmission between host plants depends on the spatial\nseparation between them, R0 is strongly influenced by the spatial scales of\npathogen dispersal and the spatial scales of the host population. The basic\nreproductive number was found to increase with the field size at small field\nsizes and to saturate to a constant value at large field sizes. It reaches a\nmaximum in quadratic fields and decreases as the field becomes elongated. This\npattern appears to be quite general: it holds for dispersal kernels that\ndecrease exponentially or faster as well as for \"fat-tailed\" dispersal kernels\nthat decrease slower than exponential (i.e. power-law kernels). We used this\napproach to estimate R0 in wheat stripe rust (an important pathogen caused by\nPuccinia striiformis), since disease gradients for this pathogen were\nthoroughly measured over large distances [Sackett and Mundt, Phytopathology,\n95, 983 (2005)]. For the two largest datasets, we estimated R0 in the limit of\nlarge fields to be of the order of 50. These estimates are consistent with\nindependent field observations [Cowger et al.

We found that the\nspatial extent over which R0 changes strongly is quite fine-scaled (about 30 m\nof the linear extension of the field).

Although the human milk microbiome has received\nincreasing attention with the expansion of research on the human microbiome,\nour understanding of the milk microbiome has been limited to cataloguing OTUs\nand computation of community diversity indexes. To the best of our knowledge,\nthere has been no report on the bacterial interactions within the human milk\nmicrobiome. To bridge this gap, we reconstructed a milk bacterial community\nnetwork with the data from Hunt et al (2011), which is the largest 16S-rRNA\nsequence data set of human milk microbiome available to date. Our analysis\nrevealed that the milk microbiome network consists of two disconnected\nsub-networks. One sub-network is a fully connected complete graph consisting of\nseven genera as nodes and all of its pair-wise interactions among the bacteria\nare facilitative or cooperative. In contrast, the interactions in the other\nsub-network of 8 nodes are mixed but dominantly cooperative. Somewhat\nsurprisingly, the only 'non-cooperative' nodes in the second sub-network are\nmutually cooperative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium, genera that include\nsome opportunistic pathogens. This potentially 'evil' alliance between\nStaphylococcus and Corynebacterium could be inhibited by the remaining nodes\nwho cooperate with one another in the second sub-network. We postulate that the\n'confrontation' between the 'evil' alliance and 'benign' alliance in human milk\nmicrobiome should have important health implications to lactating women and\ntheir infants and shifting the balance between the two alliances may be\nresponsible for dysbiosis of the milk microbiome that permits mastitis.

The effect of\nsupramolecular encapsulation on Cy3 photophysical properties was found to be\nhighly host-specific. Up to three-fold increase in brightness of Cy3 was\nobserved when the dye was trapped in methyl-beta-CD, due to an increase in both\ndye absorption and quantum yield. Steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy\nof the various complexes revealed that host polarizability and restricted\nmobility of the dye in the host both contribute to the observed increase in\nmolecular brightness. Furthermore, entrapment of the dye molecule in CDs\nresulted in a marked increase in dye photostability, whereas the dye degraded\nmore rapidly in CB[7]. These results suggest that the changes in photophysical\nproperties of the dye afforded by supramolecular encapsulation are highly\ndependent on the host molecule.

Recent technical and methodological progress in neuroimaging has\nhelped advance our understanding of this important issue, with diffusion\nweighted images providing information about structural connectivity (SC) and\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging shedding light on resting state\nfunctional connectivity (rsFC). However, comparing these two distinct datasets,\neach of which can be encoded into a different complex network, is by no means\ntrivial as pairwise link-to-link comparisons represent a relatively restricted\nperspective and provide only limited information. Thus, we have adopted a more\nintegrative systems approach, exploiting theoretical graph analyses to study\nboth SC and rsFC datasets gathered independently from healthy human subjects.\nThe aim is to find the main architectural traits shared by the structural and\nfunctional networks by paying special attention to their common hierarchical\nmodular organization. This approach allows us to identify a common skeleton\nfrom which a new, optimal, brain partition can be extracted, with modules\nsharing both structure and function. We describe these emerging common\nstructure-function modules (SFMs) in detail. In addition, we compare SFMs with\nthe classical Resting State Networks derived from independent component\nanalysis of rs-fMRI functional activity, as well as with anatomical\nparcellations in the Automated Anatomical Labeling atlas and with the Broadmann\npartition, highlighting their similitude and differences. The unveiling of SFMs\nbrings to light the strong correspondence between brain structure and\nresting-state dynamics.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 12:53:35 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Thu, 30 Apr 2015 17:10:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-01", "authors_parsed": [["Diez", "Ibai", ""], ["Bonifazi", "Paolo", ""], ["Escudero", "I\u00f1aki", ""], ["Mateos", "Beatriz", ""], ["Mu\u00f1oz", "Miguel A.", ""], ["Stramaglia", "Sebastiano", ""], ["Cortes", "Jesus M.", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8230", "submitter": "Leandro Alonso", "authors": "Leandro M.

For HIV/AIDS, the\nassumption of random mixing is inappropriate for epidemics that are\nconcentrated in groups of people at high risk, including female sex workers\n(FSW) and their male clients (MCF), injection drug users (IDU) and men who have\nsex with men (MSM). To find out who transmits infection to whom and how that\naffects the spread and containment of infection remains a major empirical\nchallenge in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. Here we develop a technique, based\non the routine sampling of infection in linked population groups, which shows\nhow an Asian HIV/AIDS epidemic began in FSW, was propagated mainly by IDU, and\nultimately generated most cases among the female partners of MCF (FPM).\nCalculation of the case reproduction numbers within and between groups, and for\nthe whole network, provides insights into control that cannot be deduced simply\nfrom observations on the prevalence of infection. Specifically, the per capita\nrate of HIV transmission was highest from FSW to MCF, and most HIV infections\noccurred in FPM, but the number of infections in the whole network is best\nreduced by interrupting transmission to and from IDU. This network analysis can\nbe used to guide HIV/AIDS interventions based on needle exchange, condom\ndistribution and antiretroviral therapy. The method requires only routine data\nand could be applied to infections in other populations.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 12:14:29 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 13:47:34 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-02-24", "authors_parsed": [["Williams", "Brian G.", ""], ["Dye", "Christopher", ""]]}, {"id": "1410.8596", "submitter": "Tatiana T.
