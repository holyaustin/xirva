However, the analysis of transient\ndynamics associated with solutions on their way to an attracting fixed point\nhas not received much rigorous attention. This paper introduces methods for the\nstudy of such transient dynamics. In particular, we focus on the analysis of\nwhether one component of a solution to a system of differential equations can\novertake the corresponding component of a reference solution, given that both\nsolutions approach the same stable node. We call this phenomenon tolerance,\nwhich derives from a certain biological effect. Here, we establish certain\ngeneral conditions, based on the initial conditions associated with the two\nsolutions and the properties of the vector field, that guarantee that tolerance\ndoes or does not occur in two-dimensional systems. We illustrate these\nconditions in particular examples, and we derive and demonstrate additional\ntechniques that can be used on a case by case basis to check for tolerance.\nFinally, we give a full rigorous analysis of tolerance in two-dimensional\nlinear systems.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 2 Apr 2008 16:19:35 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-05-13", "authors_parsed": [["Day", "Judy", ""], ["Rubin", "Jonathan", ""], ["Chow", "Carson C.", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.0379", "submitter": "Ping Ao", "authors": "P.

By\ncomparing the simulation results to exact analytical results for a bimolecular\nreaction, we show that the algorithm correctly reproduces both equilibrium and\ndynamical quantities. We apply our scheme to a ``push-pull'' network in which\ntwo antagonistic enzymes covalently modify a substrate. Our results highlight\nthat the diffusive behaviour of the reacting species can reduce the gain of the\nresponse curve of this network.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 25 Apr 2008 15:15:17 GMT"}], "update_date": "2009-11-13", "authors_parsed": [["Morelli", "Marco J.", ""], ["Wolde", "Pieter Rein ten", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4178", "submitter": "Ziya Kalay", "authors": "V.

The proposed method allows for predicting the\nasymmetric response of the genetic switch to noise, arising from the\nnoise-induced shift of stationary states. The method has been tested on an\nexample model of the lac operon regulatory network: a reduced Yildirim-Mackey\nmodel with fluctuating extracellular lactose concentration. We calculate\nanalytically the shift of the system's stationary states in the presence of\nnoise. The results of the analytical calculation are in excellent agreement\nwith the results of numerical simulation of the noisy system. The simulation\nresults suggest that the structure of the kinetics of the underlying\nbiochemical reactions protects the bistability of the lactose utilization\nmechanism from environmental fluctuations. We also show that, in the\nconsequence of the noise-induced shift of stationary states, the presence of\nfluctuations stabilizes the behavior of the system in a selective way: although\nthe extrinsic noise facilitates, to some extent, switching off the lactose\nmetabolism, the same noise prevents it from switching on.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Apr 2008 11:09:25 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Wed, 28 May 2008 14:57:12 GMT"}, {"version": "v3", "created": "Wed, 13 Aug 2008 10:08:21 GMT"}], "update_date": "2008-08-13", "authors_parsed": [["Ochab-Marcinek", "Anna", ""]]}, {"id": "0804.4375", "submitter": "Erez Ben-Yaacov", "authors": "Erez Ben-Yaacov, Yonina Eldar", "title": "A Fast and Flexible Method for the Segmentation of aCGH Data", "comments": "7 pages, 5 figures, preprint, accepted for publication in\n  Bioinformatics (Proceedings of ECCB08)", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Motivation: Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is used to scan\nthe entire genome for variations in DNA copy number. A central task in the\nanalysis of aCGH data is the segmentation into groups of probes sharing the\nsame DNA copy number. Some well known segmentation methods suffer from very\nlong running times, preventing interactive data analysis. Results: We suggest a\nnew segmentation method based on wavelet decomposition and thresholding, which\ndetects significant breakpoints in the data. Our algorithm is over 1,000 times\nfaster than leading approaches, with similar performance. Another key advantage\nof the proposed method is its simplicity and flexibility. Due to its intuitive\nstructure it can be easily generalized to incorporate several types of side\ninformation. Here we consider two extensions which include side information\nindicating the reliability of each measurement, and compensating for a changing\nvariability in the measurement noise. The resulting algorithm outperforms\nexisting methods, both in terms of speed and performance, when applied on real\nhigh density CGH data.
