We aim to demonstrate through\ncomputational experiments that the proposed DTS can significantly enhance the\naccumulation of MNPs in the tumor site, which serve as a contrast agent in\nvarious medical imaging modalities, by using the shortest possible\nphysiological routes and with minimal systemic exposure. Methods: The epicenter\nof a tumor corresponds to the global maximum of an externally measurable\nobjective function associated with an in vivo tumor-triggered biophysical\ngradient; the domain of the objective function is the tissue region at a high\nrisk of malignancy; swarms of externally controllable magnetic nanoswimmers for\ntumor sensitization are modeled as the guess inputs. The objective function may\nbe resulted from a passive phenomenon such as reduced blood flow or increased\nkurtosis of microvasculature due to tumor angiogenesis; otherwise, the\nobjective function may involve an active phenomenon such as the fibrin formed\nduring the coagulation cascade activated by tumortargeted \"activator\"\nnanoparticles. Subsequently, the DTS can be interpreted from the iterative\noptimization perspective: guess inputs (i.e., swarms of nanoswimmers) are\ncontinuously updated according to the gradient of the objective function in\norder to find the optimum (i.e., tumor) by moving through the domain (i.e.,\ntissue under screening). Along this line of thought, we propose the\ncomputational model based on the gradient descent (GD) iterative method to\ndescribe the GD-inspired DTS, which takes into account the realistic in vivo\npropagation scenario of nanoswimmers.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 25 Dec 2018 08:25:36 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-03", "authors_parsed": [["Chen", "Yifan", ""], ["Ali", "Muhammad", ""], ["Shi", "Shaolong", ""], ["Cheang", "U Kei", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.00497", "submitter": "Shiva Rudraraju", "authors": "Shiva Rudraraju, Derek E.

DIVE is\nan image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution,\ndesigned to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term\nlongitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker measurements on the\ncortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient\npopulation, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex\nmeasurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the\ncortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature\nfor individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and\nprogression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing\nstratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can\nrecover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the\naverage trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We\ndemonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing\npatients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's\ndisease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects\nin the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct\npatterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types\nof biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs\namyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used\nto estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using\nany kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression\nmaps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET\nmeasures.

To enable detection of metastatic breast\ncancer (MBC), we applied a semi-supervised machine learning framework to linked\nEMR-California Cancer Registry (CCR) data. Materials and Methods: We studied\n11,459 female patients treated at Stanford Health Care who received an incident\nbreast cancer diagnosis from 2000-2014. The dataset consisted of structured\ndata and unstructured free-text clinical notes from EMR, linked to CCR, a\ncomponent of the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. We\nextracted information on metastatic disease from patient notes to infer a class\nlabel and then trained a regularized logistic regression model for MBC\nclassification. We evaluated model performance on a gold standard set of set of\n146 patients. Results: There are 495 patients with de novo stage IV MBC, 1,374\npatients initially diagnosed with Stage 0-III disease had recurrent MBC, and\n9,590 had no evidence of metastatis. The median follow-up time is 96.3 months\n(mean 97.8, standard deviation 46.7). The best-performing model incorporated\nboth EMR and CCR features.

We provide a\nrobustly implemented algorithm for computing the Dirichlet energy of the normal\n(ariaDNE) on 3D meshes.\n  Point 3: We show through simulation that the effects of preparation-related\nmesh surface attributes such as triangle count, mesh representation, noise,\nsmoothing and boundary triangles are much more limited on ariaDNE than DNE.\nFurthermore, ariaDNE retains the potential of DNE for biological studies,\nillustrated by its effectiveness in differentiating species by dietary\npreferences.\n  Point 4: Use of ariaDNE can dramatically enhance assessment of ecological\naspects of morphological variation by its stability under different 3D model\nacquisition methods and preparation procedure.

In embryogenesis the interplay between\nCa2+ signalling and mechanical forces is critical to the healthy development of\nan embryo but poorly understood. Several types of embryonic cells exhibit\ncalcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that Ca2+ signals\nand contractions are coupled via a two-way mechanochemical coupling. We present\na new analysis of experimental data that supports the existence of this\ncoupling during Apical Constriction in Neural Tube Closure.

We assume that the cell is a linear\nviscoelastic material and model the Ca2+-induced contraction stress with a Hill\nfunction saturating at high Ca2+ levels. We also express, for the first time,\nthe \"stretch-activation\" Ca2+ flux in the early mechanochemical models as a\nbottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive Ca2+ channels on the cell\nmembrane. We reduce the model to three ordinary differential equations and\nanalyse its bifurcation structure semi-analytically as the $IP_3$\nconcentration, and the \"strength\" of stretch activation, $\\lambda$ vary.

To this end, we introduce here the problem of finding a minimum\nlength subsequence of a time series, the removal of which changes the outcome\nof the classification under the nearest neighbour algorithm with DTW distance.\nInformally, such a subsequence is expected to be relevant for the\nclassification and can be helpful for practitioners in interpreting the\noutcome. We describe a simple but optimized implementation for detecting these\nsubsequences and define an accompanying measure to quantify the relevance of\nevery time point in the time series for the classification. In tests on\nelectrocardiogram data we show that the algorithm allows discovery of important\nsubsequences and can be helpful in detecting abnormalities in cardiac rhythms\ndistinguishing sick from healthy patients.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 26 Jan 2019 09:47:31 GMT"}], "update_date": "2019-01-29", "authors_parsed": [["Marcinkevics", "Ricards", ""], ["Kelk", "Steven", ""], ["Galuzzi", "Carlo", ""], ["Stegemann", "Berthold", ""]]}, {"id": "1901.09861", "submitter": "Vishwa Parekh", "authors": "Vishwa S.
