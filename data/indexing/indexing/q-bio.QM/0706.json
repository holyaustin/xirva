The elastic theory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, bending-soften rod,\nfluid membrane, and solid shell is revisited. Secondly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nbio-structures, including short DNA rings, lipid membranes, and cell membranes,\nare discussed. The kink stability of short DNA rings is addressed by using the\ntheory of Kirchhoff rod, Helfrich rod, and bending-soften rod. The lipid\nmembranes obey the theory of fluid membrane. A cell membrane is simplified as a\ncomposite shell of lipid bilayer and membrane skeleton, which is a little\nsimilar to the solid shell. It is found that the membrane skeleton enhances\nhighly the mechanical stability of cell membranes. Thirdly, the application and\navailability of the elastic theory of low-dimensional continua in\nnano-structures, including graphene and carbon nanotubes, are discussed. A\nrevised Lenosky lattice model is proposed based on the local density\napproximation. Its continuum form up to the second order terms of curvatures\nand strains is the same as the free energy of 2D solid shells. Several typical\nmechanical properties of carbon nanotubes are revisited and investigated based\non this continuum form. It is possible to avoid introducing the controversial\nconcepts, the Young's modulus and thickness of graphene and single-walled\ncarbon nanotubes, with this continuum form.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Fri, 1 Jun 2007 12:10:57 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Sun, 1 Jun 2008 15:46:15 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-01-20", "authors_parsed": [["Tu", "Z.

The intuition behind this is that when a susceptible person\nhas multiple potential infectors, there is a ``race'' to infect him or her in\nwhich only the first infectious contact leads to infection. In an epidemic, the\nmean generation interval contracts as the prevalence of infection increases. We\ncall this global competition among potential infectors.

Previous models of run and tumble chemotaxis neglect one or more\nfeatures of the motion, namely (i) a cell cannot directly detect a\nchemoattractant gradient but rather makes temporal comparisons of\nchemoattractant concentration, (ii) rather than being entirely random, tumbles\nexhibit persistence of direction, meaning that the new direction after a tumble\nis more likely to be in the forward hemisphere, and (iii) rotational Brownian\nmotion makes it impossible for an E. coli cell to swim in a straight line\nduring a run. This paper presents an analytic calculation of the chemotactic\ndrift velocity taking account of (i), (ii) and (iii), for weak chemotaxis. The\nanalytic results are verified by Monte Carlo simulation. The results reveal a\nsynergy between temporal comparisons and persistence that enhances the drift\nvelocity, while rotational Brownian motion reduces the drift velocity.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2007 08:42:01 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Locsei", "J.

The class of models constructed is defined\nby the biological description of the system, with minimal mathematical\nassumptions. The key features are an electron transport chain coupled to a\nprocess of charge translocation across a membrane. In the absence of charge\ntranslocation these models have previously been shown to behave in a very\nsimple manner with a single, globally stable equilibrium. We show that with\ncharge translocation the conclusion about a unique equilibrium remains true,\nbut local and global stability do not necessarily follow. In sufficiently low\ndimensions - i.e. for short electron transport chains - it is possible to make\nclaims about local and global stability of the equilibrium. On the other hand,\nfor longer chains, these general claims are no longer valid. Some particular\nconditions which ensure stability of the equilibrium for chains of arbitrary\nlength are presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jun 2007 17:55:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2007-06-26", "authors_parsed": [["Donnell", "Pete", ""], ["Banaji", "Murad", ""], ["Baigent", "Stephen", ""]]}, {"id": "0706.3743", "submitter": "Kilho Eom", "authors": "Kilho Eom, Tae Yun Kwon, Dae Sung Yoon, Hong Lim Lee, Tae Song Kim", "title": "Dynamical Response of Nanomechanical Resonators to Biomolecular\n  Interactions", "comments": "17 page, 4 figures, accepted for publication at PRB.
