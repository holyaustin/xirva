Information measures, like marginal entropies, mutual and\nmulti-information, have a number of significant advantages over more standard\nstatistical methods, like their reduced sensitivity to sampling limitations\nthan statistical estimates of probability densities. There are also interesting\napplications of these measures to the theory of complexity and to statistical\nmechanics. Their mathematical properties and relationships are therefore of\ninterest at several levels.\n  Of the interesting relationships between common information measures, perhaps\nnone are more intriguing and as elegant as the duality relationships based on\nMobius inversions. These inversions are directly related to the lattices\n(posets) that describe these sets of variables and their multi-variable\nmeasures. In this paper we describe extensions of the duality previously noted\nby Bell to a range of measures, and show how the structure of the lattice\ndetermines fundamental relationships of these functions. Our major result is a\nset of interlinked duality relations among marginal entropies, interaction\ninformation, and conditional interaction information. The implications of these\nresults include a flexible range of alternative formulations of\ninformation-based measures, and a new set of sum rules that arise from\npath-independent sums on the lattice. Our motivation is to advance the\nfundamental integration of this set of ideas and relations, and to show\nexplicitly the ways in which all these measures are interrelated through\nlattice properties. These ideas can be useful in constructing theories of\ncomplexity, descriptions of large scale stochastic processes and systems, and\nin devising algorithms and approximations for computations in multi-variable\ndata analysis.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 22:02:20 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-02", "authors_parsed": [["Galas", "David J.", ""], ["Sakhanenko", "Nikita A.", ""], ["Keller", "Benjamin", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.0101", "submitter": "Juli\\'an Candia", "authors": "Juli\\'an Candia, Ryan Maunu, Meghan Driscoll, Ang\\'elique Biancotto,\n  Pradeep Dagur, J.

Microvessel wall is a composite media with the internal glycocalyx\nlayer exerting a remarkable sieving effect on macromolecules, with respect to\nthe external layer composed by endothelial cells. The physiological structure\nof microvessel is represented as the superimposition of two membranes with\ndifferent properties; the inner membrane represents the glycocalyx, while the\nouter membrane represents the surrounding endothelial cells. Application of\nmass conservation principle and thermodynamic considerations lead to a model\ncomposed by two coupled second-order partial differential equations in the\nhydrostatic and osmotic pressures, one expressing volumetric mass conservation\nand the other, which is non-linear, expressing macromolecules mass\nconservation. Despite system complexity, the assumption that the properties of\nthe layers are piece-wise constant allows us to obtain analytical solutions for\nthe two pressures. This solution is in agreement with experimental\nobservations, which contrary to common belief, show that flow reversal cannot\noccur in steady state unless luminal hydrostatic pressure drops below\nphysiologically plausible values. The observed variations of volumetric and\nsolute mass flux in case of a significant reduction of luminal hydrostatic\npressure are in qualitative agreement with observed variations during\nexperiments reported in the literature.

Protein contact map describes the pairwise spatial and functional\nrelationship of residues in a protein and contains key information for protein\n3D structure prediction. Although studied extensively, it remains very\nchallenging to predict contact map using only sequence information. Most\nexisting methods predict the contact map matrix element-by-element, ignoring\ncorrelation among contacts and physical feasibility of the whole contact map. A\ncouple of recent methods predict contact map based upon residue co-evolution,\ntaking into consideration contact correlation and enforcing a sparsity\nrestraint, but these methods require a very large number of sequence homologs\nfor the protein under consideration and the resultant contact map may be still\nphysically unfavorable.\n  Results. This paper presents a novel method PhyCMAP for contact map\nprediction, integrating both evolutionary and physical restraints by machine\nlearning and integer linear programming (ILP). The evolutionary restraints\ninclude sequence profile, residue co-evolution and context-specific statistical\npotential. The physical restraints specify more concrete relationship among\ncontacts than the sparsity restraint. As such, our method greatly reduces the\nsolution space of the contact map matrix and thus, significantly improves\nprediction accuracy. Experimental results confirm that PhyCMAP outperforms\ncurrently popular methods no matter how many sequence homologs are available\nfor the protein under consideration. PhyCMAP can predict contacts within\nminutes after PSIBLAST search for sequence homologs is done, much faster than\nthe two recent methods PSICOV and EvFold.\n  See http://raptorx.uchicago.edu for the web server.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Thu, 8 Aug 2013 20:44:01 GMT"}, {"version": "v2", "created": "Mon, 19 Aug 2013 16:24:06 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-01-21", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Zhiyong", ""], ["Xu", "Jinbo", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.2150", "submitter": "Cameron Palmer", "authors": "Cameron Palmer and Itsik Pe'er", "title": "GeneZip: A software package for storage-efficient processing of genotype\n  data", "comments": "6 pages, 1 figure Stylistic edits, added references, added author who\n  joined project between versions; conclusions unchanged", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM q-bio.GN", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Genome wide association studies directly assay 10^6 single nucleotide\npolymorphisms (SNPs) across a study cohort.

We observe that each aphid transitions stochastically\nbetween a moving and a stationary state. Moving aphids follow a correlated\nrandom walk. The probabilities of motion state transitions, as well as the\nrandom walk parameters, depend strongly on distance to an aphid's nearest\nneighbor. For large nearest neighbor distances, when an aphid is essentially\nisolated, its motion is ballistic with aphids moving faster, turning less, and\nbeing less likely to stop. In contrast, for short nearest neighbor distances,\naphids move more slowly, turn more, and are more likely to become stationary;\nthis behavior constitutes an aggregation mechanism. From the experimental data,\nwe estimate the state transition probabilities and correlated random walk\nparameters as a function of nearest neighbor distance. With the\nindividual-level model established, we assess whether it reproduces the\nmacroscopic patterns of movement at the group level. To do so, we consider\nthree distributions, namely distance to nearest neighbor, angle to nearest\nneighbor, and percentage of population moving at any given time.

Interestingly, we showed, for the first time, that AQP1\nco-immunoprecipitated with Lin-7. Lin7-GFP experiments confirmed\nco-immunoprecipitation. In addition, the knock down of AQP1 decreased the level\nof expression of Lin-7 and b-catenin and the inhibition of proteasome\ncontrasted partially such a decrease. Conclusions/Significance: All together,\nour findings show that AQP1 plays a role inside the cells through\nLin-7/b-catenin interaction. Such a role of AQP1 is the same in human melanoma\nand endothelial cells, suggesting that AQP1 plays a global physiological role.\nA model is presented.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 02:33:24 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-08-29", "authors_parsed": [["Monzani", "Elena", ""], ["Bazzotti", "Riccardo", ""], ["Perego", "Carla", ""], ["La Porta", "Caterina A.

For\ndesigning such experiments, candidate variants are ranked by their strength of\ngenetic association with the disease. However, the two commonly used measures\nof genetic association, the odds-ratio (OR) and p-value, may rank variants in\ndifferent order. To integrate these two measures into a single analysis, here\nwe transfer the volcano plot methodology from gene expression analysis to\ngenetic association studies. In its original setting, volcano plots are scatter\nplots of fold-change and t-test statistic (or -log of the p-value), with the\nlatter being more sensitive to sample size. In genetic association studies, the\nOR and Pearson's chi-square statistic (or equivalently its square root, chi; or\nthe standardized log(OR)) can be analogously used in a volcano plot, allowing\nfor their visual inspection. Moreover, the geometric interpretation of these\nplots leads to an intuitive method for filtering results by a combination of\nboth OR and chi-square statistic, which we term \"regularized-chi\". This method\nselects associated markers by a smooth curve in the volcano plot instead of the\nright-angled lines which corresponds to independent cutoffs for OR and\nchi-square statistic. The regularized-chi incorporates relatively more signals\nfrom variants with lower minor-allele-frequencies than chi-square test\nstatistic. As rare variants tend to have stronger functional effects,\nregularized-chi is better suited to the task of prioritization of candidate\ngenes.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 28 Aug 2013 18:40:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2017-03-03", "authors_parsed": [["Li", "Wentian", ""], ["Freudenberg", "Jan", ""], ["Suh", "Young Ju", ""], ["Yang", "Yaning", ""]]}, {"id": "1308.6367", "submitter": "Ralph Brinks", "authors": "Ralph Brinks", "title": "Partial differential equation about the prevalence of a chronic disease\n  in the presence of duration dependency", "comments": "10 pages, 3 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  The illness-death model of a chronic disease consists of the states 'Normal',\n'Disease' and 'Death'.
