The processes of denitrification and anaerobic ammonium\noxidation (anammox) remove N from estuaries by producing di-nitrogen gas, and\neach can be coupled to N recycling pathways such as nitrification and\ndissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). Environmental conditions in\nestuaries influence sedimentary N cycling processes; therefore, seawater\nintrusion may affect the coupling of N cycling processes in the freshwater\nportions of estuaries. This study investigated the potential effects of\nseawater intrusion on these process couplings through a comparative modeling\napproach. We applied environ analysis, a form of ecological network analysis,\nto two N cycling mass-balance network models constructed at freshwater\n(oligohaline) and saltwater (polyhaline) sites in the Cape Fear River Estuary,\nNorth Carolina. We used a space-for-time substitution to predict the effects of\nseawater intrusion on the sedimentary N cycle. Further, we conducted an\nuncertainty analysis using linear inverse modeling to evaluate the effects of\nparameterization uncertainty on model results. Nitrification coupled to both\ndenitrification and anammox was 2.5 times greater in the oligohaline model,\nwhile DNRA coupled to anammox was 2.7 times greater in the polyhaline model.\nHowever, the total amount of N2 gas produced relative to the nitrogen inputs to\neach network was 4.7% and 4.6% at the oligohaline and polyhaline sites,\nrespectively. These findings suggest that changes in water chemistry from\nseawater intrusion may favor direct over coupled nitrogen removal, but may not\nsubstantially change the N removal capacity of the sedimentary microbial\nprocesses.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 19:32:07 GMT"}], "update_date": "2015-04-16", "authors_parsed": [["Hines", "David E.", ""], ["Lisa", "Jessica A.", ""], ["Song", "Bongkeun", ""], ["Tobias", "Craig R.", ""], ["Borrett", "Stuart R.", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.1301", "submitter": "Santiago Laplagne", "authors": "Massimo Andreatta, Santiago Laplagne, Shuai Cheng Li and Stephen Smale", "title": "Prediction of residue-residue contacts from protein families using\n  similarity kernels and least squares regularization", "comments": "16 pages", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.BM math.NA q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  One of the most challenging and long-standing problems in computational\nbiology is the prediction of three-dimensional protein structure from amino\nacid sequence.

Using high\nspatio-temporal resolution GPS trajectories of foraging meerkats, Suricata\nsuricatta, we provide an information-theoretic framework to identify dynamical\ncoupling between animals independent of their relative spatial positions. Based\non this identification, we then compare designations of individuals as either\ndrivers or responders against designations provided by the relative spatial\nposition. We find that not only does coupling occur both from the frontal to\nthe trailing individuals and vice versa, but also that the coupling direction\nis a non-linear function of the relative position. This provides evidence for\n(i) intermittent fluctuation of the coupling strength and (ii) alternation in\nthe coupling direction within foraging meerkat pairs. The framework we\nintroduce allows for a detailed description of the dynamical patterns of mutual\ninfluence between all pairs of individuals within moving animal groups.

These fields\nrequire 3D protein structures for rational design of proteins with improved or\nnovel properties. X-ray crystallography is the most common approach even with\nits low success rate, but lately NMR based approaches have gained popularity.\nThe general approach involves a set of distance restraints used to guide a\nstructure prediction, but simple NMR triple-resonance experiments often provide\nenough structural information to predict the structure of small proteins.\nPrevious protein folding simulations that have utilised experimental data have\nweighted the experimental data and physical force field terms more or less\narbitrarily, and the method is thus not generally applicable to new proteins.\nFurthermore a complete and near error-free assignment of chemical shifts\nobtained by the NMR experiments is needed, due to the static, or deterministic,\nassignment.

However, identifying the fine\nstructures of the smallest capillary vessels via conventional imaging ways\nremains a big challenge. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography\nwas proposed for the first time to produce mega contrast X-ray images for\nmulti-scale vasculature mapping. Gallium was used as the room temperature\nliquid metal contrast agent and perfused into the vessels of in vitro pig\nhearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the\nangiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent--the iohexol. As\nquantitatively proved by the gray scale histograms, the contrast of the vessels\nto the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than\nthat of the iohexol enhanced images. And the resolution of the angiograms has\nreached 100{\\mu}m, which means the capillaries can be clearly distinguished in\nthe liquid metal enhanced images. With tomography from the micro-CT, we also\nmanaged to reconstruct the 3-dementional structures of the kidney vessels.\nTremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches were\nexperimentally demonstrated. It was disclosed that the usually invisible\ncapillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms.\nThis mechanism can be generalized and extended to a wide spectrum of\n3-dimensional computational tomographic areas. It provides a soft tool for\nquickly reconstructing high resolution spatial channel networks for scientific\nresearches or engineering applications where complicated and time consuming\nsurgical procedures are no longer necessary.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Tue, 26 Nov 2013 15:58:58 GMT"}], "update_date": "2014-05-20", "authors_parsed": [["Wang", "Qian", ""], ["Yu", "Yang", ""], ["Pan", "Keqin", ""], ["Liu", "Jing", ""]]}, {"id": "1311.6771", "submitter": "Seyed Majid Saberi Fathi", "authors": "Seyed Majid S.

Our method of network reduction is the use of \"steady state\napproximations\" that do not change the number of steady states. Our algorithm\nis designed to work at the wiring diagram level without the need to evaluate or\nsimplify Boolean functions. Also, our implementation of the algorithm takes\nadvantage of the sparsity typical of discrete models of biological systems. The\nmain features of our algorithm are that it works at the wiring diagram level,\nit runs in polynomial time, and it preserves the number of steady states. We\nused our results to study AND-NOT network models of gene networks and showed\nthat our algorithm greatly simplifies steady state analysis.
