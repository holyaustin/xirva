It is therefore important to simulate both tissue morphogenesis and\nsignaling simultaneously in in silico models of developmental processes. The\nresolution of the processes depends on the questions of interest. As part of\nthis chapter we will introduce different descriptions of tissue morphogenesis.\nIn the most simple approximation tissue is a continuous domain and tissue\nexpansion is described according to a pre-defined function of time (and\npossibly space). In a slightly more advanced version the expansion speed and\ndirection of the tissue may depend on a signaling variable that evolves on the\ndomain. Both versions will be referred to as 'prescribed growth'. Alternatively\ntissue can be regarded as incompressible fluid and can be described with\nNavier-Stokes equations. Local cell expansion, proliferation, and death are\nthen incorporated by a source term. In other applications the cell boundaries\nmay be important and cell-based models must be introduced. Finally, cells may\nmove within the tissue, a process best described by agent-based models.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sat, 25 May 2013 13:56:37 GMT"}], "update_date": "2013-05-28", "authors_parsed": [["Iber", "Dagmar", ""], ["Tanaka", "Simon", ""], ["Fried", "Patrick", ""], ["Germann", "Philipp", ""], ["Menshykau", "Denis", ""]]}, {"id": "1305.6231", "submitter": "Kristina Crona", "authors": "Kristina Crona, Devin Greene, Miriam Barlow", "title": "Evolutionary Predictability and Complications with Additivity", "comments": null, "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.PE q-bio.QM", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  Adaptation is a central topic in theoretical biology, of practical importance\nfor analyzing drug resistance mutations.

However, the\napproaches have been used in published work, even in situations with\nsubstantial amounts of additivity. In particular, extreme value theory has been\nused in discussions on evolutionary predictability. We say that evolution is\npredictable if the use of a particular drug at different locations tends lead\nto the same resistance mutations. Evolutionary predictability depends on the\nprobabilities of mutational trajectories. Arguments about probabilities based\non extreme value theory can be misleading. Additivity may cause errors in\nestimates of the probabilities of some mutational trajectories by a factor 20\neven for rather small examples. We show that additivity gives systematic errors\nso as to exaggerate the differences between the most and the least likely\ntrajectory. As a result of this bias, evolution may appear more predictable\nthan it is.

We demonstrate that removal of knowledgable\nindividuals or alteration of individual preference can produce rapid changes in\ngroup formation and collective behavior. For example, intensive fishing\ntargeting the migratory species and also their preferred prey can reduce both\nterms to a point at which migration to the destination sites is suddenly\nstopped.
