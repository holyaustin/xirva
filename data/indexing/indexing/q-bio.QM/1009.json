Genome-wide maps of nucleosome positions have revealed a salient pattern\naround transcription start sites, involving a nucleosome-free region (NFR)\nflanked by a pronounced periodic pattern in the average nucleosome density.\nWhile the periodic pattern clearly reflects well-positioned nucleosomes, the\npositioning mechanism is less clear. A recent experimental study by Mavrich et\nal. argued that the pattern observed in S. cerevisiae is qualitatively\nconsistent with a `barrier nucleosome model', in which the oscillatory pattern\nis created by the statistical positioning mechanism of Kornberg and Stryer. On\nthe other hand, there is clear evidence for intrinsic sequence preferences of\nnucleosomes, and it is unclear to what extent these sequence preferences affect\nthe observed pattern. To test the barrier nucleosome model, we quantitatively\nanalyze yeast nucleosome positioning data both up- and downstream from NFRs.\nOur analysis is based on the Tonks model of statistical physics which\nquantifies the interplay between the excluded-volume interaction of nucleosomes\nand their positional entropy. We find that although the typical patterns on the\ntwo sides of the NFR are different, they are both quantitatively described by\nthe same physical model, with the same parameters, but different boundary\nconditions. The inferred boundary conditions suggest that the first nucleosome\ndownstream from the NFR (the +1 nucleosome) is typically directly positioned\nwhile the first nucleosome upstream is statistically positioned via a\nnucleosome-repelling DNA region. These boundary conditions, which can be\nlocally encoded into the genome sequence, significantly shape the statistical\ndistribution of nucleosomes over a range of up to ~1000 bp to each side.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Wed, 1 Sep 2010 12:15:39 GMT"}], "update_date": "2010-09-02", "authors_parsed": [["Mobius", "Wolfram", ""], ["Gerland", "Ulrich", ""]]}, {"id": "1009.0857", "submitter": "Chris Wiggins PhD", "authors": "Jonathan E.

The standard method for modeling fluctuations in the states of ion\nchannels uses continuous-time Markov chains nonlinearly coupled to a\ndifferential equation for voltage. Beginning with the work of Fox and Lu, there\nhave been attempts to generate simpler models that use stochastic differential\nequation (SDEs) to approximate the stochastic spiking activity produced by\nMarkov chain models. Recent numerical investigations, however, have raised\ndoubts that SDE models can preserve the stochastic dynamics of Markov chain\nmodels.\n  We analyze three SDE models that have been proposed as approximations to the\nMarkov chain model: one that describes the states of the ion channels and two\nthat describe the states of the ion channel subunits. We show that the former\nchannel-based approach can capture the distribution of channel noise and its\neffect on spiking in a Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model to a degree not previously\ndemonstrated, but the latter two subunit-based approaches cannot. Our analysis\nprovides intuitive and mathematical explanations for why this is the case: the\ntemporal correlation in the channel noise is determined by the combinatorics of\nbundling subunits into channels, and the subunit-based approaches do not\ncorrectly account for this structure. Our study therefore confirms and\nelucidates the findings of previous numerical investigations of subunit-based\nSDE models. Moreover, it presents the first evidence that Markov chain models\nof the nonlinear, stochastic dynamics of neural membranes can be accurately\napproximated by SDEs.
