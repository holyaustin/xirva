A measurement selection algorithm identifies frequencies that\nbest discriminate the different aerodynamic environments in low-rank POD\nfeature space.

Astrophysics is no exception since an overwhelming amount of\nmultivariate data has appeared in the last twenty years or so. In particular,\nthe diversification of galaxies throughout the evolution of the Universe quite\nnaturally invokes phylogenetic approaches. We have demonstrated that Maximum\nParsimony brings useful astrophysical results, and we now proceed toward the\nanalyses of large datasets for galaxies. In this talk I present how we solve\nthe major difficulties for this goal: the choice of the parameters, their\ndiscretization, and the analysis of a high number of objects with an\nunsupervised NP-hard classification technique like cladistics. 1. Introduction\nHow do the galaxy form, and when? How did the galaxy evolve and transform\nthemselves to create the diversity we observe? What are the progenitors to\npresent-day galaxies? To answer these big questions, observations throughout\nthe Universe and the physical modelisation are obvious tools. But between\nthese, there is a key process, without which it would be impossible to extract\nsome digestible information from the complexity of these systems. This is\nclassification. One century ago, galaxies were discovered by Hubble. From\nimages obtained in the visible range of wavelengths, he synthetised his\nobservations through the usual process: classification. With only one parameter\n(the shape) that is qualitative and determined with the eye, he found four\ncategories: ellipticals, spirals, barred spirals and irregulars. This is the\nfamous Hubble classification. He later hypothetized relationships between these\nclasses, building the Hubble Tuning Fork. The Hubble classification has been\nrefined, notably by de Vaucouleurs, and is still used as the only global\nclassification of galaxies. Even though the physical relationships proposed by\nHubble are not retained any more, the Hubble Tuning Fork is nearly always used\nto represent the classification of the galaxy diversity under its new name the\nHubble sequence (e.g. Delgado-Serrano, 2012). Its success is impressive and can\nbe understood by its simplicity, even its beauty, and by the many correlations\nfound between the morphology of galaxies and their other properties. And one\nmust admit that there is no alternative up to now, even though both the Hubble\nclassification and diagram have been recognised to be unsatisfactory. Among the\nmost obvious flaws of this classification, one must mention its monovariate,\nqualitative, subjective and old-fashioned nature, as well as the difficulty to\ncharacterise the morphology of distant galaxies. The first two most significant\nmultivariate studies were by Watanabe et al. (1985) and Whitmore (1984). Since\nthe year 2005, the number of studies attempting to go beyond the Hubble\nclassification has increased largely. Why, despite of this, the Hubble\nclassification and its sequence are still alive and no alternative have yet\nemerged (Sandage, 2005)? My feeling is that the results of the multivariate\nanalyses are not easily integrated into a one-century old practice of modeling\nthe observations. In addition, extragalactic objects like galaxies, stellar\nclusters or stars do evolve. Astronomy now provides data on very distant\nobjects, raising the question of the relationships between those and our\npresent day nearby galaxies. Clearly, this is a phylogenetic problem.\nAstrocladistics 1 aims at exploring the use of phylogenetic tools in\nastrophysics (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2006a,b). We have proved that Maximum\nParsimony (or cladistics) can be applied in astrophysics and provides a new\nexploration tool of the data (Fraix-Burnet et al., 2009, 2012, Cardone \\&\nFraix-Burnet, 2013). As far as the classification of galaxies is concerned, a\nlarger number of objects must now be analysed.

One such strategy is\nusing permutation to non-parametrically determine a null distribution of\ncluster sizes, which is then used to establish a minimum cluster size\nthreshold. This strategy is intuitively appealing because it respects the\nnecessary spatial contiguity of stroke lesions and connects with the typical\ncluster-based interpretation of VLSM results. We evaluated this strategy for\ndetecting true lesion-symptom relations using simulated deficit scores based on\npercent damage to defined brain regions (BA 45 and BA 39) in a sample of 124\nindividuals with left hemisphere stroke. Even under the most conservative\nsettings tested here, the region identified by VLSM with cluster size\ncorrection systematically extended well beyond the true region.

In practice data are often multi-way, or measured\nover multiple dimensions. For example, metabolite abundance may be measured\nover multiple regions or tissues, or gene expression may be measured over\nmultiple time points, for the same subjects. We propose a framework for linear\nclassification of high-dimensional multi-way data, in which coefficients can be\nfactorized into weights that are specific to each dimension. More generally,\nthe coefficients for each measurement in a multi-way dataset are assumed to\nhave low-rank structure. This framework extends existing classification\ntechniques, and we have implemented multi-way versions of SVM and DWD. We\ndescribe informative simulation results, and apply multi-way DWD to data for\ntwo very different clinical research studies. The first study uses metabolite\nmagnetic resonance spectroscopy data over multiple brain regions to compare\npatients with and without spinocerebellar ataxia, the second uses publicly\navailable gene expression time-course data to compare treatment responses for\npatients with multiple sclerosis. Our method improves performance and\nsimplifies interpretation over naive applications of full rank linear\nclassification to multi-way data.

It is commonly assumed that\nligands are spatially well mixed in the SPR region, and hence a mean-field rate\nequation description is appropriate. This approximation however ignores the\nspatial fluctuations as well as temporal correlations induced by multiple local\nrebinding events, which become prominent for slow diffusion rates and high\nbinding affinities. We report detailed Monte Carlo simulations of ligand\nbinding kinetics in an SPR cell subject to laminar flow. We extract the binding\nand dissociation rates by means of the techniques frequently employed in\nexperimental analysis that are motivated by the mean-field approximation. We\nfind major discrepancies in a wide parameter regime between the thus extracted\nrates and the known input simulation values.

This connection gives rise to a\ndrift-diffusion equation to govern the gradient flows of the surface molecule\nconcentrations. We recast the energetic formulation and the related governing\nequations in the Eulerian framework by using a phase field function that\ndefines the membrane morphology.
