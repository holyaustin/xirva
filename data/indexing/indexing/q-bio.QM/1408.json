Rescaling categorical\nraster data by spatial aggregation is common in large area ecological\nassessments. However, distortion and loss of information are associated with\naggregation.

Using\nnearest neighbor techniques generally maintains the global proportion of each\ncategory in the original map but can lead to disaggregation. In this paper we\nimplement the spatial scan statistic for spatial aggregation of categorical\nraster maps and describe the behavior of the technique at the local level\n(aggregation unit) and global level (map). We also contrast the spatial scan\nstatistic technique with the majority rule and nearest neighbor approaches. In\ngeneral, the scan statistic technique behaved inverse the majority rule\napproach in that rare classes rather than abundant classes were preserved.

The closure of schools has therefore been proposed as\nefficient mitigation strategy, with however high social and economic costs:\nalternative, less disruptive interventions are highly desirable. The recent\navailability of high-resolution contact networks in school environments\nprovides an opportunity to design micro-interventions and compare the outcomes\nof alternative mitigation measures. We consider mitigation measures that\ninvolve the targeted closure of school classes or grades based on readily\navailable information such as the number of symptomatic infectious children in\na class.

We find that targeted class closure affords strong\nmitigation effects: closing a class for a fixed period of time -equal to the\nsum of the average infectious and latent durations- whenever two infectious\nindividuals are detected in that class decreases the attack rate by almost 70%\nand strongly decreases the probability of a severe outbreak. The closure of all\nclasses of the same grade mitigates the spread almost as much as closing the\nwhole school. Targeted class closure strategies based on readily available\ninformation on symptomatic subjects and on limited information on mixing\npatterns, such as the grade structure of the school, can be almost as effective\nas whole-school closure, at a much lower cost.
