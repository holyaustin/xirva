At the\nsame time, the limitations in technology for generating data and the inherently\nstochastic nature of biomolecular events have led to the discrepancy between\nthe volume of data and the amount of knowledge gleaned from it. A major\nbottleneck in our ability to understand the molecular underpinnings of life is\nthe assignment of function to biological macromolecules, especially proteins.\nWhile molecular experiments provide the most reliable annotation of proteins,\ntheir relatively low throughput and restricted purview have led to an\nincreasing role for computational function prediction. However, accurately\nassessing methods for protein function prediction and tracking progress in the\nfield remain challenging. Methodology: We have conducted the second Critical\nAssessment of Functional Annotation (CAFA), a timed challenge to assess\ncomputational methods that automatically assign protein function. One hundred\ntwenty-six methods from 56 research groups were evaluated for their ability to\npredict biological functions using the Gene Ontology and gene-disease\nassociations using the Human Phenotype Ontology on a set of 3,681 proteins from\n18 species. CAFA2 featured significantly expanded analysis compared with CAFA1,\nwith regards to data set size, variety, and assessment metrics. To review\nprogress in the field, the analysis also compared the best methods\nparticipating in CAFA1 to those of CAFA2. Conclusions: The top performing\nmethods in CAFA2 outperformed the best methods from CAFA1, demonstrating that\ncomputational function prediction is improving. This increased accuracy can be\nattributed to the combined effect of the growing number of experimental\nannotations and improved methods for function prediction.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Sun, 3 Jan 2016 00:55:23 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-12-07", "authors_parsed": [["Jiang", "Yuxiang", ""], ["Oron", "Tal Ronnen", ""], ["Clark", "Wyatt T", ""], ["Bankapur", "Asma R", ""], ["D'Andrea", "Daniel", ""], ["Lepore", "Rosalba", ""], ["Funk", "Christopher S", ""], ["Kahanda", "Indika", ""], ["Verspoor", "Karin M", ""], ["Ben-Hur", "Asa", ""], ["Koo", "Emily", ""], ["Penfold-Brown", "Duncan", ""], ["Shasha", "Dennis", ""], ["Youngs", "Noah", ""], ["Bonneau", "Richard", ""], ["Lin", "Alexandra", ""], ["Sahraeian", "Sayed ME", ""], ["Martelli", "Pier Luigi", ""], ["Profiti", "Giuseppe", ""], ["Casadio", "Rita", ""], ["Cao", "Renzhi", ""], ["Zhong", "Zhaolong", ""], ["Cheng", "Jianlin", ""], ["Altenhoff", "Adrian", ""], ["Skunca", "Nives", ""], ["Dessimoz", "Christophe", ""], ["Dogan", "Tunca", ""], ["Hakala", "Kai", ""], ["Kaewphan", "Suwisa", ""], ["Mehryary", "Farrokh", ""], ["Salakoski", "Tapio", ""], ["Ginter", "Filip", ""], ["Fang", "Hai", ""], ["Smithers", "Ben", ""], ["Oates", "Matt", ""], ["Gough", "Julian", ""], ["T\u00f6r\u00f6nen", "Petri", ""], ["Koskinen", "Patrik", ""], ["Holm", "Liisa", ""], ["Chen", "Ching-Tai", ""], ["Hsu", "Wen-Lian", ""], ["Bryson", "Kevin", ""], ["Cozzetto", "Domenico", ""], ["Minneci", "Federico", ""], ["Jones", "David T", ""], ["Chapman", "Samuel", ""], ["C.", "Dukka B K.", ""], ["Khan", "Ishita K", ""], ["Kihara", "Daisuke", ""], ["Ofer", "Dan", ""], ["Rappoport", "Nadav", ""], ["Stern", "Amos", ""], ["Cibrian-Uhalte", "Elena", ""], ["Denny", "Paul", ""], ["Foulger", "Rebecca E", ""], ["Hieta", "Reija", ""], ["Legge", "Duncan", ""], ["Lovering", "Ruth C", ""], ["Magrane", "Michele", ""], ["Melidoni", "Anna N", ""], ["Mutowo-Meullenet", "Prudence", ""], ["Pichler", "Klemens", ""], ["Shypitsyna", "Aleksandra", ""], ["Li", "Biao", ""], ["Zakeri", "Pooya", ""], ["ElShal", "Sarah", ""], ["Tranchevent", "L\u00e9on-Charles", ""], ["Das", "Sayoni", ""], ["Dawson", "Natalie L", ""], ["Lee", "David", ""], ["Lees", "Jonathan G", ""], ["Sillitoe", "Ian", ""], ["Bhat", "Prajwal", ""], ["Nepusz", "Tam\u00e1s", ""], ["Romero", "Alfonso E", ""], ["Sasidharan", "Rajkumar", ""], ["Yang", "Haixuan", ""], ["Paccanaro", "Alberto", ""], ["Gillis", "Jesse", ""], ["Sede\u00f1o-Cort\u00e9s", "Adriana E", ""], ["Pavlidis", "Paul", ""], ["Feng", "Shou", ""], ["Cejuela", "Juan M", ""], ["Goldberg", "Tatyana", ""], ["Hamp", "Tobias", ""], ["Richter", "Lothar", ""], ["Salamov", "Asaf", ""], ["Gabaldon", "Toni", ""], ["Marcet-Houben", "Marina", ""], ["Supek", "Fran", ""], ["Gong", "Qingtian", ""], ["Ning", "Wei", ""], ["Zhou", "Yuanpeng", ""], ["Tian", "Weidong", ""], ["Falda", "Marco", ""], ["Fontana", "Paolo", ""], ["Lavezzo", "Enrico", ""], ["Toppo", "Stefano", ""], ["Ferrari", "Carlo", ""], ["Giollo", "Manuel", ""], ["Piovesan", "Damiano", ""], ["Tosatto", "Silvio", ""], ["del Pozo", "Angela", ""], ["Fern\u00e1ndez", "Jos\u00e9 M", ""], ["Maietta", "Paolo", ""], ["Valencia", "Alfonso", ""], ["Tress", "Michael L", ""], ["Benso", "Alfredo", ""], ["Di Carlo", "Stefano", ""], ["Politano", "Gianfranco", ""], ["Savino", "Alessandro", ""], ["Rehman", "Hafeez Ur", ""], ["Re", "Matteo", ""], ["Mesiti", "Marco", ""], ["Valentini", "Giorgio", ""], ["Bargsten", "Joachim W", ""], ["van Dijk", "Aalt DJ", ""], ["Gemovic", "Branislava", ""], ["Glisic", "Sanja", ""], ["Perovic", "Vladmir", ""], ["Veljkovic", "Veljko", ""], ["Veljkovic", "Nevena", ""], ["Almeida-e-Silva", "Danillo C", ""], ["Vencio", "Ricardo ZN", ""], ["Sharan", "Malvika", ""], ["Vogel", "J\u00f6rg", ""], ["Kansakar", "Lakesh", ""], ["Zhang", "Shanshan", ""], ["Vucetic", "Slobodan", ""], ["Wang", "Zheng", ""], ["Sternberg", "Michael JE", ""], ["Wass", "Mark N", ""], ["Huntley", "Rachael P", ""], ["Martin", "Maria J", ""], ["O'Donovan", "Claire", ""], ["Robinson", "Peter N", ""], ["Moreau", "Yves", ""], ["Tramontano", "Anna", ""], ["Babbitt", "Patricia C", ""], ["Brenner", "Steven E", ""], ["Linial", "Michal", ""], ["Orengo", "Christine A", ""], ["Rost", "Burkhard", ""], ["Greene", "Casey S", ""], ["Mooney", "Sean D", ""], ["Friedberg", "Iddo", ""], ["Radivojac", "Predrag", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.01048", "submitter": "Iddo Friedberg", "authors": "Iddo Friedberg and Predrag Radivojac", "title": "Community-Wide Evaluation of Computational Function Prediction", "comments": "Accepted as a book chapter in Methods in Molecular Biology Series.\n  Publisher: Springer", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "q-bio.QM", "license": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/", "abstract": "  A biological experiment is the most reliable way of assigning function to a\nprotein.

It is widely believed that these alterations\nfollow combinatorial patterns that have a strong connection with the underlying\nmolecular interaction networks and functional pathways. A better understanding\nof the generative mechanisms behind the mutation rules and their influence on\ngene communities is of great importance for the process of driver mutations\ndiscovery and for identification of network modules related to cancer\ndevelopment and progression. We developed a new method for cancer mutation\npattern analysis based on a constrained form of correlation clustering.\nCorrelation clustering is an agnostic learning method that can be used for\ngeneral community detection problems in which the number of communities or\ntheir structure is not known beforehand. The resulting algorithm, named $C^3$,\nleverages mutual exclusivity of mutations, patient coverage, and driver network\nconcentration principles; it accepts as its input a user determined combination\nof heterogeneous patient data, such as that available from TCGA (including\nmutation, copy number, and gene expression information), and creates a large\nnumber of clusters containing mutually exclusive mutated genes in a particular\ntype of cancer. The cluster sizes may be required to obey some useful soft size\nconstraints, without impacting the computational complexity of the algorithm.\nTo test $C^3$, we performed a detailed analysis on TCGA breast cancer and\nglioblastoma data and showed that our algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art CoMEt method in terms of discovering mutually exclusive gene\nmodules and identifying driver genes. Our $C^3$ method represents a unique tool\nfor efficient and reliable identification of mutation patterns and driver\npathways in large-scale cancer genomics studies.\n", "versions": [{"version": "v1", "created": "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 04:02:52 GMT"}], "update_date": "2016-01-26", "authors_parsed": [["Hou", "Jack P.", ""], ["Emad", "Amin", ""], ["Puleo", "Gregory J.", ""], ["Ma", "Jian", ""], ["Milenkovic", "Olgica", ""]]}, {"id": "1601.06693", "submitter": "Maritza Hernandez", "authors": "Maritza Hernandez, Arman Zaribafiyan, Maliheh Aramon, and Mohammad\n  Naghibi", "title": "A Novel Graph-based Approach for Determining Molecular Similarity", "comments": "16 pages, 4 figures", "journal-ref": null, "doi": null, "report-no": null, "categories": "cs.DS q-bio.QM quant-ph", "license": "http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/", "abstract": "  In this paper, we tackle the problem of measuring similarity among graphs\nthat represent real objects with noisy data.
